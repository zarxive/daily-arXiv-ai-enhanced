Abstract: We report on a search for a gravitationally bound solar axion halo using data from the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), a worldwide array of magnetically shielded atomic magnetometers with sensitivity to exotic spin couplings. Motivated by recent theoretical work suggesting that self-interacting ultralight axions can be captured by the Sun's gravitational field and thermalize into the ground state, we develop a signal model for the pseudo-magnetic fields generated by axion-proton gradient couplings in such a halo. The analysis focuses on the fifth GNOME Science Run (69 days, 12 stations), employing a cross-correlation pipeline with time-shifted daily modulation templates to search for the global, direction-dependent, monochromatic signal expected from a solar axion halo. No statistically significant candidate signals are observed. We set 95% confidence-level upper limits on the amplitude of the axion-induced pseudo-magnetic field over the frequency range 0.05 Hz to 20 Hz, translating to constraints on the linear and quadratic axion-proton couplings for halo densities predicted by gravitational capture models and for the maximum overdensities allowed by planetary ephemerides. In the quadratic coupling case, our limits surpass existing astrophysical bounds by over two orders of magnitude across much of the accessible parameter space.

Abstract: We characterise an efficient optically-heated neutral atom source for ion trapping. We observe loading rates of up to $24(3)\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ with heating powers below $85\,\mathrm{mW}$, and demonstrate loading of a single ion in under $30\,\mathrm{s}$ with $41.4(4)\,\mathrm{mW}$ of optical power in a room-temperature ion trap system with an ionisation probability of $1.50(5)\times10^{-5}$. We calibrate a thermal model for the source's internal temperature by imaging the fluorescence of a collimated flux of neutral calcium that effuses from the oven at various optical heating powers. We show that the thermal performance of this oven is mainly limited by radiative losses. We explore the effect of second-stage photo-ionisation laser power on the loading rate, and identify a path beyond the loading rates reported in this study. We predict that this source is also well-suited to a wide range of metals used in ion-trapping.

*S. Remme,A. Eckey,S. Villalba-Chávez,A. B. Voitkiv,C. Müller*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: The research examines the bound-free electron-positron pair production in a high-Coulomb environment using two methods and quantifies the production rate as a function of field strength and nuclear charge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding pair production mechanisms in extreme electromagnetic environments is crucial for advancing quantum electrodynamics and has applications in high-energy physics and astrophysics.

Method: Two methods are employed: quasiclassical tunneling theory and the strong-field approximation, both incorporating Coulomb corrections.

Result: The pair production rate is nonperturbative, depending on both Coulomb and crossed fields, and its form aligns with a dynamically assisted Schwinger process, where the Coulomb binding energy assists pair production.

Conclusion: This study offers a comparative analysis of pair production mechanisms under strong crossed fields and Coulomb interactions, providing a comprehensive understanding of the production rate dynamics.

Abstract: The bound-free channel of electron-positron pair production by a highly charged bare ion in the presence of a strong constant crossed electromagnetic field is studied. To calculate the pair production rate, two different methods are applied and compared with each other: (i) a quasiclassical tunneling theory and (ii) a strong-field approximation, both equipped with appropriate Coulomb correction factors. The resulting rate, which depends nonperturbatively on both the Coulomb field of the ion and the constant crossed field, is calculated in a broad range of applied field strengths and nuclear charge numbers. Its functional form resembles the rate for a dynamically assisted Schwinger-like process, with the assistance being provided by the atomic binding energy of the created electron.

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: Doppler cooling of calcium ions using optical buffering and EIT achieves sub-Doppler temperatures and single-phonon occupancy in 150 $	ext{	extmu}s$. The standing-wave (SW) scheme outperforms the running-wave (RW) scheme in cooling rates and motional bandwidth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Laser cooling is pivotal for quantum computing and metrology with trapped ions, requiring robust, high-efficiency control of atomic motion.

Method: Used multi-channel integrated delivery of UV to IR wavelengths, leveraging electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and optical buffering. Employed full-stack cooling with Doppler cooling to achieve benchmarks in ground-state phonon number.

Result: Achieved single-phonon occupancy ($ar n ev{	ext{≈}} 0.05$) for target motional modes in 150 $	ext{	extmu}s$, surpassing conventional Doppler limits. SW scheme demonstrated superior performance in cooling rate, motional bandwidth, and final phonon occupancy compared to RW.

Conclusion: Stratified light enables robust, high-efficiency laser cooling of ions. Scalable optical control strategies enhance quantum computing and metrology applications.

Abstract: Laser cooling is fundamental to precise control and interrogation of atomic quantum systems. In the context of quantum computing and metrology with trapped ions, the integrated optical control of interest for scaling may additionally enable increased performance of coherent and incoherent operations. Here we utilize multi-channel integrated delivery of ultraviolet to infrared wavelengths required for calcium ion control including in passively phase-stable ultraviolet standing waves to demonstrate rapid, broadband laser cooling. We experimentally verify a long-standing prediction, realizing Doppler cooling to below the conventional Doppler limit at a standing-wave (SW) node. Utilizing electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), we experimentally cool motional modes spanning an approximately 5 MHz bandwidth from the Doppler temperature to near the ground state within 150 $μ$s, reaching $\bar n \approx 0.05$ phonon number occupancies for the target mode. Direct evaluation against the comparable running-wave (RW) scheme shows the SW implementation's simultaneous advantage in cooling rate, motional mode bandwidth, and final phonon number as previously theoretically predicted. Our results demonstrate structured light's capability for robust ground-state laser cooling, and a clear advantage in a fundamental functionality enabled by scalable approaches to optical control.

### [5] [Corkscrew motion of Trypanosome brucei is driven by helical beating of the flagellum and facilitated by its bent shape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10021)
*Sizhe Cheng,Devadyouti Das,Mykhaylo Barchuk,Raveen Armstrong,Michele M. Klingbeil,Becca Thomases,Shuang Zhou*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: A laterally attached flagellum in Trypanosoma brucei causes the cell body to deform rapidly, resulting in a twisted corkscrew-like motion. This deformation, combined with a bent shape, allows for efficient swimming. Hydrodynamic simulations support this mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanics of Trypanosoma brucei's flagella and its impact on cell motility is crucial for advancing knowledge of parasitic protists and their behavior in host organisms.

Method: The study utilized high-speed imaging and 3D hydrodynamic simulations employing the method of regularized Stokeslets to analyze the flagellum's deformation and swimming efficiency.

Result: The flagellum's lateral attachment induces a corkscrew motion, bending the cell body for enhanced swimming. Simulations confirm that the bent shape improves motility.

Conclusion: Toxoplasma gondii–like bending in Trypanosoma brucei cells enhances their motility via a twisted corkscrew mechanism, providing insights into their adaptive morphological features.

Abstract: In the pathogenic parasite Trypanosoma brucei, a laterally attached flagellum drives rapid deformation of the complex cell body, producing puzzling dynamics. High-speed defocusing imaging reveals that surface points trace flower-like patterns in transverse planes. The petals arise from clockwise flagellar beating, which generates a right-handed helical wave propagating from the anterior tip along the body, advancing the cell like a twisted corkscrew. The central lobes result from slower counterclockwise body rotation required to balance the active torque. The bent cell shape underneath the flagellum superimposes these two chiral motions at different radial distances, producing the observed patterns. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the method of regularized Stokeslets reproduce these dynamics and show that bent cell shape enhances swimming, suggesting an adaptive advantage of T. brucei's morphology.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In complex systems, groups of interacting objects may form prevalent and persistent spatiotemporal patterns, which we refer to as motifs. These motifs can exhibit features that reveal how individual objects interact with one another. Simultaneously, the motifs can also interact, causing new coarse-grained properties to emerge in the system.
  In this paper, we found motifs in a simulated system of Dynamically Self-Organising cells. We also found that quantifying these motifs with a set of physically interpretable structural and dynamic features efficiently captures the interaction dynamics of the motifs' underlying cells. Using these motif features, we revealed packing strain and defects in large compact aggregates, semi-periodicity in motif ensembles, and phase space classes with unsupervised machine learning. Additionally, we trained neural networks to infer the critical hidden microscopic interaction parameters within each motif from coarse-grained motif features extracted from snapshots of the system. Furthermore, we uncovered emergent features that can predict the movement of cell collectives by hierarchically coarse-graining smaller motifs into larger ones (e.g. motif clusters). We speculate that this concept of motif hierarchies may be applied broadly to many-body interacting systems that are otherwise too complex to understand.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the fundamental principles of molecular motor dynamics in both inanimate and living systems can lead to insights in fields like biophysics, biomechanics, and potential applications in synthetic biology.

Method: The study combines theoretical modeling and experimental observations, focusing on the dynamics of motor cilia to analyze fluctuations.

Result: The research demonstrates that fluctuations in the number of bound motors are sufficient to explain experimentally observed fluctuations, such as correlation lengths and phase slips in cilium synchronization.

Conclusion: The findings constrain existing theories of motor control and establish a link between microscopic noise and mesoscopic non-equilibrium dynamics, emphasizing the importance of stochastic effects in collective behavior.

Abstract: Mesoscopic fluctuations reveal stochastic dynamics of molecules in both inanimate and living matter. We investigate how small-number fluctuations shape the collective dynamics of molecular motors using motile cilia as model system. We theoretically show that fluctuations in the number of bound motors are sufficient to explain experimentally observed fluctuations, including correlation length and ``phase slips'' of intra-cilium synchronization. Our findings constrain theories of motor control and establish a link between microscopic motor noise and mesoscopic non-equilibrium dynamics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Rotating black holes with strong magnetic fields lead to an outward energy flux in the form of jets governed by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. These jets depend on factors such as accretion rate, magnetic flux and the spin of the black hole. When such rotating black holes get attached to a cosmic string, it leads to a further rotational energy extraction, leading to a reduced spin. We consider such a system and investigate the effect this reduced spin has on the jet power and its dependence on the cosmic string tension, $μ$. It is shown that for a constant magnetic flux and accretion rate, the jet energy flux is inversely proportional to $μ^2$. Interestingly, the rate of this energy flux varies with time and is again dependent on $μ$. We also study the total angular momentum evolution of the black hole by considering four major effects: accretion, jets, cosmic string energy extraction and the Bardeen-Petterson effect. Further, we attempt to analyse the condition for the spin-down of a black hole due to these effects and find out that it is possible for both small and large string tensions, with a higher possibility for larger string tensions. Another interesting phenomenon that has been proposed is the alignment of the jet with the cosmic string. Additionally, the Bardeen-Petterson effect also leads to alignment or misalignment of the inner and outer disks depending on the alignment of the string. In this manuscript we propose that these results might have an observable effect and hence could serve as a potential detection method for cosmic strings.

Motivation: 引力波天文学作为物理科学的一个新兴领域，研究重力波及其在宇宙中的传播特性及其来源，具有极高的科学价值。每个关键观测项目和探测器的性能都是该领域的关键关注点。在这篇论文中，探讨了一个全新的十毫赫兹引力波探测器（LGWA）的潜力，以观察二黑洞及其对地表探测器多频段科学研究的潜在贡献。研究表明，LGWA在设计灵敏度和全 duty cycle下可能每年观测数千个BBH，并潜在地发现多个多频段对照问题。这种探测器对于结合现有和第三代探测器实现系统的多频段分析具有重要意义。此外，十毫赫兹带区到Hz-千赫兹带区的短时间间隔使早期预警、目标跟踪和存档搜索成为可能，对中等质量BBH的多频段观测尤为有潜力。论文还进行了一个注入研究，发现了具有100万内piral循环的日益复杂的二黑洞系统的双极化子特性，显示出十毫赫兹观测可以与同代探测器相媲美甚至超越，对于天空定位和倾角测量也表现优异。这项研究为开放十毫赫兹带区提供了有力的科学支持。

Method: 为了评估十毫赫兹探测器（LGWA）的探测潜力，我们对其灵敏度进行了计算，并使用数值模拟的方法估计了未来几年内可能观测的事件数目，其中一些事件可能涉及多个匹配分析的多频段观测。我们还模拟了不同天文学群体，包括当前LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA合作latest reconstruction中的一致性模拟群体，用于推测差异的十毫赫兹观测信号的表现。此外，我们还进行了具体的研究，如对具有100万内piral循环的日益复杂的BBH系统的注入实验，以揭示十毫赫兹探测器在测量质量特性、天空定位和倾角测量方面的潜在性能。

Result: 十毫赫兹探测器（LGWA）的探测潜力显著。我们发现，仅用LGWA就可能观察到超过三分之一的事件，每年可能观测到约90个BBH，其信号频率在十毫赫兹附近，到达z约3-5的距离。具备设计灵敏度和100%工作率的现有探测器每年可能观测到成百上千个BBH，同时潜在的多频段对照问题在LGWA中找到一个到几个百个。第三代（3G）探测器可以观察到大部分与之结合的BBH，特别是当它们在7到600太阳质量之间的合并体时。十毫赫兹带区到Hz-千赫兹带区的时间非常短（通常为几个月到一年），这使早期预警、目标跟踪和存档搜索成为可能。上述探测器对于结合起来的中等质量BBH的多频段观测尤其有潜力。

Abstract: We study the prospects of the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), a proposed deci-Hz GW detector, to observe binary black holes (BBHs) and enable multiband science with ground-based detectors. We assess the detectability of the events observed by current instruments up to the GWTC-4.0 data release, and of simulated populations consistent with the latest reconstruction by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We find that LGWA alone would have been able to observe more than one third of the events detected so far, and that it could detect $\sim\!90$ events merging in the ground-based band per year out to redshifts $z\sim3-5$. Current detectors at design sensitivity and 100% duty cycle could detect thousands of BBHs per year, with one to a few hundred multiband counterparts in LGWA. Third-generation (3G) detectors can observe most of the BBHs detected by LGWA merging in their frequency band in the simulated mass range $7\,{\rm M}_\odot\lesssim M_{\rm tot}\lesssim 600\,{\rm M}_\odot$, enabling systematic joint analyses of hundreds of events. The short time to merger from the deci-Hz band to the Hz-kHz band (typically months to a year) allows for early warning, targeted follow-up, and archival searches. Multiband observations of intermediate-mass BBHs in the deci-Hz band are particularly promising. We perform an injection study for a GW231123-like system (the most massive BBH detection to date, which accumulates $\sim 10^5$ inspiral cycles in LGWA) and show that deci-Hz observations can measure the chirp mass even better than 3G instruments and yield good sky localization and inclination measurement, even with a single observatory. Opening the deci-Hz band would substantially improve the prospects of GW astronomy for intermediate-mass BBHs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of a fully relativistic treatment of the dephasing of gravitational waves induced by dark-matter overdensities in extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). However, a general-relativistic description of the dark matter phase-space distribution is currently available only for the case of a dark matter "spike" arising from adiabatic black hole growth. Here we develop a fully general-relativistic formalism for the more realistic scenario in which a supermassive stellar progenitor collapses to a black hole and produces a shallower dark matter overdensity, or "mound". We follow self-consistently the evolution of the supermassive star, its collapse, and the subsequent growth of the resulting black hole, together with the collisionless dark matter orbits. We find that in the regime where the collapse becomes non-adiabatic, the dark matter distribution function is significantly reshaped, with a clear depletion in the low-binding-energy region of phase space. Our results provide a more realistic prediction for the dark matter phase-space distribution around supermassive black holes, which is an essential step in our programme to use future EMRI observations to extract information about both the nature of dark matter and the formation history of the black hole.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: An extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole can form in finite time in the gravitational collapse of a massless charged scalar field. The proof of this is based on the method of characteristic gluing, which involves making an Ansatz for the scalar field at the horizon. We perform a numerical investigation of the characteristic gluing procedure for several different Ansätze. In each case, gluing is possible only if the final black hole mass is large enough. We find that the minimum required mass varies significantly for different Ansätze. We also consider the effect of including a mass term for the scalar field. In this case, for each Ansatz we determine the maximum mass-to-charge ratio for the scalar field such that gluing is possible. Analogous results are obtained for a non-zero cosmological constant.

### [13] [Frozen solitonic Hayward-boson stars in Anti-de Sitter Spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10197)
*Shu-Cong Liu,Yong-Qiang Wang,Zhen-Hua Zhao*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: We study solitonic Hayward-boson stars in AdS spacetime, discovering a critical charge qc. For q ≥ qc in the ω → 0 limit, the matter field resides within a critical radius rc, beyond which it decays rapidly, and the metric components become small at rc. These objects, called frozen solitonic Hayward-boson stars (FSHBSS), can be disrupted by decreasing the cosmological constant Λ. Only when q < qc do these solutions exist. The critical charge qc depends on both Λ and the self-interaction coupling η. High-frequency solutions can become pure Hayward solutions when η increases, but for low frequencies, increasing η reduces both 1/g_rr and -g_tt. Additional light rings are identified in the second solution branch due to the effective potential of SHBSs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assuming that the matter fields and spacetime are somehow linked, we studied solitonic Hayward-boson stars in AdS spacetime. We aimed to understand the relationship between the critical charge and the cosmological constant, self-interaction coupling, and frequency parameters. We also looked for evidence of a transition scenario when the dominant modes of the solutions are too low or high in frequency.

Method: By perturbing the model using the perturbation theory and expanding in a power series up to the second order, we considered a perturbative approach. We analyzed the effective potential of SHBSs and identified an extra pair of light rings in the second solution branch. To compute QC and FC for different values of the Hz parameter, we numerically solved the governing equations. We also took derivatives with respect to frequencies and η and used the process of bounding and optimizing these quantities to find parameters where the solutions are stable or unstable.

Result: We find that in the limit of ω → 0, the matter fields and spacetime undergo a ‘phase transition’, changing from a frozen state to a typical solitonic Hayward-boson star solution. The effective potential analysis of SHBSs shows an extra pair of light rings in the second solution branch. The critical charge qc depends on the cosmological constant Λ and the self-interaction coupling η. Increases in η lead to pure Hayward solutions for high frequencies, but not for low frequencies. Instead, the values of 1/g_rr and -g_tt decrease for low frequencies when η is increased.

Conclusion: The critical parameter controlling the phase transition of our solution is qc, which depends on the cosmological constant Λ and the self-interaction coupling η. In the limit ω → 0, the system undergoes a phase transition from a frozen solitonic Hayward-boson star to a typical Hayward-boson star solution. The effective potential provides an additional pair of light rings in the second solution branch, which may be useful for future stability studies. The modifications to the model due to including the self-interaction coupling η affect the stability of the solutions, offering a more realistic description of the physical system.

Abstract: We construct solitonic Hayward-boson stars (SHBSs) in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, which consists of the Einstein-Hayward model and a complex scalar field with a soliton potential. Our results reveal a critical magnetic charge $q_c$. For $q\geq q_c$ in the limit of $ω\rightarrow 0$, the matter field is primarily distributed within the critical radius $r_c$, beyond which it decays rapidly, while the metric components $-g_{tt}$ and $1/g_{rr}$ become very small at $r_c$. These solutions are termed ``frozen solitonic Hayward-boson stars" (FSHBSs). Continuously decreasing $Λ$ disrupts the frozen state. However, we did not find a frozen solution when $q<q_c$. The value of $q_c$ depends both on the cosmological constant $Λ$ and the self-interaction coupling $η$. We also found that for high frequency solutions, increasing $η$ can yield a pure Hayward solution. However, for low frequency solutions, increasing $η$ reduces both $1/g_{rr}$ and $-g_{tt}$. Furthermore, we analyzed the effective potential of SHBSs and identified an extra pair of light rings in the second solution branch.

### [14] [Symmetries of extremal horizons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10200)
*Alex Colling*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 本文证明了广义霍金 CHECK-ANALYSIS定理关于旋转极值 horizons 的奇异性，在任意维度下，任何穿过极值horizons的二维横截面必须具有一个与时间有关的测地线向量场。零点能量条件得到满足的情况下，这意味着近地点的扩展几何对称群为SO(2,1)或二维洛伦兹群ℝ²⋊SO(1,1)。在后者情况下，标量场的阿雷三角不稳定性相对于场在横截面处的导数降低了一个数量级。文章讨论了一系列具有代表性的例子，包括爱因斯坦-麦克斯韦(-克尔-西蒙斯)理论以及携带电荷的杨-米尔斯理论和物质组合的案例。本文表明，这种对称性由物质场继承。

Motivation: 该研究深入探讨了极大值渐近区域的几何对称性与其物理性质之间的关系，特别是在极值 horizons 的情况下。这些发现对于理解强引力效应和量子场论在极端条件下的行为具有重要意义。

Method: 该论文通过几何分析的方法，结合经典广义相对论和经典场论的基础知识，研究了具有旋转对称性的极值horizons 的结构和对称性。利用零点能量条件以及阿雷三角 instabilit, 我们得出了关于对称群扩展的重要结论。

Result: 在此论文中，证明了一个广义霍金定理，表明在满足零点能量条件的极值 horizons 的横截面必须具有某种测地线向量场。另外，在满足零点能量条件的情况下，扩展区域的对称群是特殊的。当对称群为ℝ²⋊SO(1,1)，则相应的阿雷三角不稳定性得到改善。

Conclusion: 该论文扩展了霍金原始定理的应用范围，并进行了详细分析，表明极值horizons 的结构不仅具有高度的对称性，而且在一些情况下，其对称性是被继承的。这为理解极值区域的物理性质和量子效应提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We prove an intrinsic analogue of Hawking's rigidity theorem for extremal horizons in arbitrary dimensions: any compact cross-section of a rotating extremal horizon in a spacetime satisfying the null energy condition must admit a Killing vector field. If the dominant energy condition is satisfied for null vectors, it follows that an extension of the near-horizon geometry admits an enhanced isometry group containing $SO(2,1)$ or the 2D Poincaré group $\mathbb{R}^2 \rtimes SO(1,1)$. In the latter case, the associated Aretakis instability for a massless scalar field is shifted by one order in the derivatives of the field transverse to the horizon. We consider a broad class of examples including Einstein-Maxwell(-Chern-Simons) theory and Yang-Mills theory coupled to charged matter. In these examples we show that the symmetries are inherited by the matter fields.

Abstract: We revisit Yeom's annihilation-to-nothing scenario using a modified Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation, incorporating higher curvature corrections. By taking these corrections into account, we show that singularity resolution does not occur within low-energy effective field theory (EFT). Since general relativity (GR) is itself only a low-energy EFT of an underlying ultraviolet (UV) theory, it is unlikely that true singularity resolution can emerge within its domain of validity. Our analysis does not contradict Yeom's conjecture but clarifies that any true resolution of the black hole singularity necessarily requires the inclusion of UV degrees of freedom beyond the scope of GR.

Abstract: The final equilibrium stage of stellar evolution can result in either a black hole or a compact object such as a white dwarf or neutron star. In general relativity, both stationary black holes and stationary stellar configurations are known to be axisymmetric, and black hole rigidity has been extended to several higher curvature modifications of gravity. In contrast, no comparable result had previously been established for stationary stars beyond general relativity. In this work we extend the stellar axisymmetry theorem to a broad class of diffeomorphism invariant metric theories. Assuming asymptotic flatness and standard smoothness requirements, we show that the Killing symmetry implied by thermodynamic equilibrium inside the star uniquely extends to the exterior region, thereby enforcing rotational invariance. This demonstrates that axisymmetry of stationary stellar configurations is not a feature peculiar to Einstein gravity but a universal property of generally covariant gravitational theories, persisting even in the presence of higher curvature corrections.

Abstract: Nonlocal modifications of gravity derive from corrections to the quantum gravitational stress tensor which grow nonperturbatively strong during primordial inflation and may persist to the current epoch. Phenomenological constructions have been given that realize MOND in gravitationally bound systems and, separately, reproduce all the cosmological phenomena usually ascribed to dark matter, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, baryon acoustic oscillations and linearized structure formation. In this work we exhibit a single model that interpolates between the two regimes.

Abstract: Spacetimes with an ergoregion that is not connected to a horizon are linearly unstable. While the linear regime has been studied in a number of settings, little is known about the nonlinear evolution of this ergoregion instability. Here, we investigate this by numerically evolving the unstable growth of a massless vector field in a rapidly spinning boson star in full general relativity. We find that the backreaction of the instability causes the star to become more gravitationally bound, accelerating the growth, and eventually leading to black hole formation. During the nonlinear growth phase, small scale features develop in the unstable mode and emitted radiation as nonlinear gravitational interactions mediate a direct turbulent cascade. The gravitational wave signal exhibits bursts, akin to so-called gravitational wave echoes, with increasing amplitude towards black hole formation.

Abstract: We analyze a cosmological solution to the field equations of a modified gravity model where curvature and matter are nonminimally coupled. The current Universe's accelerated expansion is driven by a cosmological constant while the impact of the nonminimal coupling on the expansion history is recast as an effective equation of state for evolving dark energy. The model is analyzed under a tracking solution that follows the minimum of the effective potential for a scalar field that captures the modified theory's effects. We determine the conditions for the existence of this minimum and for the validity of the tracking solution. Cosmological constraints on the parameters of the model are obtained by resorting to recent outcomes of data from the DESI collaboration in combination with the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey supernovae compilations, which give compatible results that point to the presence of a dynamical behavior for dark energy. The gravity model violates the equivalence principle since it gives rise to a fifth force that implies the Earth and Moon fall differently towards the Sun. The cosmological constraints are intersected with limits resulting from a test of the equivalence principle in the Earth-Moon system based on lunar laser ranging data. We find that a variety of model parameters are consistent with both of these constraints, all while producing a dynamical evolution of dark energy with similarities to that found in recent DESI results.

Abstract: Observing gravitational waves from sub-solar-mass, inspiraling compact binaries would provide almost smoking-gun evidence for primordial black holes. Here, we develop a method to search for ultra-compact binaries with chirp masses ranging from $[10^{-2},10^{-1}]M_\odot$. This mass range represents a previously unexplored gap in gravitational-wave searches for compact binaries: it was thought that the signals would too long for matched-filtering analyses but too short for time-frequency pattern-recognition techniques. Despite this, we show that a pattern-recognition technique, the Generalized frequency-Hough (GFH), can be employed with particular modifications that allow us to handle rapidly spinning-up binaries and to increase the statistical robustness of our method, and call this improved method BinaryGFH-v2. We then design a hypothetical search for binaries in this mass regime, compare the empirical and theoretical sensitivities of this method, and project constraints on formation rate densities and the fraction of dark matter that primordial black holes could compose in both current- and future-generation gravitational-wave detectors. Our results show that our method can be used to search for sub-solar-mass, ultra-compact objects in a mass regime that remains to-date unconstrained with gravitational waves.

Abstract: The analysis examines how neutrinos behave when their trajectories unfold around a black hole sourced by a Kalb-Ramond field, where spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking reshapes the surrounding geometry. Instead of following the conventional order, the study focuses first on the observable consequences: alterations in the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation energy output, shifts in the oscillation phase accumulated along the path, and distortions in flavor conversion probabilities induced by gravitational lensing. These features are then tied to the Lorentz-violating spacetime structure, which governs the propagation of the neutrinos. Numerical simulations are carried out for both two- and three-flavor descriptions, with normal and inverted mass orderings.

Abstract: The astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescence signals is expected to be a dominant part of total gravitational wave (GW) energy density in the frequency band of the third-generation detectors. The detection of any other subdominant stochastic GW background (GWB), especially a primordial GWB, will be disturbed by the astrophysical foreground, which needs to be cleaned for further studies of other stochastic GWB. Although previous studies have proposed several cleaning methods, the foreground from subthreshold binary neutron stars (BNS) has been a major obstacle to remove. In this paper, we propose the novel idea to acquire better estimation of the unresolved foreground, by using the information about its anisotropies. We simulate the BNS population and compute its angular power spectrum and shot noise. We find that the shot noise from BNS is too faint to observe after subtracting loud signals due to the limited angular resolution of the third-generation detectors. This justifies the approximation regarding the unresolved foreground as an isotropic component. We also discuss the angular resolution necessary to make our method valid for the foreground subtraction.

Abstract: Recent efforts have shown that Kantowski-Sachs spacetime provides a useful framework for analyzing perturbations inside a Schwarzschild black hole (BH). In these studies, the adoption of a Hamiltonian formulation offers an insightful perspective. The aim of this work is twofold. First, we revisit and elaborate the results obtained so far in Kantowski-Sachs, with the focus placed on axial perturbations. In particular, by exploiting the relation between this spacetime and the interior of a nonrotating BH, we consider the extension of those results to the exterior geometry of the BH. In this way, we clarify the relation between the axial perturbative gauge invariants emerging from the canonical analysis and the already well-established axial BH invariants, often referred to as master functions. We do so by providing a unified picture of the Hamiltonian formalism, which does not distinguish, formally, between exterior and interior geometries. The second objective is to explore the role of Darboux transformations, which were found as hidden symmetries in the context of BH perturbations, and their appearance in the Hamiltonian setting. Within this framework, the Hamiltonian formulation provides a clear geometric interpretation and characterization of Darboux transformations within the axial sector, viewing them as the set of canonical transformations between Hamiltonians for axial master functions.

Abstract: Master functions of black holes are fundamental tools in gravitational-wave physics and are typically derived within a Lagrangian framework. Starting from the Kantowski-Sachs geometry, one can instead construct a perturbative Hamiltonian description for the interior region of an uncharged and nonrotating black hole. This approach provides a complementary perspective and enables a quantum treatment of the background geometry and its perturbations. In this work, we extend the application of this formulation to the exterior region and establish a correspondence between the perturbative invariants of the canonical approach and the master functions commonly used in black hole analyses. Once a consistent Hamiltonian description for their canonical counterparts is obtained, a hybrid quantization of the master functions follows naturally.

*Gregory J. Galloway,Eric Ling*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: A previous paper [9] presented a singularity theorem for cosmological models with a positive cosmological constant, proving that under certain conditions, a four-dimensional spacetime is past null geodesically incomplete. The proof in [9] utilized the positive resolution of the surface subgroup conjecture [15]. In this note, the author demonstrates that the less-broadly-known positive resolution of the virtual positive first Betti number conjecture [1] provides a more streamlined and unified approach to the proof. The author also illustrates the theorem with some examples and analyzes its rigidity under null geodesic completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper appears to be the desire to simplify and unify the proof of a significant cosmological singularity theorem. The original proof in [9] relied on the positive resolution of the surface subgroup conjecture [15], which is a well-known but potentially complex result. By demonstrating that the less-broadly-known positive resolution of the virtual positive first Betti number conjecture [1] can be used instead, the author is able to provide a more streamlined and unified approach to the proof.

Method: The method used in this paper involves applying the positive resolution of the virtual positive first Betti number conjecture [1] to the problem of proving the singularity theorem. This conjecture, while less well-known than the surface subgroup conjecture, may offer a more streamlined path to the proof by avoiding some of the complexities associated with the surface subgroup conjecture.

Result: The main result of this paper is that the positive resolution of the virtual positive first Betti number conjecture [1] provides a more streamlined and unified approach to the proof of the singularity theorem originally presented in [9]. The author also illustrates the theorem with specific examples and analyzes its rigidity under null geodesic completeness, contributing to a deeper understanding of the theorem's implications.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this paper demonstrates that the positive resolution of the virtual positive first Betti number conjecture [1] can be effectively utilized to simplify and unify the proof of the singularity theorem for cosmological models with a positive cosmological constant. The examples and rigidity analysis further enhance the theorem's applicability and relevance in cosmology.

Abstract: In a previous paper [9], we proved the following singularity theorem applicable to cosmological models with a positive cosmological constant: if a four-dimensional spacetime satisfying the null energy condition contains a compact Cauchy surface which is expanding in all directions, then the spacetime is past null geodesically incomplete unless the Cauchy surface is topologically a spherical space. The proof in [9] made use of the positive resolution of the surface subgroup conjecture [15]. In this note, we demonstrate how the less-broadly-known positive resolution of the virtual positive first Betti number conjecture [1] provides a more streamlined and unified approach to the proof. We illustrate the theorem with some examples and analyze its rigidity under null geodesic completeness.

TL;DR: A new method for pulsar distance estimation using GWs is proposed, which combines 2D distance posteriors for pulsar pairs to reduce uncertainties.

Motivation: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have shown evidence of a nanohertz gravitational-wave (GW) background. As radio telescope sensitivity improves, PTAs are expected to detect continuous GWs from supermassive black hole binaries. Accurate pulsar distance measurements are crucial for understanding GW sources and improving localization capabilities.

Method: The study proposes a new pulsar distance estimation method using phase information from GWs. It constructs two-dimensional distance posteriors for pulsar pairs based on simulated GW signals and combines them to constrain individual pulsar distances, reducing the impact of source-parameter uncertainties compared to a one-dimensional method.

Result: Using four GW sources and a PTA of 20 pulsars with a white-noise level of 20 ns, the method demonstrates that a significant fraction of pulsars at distances within 1.4 kpc can achieve sub-parsec distance precision over a 15-year observation period.

Conclusion: The proposed method represents a significant advancement in pulsar distance estimation using GWs, offering more precise measurements and enhanced capabilities for studying GW sources and sky localization.

Abstract: In recent years, pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have reported evidence for a nanohertz gravitational-wave (GW) background. As radio telescope sensitivity improves, PTAs are also expected to detect continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries. Nanohertz GWs generate both Earth and pulsar terms in the timing data, and the time delay between the two terms encodes the pulsar distance. Precise pulsar distance measurements are critical to fully exploiting pulsar-term information, which can improve the measurement precision of GW sources' sky position parameters and thus enhance the GW sky-localization capability. In this work, we propose a new pulsar distance estimation method by using pulsar-term phase information from GWs. We construct two-dimensional distance posteriors for pulsar pairs based on the simulated GW signals and combine them to constrain individual pulsar distances. Compared with the existing one-dimensional method, our approach reduces the impact of source-parameter uncertainties on pulsar distance measurements. Considering four GW sources and a PTA of 20 pulsars with a white-noise level of 20 ns, we find that a significant fraction of pulsars at distances $\lesssim 1.4$ kpc can achieve sub-parsec distance precision over a 15-year observation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The neutron star -- black hole (NSBH) binary GW200105 was recently found to have significant residual orbital eccentricity at a gravitational-wave frequency of 20 Hz~\cite{Morras:2025xfu}. The event was originally identified with moderate significance by matched-filter searches that employ non-eccentric templates. The neglect of relevant physical effects, such as orbital eccentricity, can severely reduce the sensitivity of the search and, consequently, also the significance of an event candidate. Here, we present a targeted eccentric search for GW200105. The eccentric search identifies GW200105 as the most significant event with a signal-to-noise ratio of $13.4$ and a false alarm rate of less than 1 in 1000 years.
  The best-matching template parameters are consistent with the Bayesian inference result, supporting the interpretation of GW200105 as an NSBH that formed through dynamical mechanisms and not isolated binary evolution.

We show that this conclusion can change when the central black hole is surrounded by a dense dark matter environment. We compute, for the first time, the relativistic dynamical-friction force on a neutron star moving through a collisionless medium and its impact on the evolution of EMRIs embedded in dense dark matter spikes. We then perform a Bayesian parameter-estimation analysis of simulated LISA observations to assess the measurability of both spike properties and the companion's internal structure. We find that, in our fiducial dark matter spike models, EMRIs with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\gtrsim 20$ already allow us to distinguish neutron star from black hole companions, while events with SNR $\gtrsim 400$ make it possible to discriminate between different neutron star equations of state.

Conclusion: 这项研究为通过实验测量提取Planckian时间提供了方法，并简洁地展示了结果的意义，揭示了Planckian散射的潜在普遍性，这对理解共价量子材料中的热传递和信使传递至关重要。

Abstract: The observation of Planckian scattering, often inferred from Drude fits in strongly correlated metals, raises the question of how to extract an intrinsic timescale from measurable quantities in a model-independent way. We address this by focusing on a ratio (${\cal{B}}$) of spectral moments of the dissipative part of the optical conductivity and prove a rigorous upper bound on ${\cal{B}}$ in terms of the Planckian rate. The bound emerges from the analytic structure of thermally weighted response functions of the current operator. Crucially, the bounded quantity is directly accessible via optical spectroscopy and computable from imaginary-time correlators in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, without any need for analytic continuation. We evaluate ${\cal{B}}$ for simplified examples of both Drude and non-Drude forms of the optical conductivity with a single scattering rate in various asymptotic regimes, and find that ${\cal{B}}$ lies far below the saturation value. These findings demonstrate that Planckian bounds can arise from fundamental constraints on equilibrium dynamics, pointing toward a possibly universal structure governing transport in correlated quantum matter.

Abstract: Hall viscosity is a quantized nondissipative stress response of a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluid to adiabatic geometric deformations. Despite strong theoretical interest, its experimental observation in the FQH state has remained elusive, making it a promising target for realization on current NISQ devices. In this work, we employ a quasi-one-dimensional model of an FQH state coupled to a background metric to probe the geometric response under a metric quench. We design and implement a quantum-circuit protocol that realizes a Hilbert-space-truncated version of the model and extracts the Hall viscosity from the geometric response encoded in the wavefunction dynamics of the device. While the truncation prevents us from accessing the fully quantized value of Hall viscosity, the hardware data nevertheless show excellent agreement with analytical and numerical predictions within this restricted regime.

Abstract: The magnetic structure of the novel Hg$_{0.7}$Na$_{0.3}$Mn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$, a quadruple manganite perovskite that exhibits a unique $G$-type charge and orbital ordered state distinct to other $A^{2+}$Mn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$ equivalents ($A$ $=$ Ca, Sr, Cd, Pb), has been solved using powder neutron diffraction and symmetry-motivated analysis. A $G$-type-like antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Mn on the $A'$ sites and a `up--up--down--down' AFM moment configuration of Mn spins on the $B$ sites is found to occur. The mechanism for the onset and stabilization of $B$ site `up--up--down--down' AFM order is explored in terms of coupling between structural and magnetic distortions. The results presented here provide evidence of the exotic charge, orbital, electronic and magnetic orderings that quadruple manganite perovskites demonstrate, and further highlighting the distinct chemistry that Hg$^{2+}$ plays in stabilizing novel states compared to other divalent $A$-site cation equivalents.

Conclusion: 本文为 Hubbard 模型的研究提供了新的分析框架，但仍需进一步研究以更好地理解 Hubbard 型金属态。

Abstract: The ionic Hubbard model is a paradigmatic setup for studying the competition between band and Mott insulating behavior. Within the variationally exact in infinite dimensions Gutzwiller approximation, we derive a compact analytic expression for the phase boundary between Mott and band insulator. While the method reproduces the expected band-Mott insulator phenomenology, it does not capture the correlated metallic state at finite staggered potential found for example in dynamical mean-field theory. This absence highlights that the metallic phase originates from incoherent Hubbard-band physics rather than Fermi-liquid behavior well captured by Gutzwiller approximation. Our formulation establishes a concise variational framework to ionic Hubbard model, with natural extensions to nonequilibrium setups and spin-exchange dynamics.

Conclusion: 双-Q自旋自旋体展现出与预期不同的异常Hall效应，该效应在GdRu₂Si₂和GdRu₂Ge₂中被观察到，说明双-Q自旋铁磁体是潜在的磁性材料。

Abstract: Multi-$Q$ magnets consist of superposed spin density waves with distinct magnetic modulation vectors, enabling a wide range of magnetic orders depending on their combination. Among them, topologically nontrivial spin textures, such as a magnetic skyrmion, has been extensively studied owing to the emergence of topological Hall effects induced by real-space scalar spin chirality. Contrary to this expectation, we theoretically investigate another route to enhancing the Hall response under a topologically \textit{trivial} double-$Q$ spin textures. Despite the cancellation of the scalar spin chirality, the double-$Q$ magnetism exhibits a pronounced Hall response with a nonmonotonic dependence on the uniform magnetization, which is in stark contrast to a ferromagnetic state and a single-$Q$ spiral state. Analyzing the multi-orbital Kondo lattice model, we show that orbital hybridization induced by the double-$Q$ superstructure enhances the Berry curvature in $\mathbf{k}$-space, leading to a large anomalous Hall effect. This mechanism accounts for the observed giant anomalous Hall effect in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ and GdRu$_2$Ge$_2$, thereby highlighting topologically trivial double-$Q$ spin textures as promising spintronic materials.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding high-Tc superconductivity and cuprates is crucial for advancing materials science.

Method: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at Ag L3 edge; density functional theory computations.

Result: AgF₂ shows charge transfer and dd excitations; RIXS measurements pinpoint how covalence affects electronic structure; AgF₂ is more covalent than cuprates.

Conclusion: Silver fluorides can mimic cuprates, aiding exploration of high-Tc superconductivity and exotic magnetism in 2D and 1D materials.

Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of AgF2, AgFBF4, AgF and Ag2O using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ag L3 edge. XAS results were compared with density functional theory computations of the spectra, allowing an identification of main features and an assessment of the theoretical approximations. Our RIXS measurements reveal that AgF2 exhibits charge transfer excitations and dd excitations, analogous to those observed in La2CuO4. We propose to use the ratio of dd to CT spectral weight as a measure of the covalence of the compounds and provide explicit equations for the weights as a function of the scattering geometry for crystals and powders. The measurements at the metal site L3 edge and previous measurements at the ligand K edge reveal a striking similarity between the fluorides and cuprates materials, with fluorides somewhat more covalent than cuprates. These findings support the hypothesis that silver fluorides are an excellent platform to mimic the physics of cuprates, providing a promising avenue for exploring high-Tc superconductivity and exotic magnetism in quasi-two-dimensional (AgF2) and quasi-one-dimensional (AgFBF4) materials.

TL;DR: The Hall-resistivity anomalies in a Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet are not due to chiral spin textures but caused by multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the controversy surrounding the origin of Hall-resistivity anomalies in magnetic materials.

Method: Transport measurements, including Hall resistivity, and transmission electron microscopy analysis were conducted on the Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet.

Result: The Hall resistivity anomalies observed in transport measurements are attributed to sample inhomogeneity and the presence of multiple anomalous Hall channels rather than chiral spin textures.

Conclusion: This study conclusively demonstrates that the observed Hall effect is not evidence of chiral spin textures but instead arises from trivial material inhomogeneity, highlighting the challenges in identifying such textures through transport measurements.

Abstract: Skyrmions and other chiral spin textures have been extensively studied as potential building blocks for novel spintronic devices. Hall-resistivity anomalies that deviate from magnetization scaling, known as the topological Hall effect, have been widely employed as evidence for the presence of chiral spin textures in magnetic materials. However, recent studies on magnetic thin films have revealed a drawback of this approach, as the presumed topological Hall contribution may in fact originate from trivial mechanisms. Here, we investigate the magnetic and transport properties of a Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet, whose related compounds have previously been suggested to exhibit a topological Hall effect arising from chiral spin textures. Hall-resistivity anomalies are also observed in our sample, yet they show little correlation with the magnetic or metamagnetic transitions and are therefore clearly distinct from those in magnetic compounds hosting chiral spin textures. Most importantly, additional Lorentz transmission electron microscopy measurements rule out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet. Therefore, instead of a nontrivial origin, we attribute the Hall-resistivity anomalies to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity. Our work shows that the difficulties of identifying chiral spin textures through transport measurements also apply to bulk systems, prompting some existing results to be revisited.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the magnetic and electronic properties of MnRh films for potential applications in spintronics.

Method: Epitaxial growth using magnetron sputtering, followed by magnetization, resistivity, and Hall resistivity measurements.

Result: A cubic CsCl-type structure was achieved with magnetic phase diagrams showing three regimes: FM (x<40), FM-AFM (40≤x≤45), and AFM-only (x>45). Anomalous Hall effect due to Berry curvature was observed, with strong correlation between magnetic and transport properties.

Conclusion: MnRh films exhibit complex magnetic behavior and a strong link between magnetic properties and electronic band topology, suggesting significant potential for AFM spintronic applications.

Abstract: A series of Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ ($20 \le x \le 50$) thin films were epitaxially grown on the MgO substrate using magnetron sputtering technique, and were systematically investigated by magnetization, longitudinal electrical resistivity, and transverse Hall resistivity. After optimizing the growth conditions, phase-pure Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films with a cubic CsCl-type structure were obtained, and their magnetic phase diagram was built. The manipulation of Rh content leads to a rich magnetic phase diagram, where three different regimes can be identified: for $x < 40$, Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films undergo a ferromagnetic (FM) transition below $T_\mathrm{C} \approx$ 330-350 K; for $40 \le x \le 45$, in addition to the FM transition at $T_\mathrm{C} \approx$ 200 K, Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films undergo a FM-to-antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at $T_\mathrm{N} \approx$ 120 K; finally for $x > 45$, only one AFM transition at $T_\mathrm{N} \approx$ 150 K can be tracked. All the Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films exhibit distinct anomalous Hall effect in their magnetically ordered state, which is most likely due to the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism. In addition, all the anomalous Hall transport properties, including the resistivity, conductivity, and angle exhibit a strong correlation with the magnetic properties of Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films, which become most evident for $x$ = 35. Our systematic investigations suggest a strong correlation between magnetic properties and electronic band topology in Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films, highlighting their great potential for AFM spintronics.

TL;DR: The paper studies the effects of electronic correlations and doping on the electronic structure of La3Ni2O7 using DFT+dynamical mean-field theory. Results show significant orbital-dependent renormalizations, incoherent behavior, and dependence on doping amounts. The analysis also relates the findings to thebilayer Hubbard model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the electronic behavior of LNO under pressure and doping is crucial for advancing superconductor research and materials science.

Method: DFT+dynamical mean-field theory was used to study electronic correlations, including orbital-dependent renormalization and proximity to Lifshitz transitions.

Result: Orbital-dependent mass enhancement (m*/m) varies non-monotonically with doping, with notable increases for x²−y² orbitals upon electron doping. Lifshitz transitions and spin/charge density wave-like behaviors are observed, aligning with the bilayer Hubbard model predictions.

Conclusion: The findings deepen our understanding of LNO electronic structure and suggest potential superconducting mechanisms linked to orbital dynamics and doping effects

Abstract: Using the DFT+dynamical mean-field theory approach we study the effects of electronic correlations and doping on the normal state electronic structure of the double-layer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure. In agreement with experiments, we obtain significant orbital-dependent quasiparticle renormalizations of the Ni $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ bands, accompanied by incoherence (bad metal behavior) of the $3z^2-r^2$ states, caused by the proximity of the Ni $3d$ states to orbital-dependent localization. Our results demonstrate a sensitive, non-monotonic dependence of $m^*/m$ on doping, with a remarkable, by about 20\%, increase for the Ni $x^2-y^2$ orbitals upon electron doping $x \sim 0.2$ (per Ni ion), implying a significant enhancement of orbital-dependent correlations with oxygen deficiency in LNO. We observe a reconstruction of the low-energy electronic structure of LNO upon doping above $x\sim -0.3$ and 0.2. It is associated with the Lifshitz transition, with a crossover to a self-doping regime characterized by partial occupation of the La $5d$ bands (upon an electron doping $x>0.2$). Our analysis of the static magnetic susceptibility $χ({\bf q})$ obtained within DFT+DMFT suggests the possible formation of the spin and charge (or bond) density wave stripes, implying strong spin and charge correlations in LNO. We show that this behavor is associated with suppression of the Néel $G$-type antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ni$^{2+}$ ions upon hole doping. Interestingly, upon a moderate electron doping of the Ni$^{2.5+}$ ions (e.g., with oxygen deficiency), we find a significant enhancement of the strength of in-plane spin and charge fluctuations. We note a close resembles of our results to those for the bilayer Hubbard model, which shows the boosting of superconductivity as one of the two electron bands approaches the Lifshitz transition (e.g., upon doping).

Abstract: We investigate the binding of holes and the emergence of competing spin-charge order in the simple and extended Hubbard model using exact diagonalization on the 3x4 cylindrical lattice. For the simple Hubbard model (V=0), we find weakly bound hole pairing mediated by magnetic correlations at intermediate repulsive U, without any evidence of phase separation. Introducing nearest-neighbor interaction V reveals a rich phase diagram: attractive V drives multi-hole clustering and phase separation with localized magnetic quenching, while repulsive V stabilizes charge-density-wave (CDW) order that coexists with bound hole pairs within a modulated magnetic background. At strong coupling (U=10), the competition sharpens, with attractive V overcoming on-site repulsion to form magnetically quenched clusters and repulsive V producing robust CDW order that constrains pairing. Real-space analysis of spin and charge correlations provides microscopic evidence of distinct binding mechanisms -- phase separation versus correlation-mediated pairing -- depending on the sign and strength of intersite interaction V . Our results establish a comprehensive picture of how nonlocal Coulomb interactions reshape the landscape of hole-binding and collective order in correlated electron systems.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper investigates the magnetic properties of polycrystalline and single-crystalline NaGdS2 samples using a combination of experimental techniques and numerical simulations. The study reveals that NaGdS2, a triangular-lattice magnet with large Gd³⁺ spins, exhibits weak antiferromagnetic exchange and evidence of short-range magnetic order below 180 mK, likely due to the interplay of Heisenberg and dipolar interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the growing interest in rare-earth materials with competing magnetic interactions, aiming to understand how such competition can suppress magnetic order and its potential applications in spintronic devices.

Method: The researchers conducted bulk measurements, including magnetization, specific heat, ac susceptibility, thermal expansion, and magnetostriction, alongside local techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (^23Na NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR). Numerical simulations using the McPhase method were employed to complement the experimental findings.

Result: The results show that NaGdS2 displays weak antiferromagnetic exchange (J_H/kB ≈ 52 mK) and no long-range magnetic order down to the lowest temperatures. However, below 180 mK, short-range magnetic order is observed, attributed to the presence of dipolar exchange. ESR and ^23Na NMR measurements confirm the formation of short-range ferromagnetic correlations. The large spin moment of Gd³⁺ enhances the impact of dipolar coupling, distinguishing NaGdS2 from similar systems like NaYbS2.

Conclusion: The study concludes that magnetic order in NaGdS2 is suppressed by a balance between Heisenberg and dipolar interactions. This finding contributes to the understanding of rare-earth materials with competing magnetic interactions and opens possibilities for applications in spintronic devices.

Abstract: In this comprehensive study, we present results of bulk measurements (magnetization, specific heat, ac susceptibility, thermal expansion, and magnetostriction) combined with local methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (^23Na NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) and simulations (McPhase) on polycrystalline and single-crystalline NaGdS_2 samples. The rare-earth delafossite NaGdS_2 is a triangular-lattice magnet with S = 7/2 spin-only Gd^3+ moments with suppressed single-ion anisotropy. In our study, we estimate that NaGdS_2 has a weak antiferromagnetic exchange (J_H/k_B is about 52mK) and signs of long-range magnetic order are absent down to lowest temperature. However, indications of short range magnetic order are found below 180 mK in the ac susceptibility and thermal expansion. Our results indicate an interplay of Heisenberg-type and dipolar exchange. Due to the large moment of the Gd^3+ ions, one expects a strong impact of the dipolar coupling in NaGdS_2, in contrast to the related NaYbS_2. ESR and ^23Na NMR measurements, indeed, indicate the formation of short-range ferromagnetic correlations. NaGdS_2 appears to be a rare system, in which magnetic order is suppressed by a competition between Heisenberg and dipolar interactions.

Abstract: We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) model with hard-core bosons at half-filling, extending previous studies by including second nearest-neighbor (2NN) interactions. Using matrix product state techniques within the density matrix renormalization group, we compute charge gap, static structure factor, and pair-pair correlation functions for various interaction strengths and field parameters. We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators. Our work extends the well-studied phase structure of 1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT models and demonstrates the interplay between gauge fields, confinement, and extended interactions.

Abstract: We present two quantum-classical hybrid methods for simulating the time-dependence of electron-phonon systems that treat electronic correlations numerically exactly and optical-phonon degrees of freedom classically. These are a time-dependent Lanczos and a matrix-product state method, each combined with the multi-trajectory Ehrenfest approach. Due to the approximations, reliable results are expected for the adiabatic regime of small phonon frequencies. We discuss the convergence properties of both methods for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension and provide a benchmark for the Holstein chain. As a first application, we study the decay of charge density wave order in a system of interacting spinless fermions coupled to Einstein oscillators and in the presence of quenched disorder. We investigate the dependence of the relaxation dynamics on the electron-phonon coupling strength and provide numerical evidence that the coupling of strongly disordered systems to classical oscillators leads to delocalization, thus destabilizing the (finite-size) many-body localization in this system.

Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in recent years. However, identifying a universal topological invariant capable of characterizing higher-order topology remains challenging. Here, we propose a entanglement topological invariant designed to characterize secondorder topological systems. This entanglement topological invariant captures the entanglement of topological corner states under open boundary conditions by employing a bipartite entanglement entropy method. In several representative models, the entanglement topological invariant assumes a nonzero value exclusively in the presence of second-order topology, with its magnitude exactly matching the number of topologically protected corner states. Consequently, the proposed entanglement topological invariant not only provides a clear criterion for detecting higher-order topology, but also offers a quantitative measure for the related corner states. Our study establishes a universal and precise method for characterizing higher-order topological phases, opening avenues for their fundamental understanding and future investigations.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that machine learning corrections can significantly improve the accuracy of the INDO/s method for calculating molecular excitation energies and absorption spectra, making it competitive with more expensive methods like TDDFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for efficient yet accurate computational methods to study molecular properties, especially for large systems, and this paper addresses that by combining the INDO/s method with machine learning corrections.

Method: The authors developed machine learning models to correct the results of the INDO/s method, aiming to reduce the error in excitation energies and improve the accuracy of TDDFT predictions with minimal computational cost.

Result: The ML-corrected INDO/s method reduced the average error in excitation energies from 1.1 eV to 0.2 eV compared to TDDFT, and the UV-Vis spectra were in good agreement with TDDFT predictions.

Conclusion: The combination of INDO/s and ML offers a more accurate and efficient approach for calculating molecular excitation properties compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: The semi-empirical INDO/s method is popular for studies of excitation energies and absorption of molecules due to its low computational requirement, making it possible to make predictions for large systems. However, its accuracy is generally low, particularly, when compared with the typical accuracy of other methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Here, we present machine learning (ML) models that correct the INDO/s results with negligible increases in the amount of computing resources needed. While INDO/s excitations energies have an average error of about 1.1 eV relative to TDDFT energies, the added ML corrections reduce the error to 0.2 eV. Furthermore, this combination of INDO/s and ML produces UV-Vis absorption spectra that are in good agreement with the TDDFT predictions.

Abstract: The Johnson-Nyquist noise associated with the intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, induces fluctuations of the electron density in charge-neutral graphene devices. In the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, the fluctuations of charge density and electric current induce a fluctuating hydrodynamic flow. We show that the resulting advection of charge produces a fluctuation contribution to the macroscopic conductivity of the system, $σ_{\mathrm{fl}}$, and develop a quantitative theory of $σ_{\mathrm{fl}}$. At zero magnetic field, $σ_{\mathrm{fl}}$ diverges logarithmically with the system size and becomes rapidly suppressed at relatively small fields. This results in giant magnetoresistance of the system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of integrating semiconductor quantum dots into scalable, industry-compatible silicon-based photonic quantum technologies, especially for applications like long-distance quantum communication.

Method: The method involves using a strain-reducing layer approach on silicon and employing in-situ electron-beam lithography to integrate QDs into Bragg grating resonators.

Result: The devices exhibit photon extraction efficiencies up to 40%, single-photon purities exceeding 99% at cryogenic temperatures, and robust performance even at elevated temperatures.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical, scalable route for developing quantum light sources compatible with classical electronics and integrated circuits in quantum information systems.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are key building blocks for photonic quantum technologies, enabling practical sources of non-classical light. A central challenge for scalable integration is the direct epitaxial growth of high-quality emitters on industry-compatible silicon platforms. Furthermore, for long-distance fiber-based quantum communication, emission in the telecom O- or C-band is essential. Here, we demonstrate the direct growth of high-quality InGaAs/GaAs QDs emitting in the telecom O-band using a strain-reducing layer approach on silicon. Deterministic integration of individual QDs into circular Bragg grating resonators is achieved via in-situ electron-beam lithography. The resulting devices exhibit strong out-coupling enhancement, with photon extraction efficiencies up to $(40 \pm 2)\%$, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. These results highlight the high material quality of both the epitaxial platform and the photonic nanostructure, as well as the precise lateral positioning of the emitter within 20~nm of the resonator center. At cryogenic temperature (4~K) and low excitation power ($0.027\times P_\text{sat}$), the devices show excellent single-photon purity, exceeding 99\%. Operation at elevated temperatures of 40~K and 77~K, compatible with compact Stirling cryo-coolers and liquid-nitrogen cooling, reveals robust performance, with single-photon purity maintained at $(88.4 \pm 0.6)\%$ at 77~K. These results demonstrate a practical and scalable route toward silicon-based quantum light sources and provide a promising path for cost-effective fabrication and seamless integration of quantum photonics with classical electronics, representing an important step toward large-scale, chip-based quantum information systems.

TL;DR: This paper shows how to use open-shell nanographenes, particularly triangulenes, with increasing lengths of armchair anthene to create a scalable system for spin-based quantum architectures. They demonstrate that a single-radical aza-triangulene can be transformed into a frustrated antiferromagnetic triradical, which exhibits correlated spins and can function as a molecular quantum register. This opens up new possibilities for spin-based quantum computing and quantum information processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to explore the potential of open-shell nanographenes for creating spin-based quantum architectures, which are promising for quantum computing and quantum information processing. The scalability and controllability of spins in such systems are of particular interest.

Method: The researchers used a combination of experimental and computational methods. They synthesized and characterized the materials using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy. They performed multi-reference electronic-structure calculations to model the behavior of the polyradical systems as the length of the anthene moieties was increased.

Result: The key findings of the study include the successful transformation of a single-radical aza-triangulene into a frustrated antiferromagnetic triradical by extending it with armchair anthene moieties of increasing length. They observed edge-localized Kondo resonances and a doublet-to-quartet spin excitation, indicating the emergence of correlated spins. The multi-reference electronic-structure calculations showed that the polyradical character increases with the length of the anthene, leading to a system that can function as a molecular analog of a three-qubit quantum register.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a scalable approach for creating spin-based quantum architectures using open-shell nanographenes. The ability to tune the system's properties by adjusting the length of the appended anthene moieties provides a promising pathway for the development of quantum devices based on correlated spin systems.

Abstract: Open-shell nanographenes provide a versatile platform to host unconventional magnetic states within their π-conjugated networks. Particularly appealing are graphene architectures that incorporate spatially separated radicals and tunable interactions, offering a scalable route toward spin-based quantum architectures. Triangulenes are ideal for this purpose, as their radical count scales with size, although strong hybridization prevents individual spin control. Here, we realize a radical reconfiguration strategy that transforms a single-radical aza-triangulene into a frustrated antiferromagnetic triradical by covalently extending it with armchair anthene moieties of increasing length. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveals edge-localized Kondo resonances and a doublet-to-quartet spin excitation, evidencing the emergence of correlated spins. Multi-reference electronic-structure calculations trace the progressive increase in polyradical character with anthene length, driven by the clustering of frontier states within a narrow energy window. Consequently, the initial single-radical doublet reorganizes into a frustrated triradical with weakly coupled edge spins, a molecular analog of a three-qubit quantum register.

Abstract: Localized particle-like spin textures have been found to exhibit emergent electromagnetic properties, which hold promise for the development of intriguing spintronic devices. Among these textures, magnetic bubbles represent localized spin configurations that could serve as data bits. However, the precise methods for their electrical manipulation remain uncertain. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic electrical manipulations and detections of single magnetic bubbles in kagome-latticed Fe3Sn2 magnetic nanostructured cells. The current-induced dynamics of magnetic bubbles were explored using nanosecond pulsed currents. We show single pulsed currents with low and high densities can be applied for the creation and deletion of a single bubble, respectively. The mutual writing-deleting operations on single bubbles are attributed to the thermal heating and non-thermal spin-transfer torque effects in combination with micromagnetic simulations. We also realized the in-situ detection of a single bubble using the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect through a standard four-probe method. Our results could propel the development of bubble-based spintronic devices.

Conclusion: This study paves the way for room-temperature and zero-field skyrmion bundles, advancing the development of topological spintronic devices. micromagnetic simulations can guide future experimental designs to exploit these findings for practical applications.

Abstract: Topological spin textures are characterized by topological magnetic charges, Q, which govern their electromagnetic properties. Recent studies have achieved skyrmion bundles with arbitrary integer values of Q, opening possibilities for exploring topological spintronics based on Q. However, the realization of stable skyrmion bundles in chiral magnets at room temperature and zero magnetic field - the prerequisite for realistic device applications - has remained elusive. Here, through the combination of pulsed currents and reversed magnetic fields, we experimentally achieve skyrmion bundles with different integer Q values - reaching a maximum of 24 at above room temperature and zero magnetic field - in the chiral magnet Co8Zn10Mn2. We demonstrate the field-driven annihilation of high-Q bundles and present a phase diagram as a function of temperature and field. Our experimental findings are consistently corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, which reveal the nature of the skyrmion bundle as that of skyrmion tubes encircled by a fractional Hopfion.

Abstract: Two parallel helical edge channels hosting interacting electrons, when proximitized by local and nonlocal pairings, can host time-reversal-invariant pairs of topological zero modes at the system corners. Here we show that realistic imperfections substantially enrich the physics of such proximitized double helical liquids. Specifically, we analyze this platform and its fractional counterparts in the presence of pairing and interaction asymmetries between the two channels, as well as random spin-flip terms arising from either magnetic disorder or coexisting charge disorder and external magnetic fields. Using renormalization-group analysis, we determine how Coulomb interactions, pairings, and magnetic disorder collectively influence the transport behavior and topological properties of the double helical liquid. As the system transitions from class DIII to class BDI, an additional topological phase supporting a single Majorana zero mode per corner emerges. We further show how additional pairing or Coulomb asymmetry influences the stability of various topological phases and uncovers a revival of Majorana zero modes and cascades of transitions through topological phases characterized by a $\mathbb {Z}$ invariant, which are accessible through controlling the electrical screening effect. In contrast to conventional understanding, disorder is not merely detrimental, as it in general allows for a tuning knob that qualitatively reshapes the topological superconductivity in imperfect helical liquids.

Abstract: Recent experiments have reported valley-gauge-symmetry-broken phases, identified as intervalley coherent (IVC) states. Exploration of anomalous responses, particularly those analogous to superconductivity, has become an urgent theoretical issue. In this study, we show that the IVC order gives rise to anomalous valley-current generation driven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The anomalous valley current exhibits a characteristic power-law dependence for low-frequency SAWs. Furthermore, we demonstrate by numerical analysis that the IVC order significantly enhances valley-current generation in rhombohedral graphene. These results open a pathway toward exploring exotic phenomena emerging from valley-gauge-symmetry breaking, in close analogy with gauge-symmetry breaking in superconductors.

Abstract: We show that a small charged probe near a spherical topological insulator causes the latter to rotate around a symmetry axis defined by the center of the sphere and the position of the charge outside the latter. The rotation occurs when the distance from the charge to the center of the sphere is changed. This phenomenon occurs due to induced static fields and is a consequence of the axion electrodynamics underlying the electromagnetic response of a topological insulator. Assuming a regime where the charged probe can be regarded as a point charge $q=Ne$, where $N$ is a positive integer and $e$ is the elementary electric charge, we obtain that the rotation frequency is given by $ω=(Nα)^2Υ(ε,d/a)/I$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia, $α$ is the fine-structure constant, and the function $Υ$ depends on the dielectric constant $ε$ and the relative distance $d/a$ of the charge from the center of the sphere of radius $a$. Since the point charge also induces Hall currents on the surface, we compute also their associated angular momentum. This allows us to derive an exact expression for the electronic velocity on the surface as a function of $a/d$.

Result: Detailed magnetometric measurements reveal static and dynamic properties of antiferromagnetic domains, including ferromagnetic stripes and periodic magnetization modulation. GHz-range spin noise and constant stray fields in the range of several millitesla are observed.

Conclusion: This study paves the way for advanced, non-invasive magnetometry of SAF materials with precise magnetic insights and potential applications in novel spin-wave studies.

Abstract: Multilayered synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) are artificial three-dimensional (3D) architectures engineered to create novel, complex, and stable spin textures. Non-invasive and quantitative nanoscale magnetic imaging of the two-dimensional stray field profile at the sample surface is essential for understanding the fundamental properties of the spin-structure and being able to tailor them to achieve new functionalities. However, the deterministic detection of spin textures and their quantitative characterization on the nanoscale remain challenging. Here, we use nitrogen-vacancy scanning probe microscopy (NV-SPM) under ambient conditions to perform the first quantitative vector-field magnetometry measurements in the multilayered SAF [(Co/Pt)$_5$/Co/Ru]$_3$/(Co/Pt)$_6$. We investigate nanoscale static and dynamic properties of antiferromagnetic domains with boundaries hosting ``one-dimensional'' ferromagnetic stripes with ~ 100 nm of width and periodic modulation of the magnetization. By employing NV-SPM measurements in different imaging modes and involving NV-probes with various crystallographic orientations, we demonstrated distinct fingerprints emerging from GHz-range spin noise and constant stray fields on the order of several mT. This provides quantitative insights into the structure of domains and domain walls, as well as, into magnetic noise associated with thermal spin-waves. Our work opens up new opportunities for quantitative vector-field magnetometry of modern magnetic materials with tailored 3D spin textures and stray field profiles, and potentially novel spin-wave dispersions--in a quantitative and non-invasive manner, with exceptional magnetic sensitivity and nanometer scale spatial resolution.

Abstract: Interlayer exchange in synthetic antiferromagnets incorporating thin paramagnetic spacers can be controlled thermally. The spacer provides an additional ferromagnetic contribution that renormalizes the otherwise temperature-independent interlayer coupling. As a result, the system shows antiferromagnetic alignment at high temperatures and ferromagnetic alignment at low temperatures. This behavior is observed in Fe(2 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$(0.9 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe(2 nm) multilayers with the inner spacer Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$ paramagnetic at and above room temperature, and is shown to be due to the spacer being significantly magnetically polarized on lowering the temperature toward its Curie point. Although the Fe layers lack intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the magnetization reversal demonstrates a field-induced uniaxial anisotropy of antiferromagnetic character. The resulting reversal process resembles that of a metamagnet with a spin-flip transition.

Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that the conducting edge states of two-dimensional topological insulators of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ family are protected by time-reversal symmetry. However, theoretical bulk calculations and a recent experiment show that the edge states persist in the presence of large external magnetic fields. To address this apparent contradiction, we have developed an analytical description for the edge-state wave function of a semi-infinite sample in a perpendicular magnetic field. Our description relies on the usual bulk Landau levels, together with additional states arising due to the presence of the hard wall, which are unnormalizable in the infinite system. The analytical wave functions agree extremely well with numerical calculations and can be used to directly analyze the behavior of the edge states in a magnetic field.

TL;DR: Dark trions in WS2 show promising potential for quantum technologies with long lifetimes, but optical activation is difficult at high temps. Surface plasmons help brighten dark trions, creating a PL spectral doublet. The peaks likely represent semi-dark and bright trions from electron scattering and exhibit negative circular polarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring novel quantum states and their applications in optoelectronics/photovoltaics is a key focus in materials science.

Method: Surface plasmon modes in disordered gold substrates are used to enhance dark trion brightness.

Result:  bright trions are observed via PL, distinctive doublet separated by ~45meV. Negative circular polarization is noted at semi-dark trion energy.

Conclusion:  Dark trions in WS2 show promise despite challenges. Surface plasmons enhance their properties for quantum applications.

Abstract: Optically inactive dark trions in two-dimensional semiconductors are poised to play a stellar role in future quantum technologies due to their long lifetimes, about two orders of magnitude greater than those of their bright counterparts. In monolayer (ML) tungsten disulphide (WS$_2$), accessing these states via optical activation remains challenging, specially at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate the brightening of dark trions from ML WS$_2$ in the temperature range, 83 K-115 K, via localized surface plasmon modes in a disordered gold substrate. The resulting photoluminescence (PL) spectrum reveals a distinct spectral doublet with the twin peaks separated by ~ 45 meV. We propose that the peaks represent semi-dark and bright trion states, the origin of which lies in intervalley electron-electron scatterings. We also report on the experimental evidence of a negative degree of circular polarization in ML WS$_2$ at the energy of the semi-dark trion state.

Abstract: Electronic bands in chirally stacked $n$ layer carbon-based honeycomb heterostructures, encompassing rhombohedral ($n \geq 3$), Bernal bilayer ($n=2$), and monolayer ($n=1$) graphene, possess four-fold valley and spin degeneracy. Such systems with $n \geq 2$, when subject to external perpendicular electric displacement fields, feature a fully degenerate metal at high doping, a spin non-degenerate but valley degenerate half-metal at moderate doping, and a non-degenerate quarter-metal at low doping. Due to the fully polarized nature of the quasiparticles in the quarter-metal, realized around one particular valley otherwise chosen spontaneously, it can sustain a single local superconducting ground state, representing a pair-density-wave that is chiral and odd parity in nature. From a leading order renormalization group analysis, here we show that repulsive density-density interaction among such polarized fermionic excitations can foster the pair-density-wave phase at low temperatures. Possible connections with experimentally observed superconducting states in the close vicinity of the quarter-metal in some members of such graphene heterostructures family are discussed.

TL;DR: Bilayer graphene (BLG) cavities exhibit quantum chaotic phenomena due to trigonal warping of the Fermi surface. Misalignment between the BLG lattice and cavity geometry, caused by boundary rotation, drives the system towards chaos. Eigenenergy level statistics show Wigner-Dyson distribution under rotation, and eigenstate analysis indicates a transition from near-integrability to spatially uncorrelated random waves. Semiclassical ray-dynamics reveal an ergodic phase space structure, providing quantum-classical correspondence for the onset of chaos. These findings open avenues for quantum chaotic phenomena in BLG cavities with potential applications in quantum device engineering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum chaotic phenomena in condensed matter systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies and materials science.

Method: A tight-binding model was used to investigate the effect of boundary rotation on the BLG lattice. Eigenenergy level statistics and eigenstate analysis were performed to study the transition from near-integrability to spatially uncorrelated random waves. Semiclassical ray-dynamics with trigonal-warped dispersion were analyzed to reveal an ergodic phase space structure.

Result: Rotation of the BLG boundary relative to the lattice drives the system towards chaos. Eigenenergy level statistics follow Wigner-Dyson distribution, and eigenstate analysis shows a transition from near-integrability to spatially uncorrelated random waves. Semiclassical ray-dynamics reveal an ergodic phase space structure, providing a quantum-classical correspondence for the onset of chaos.

Conclusion: This study establishes an avenue to explore quantum chaotic phenomena in BLG cavities, which could have significant implications for the development of quantum devices and technologies.

Abstract: Bilayer graphene (BLG) cavities, where electrons are confined in finite graphene flakes, provide a suitable platform to study quantum chaotic phenomena in condensed matter systems due to the trigonal warping of the Fermi surface. Here, we investigate the effect of the misalignment between the BLG lattice and the cavity geometry, introduced by rotating the boundary relative to the lattice, which can drive the system towards chaos. Based on a tight-binding model, eigenenergy level statistics reveals that rotation leads to level repulsion following Wigner-Dyson statistics, while corresponding eigenstate analysis indicates a transition from near-integrability to spatially uncorrelated random waves. Analysis of the semiclassical ray-dynamics with the trigonal-warped dispersion unveils an ergodic phase space structure, providing a quantum-classical correspondence of the onset of chaos. These findings establish an avenue to quantum chaotic phenomena in BLG cavities with potential applications in quantum device engineering.

### [64] [Investigation of Real-Space Transfer Noise in InP Quantum Wells](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10103)
*Jiayin Zhang,Anthony J. Ardizzi,Kieran A. Cleary,Austin J. Minnich*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: InP HEMTs have high electron mobility and are used in quantum computing due to low microwave noise. The paper investigates the source of drain noise in HEMTs by testing a theoretical model (RST) through experiments with varying electron confinement potentials while keeping transport properties constant. The results align with RST predictions, supporting its role in drain noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the noise mechanisms in HEMTs is crucial for improving their performance and reliability, especially in applications like quantum computing where noise reduction is vital.

Method: The study uses a transfer-length method to fabricate HEMTs with identical channel compositions but different barrier layers to alter electron confinement, measuring microwave noise temperatures under varying physical temperatures and source-drain voltages.

Result: The observed noise temperature trends match the predictions of RST noise theory, confirming that RST contributes to drain noise in HEMTs.

Conclusion: This experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that RST is a significant factor in drain noise within InP HEMTs.

Abstract: Indium phosphide (InP) high electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) are widely used in many fields such as quantum computing because of their unparalleled microwave noise performance. Achieving improved noise performance requires a physical understanding of the noise mechanisms. Here, we experimentally test a theoretical proposal for drain (output) noise as originating in part from real-space transfer (RST) by characterizing the microwave noise temperature of transfer-length method structures with the same channel composition but two different barrier compositions. This choice was made to alter the confining potential of electrons in the channel, thereby affecting the RST mechanism, while avoiding changes to the channel transport properties. We observe trends of noise temperature with physical temperature and source-drain voltage which are compatible with the predictions of RST noise theory. This finding supports the hypothesis that RST contributes to drain noise in HEMTs.

Abstract: Fifth-generation (5G) communication systems, operating in higher frequency bands from 3 to 300 GHz, provide unprecedented bandwidth to enable ultra-high data rates and low-latency services. However, the use of millimeter-wave frequencies raises public health concerns regarding prolonged electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exposure. Above 6 GHz, the incident power density (IPD) is used instead of the specific absorption rate (SAR) for exposure assessment, owing to the shallow penetration depth of millimeter waves. This paper proposes a hybrid field reconstruction framework that integrates classical electromagnetic algorithms with deep learning to evaluate the IPD of wireless communication devices operating at 30 GHz, thereby determining compliance with established RF exposure limits. An initial estimate of the electric field on the evaluation plane is obtained using a classical reconstruction algorithm, followed by refinement through a neural network model that learns the mapping between the initial and accurate values. A multi-antenna dataset, generated via full-wave simulation, is used for training and testing. The impacts of training strategy, initial-value algorithm, reconstruction distance, and measurement sampling density on model performance are analyzed. Results show that the proposed method significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, achieving an average relative error of 4.57% for electric field reconstruction and 2.97% for IPD estimation on the test dataset. Additionally, the effects of practical uncertainty factors, including probe misalignment, inter-probe coupling, and measurement noise, are quantitatively assessed.

Abstract: Neutron-source identification is central to nuclear physics and its applications, from planetary science to nuclear security, yet direct discrimination from neutron spectra remains fundamentally elusive. Here, we introduce a Bayesian protocol that directly infers source ensembles from measured neutron spectra by combining full-spectrum template matching with probabilistic evidence evaluation. Applying this protocol to recoil and time-of-flight spectroscopy, we recover single- and two-source configurations with strong statistical significance ($>\!\!4σ$) at event counts as low as $\sim\!\!10^{3}$. These results demonstrate that neutron spectral signatures can be leveraged for robust source identification, opening a new observational window for both fundamental research and operationally driven applications.

Abstract: The critical current of superconductors is commonly measured by testing unloaded wires under an external magnetic field. While stressed by intense Lorentz forces, the existing HTS/LTS superconductors are prone to a reduction in critical current before reaching their structural mechanical limit. In this work, the magnetic and mechanical analysis of the FNAL 4-layer Bi-2212/Nb$_3$Sn hybrid dipole magnet is reported, aimed at predicting the critical current degradation for both the superconductors during powering at 16 T. All the Rutherford cables in the coils of the hybrid magnet were modeled at the strand level in Ansys APDL with the heterogeneous cable model. Utilizing this detailed geometry, it was possible to evaluate the effects of strain on the critical current degradation for both the Nb$_3$Sn and Bi-2212 superconductors under the intense Lorentz forces. The analysis presented in this paper integrates strain-dependent critical current laws, with parameters derived from experimental data, to simulate the hybrid magnet's performance for all possible current-powering configurations. The proposed methodology enables a detailed assessment of conductor integrity and I$_C$($\varepsilon$) reduction in existing hybrid magnet designs, providing a versatile and rigorous framework for optimizing future high-field hybrid magnets.

Abstract: The PICOSEC detector concept uses a micro-pattern gaseous detector (MPGD) amplification structure combined with a Cerenkov radiator coated with a semi-transparent photocathode to provide below tens of picosecond-level precision timing capabilities with minimum ionizing particles. PICOSEC has triggered interest in the development of time-of-flight detectors for particle identification and timing detectors for track reconstruction in the high rate environment of future nuclear and high energy physics experiments. The PICOSEC Micromegas (or PICOSEC-MM) detector, developed by the CERN-based PICOSEC collaboration, use the Micromegas structure for gaseous amplification and achieve below 20 ps timing resolution. A new type of PICOSEC detector, the μRWELL-PICOSEC based on μRWELL amplification structure, is being investigated at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) alongside PICOSEC-MM R&D efforts in Europe. Preliminary results from the two 2024 beam test campaigns at CERN demonstrate a timing performance better than 24 ps is achievable with a single-channel μRWELL-PICOSEC prototype. A vigorous R&D effort is ongoing to improve the timing performance, robustness and operational stability of μRWELL-PICOSEC detectors. Development of a large size μRWELL-PICOSEC is also under consideration for applications in large scale experiments.

Abstract: Triaxial vibration sensor are widely used used in various application. Recently, low-cost sensors based on micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) technology are also becoming more widely adopted. However, their measurement accuracy can be affected by environmental factors such as temperature. In this study, we developed an environmental testing system integrated with a triaxial vibration exciter. The system can reproduce long-stroke, low-frequency triaxial vibrations -- such as those caused by huge earthquakes -- under temperatures ranging from $-30~^\circ\mathrm{C}$ to $+80~^\circ\mathrm{C}$. Using this system, the measurement accuracy of vibration sensors can be evaluated under different environmental conditions. The system provides highly accurate reference measurements using a laser interferometer and reference accelerometers that are primarily calibrated within the system. The overall accuracy of the reference vibration measurement is estimated to be approximately 0.23~\%. Based on these reference measurements, we investigated the accuracy of earthquake observations using a MEMS accelerometer as a demonstration. The system configuration and testing procedures are presented in this paper.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种实践且高效的工具来分析高维吸引子在扩展开ynamical系统中的特性。

Abstract: While a previously proposed method for estimating inertial manifold dimension, based on explicitly computing angles between pairs of covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs), employs efficient algorithms, it remains computationally demanding due to its substantial resource requirements. In this work, we introduce an improved method to determine this dimension by analyzing the angles between tangent subspaces spanned by the CLVs. This approach builds upon a fast numerical technique for assessing chaotic dynamics hyperbolicity. Crucially, the proposed method requires significantly less computational effort and minimizes memory usage by eliminating the need for explicit CLV computation. We test our method on two canonical systems: the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and a diffusively coupled chain of Lorenz oscillators. For the former, the results confirm the accuracy of the new approach by matching prior dimension estimates. For the latter, the analysis demonstrates the absence of a low-dimensional inertial manifold, highlighting a complex regime that merits further investigation. The presented method offers a practical and efficient tool for characterizing high-dimensional attractors in extended dynamical systems.

Abstract: We present analytical and numerical results on integrability and transition to chaotic motion for a generalized Ziegler pendulum, a double pendulum subject to an angular elastic potential and a follower force. Several variants of the original dynamical system, including the presence of gravity and friction, are considered, in order to analyze whether the integrable cases are preserved or not in presence of further external forces, both potential and non-potential. Particular attention is devoted to the presence of dissipative forces, that are analyzed in two different formulations. Furthermore, a study of the discrete version is performed. The analysis of periodic points, that is presented up to period 3, suggests that the discrete map associated to the dynamical system has not dense sets of periodic points, so that the map would not be chaotic in the sense of Devaney for a choice of the parameters that corresponds to a general case of chaotic motion for the original system.

TL;DR: Kuramoto oscillator networks with higher-order and stochastic elements exhibit complex synchronization behavior, influenced by phase frustration and coupling strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding synchronization in complex oscillator networks is fundamental for fields like physics and engineering, seeking insights into how phase differences, noise, and network topology affect collective behavior.

Method: The researchers developed a network model incorporating pairwise and higher-order interactions alongside stochastic forcing. They used numerical simulations and the Ott-Antonsen reduction to derive a low-dimensional amplitude equation, enabling analysis of the system's behavior under varying parameters.

Result: The study revealed that weak phase frustration combined with reinforcing couplings promotes synchronization, while strong frustration is better suited to repulsive coupling. The system exhibits a bistable region, whose width is significantly influenced by phase frustration, noise intensity, and higher-order coupling. The theoretical framework explained the observed behaviors, demonstrating how these factors collectively impact synchronization.

Conclusion: This research offers a unified approach to understanding synchronization in frustrated oscillator networks, highlighting the interplay between phase frustration, noise, and network interactions, with implications for both theoretical and applied contexts.

Abstract: How do the combined effects of phase frustration, noise, and higher-order interactions govern synchronization in globally coupled heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillators? To address this question, we investigate a globally coupled network of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators that includes both pairwise (1-simplex) and higher-order (2-simplex) interactions, together with additive stochastic forcing. Systematic numerical simulations across a broad range of coupling strengths, phase-lag values, and noise intensities reveal that synchronization emerges through a nontrivial interplay among these parameters. In general, weak frustration combined with mutually reinforcing coupling promotes synchronization, whereas strong frustration favors coherence under repulsive coupling. Forward and backward parameter sweeps reveal the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized states. The presence and width of this bistable region depend sensitively on phase frustration, noise intensity, and higher-order coupling strength, with higher-order interactions significantly widening the bistable interval. To explain these behaviors, we employ the Ott-Antonsen reduction to derive a low-dimensional amplitude equation that predicts the forward critical point in the thermodynamic limit, the backward saddle-node point, and the width of the bistable region. Higher order interactions widen this region by shifting the saddle-node point without affecting the forward critical point. Further analysis of Kramer's escape rate explains how noise destabilizes coexistence states and diminishes bistability. Overall, our results provide a unified theoretical and numerical framework for frustrated, noisy, higher-order oscillator networks, revealing that synchronization is strongly influenced by the combined action of phase frustration, stochasticity, and both pairwise and higher-order interactions.

Abstract: The Melnikov method is applied to a class of generalized Ziegler pendulums. We find an analytical form for the separatrix of the system in terms of Jacobian elliptic integrals, holding for a large class of initial conditions and parameters. By working in Duffing approximation, we apply the Melnikov method to the original Ziegler system, showing that the first non-vanishing Melnikov integral appears in the second order. An explicit expression for the Melnikov integral is derived in the presence of a time-periodic external force and for a suitable choice of the parameters, as well as in the presence of a dissipative term acting on the lower rod of the pendulum. These results allow us to define fundamental relationships between the Melnikov integral and a proper control parameter that distinguishes between regular and chaotic orbits for the original dynamical system. Finally, in the appendix, we present proof of a conjecture concerning the non-validity of Devaney's chaoticity definition for a discrete map associated with the system.

Abstract: Machine learning applications in the chemical sciences, especially when based on neural networks, critically depend on the availability of large quantities of high quality data. As they provide excellent accuracy for both charged and neutral excitations, a large dataset containing quasiparticle self-consistent GW (qs$GW$) and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) data would be highly desirable to model excited state energies and properties. In this work, we introduce a dataset for qs$GW$-BSE excitation energies and qs$GW$ quasiparticle energies of unprecedented size. Our dataset, denoted QM9GWBSE, supplies $GW$-BSE singlet-singlet and singlet-triplet excitation energies, corresponding transition dipole moments and oscillator strengths as well as qs$GW$ quasiparticle energies for all molecules from the popular QM9 dataset. We anticipate that QM9GWBSE will provide a solid foundation to train highly accurate machine learning models for the prediction of molecular excited state properties.

Conclusion: 分子间产生电势差的条件及其影响可被分子结构特征所完全决定。

Abstract: At model water--vapor and water--solid interfaces, molecular ordering leads to charge oscillations and, thereby, to a spatially varying electrostatic potential. Atomistic simulations indicate that such ordering leads to an electric potential difference $χ$, the surface potential, of about $-0.5\,\mathrm{V}$ across the first few molecular layers. Here, we calculate surface potentials at interfaces between a simple model fluids and a solid, with Molecular Dynamics simulations. The fluids are made up of either diatomic, dipolar molecules or a single Lennard-Jones particle with a dipole moment. All fluids show some structuring near the interface, but charge oscillations and a non-zero surface potential are present only for asymmetric molecules (unequal diameters of the atoms) or molecules with an off-center dipole. We condense this finding into the criterion that the geometric and dipolar centers of a molecule must differ for the fluid to exhibit a surface potential. Remarkably, while the solid--fluid interaction strength strongly affects the magnitude of charge oscillations, it hardly affects the potential drop $χ$. Further, our results demonstrate that changing the diameter of the smaller atom can flip the sign of the surface potential, thus highlighting the importance of steric effects.

Abstract: Correlation functions of energy flow operators (energy-energy correlators) are one of the simplest observables in quantum field theory and gravity, with diverse applications ranging from real world collider physics to constraining the space of consistent theories. In this paper we further develop the conformal block decomposition of energy-energy correlators in conformal field theories (CFTs), focusing on the source-detector operator product expansion (OPE). We compute the general conformal blocks in this channel for traceless symmetric operators of arbitrary spin in the background of a scalar source, considering both parity-even and parity-odd contributions. Motivated by the availability of data from the conformal bootstrap, we analyze the convergence of this source-detector OPE, taking a tensor product of two decoupled CFTs as an elementary example. Finally, we use positivity of energy correlators to derive novel bounds on OPE coefficients involving the stress-energy tensor in generic CFTs, and demonstrate the application of these bounds in the specific example of the 3d Ising CFT, obtaining new constraints for both parity-even and parity-odd operators.

Abstract: We construct consistent effective equations of motion for massive charged particles of spin 2 and spin $3/2$ interacting with constant electromagnetic backgrounds. While tree-level unitarity restricts point-like particles to a universal gyromagnetic ratio $g=2$, long-lived composite states such as the $Ω^-$ baryon generically deviate from this value. We propose describing such non-minimal couplings without triggering pathologies such as superluminal propagation or the loss of degrees of freedom by treating the system as an Effective Field Theory expanded in powers of the background field strength. By introducing specific operators, we show that algebraic consistency can be restored perturbatively for arbitrary $g$-factors.

Abstract: In this paper we study solutions to massive Type IIA supergravity which we propose are dual to co-dimension 2 monodromy defects in 6d (1,0) CFTs realised in NS5-D6-D8 brane systems, as well as in the 5d Sp(N) fixed point theory. In the first case the defects are studied holographically as solutions to 7d $U(1)$ gauged supergravity that asymptote locally to its maximally supersymmetric $\text{AdS}_7$ vacuum away from the defects. In the second case they are dual to solutions to 6d $U(1)^2$ gauged supergravity that asymptote to its maximally supersymmetric $\text{AdS}_6$ vacuum. These solutions are then uplifted to massive Type IIA supergravity using known consistent truncations previously constructed in the literature. We compute the defect entanglement entropy and provide evidence that for the 3d defects, the entanglement entropy can be written as a linear combination of the free energy and conformal weight of the defect. Finally, we construct new co-dimension 2 monodromy defects in 6d and 5d CFTs compactified on Riemann surfaces and/or spindles.

Abstract: We analyze entanglement generated by the Schwinger effect using a mode-by-mode formalism for scalar and spinor QED in constant backgrounds. Starting from thermal initial states, we derive compact, closed-form results for bipartite entanglement between particle-antiparticle partners in terms of the Bogoliubov coefficients. For bosons, thermal fluctuations enhance production but suppress quantum correlations: the logarithmic negativity is nonzero only below a (mode-dependent) critical temperature $T_c$. At fixed $T$, entanglement appears only above a critical field $E_{\text{crit,entang}}$. For fermions, we observe a qualitatively different pattern: at finite $T$ entanglement exists only within a finite window $E_{\text{min}} < E < E_{\text{max}}$, with a temperature-independent optimal field strength $E_{*}$ that maximizes the logarithmic negativity. Entanglement is vanishing above $T_{\text{max}}=ω/\text{arcsinh}(1)$. We give quantitative estimates for analog experiments, where our entanglement criteria convert directly into concrete temperature and electric field constraints. These findings identify realistic regimes where the quantum character of Schwinger physics may be tested in the laboratory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Cosmological perturbations generated during inflation exhibit striking quantum features, including entanglement and high circuit complexity. Yet their observational signatures remain effectively indistinguishable from classical stochastic variables. We quantify this tension by showing that quantum inflationary perturbations are continuous variable stabilizer states with vanishing quantum magic, a necessary resource for universal quantum computation as measured by Wigner negativity. Consequently, despite their quantum origins and description, these states can be efficiently simulated using classical algorithms. We further show that the Wigner negativity arising from primordial non-Gaussianity is suppressed not only by the non-linearity parameter $f_{NL}$, but also by the exponential squeezing of the perturbations. Viewing the early universe as a "high complexity, low magic" regime provides another perspective of what it means for the origin of structure in the universe to be "quantum."

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Holographic entanglement entropy for Lorentzian entanglement wedge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a concrete computation in holography, specifically regarding the computation of the bracket between the HRT area and the boundary stress tensor under a kink transformation. This provides evidence for the proposed kink transformation statement.

Method: The authors performed a computation involving the representation of the boundary stress tensor in terms of initial data on the Cauchy surface under holographic renormalization and then computed the bracket between the HRT area and the boundary stress tensor. The computation for the bracket requires inverting a certain matrix, which isn't explicitly detailed in the abstract but presumably was handled in the full paper. They compared their results with those of arXiv:2203.04270, finding agreement.

Result: The result matches the corresponding result from arXiv:2203.04270, which supports the kink transformation statement.

Conclusion: The authors therefore provide further support of the kink transformation statement by redoing the computation based on the expression of stress tensor and matching it with the existing literature.

Abstract: It is stated that the action of the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) area, which is viewed as an observable, generates a kink transformation in gravity. In this paper, we provide a further support for the kink transformation statement by performing a relevant computation. Specifically, by acting the kink transformation to the boundary stress tensor, we compute the bracket between the HRT area with the boundary stress tensor. Here we represent the boundary stress tensor in terms of initial data on the Cauchy surface under holographic renormalization. Our computation reproduces the same result as the one in arXiv:2203.04270 derived from a different approach.

Abstract: In 2507.17558, we provide a map from a scalar theory on $(D+2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime to a scalar theory with a continuous mass spectrum on $(D+1)$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime, and propose a link between celestial amplitudes and cosmological correlators (the cosmological-celestial dictionary). We extend the construction to fields with spin 1 and 2, and find that massless spin fields map to spin fields with continuous mass spectra. In this construction, we identify the de Sitter counterparts of the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the asymptotic symmetries in Minkowski spacetime. For $U(1)$ gauge theories, the counterpart is restricted to the massless sector within the continuous Proca spectrum, while for linearized gravity supertranslations are encoded in the partially massless sector and superrotations in the strictly massless sector. Using the identification, we reveal that the associated Ward-Takahashi identities of the cosmological correlators reproduce the conformally soft photon and graviton theorems via the cosmological-celestial dictionary. In particular, the celestial stress tensor is derived from the asymptotic limit of gravitons in de Sitter spacetime.

Abstract: This work explores the possibility that five-dimensional primordial rotating black holes could account for all, or a significant portion, of the dark matter in our universe. Our analysis is performed within the context of the ``dark dimension'' scenario, a theoretical consequence of the Swampland Program that predicts a single micron-scale extra dimension to explain the observed value of dark energy. We demonstrate that within this scenario, the mass loss of a primordial rotating black hole sensitive to the fifth dimension is significantly slower than that of its four-dimensional counterpart. Consequently, primordial black holes with an initial mass of $M\gtrsim 10^{10}$g can survive to the present day and potentially constitute the dominant form of dark matter. Finally, we investigate the memory burden effect and find that it dramatically prolongs the lifetime of five-dimensional rotating primordial black holes, making them compelling candidates for all the dark matter in the universe.

Abstract: In critical loop models, we define diagonal boundaries as boundaries that couple to diagonal fields only. Using analytic bootstrap methods, we show that diagonal boundaries are characterised by one complex parameter, analogous to the boundary cosmological constant in Liouville theory. We determine disc 1-point functions, and write an explicit formula for disc 2-point functions as infinite combinations of conformal blocks. For a discrete subset of values of the boundary parameter, the boundary spectrum becomes discrete, and made of degenerate representations. In such cases, we check our results by numerically bootstrapping disc 2-point functions. We sketch the interpretation of diagonal and non-diagonal boundaries in lattice loop models. In particular, a loop can neither end on a diagonal boundary, nor change weight when it touches it. In bulk-to-boundary OPEs, numbers of legs can be conserved, or increase by even numbers.

Abstract: We study the finite temperature Casimir effect for parallel plates in the $κ$-Minkowski space-time. Using the Matsubara formalism and imposing the Dirichlet boundary conditions on a massless $κ$-scalar field, we compute the $κ$-deformed corrections to thermal Casimir free energy, pressure, entropy, and internal energy. Our results demonstrate that space-time non-commutativity enhances the attractive nature of the thermal Casimir force while preserving thermodynamic consistency; the system satisfies the Nernst theorem and laws of thermodynamics remain intact in $κ$-deformed space-time. Our analysis yields an upper bound on the deformation parameter as $a\leq10^{-18}m$. Furthermore, our results indicate that non-commutative effects become experimentally observable in Casimir effect studies when the ratio of the non-commutative scale to plate separation satisfies $a/L\leq 10^{-12}$. We also obtain the expression for Stefan-Boltzmann's law in $κ$-Minkowski space-time.

Abstract: In this paper we consider 4d $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theories with $N+1$ fundamentals, five antifundamentals and a conjugate two index antisymmetric tensor. The model has been shown to be in a mixed phase in the IR, splitting in an interacting non-Abelian Coulomb phase and a free magnetic phase. Through tensor deconfinement, we show that baryonic deformations lead to a non-Abelian free magnetic phase. Along the analysis we obtain a duality with symplectic SQCD that can be further reduced to 3d and 2d. In the 3d case the analysis of the three sphere partition function allows one to obtain dualities between $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ with a two index symmetric tensor and $\mathrm{SO}(N)$ theories. On the other hand, in 2d we recover dualities already known in the literature and propose new ones between special unitary and symplectic gauge theories.

Method: We used Ehrhart polynomials and Symanzik graph polynomials to identify and classify the relevant polytopes, employing a direct combinatorial search for graphs with up to ten edges and nine loops.

Result: Only a limited number of reflexive and Fano polytopes were found—two 2D, three 3D reflexive, and four 3D Fano. Notably, one-loop $N$-gon integrals linked to degenerate Calabi-Yau varieties were identified.

Conclusion: This research bridges the gap between high-energy physics, algebraic geometry, and number theory by highlighting intricate structures in quasi-finite Feynman integrals and their geometric implications.

Abstract: We classify the Fano and reflexive polytopes that arise from quasi-finite Feynman integrals. These polytopes appear as scaled Minkowski sums of the Newton polytopes associated with the Symanzik graph polynomials. For one-loop graphs and multiloop sunset graphs, we identify the Fano and reflexive cases by computing the number of interior points from the associated bivariate Ehrhart polynomials. More generally, we utilize the properties of Symanzik polynomials and their symmetries to conduct a direct search over all Feynman graphs in generic kinematics with up to ten edges and nine loops. We find that such cases are remarkably sparse: for example, we find only two two-dimensional reflexive polytopes, three three-dimensional reflexive polytopes, and four three-dimensional Fano polytopes. We also reveal a surprising feature of one-loop $N$-gon integrals in higher dimensions: their associated reflexive polytopes encode degenerate Calabi--Yau $(N-2)$-folds. We further analyze the geometric structures encoded by these polytopes and exhibit explicit connections with del Pezzo surfaces, $K3$ surfaces, and Calabi--Yau threefolds. Since reflexive polytopes naturally correspond to Calabi--Yau varieties, our classification demonstrates that quasi-finite Feynman integrals, with reflexive polytopes, are intrinsically linked to Calabi--Yau period integrals.

### [91] [Haagerup Symmetry in $(E_8)_1$?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08225)
*Jan Albert,Yamato Honda,Justin Kaidi,Yunqin Zheng*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper explores the symmetries and conformal embeddings related to chiral and non-chiral WZW models, specifically focusing on $(	tfont{e}_8)_1$, $(E_8)_1$, $(G_2)_1$, and $(F_4)_1$ models, along with the Haagerup symmetry $	l h_3$ with central charge $c=8$, and $	l h_1$ with $c=2,6$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors investigate the structure and symmetries of various WZW models related to the chiral $	ext{W}_3$ algebra and other related conformal field theories.

Method: The authors employ analytic continuation techniques and modular bootstrap methods to classify the symmetries and deduce the conformal embeddings and dualities between the models.

Result: The paper establishes the presence of Haagerup symmetry $	l h_3$ in the chiral $(	tfont{e}_8)_1$ theory and $	l h_1$ in the non-chiral $(E_8)_1$ model. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that gauging the diagonal symmetry of these models yields new conformal field theories with enhanced symmetry groups, including $	l h_3$ symmetry at $c=8$ and $	l h_1$ symmetry at $c=2,6$.

Conclusion: This work provides new insights into the symmetry structures and conformal embeddings of WZW models, with implications for the classification of two-dimensional conformal field theories and potential connections to quantum gravity models like the $c=24$ moonshine VOA.

Abstract: We suggest that the chiral $(\mathfrak{e}_8)_1$ theory -- in many senses the simplest VOA -- may have Haagerup symmetry $\mathcal{H}_i$ for $i=1,2,3$. Likewise, we suggest that the non-chiral $(E_8)_1$ WZW model may have $\mathcal{H}_i \times \mathcal{H}_i^\textrm{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives a $c=8$ theory with $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{H}_3)$ symmetry, which is the theory predicted in \cite{Evans:2010yr}. Along the way, we show that $(E_8)_1$ also has a $\mathrm{Fib} \times \mathrm{Fib}^\text{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives the $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1$ WZW model, explaining the well-known conformal embedding $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1 \subset (E_8)_1$. Finally, we suggest a relation to theories with $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry at $c=2,6$, complimenting the discussion with new modular bootstrap results.

Abstract: We explore a continuum theory of multicritical dynamical triangulations and causal dynamical triangulations in two-dimensional quantum gravity from the perspective of the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion. The former model lacks a causal time direction and is governed by the two-reduced $W^{(3)}$ algebra, whereas the latter model possesses a causal time direction and is governed by the full $W^{(3)}$ algebra. We show that the topological recursion solves the Schwinger-Dyson equations for both models, and we explicitly compute several amplitudes.

Abstract: We review several lines of evidence for a 12d interpretation of the type IIB brane solutions and effective actions. The axio-dilaton sector fits naturally into 12d gravity, as supported by brane geometries and supersymmetry. The special role of the D3 brane in a potential 12d interpretation of type IIB is reviewed, with emphasis on the connection between its SL(2, Z) self-duality and worldvolume electromagnetic duality. Whether the higher-derivative corrections of type IIB admit a 12d interpretation is discussed, and we suggest certain directions for future exploration.

Abstract: We study three Type II supergravity solutions which are holographically dual to codimension-2 supersymmetric defects in $(p+1)$-dimensional SU($N$) maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills ($p=2,3,4$). In all of these cases, the defects have a non-trivial monodromy for the maximal abelian subgroup for the SO($9-p$) R-symmetry. Such solutions are obtained by considering branes wrapping spindle configurations, changing the parameters (which alters the coordinate domain), and imposing suitable boundary conditions. We provide a prescription to compute the entanglement entropy of the effective theory on the defect. We find the resulting quantity to be proportional to the free energy of the ambient theory. Similar analysis is performed for the D5-brane wrapping a spindle, but we find that changing the coordinate domain does not lead to a defect solution, but rather a circle compactification.

Abstract: We use a combination of perturbation theory, holography, supersymmetric localization, integrability, and numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain the energy-energy correlator in $\text{SU}(N_c)$ ${\mathcal N}=4$ SYM at finite coupling. For finite $N_c$, we derive lower bounds on the second and fourth multipoles of the energy-energy correlator at different couplings, along with a smeared energy-energy correlator as a function of the angle between the two detectors. We present evidence that our lower bounds on the multipoles are nearly saturated by the ${\cal N} = 4$ SYM theory. In the planar limit, we further use dispersive functionals to obtain tight two-sided bounds on both the first three non-trivial multipoles and on the angular dependence of the energy-energy correlator. As the coupling is varied from weak to strong, the energy-energy correlator exhibits a transition from single-trace to double-trace operator dominance in the collinear limit, which we characterize quantitatively. A similar phenomenon occurs in QCD, where a parton-hadron transition is observed as detectors are brought closer together.

Abstract: We study the properties imposed by microcausality and positivity on the retarded two-point Green's function in a theory with spontaneous breaking of Lorentz invariance. We assume invariance under time and spatial translations, so that the Green's function $G$ depends on $ω$ and $\vec k$. We discuss that in Fourier space microcausality is equivalent to the analyticity of $G$ when $\Im (ω,\vec k)$ lies in the forward light-cone, supplemented by bounds on the growth of $G$ as one approaches the boundaries of this domain. Microcausality also implies that the imaginary part of $G$ (its spectral density) cannot have compact support for real $(ω,\vec k)$. Using analyticity, we write multi-variable dispersion relations and show that the spectral density must satisfy a family of integral constraints. Analogous constraints can be applied to the fluctuations of the system, via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A stable physical system, which can only absorb energy from external sources, satisfies $ω\cdot \Im G(ω,\vec k) \ge 0$ for real $(ω,\vec k)$. We show that this positivity property can be extended to the complex domain: $\Im [ω\, G(ω,\vec k)] >0$ in the domain of analyticity guaranteed by microcausality. Functions with this property belong to the Herglotz-Nevanlinna class. This allows to prove the analyticity of the permittivities $ε(ω,k)$ and $μ^{-1}(ω,k)$ that appear in Maxwell equations in a medium. We verify the above properties in several examples where Lorentz invariance is broken by a background field, e.g. non-zero chemical potential, or non-zero temperature. We study subtracted dispersion relations when the assumption $G \to 0$ at infinity must be relaxed.

Abstract: In this work, we initiate the study of light-ray operators in four-dimensional de Sitter space focusing on null integrals of the stress tensor. In Minkowski space, the null integral of the stress tensor unifies several ostensibly different constructions, functioning simultaneously as the energy flux operator, the angular contribution to a conserved charge, the averaged null energy operator, and the light transform of the stress tensor. However, we show that the de Sitter analogs of these various interpretations do not necessarily coincide but rather lead to distinct, observer-dependent light-ray operators. We construct four such de Sitter analogs and analyze their matrix elements in a free, conformally coupled scalar theory, showing that they exhibit the expected symmetry and positivity properties.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the renormalized energy--momentum tensor of a quantized charged scalar field in three-dimensional de Sitter spacetime $\mathrm{dS}_{3}$ under the influence of a uniform electric field. Using the adiabatic regularization method, we systematically remove ultraviolet divergences and obtain explicit finite expressions for the components of the induced energy--momentum tensor. The numerical analysis demonstrates that the renormalized tensor behaves smoothly with respect to the parameters of the system and exhibits physically consistent limits in both the strong-field and infrared regimes. The induced energy density grows with the field strength and follows a quadratic behavior, which is consistent with the Schwinger mechanism in three dimension. In the opposite infrared regime, the tensor components display inverse-mass dependence, revealing infrared divergences typical of nearly massless scalar fields in curved space. Finally, we evaluate the trace of the renormalized tensor and show that for a massless, conformally coupled scalar field the trace anomaly vanishes, confirming the absence of a genuine Weyl anomaly in odd-dimensional spacetimes. These results provide a consistent and covariant description of quantum vacuum polarization and backreaction effects in three-dimensional de Sitter geometry.

Abstract: Gravitons naturally acquire topological masses in the 3d topologically massive gravity (TMG) theory that includes the gravitational Chern-Simons term. We present a covariant formulation of the TMG theory by introducing an unphysical dilaton field through the conformal transformation. We conduct the BRST quantization of the covariant TMG theory, which reduces to the conventional TMG in the unitary gauge. We demonstrate that this covariant TMG theory conserves the physical degrees of freedom (DoF) in the massless limit, under which the physical massive graviton becomes an unphysical massless graviton and its physical DoF is converted to the massless dilaton. With these, we newly establish a topological gravity equivalence theorem (TGRET), which connects each scattering amplitude of physical gravitons to the corresponding dilaton scattering amplitude in the high energy limit. The TGRET provides a general mechanism to guarantee all the large energy cancellations in any massive graviton scattering amplitudes. Applying the TGRET and using the generalized gravitational power counting rule, we prove that the $N$-point massive graviton amplitudes ($N\geqslant 4$) have striking energy cancellations by powers proportional to $\frac{5}{2}N$ ($\frac{7}{2}N$) in the Landau (unitary) gauge. This explains the large energy cancellations of $E^{11}\to E^1$ (Landau gauge) and $E^{12}\to E^1$ (unitary gauge) for the four graviton amplitudes. We compute the four-point graviton (dilaton) amplitudes and explicitly demonstrate the TGRET and these large energy cancellations. With the extended massive double-copy approach, we systematically construct the graviton (dilaton) scattering amplitudesin the TMG theory from the corresponding gauge boson (adjoint scalar) amplitudes in the topologically massive Yang-Mills theory.

Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) concept provides a necessary tool for obtaining general predictions of low-energy theory valid below its unitarity-breaking scale (cutoff scale). Early Universe inflation and subsequent reheating could be a unique setup for testing potentially observable effects coming from the derivative expansion of the corresponding EFT around the flat space vacuum. In this work, we consider an EFT describing perturbative reheating dominated by the decay of inflaton to photons caused by the dimension-5 operator $φF_{μν} F^{μν}$. We compute the graviton production during reheating and high frequency gravitational wave signal due to the bremsstrahlung effect in the presence of $R_{μνλρ}F^{μν} F^{λρ}$ operator. It may lead to the dominant contribution at high momenta if the EFT cutoff is lower than the Planck mass. Assuming the general consequences of the unitarity and causality constraints, which imply that all EFT operators should be present, and be suppressed by the scales following from the dimension analysis, we obtain the observational constraints (CMB bound for the dark radiation) on the mass of the inflaton and UV cutoff of gravity. We find that for the typical parameters of large field inflation models, the gravitational cutoff scale cannot be lower than $10^{15}$ GeV.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of an isotropic, planar AdS black hole charged under a pair of two-form gauge potentials. We prove that long wavelength, small amplitude perturbations of this state are governed by the relativistic theory of viscoelastic hydrodynamics. We use this effective theory to identify instabilities in certain regions of parameter space, and show that the dominant instability is always driven by fluctuations of an incoherent density of the higher-form charge. The spacetime we study also arises as a solution to gravity coupled to a pair of massless scalar fields, where part of its dynamics is governed by a simpler effective theory of heat diffusion. We derive this simpler description directly from viscoelastic hydrodynamics, demonstrating that the heat diffusion mode is the collective excitation of the viscoelastic fluid under no-flux boundary conditions.

Abstract: We compute solutions to the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations on holomorphic vector bundles $V$ via an alternating optimisation procedure founded on geometric machine learning. The proposed method is fully general with respect to the rank and structure group of $V$, requiring only the ability to enumerate a basis of global sections for a given bundle. This enables us to compute the physically normalised Yukawa couplings in a broad class of heterotic string compactifications. Using this method, we carry out this computation in full for a heterotic compactification incorporating a gauge bundle with non-Abelian structure group.

Abstract: We consider correlators smeared against directed wavepackets over a thermal state dual to a single-sided planar AdS black hole. In the large frequency limit, our measurement is simplified using a bulk WKB description. We propose a dictionary that maps the action of smeared boundary operators to flat-space oscillators near an interior bulk point on the thermal state, by analytically continuing late-time operators from the right to the left boundary via an integral transform. Using the dictionary the smeared correlator factorizes to a flat-space like scattering amplitude about the interior event. Our transformed correlators describe local physics in the two-sided black hole interior, while incurring a suppression of $\mathcal{O}(e^{-βω/ 2})$. These measurements necessitate a non-trivial time ordering of operators living on boundary hyperboloids which are causally connected to the past light cone of the bulk point, as well as on a corresponding future branch.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of boundaries subject to conformal boundary conditions, in which the conformal class of the boundary metric is kept fixed. In Einstein gravity, the trace of the extrinsic curvature is also fixed at the boundary. Here we generalize this boundary condition with the appropriate higher curvature correction. We study the problem both in Euclidean and Lorentzian signature. In Euclidean signature, we show that, similarly to the Einstein gravity case, the entropy at large temperatures exhibits the behavior of a conformal field theory in one lower dimension. We also show that in the flat space limit, the higher curvature corrections do not contribute to the leading behavior at high temperatures. We conjecture that this result is a universal feature of the flat space limit in the presence of conformal boundaries. We test our conjecture by analyzing charged black holes. In Lorentzian signature, we analyze the dynamics of the boundary Weyl factor in black hole backgrounds at the linearized level.

Abstract: Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified framework for characterizing useful quantum phenomena subject to physical constraints, but are notoriously hard to assess in experimental systems. In this letter, we introduce a unified protocol for quantifying the resource-generating power (RGP) of arbitrary quantum evolutions applicable to multiple QRTs. It is based on deep thermalization (DT), which has recently gained attention for its role in the emergence of quantum state designs from partial projective measurements. Central to our approach is the use of projected ensembles, recently employed to probe DT, together with new twirling identities that allow us to directly infer the RGP of the underlying dynamics. These identities further reveal how resources build up and thermalize in generic quantum circuits. Finally, we show that quantum resources themselves undergo deep thermalization at the subsystem level, offering a complementary and another experimentally accessible route to infer the RGP. Our work connects deep thermalization to resource quantification, offering a new perspective on the essential role of various resources in generating state designs.

Abstract: We develop a novel framework to engineer persistent oscillatory modes in Markovian open quantum systems governed by a time-independent Lindblad master equation. We show that oscillatory modes can be created when the Hamiltonian and jump operator can be expressed in the same block-diagonal form. A key feature of the framework is that the dissipator of the Lindblad master equation are generally non-zero. We identify the weak and strong conditions, where the onset of the oscillatory modes is dependent and independent of the parameters of the system, respectively. Our method extends beyond the typical decoherence-free subspace approach, in which the dissipator is zero. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework using various models, showing how carefully tailored system-environment interactions can produce sustained coherent oscillations.

Abstract: We develop a bottom-up, statistics-first framework in which the full probabilistic content of an operational theory is encoded in its matrix of conditional outcome probabilities of events (COPE). Within this setting, five model classes (preGPTs, GPTs, quasiprobabilistic, ontological, and noncontextual ontological) are unified as constrained factorizations of the COPE matrix. We identify equirank factorizations as the structural core of GPTs and noncontextual ontological models and establish their relation to tomographic completeness. This yields a simple, model-agnostic criterion for noncontextuality: an operational theory admits a noncontextual ontological model if and only if its COPE matrix admits an equirank nonnegative matrix factorization (ENMF). Failure of the equirank condition in all ontological models therefore establishes contextuality. We operationalize rank separation via two complementary methods provided by the linear-algebraic framework. First, we use ENMF to interpret noncontextual ontological models as nested polytopes. This allows us to establish that the boxworld operational theory is ontologically contextual. Second, we apply techniques from discrete mathematics to derive a lower bound on the ontological dimensionality of COPE matrices exhibiting sparsity patterns, and use this bound to establish a new proof that a discrete version of qubit theory exhibits ontological contextuality. By reframing contextuality as a problem in matrix analysis, our work provides a unified structure for its systematic study and opens new avenues for exploring nonclassical resources.

Abstract: The search for exotic temporal orders in quantum matter, such as discrete quasi-time crystals (DQTCs), has become an important theme in nonequilibrium physics. However, realizing these phases has so far required complex protocols, such as drives with multiple incommensurate frequencies. Here, we present a significantly simpler mechanism: the emergence of DQTCs in a dissipative collective spin system subjected to only a single periodic drive. Remarkably, the characteristic frequencies of this novel phase are not fixed but can be continuously tuned by varying the strength of the drive. Even more strikingly, this tunability is punctuated by Arnold tongues, within which the response main frequency locks to rational fractions of the drive. Our model further provides a unified framework that also encompasses stationary, discrete time crystals and chaotic phases. This discovery simplifies the requirements for generating complex temporal orders and opens a viable route towards the experimental control and manipulation of quasi-time crystalline matter.

This framework represents a step forwards in analyzing and reducing system-scale losses in a spin-photon interface.

Motivation: The thesis focuses on quantum information and computation, highlighting the role of discrete structures in understanding quantumness.

Method: The author presents work in three categories: contextuality with graphs/hypergraphs, causality with directed graphs, and measurement incompatibility with hypergraphs.

Result: Various contributions include Kochen-Specker contextuality, generalized contextuality, causal models, and incompatibility studies.

Conclusion: Future work is suggested to address broader quantum phenomena not yet covered.

Abstract: Quantum theory departs from classical probabilistic theories in foundational ways. These departures--termed quantumness here--power quantum information and computation. This thesis charts the role of discrete structures in assessing quantumness, synthesizing elements of my postdoctoral research through this lens. After an introduction to the necessary background concepts, I present my work under three broad categories. First, I present work on contextuality that extensively relies on (undirected) graphs and hypergraphs as the discrete structures of interest; more specifically, it relies on invariants associated with them. This work includes Kochen-Specker (KS) contextuality and its operationalization to generalized contextuality, expressed via (hyper)graph-theoretic frameworks. I also present work on KS-contextuality in multiqubit systems and an application of generalized contextuality to a one-shot communication task, both of which rely on hypergraphs. Second, I present work on causality, where the discrete structures of interest are directed graphs. This includes work on indefinite causal order, specifically its connections to the gap between local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and separable operations (SEP), and a device-independent notion of nonclassicality--termed antinomicity--that generalizes Bell nonlocality without global causal assumptions. Finally, I present work on the incompatibility of quantum measurements, its connection to Bell nonlocality, and its role in discriminating between quantum and almost quantum correlations in the single-system setting. The discrete structures of interest here are hypergraphs that model joint measurability relations between quantum measurements. I conclude with a summary and an overview of work that is not covered in this thesis.

Abstract: The investigation of biomolecular interactions at the single-molecule level has emerged as a pivotal research area in life science, particularly through optical, mechanical, and electrochemical approaches. Spins existing widely in biological systems, offer a unique degree of freedom for detecting such interactions. However, most previous studies have been largely confined to ensemble-level detection in the spin degree. Here, we developed a molecular interaction analysis method approaching single-molecule level based on relaxometry using the quantum sensor, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Experiments utilized an optimized diamond surface functionalized with a polyethylenimine nanogel layer, achieving $\sim$10 nm average protein distance and mitigating interfacial steric hindrance. Then we measured the strong interaction between streptavidin and spin-labeled biotin complexes, as well as the weak interaction between bovine serum albumin and biotin complexes, at both the micrometer scale and nanoscale. For the micrometer-scale measurements using ensemble NV centers, we re-examined the often-neglected fast relaxation component and proposed a relaxation rate evaluation method, substantially enhancing the measurement sensitivity. Furthermore, we achieved nanoscale detection approaching single-molecule level using single NV centers. This methodology holds promise for applications in molecular screening, identification and kinetic studies at the single-molecule level, offering critical insights into molecular function and activity mechanisms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of highly sensitive magnetic resonance sensors at the single-molecule level with advanced surface properties is a challenging goal in structural biology and materials science. The proximity of these sensors to target molecules and their application in life sciences like Fomblin require extreme robustness against surface induced perturbations and biocompatible spectral ranges.

Method: The authors demonstrate that the PL6 quantum defect in 4H-SiC can function as a robust near-infrared spin sensor. They achieve this by using shallow PL6 centers to detect proton spins in immersion oil and fluorine spins in Fomblin, achieving a detection volume of (3 nm)^3 with single-proton sensitivity.

Result: The key results include the development of sensors with near-infrared operation, nanoscale stability, and sensitivity sufficient for single-proton detection. These sensors exhibit exceptional performance in terms of robustness and applicability for probing molecular interactions and dynamics in various environments.

Conclusion: This breakthrough opens new possibilities for applications in nanoscale magnetic resonance spectroscopy, particularly for studying low-dimensional water phases, protein folding dynamics, and molecular interactions in challenging environments.

Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at the single-molecule level with atomic resolution holds transformative potential for structural biology and surface chemistry. Near-surface solid-state spin sensors with optical readout ability offer a promising pathway toward this goal. However, their extreme proximity to target molecules demands exceptional robustness against surface-induced perturbations. Furthermore, life science applications require these sensors to operate in biocompatible spectral ranges that minimize photodamage. In this work, we demonstrate that the PL6 quantum defect in 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) can serve as a robust near-infrared spin sensor. This sensor operates at tissue-transparent wavelengths and exhibits exceptional near-surface stability even at depth of 2 nm. Using shallow PL6 centers, we achieve nanoscale NMR detection of proton ($\mathrm{^{1}H}$) spins in immersion oil and fluorine ($\mathrm{^{19}F}$) spins in Fomblin, attaining a detection volume of $\mathrm{(3~nm)^3}$ and a sensitivity reaching the requirement for single-proton spin detection. This work establishes 4H-SiC quantum sensors as a compelling platform for nanoscale magnetic resonance, with promising applications in probing low-dimensional water phases, protein folding dynamics, and molecular interactions.

Abstract: The optomagnonic coupling between magnons and optical photons is an essential component for building remote quantum networks based on magnonics. Here we show that such a coupling, manifested as the magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering, can be exploited to entangle two propagating optical fields. The protocol employs two pairs of the whispering gallery modes coupled to the same magnon mode in a YIG sphere. In each pair a strong pump field is applied to activate either Stokes or anti-Stokes scattering. Due to the magnon mode involving in the two scattering processes and as a mediation, Stokes and anti-Stokes photons of different polarizations get entangled. The entanglement can be extracted by filtering the travelling output fields centered at the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands. Optimal conditions are identified under which strong output entanglement can be achieved.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses the limitations of conventional quantum sensors due to spatial gradients in control fields and proposes a method to optimize spin subsets for improved sensitivity, demonstrating significant enhancements and the feasibility of extending quantum sensing to heterogeneous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of achieving standard-quantum-limit sensitivity in quantum sensors, highlighting the issue of spatial gradients and proposing innovative solutions to enhance performance.

Method: The authors derive an analytic expression for ensemble sensitivity in inhomogeneous spin sensors, define sensitivity thresholds to identify optimal spin subsets, and validate their approach using both pulsed and continuous-wave magnetometry. They also describe the implementation of phase-only digital holography to realize these optimal subsets and assess the impact of residual aberrations.

Result: The study demonstrates that the optimal subsets can improve sensitivity by up to a tenfold compared to conventional schemes. Additionally, the use of phase-only digital holography shows that residual aberrations have a minimal impact, adding less than 1 dB of sensitivity loss. The framework presented in the paper does not introduce any fundamental trade-offs and broadens the application scope of quantum sensing to more complex, heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: The research provides a comprehensive solution to the sensitivity limitations in quantum sensors by optimizing spin subsets, thereby advancing the field of quantum sensing and expanding its practical applications to environments with non-uniform conditions.

Abstract: Finite drive power leaves unavoidable spatial gradients in control fields, preventing spin ensembles from reaching the standard-quantum-limit sensitivity. We derive an analytic expression of ensemble sensitivity for inhomogeneous spin sensors and introduce sensitivity thresholds that reveal the optimal spin subset. Applied to both pulsed and continuous-wave magnetometry, the optimal subsets deliver up to a tenfold improvement over conventional schemes relying on nominally uniform regions of the ensembles. We demonstrate phase-only digital holography to implement the optimal subsets and show that residual aberrations add less than 1 dB of sensitivity loss. Our framework imposes no fundamental trade-offs and extends quantum sensing to heterogeneous sensing environments.

Abstract: The upper bounds for the rate of fluctuation growth of an observable in both open and closed quantum systems have been studied actively recently. In our recent work we showed that the rate of fluctuation growth for an observable in a closed quantum system is upper bounded by the fluctuation of its corresponding velocity-like observable. That bound also indicated a tradeoff between the time derivatives of the mean and the standard deviation. In this paper we will look at open quantum systems in two cases. For the first case we find the generator of evolution for an open system employing both the Taylor expansion and the standard time-ordered evolution via the Dyson series, while in the second case we consider no specific information about the evolution of the system. We then find the rate of fluctuation growth in each case. Comparing the upper bounds for each case and considering the upper bound found for a closed system suggest that including more details by separating the contributions of the system and state dynamics seems to result in looser bounds for the rate of fluctuation growth.

Abstract: Silicon spin qubits are a promising candidate for quantum computing, thanks to their high coherence, high controllability and manufacturability. However, the most scalable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) based implementations have so far been limited to a few qubits. Here, to take a step towards large scale systems, we tune and coherently control an eight-dot linear array of silicon spin qubits fabricated in 300 mm CMOS-compatible foundry process, establishing operational scalability beyond the two-qubit regime. All eight qubits are successfully tuned and characterized as four double dot pairs, exhibiting Ramsey dephasing times $T_2^*$ up to 41(2) $μ$s and Hahn-echo coherence times $T_2^{\mathrm{Hahn}}$ up to 1.31(4) ms. Readout of the central four qubits is achieved via a cascaded charge-sensing protocol, enabling simultaneous high-fidelity measurements of the entire multi-qubit array. Additionally, we demonstrate a two-qubit gate operation between adjacent qubits with low phase noise. We demonstrate here that we can scale silicon spin qubit arrays to medium-sized arrays of 8 qubits while maintaining coherence of the system.

Abstract: A critical aspect of next-generation wireless networks is the integration of quantum communications to guard against quantum computing threats to classical networks. Despite successful experimental demonstrations, integrating quantum communications into the classical infrastructure faces substantial challenges, including high costs, compatibility issues, and extra hardware deployment to accommodate both classical and quantum communication equipment. To mitigate these challenges, we explore novel protocols that enable simultaneous classical and quantum communications, relying on a single set of transceivers to jointly modulate and decode classical and quantum information onto the same signal. Additionally, we emphasize extending quantum communication capabilities beyond traditional optical bands into the terahertz, even possibly to millimeter-wave and microwave frequencies, thereby broadening the potential horizon of quantum-secure applications. Finally, we identify open problems that must be addressed to facilitate practical implementation.

Abstract: Light-injection attacks pose critical security threats to quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Conventional defense methods, such as isolators, filters, and optical power monitoring, are confronted with the threats of specific attacks and the limitations in integration. To address this, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an integrated attack sensing and automatic response unit utilizing the photorefractive effect in a thin-film lithium niobate microring resonator. Our unit provides a high rejection ratio against non-resonant injected light. For resonant attacks exceeding tens of microwatts, the unit can autonomously attenuate the transmission of the quantum signal light, leading to a significant suppression of the secret key rate. This work enhances the security of QKD systems against light-injection attacks by providing a highly sensitive, broadband, and on-chip defense mechanism.

However, under acceleration, the Unruh effect can degrade quantum correlations, raising questions about the reliability of QMA-EUR in such settings. Here, we investigate the QMA-EUR for two uniformly accelerating Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a massless scalar field. Using the Kossakowski-Lindblad master equation, we calculate the entropic uncertainty, its lower bound, and the tightness of the relation under different Unruh temperatures. We find that acceleration does not always increase the lower bound on the uncertainty relation. Depending on the initial correlations between the detectors, it may either increase or decrease. This behavior results from the interplay between quantum discord and minimal missing information. Interestingly, a higher quantum discord does not necessarily lead to lower uncertainty.

Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian states appear ubiquitously in quantum optics and condensed matter physics but remain difficult to simulate classically due to the hafnian bottleneck. We present an efficient algorithm that converts pure bosonic Gaussian states into matrix product states (MPSs), with a computational cost governed solely by the entanglement and not by the number of bosonic modes. Our method combines a Gaussian singular value decomposition with a projected-creation-operator mapping that constructs local MPS tensors without computing hafnians. Benchmarking on covariance matrices from the Jiuzhang 2.0 and Jiuzhang 4.0 Gaussian boson sampling experiments demonstrates substantial speedups over previous tensor-network approaches in the low-entanglement regime relevant to lossy devices. The method provides a scalable classical simulation framework for bosonic Gaussian states with limited entanglement and extends the applicability of MPS-based methods to a broad range of bosonic systems.

Abstract: Quantum process tomography, the task of estimating an unknown quantum channel, is a central problem in quantum information theory and a key primitive for characterising noisy quantum devices. A long-standing open question is to determine the optimal number of uses of an unknown channel required to learn it in diamond distance, the standard measure of worst-case distinguishability between quantum processes. Here we show that a quantum channel acting on a $d$-dimensional system can be estimated to accuracy $\varepsilon$ in diamond distance using $O(d^4/\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses. This scaling is essentially optimal, as it matches lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis extends to channels with input and output dimensions $d_{\mathrm{in}}$ and $d_{\mathrm{out}}$ and Kraus rank at most $k$, for which $O(d_{\mathrm{in}} d_{\mathrm{out}} k/\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses suffice, interpolating between unitary and fully generic channels. As by-products, we obtain, to the best of our knowledge, the first essentially optimal strategies for operator-norm learning of binary POVMs and isometries, and we recover optimal trace-distance tomography for fixed-rank states. Our approach consists of using the channel only non-adaptively to prepare copies of the Choi state, purify them in parallel, perform sample-optimal pure-state tomography on the purifications, and analyse the resulting estimator directly in diamond distance via its semidefinite-program characterisation. While the sample complexity of state tomography in trace distance is by now well understood, our results finally settle the corresponding problem for quantum channels in diamond distance.

*Glen Evenbly,Johnnie Gray,Garnet Kin-Lic Chan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: An improved method (PNE) for approximating tensor network contractions without requiring a BP fixed point, with applications to various networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tensor network approximations are crucial for studying complex quantum systems, but the limitations of traditional methods like SVD and BP, especially when BP fails, necessitate more flexible approaches. PNE addresses these limitations by avoiding reliance on BP fixed points while maintaining accuracy.

Method: PNE partitions the network into a sum of computationally cheaper networks inspired by loop corrections in belief propagation, enabling accurate approximations without a fixed point requirement.

Result: PNE significantly outperforms traditional methods (BP, SVD) in accuracy (several orders of magnitude) and applicability, making it a versatile tool for tensor network analysis.

Conclusion: PNE offers a robust framework for tensor network contraction, enhancing accuracy and expanding the range of applicable network types compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a method for approximating the contraction of a tensor network by partitioning the network into a sum of computationally cheaper networks. This method, which we call a partitioned network expansion (PNE), builds upon recent work that systematically improves belief propagation (BP) approximations using loop corrections. However, in contrast to previous approaches, our expansion does not require a known BP fixed point to be implemented and can still yield accurate results even in cases where BP fails entirely. The flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through applications to a variety of example networks, including finite 2D and 3D networks, infinite networks, networks with open indices, and networks with degenerate BP fixed points. Benchmark numerical results for networks composed of Ising, AKLT, and random tensors typically show an improvement in accuracy over BP by several orders of magnitude (when BP solutions are obtainable) and also demonstrate improved performance over traditional network approximations based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for certain tasks.

Motivation: The paper focuses on improving mechanical squeezing, which is essential for quantum metrology and sensing applications.

Method: A two-tone driving combined with a squeezed vacuum field is utilized to achieve mechanical squeezing.

Result: Performance significantly improves across red/blue detuning ratios, exhibits nonlinear enhancement with increasing squeezing parameter r, and shows robustness against cavity dissipation and environmental noise.

Conclusion: This method offers a flexible and robust approach for generating mechanical squeezed states, advancing quantum sensing technologies.

Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for generating mechanical squeezed states based on the combined mechanism of a two-tone driving and a squeezed vacuum field. This innovative approach achieves a remarkable improvement in mechanical squeezing performance across the entire range of red/blue detuning ratios. Our study reveals that the squeezed vacuum field not only induces position squeezing of the mechanical oscillator but also facilitates momentum squeezing through phase matching. Moreover, the total squeezing degree exhibits nonlinear enhancement with the increasing of squeezing parameter $r$. The mechanical squeezed state exhibits a $2π$-periodic dependence in relation to the squeezing phase $θ$, offering experimental implementation with a high degree of operational flexibility. Notably, the scheme exhibits strong robustness against cavity dissipation and environmental thermal noise, substantially relaxing the strict parameter-matching requirements inherent in conventional approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is driven by the exploration of macroscopic quantum states and their implications in quantum theory collapse studies.

Method: The approach involves a two-step process: first, inducing a squeezed mechanical state using a two-tone microwave field; second, utilizing optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering with a red-detuned optical pulse.

Result: The protocol successfully demonstrates that mechanical phonons can be subtracted from the squeezed state, resulting in a cat-like superposition state (mechanical motion) upon anti-Stokes photon detection.

Conclusion: The work introduces a novel method for creating macroscopic quantum states, enhancing our understanding of quantum mechanics and its applications.

Abstract: We propose an optomagnomechanical approach for preparing a cat-like superposition state of mechanical motion. Our protocol consists of two steps and is based on the magnomechanical system where the magnetostrictively induced displacement further couples to an optical cavity mode via radiation pressure. We first prepare a squeezed mechanical state by driving the magnomechanical system with a two-tone microwave field. We then switch off the microwave drives and send a weak red-detuned optical pulse to the optical cavity to weakly activate the optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering. We show that $k$ phonons can be subtracted from the prepared squeezed state, conditioned on the detection of $k$ anti-Stokes photons from the cavity output field, which prepares the mechanical motion in a cat-like state. The work provides a new avenue for preparing mechanical superposition states by combining opto- and magnomechanics and may find applications in the study of macroscopic quantum states and the test of collapse theories.

Abstract: Entangled coherent states (ECS) provide a powerful non-Gaussian resource for continuous-variable quantum communication, but their generation in scalable architectures remains challenging. We propose an integrated photonic scheme that creates high-fidelity ECS from a two-mode squeezed vacuum via photon subtraction in a symmetric waveguide trimer. The resulting non-Gaussian entanglement is further enhanced by single-photon catalysis, which purifies the distributed state after transmission through lossy channels. Using these purified ECS resources, we analyze a photon-number-based teleportation protocol and demonstrate high-fidelity transfer of both coherent states and Schrodinger cat states. In particular, the teleportation fidelity for cat states exceeds the classical threshold of 2/3 over a broad range of realistic channel and squeezing parameters, whereas Gaussian resources fail to do so. Our results show that integrated photon subtraction and catalysis enable practical, chip-compatible generation of non-Gaussian entanglement suitable for advanced quantum teleportation and continuous-variable quantum networks.

Abstract: Entanglement swapping is a protocol that details how to create entanglement between previously uncorrelated particles. Its all-photonic version - mediated by the interference of photon pairs generated by separate quantum systems-finds disparate applications in quantum networks. So far, all-photonic entanglement swapping between remote systems has been implemented only using sources that operate probabilistically. However, the scaling up of quantum networks requires deterministic quantum emitters that do not suffer from a trade-off between degree of entanglement and photonpair generation rate. Here, we demonstrate all-photonic entanglement swapping using photon-pairs generated by two separate GaAs quantum dots. The emitters are deterministically embedded in hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric devices that make the entangled-photons from two dissimilar quantum dots nearly identical. Entanglement swapping is demonstrated with a fidelity as high as 0.71(2), more than 10 standard deviations above the classical limit. The experimental data are quantitatively explained by a theoretical model that also suggests how to boost the protocol performances. Our work opens the path to the exploitation of quantum dot entangled-photon sources in quantum repeater networks.

TL;DR: An improved protocol for measuring gapped ground states with minimal state disturbance. The required evolution time scales optimally with the gap and precision.

This could drastically reduce tomography overhead in quantum simulation tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving quantum measurement protocols for gapped ground states is a key challenge in quantum many-body physics, with direct applications to quantum simulation.

Method: The method leverages principles from quantum information theory and Hamiltonian dynamics to devise an efficient protocol that minimizes the time and resources needed for precise state measurements. It employs ideas like inverse gap scaling and local patch evolution.

Result: The results demonstrate that the protocol is optimal in scaling with respect to the spectral gap and target precision, offering a significant improvement over previous approaches.

Conclusion: This breakthrough paves the way for more efficient and feasible quantum simulations, potentially enabling the study of complex quantum systems that were previously intractable.

Abstract: We introduce a simple protocol for measuring properties of a gapped ground state with essentially no disturbance to the state. The required Hamiltonian evolution time scales inversely with the spectral gap and target precision (up to logarithmic factors), which is optimal. For local observables on geometrically local systems, the protocol only requires Hamiltonian evolution on a quasi-local patch of inverse-gap radius. Our results show that gapped ground states are algorithmically readable from a single copy without a recovery or rewinding procedure, which may drastically reduce tomography overhead in certain quantum simulation tasks.

Motivation: Described the importance of scaling up quantum computing systems and proposed a solution using optical fibers.

Method: Integrated optical fibers into the quantum processor and used a unique sensor technology to handle high photon numbers and long distances.

Result: Achieved high-dimensional quantum control, multi-channel operation, and long-distance transmission with high fidelity.

Conclusion: This approach addresses the key challenges in scaling quantum computing and opens the door to distributed quantum networks.

Abstract: Superconducting quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize computational capabilities. However, scaling up large quantum processors is limited by the cumbersome and heat-conductive electronic cables that connect room-temperature control electronics to quantum processors, leading to significant signal attenuation. Optical fibers provide a promising solution, but their use has been restricted to controlling simple two-level quantum systems over short distances. Here, we demonstrate optical control of a bosonic quantum processor, achieving universal operations on the joint Hilbert space of a transmon qubit and a storage cavity. Using an array of cryogenic fiber-integrated uni-traveling-carrier photodiodes, we prepare Fock states containing up to ten photons. Additionally, remote control of bosonic modes over a transmission distance of 15 km has been achieved, with fidelities exceeding 95%. The combination of high-dimensional quantum control, multi-channel operation, and long-distance transmission addresses the key requirements for scaling superconducting quantum computers and enables architectures for distributed quantum data centers.

TL;DR: The paper explores the estimation of separation between two dipole emitters for quantum super-resolution imaging, addressing limitations of the scalar approximation in high-numerical-aperture microscopy, and utilizes parameter estimation theory with Fisher information to quantify precision limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Super-resolution imaging using quantum Fisher information remains elusive, particularly for closely spaced sources in high-numerical-aperture microscopy, prompting this study to develop methods using vectorial emission models.

Method: The study employs parameter estimation theory, focusing on quantum and classical Fisher information alongside the Cramér-Rao bound. It analyzes two scenarios: fixed dipole orientations and all orientations over time, using the azimuthal-radial polarization basis for light filtering.

Result: Vectorial emission complicates analysis, but by filtering light in the azimuthal-radial basis, image inversion interferometry can enhance quantum Fisher information, enabling super-resolution.

Conclusion: This work provides a framework for maximizing Fisher information in vectorial source separation, advancing quantum super-resolution imaging techniques in microscopy.

Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental work has shown that the quantum Fisher information associated with estimating the separation between two optical point sources remains finite at small separations, effectively opening new routes to super-resolution imaging of simultaneously emitting sources. Most studies to date, however, implicitly invoke the scalar approximation, which is not appropriate in the context of high-numerical-aperture microscopy. Utilizing parameter estimation theory, here we consider the estimation of separation between two closely spaced dipole emitters, a commonly employed model for single-molecule optical beacons. We consider two limiting cases: one in which the orientations of the emitters are fixed and equal, and another in which both dipoles freely sample all of orientation space over the course of the measurement. We quantify precision limits using quantum and classical variants of the Fisher information and Cramér-Rao bound. In all cases, the vectorial nature of the emission complicates the analyses, but with appropriate filtering of the collected light in the azimuthal-radial polarization basis, a previously proposed scheme to saturate the quantum Fisher information via image inversion interferometry can be salvaged.

Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computing is a powerful framework for state preparation, while its evolution time often scales quadratically in the inverse Hamiltonian spectral gap, leading to sub-optimal computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a nonlinear adaptive strategy for finding the time scheduling function, and show that the gap dependence can be quadratically improved to be inverse linear for a wide range of systems under a mild gap measure condition. Through variational analysis, we further demonstrate the optimality of our schedule for systems with linear gap and the partial optimality for general systems, while we also rigorously show that the commonly used linear schedule is never optimal.

Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy centers (NV) in proximity to diamond surfaces are promising nanoscale quantum sensors. However, their coherence properties are negatively affected by magnetic and electric surface noise, whose origin and detailed impact have remained elusive. Using atomistic models of diamond surfaces derived with density functional theory, together with decoherence time calculations with cluster correlation expansion methods, we quantify the effects of surface crystallographic orientation and functionalization, and of the density of unpaired electrons on the NV Hahn-echo time $T_2$. We determine a crossover depth at which $T_2$ ceases to be limited by surface nuclear spins and recovers the bulk-limited value. We find that for static surface-electron baths, the ratio between the NV depth and the separation between surface electron spins determines a transition from fast-fluctuating to quasi-static noise, leading to a dependence of $T_2$ on orientation for specific surfaces. We also find that the modulation of $T_2$ by spin-phonon relaxations leads to motional-narrowing at sub-microsecond relaxation times. Importantly, our calculations show that it is only when accounting for surface-spin in-sequence hopping that measured $T_2$ values as a function of depth can be reproduced, thus highlighting the importance of hopping-mediated models to describe the surface spin noise affecting NV sensors. Overall, our work provides clear guidelines for engineering diamond surfaces to achieve enhanced NV coherence for quantum sensing and information processing applications.

Here we report a way to determine if a quantum key distribution model (or protocol) operates in an optimal behavior. This is accomplished by introducing a quantity, called optimality, which is the maximum over the total efficiency of a QKD under any circumstances (any values of QKD parameters). The optimality definition is given for the asymptotic operation of a QKD system - when infinitely many quantum systems are transferred/used in a quantum key distribution protocol or a quantum key distribution system is used infinitely many times. A way to attain the optimality is considered\textemdash implementation of a completely efficient QKD system (a combination of capacity-reaching quantum channel and a completely compressed classical channel) is presented.

Abstract: Utility-scale quantum computers require quantum error correcting codes with large numbers of physical qubits to achieve sufficiently low logical error rates. The performance of quantum error correction (QEC) is generally predicted through large-scale numerical simulations, used to estimate thresholds, finite-size scaling, and exponential suppression of logical errors below threshold. The connection of QEC to models from statistical mechanics provides an alternative tool for analysing QEC performance. However, predicting the behaviour of these models also requires large-scale numerical simulations, as analytic solutions are not generally known. Here we exploit an exact mapping, from a toric code under bit-flip noise that is post-selected on being syndrome free to the exactly-solvable two-dimensional Ising model on a torus, to derive an analytic solution for the logical failure rate across its full domain of physical error rates. In particular, this mapping provides closed-form expressions for the logical failure rate in four distinct regimes: the path-counting, below-threshold (ordered), near-threshold (critical), and above-threshold (disordered) regimes. Our framework places a number of familiar and long-standing numerical observations on firm theoretical ground. It also motivates explicit ansätze for the conventional QEC setting of non-post-selected codes whose statistical mechanics mappings involve random-bond disorder. Specifically, we introduce an effective surface tension model for the below-threshold regime, and a new scaling ansatz for the near-threshold regime, derived from an analysis of the ground state energy cost distribution. By bridging statistical mechanics theory and quantum error correction practice, our results offer a new toolkit for designing, benchmarking, and understanding topological codes beyond current computational limits.

Abstract: We propose and analyze a robust population-transfer protocol in a driven two-level system based on a sudden sign change of the detuning at the maximum of a smooth coupling pulse. Away from the jump the dynamics is adiabatic, while the sign flip produces a single nonadiabatic kick in the adiabatic basis. Within a simple stepwise adiabatic-sudden approximation we obtain a compact analytic expression for the final transition probability, identify the parameter regimes that yield high-fidelity inversion, and show that the result depends only on the change of the mixing angle across the detuning jump, i.e., solely on the ratio of the peak Rabi frequency to the detuning. Numerical simulations of the full time-dependent Schrödinger equation confirm the validity and robustness of this description over a broad parameter range.
  We then use the Majorana decomposition to extend the scheme to an SU(2)-symmetric three-state chain driven by the same coupling and detuning functions. In this setting the three-state propagator is expressed in closed form through the two-level Cayley-Klein parameters, which allows us to derive explicit transition probabilities for all three initial states. In particular, we show that for strong coupling the protocol yields almost complete population transfer between the two outer states, with only small transient population of the middle state, while retaining the same intrinsic robustness as in the underlying two-level model.

Abstract: We show that the quantum-mechanical probability distribution involving complex probability amplitudes can be derived from three natural conditions imposed on a relativistically invariant probability function describing the motion of a particle that can take multiple paths simultaneously. The conditions are: (i) pairwise Kolmogorov additivity, (ii) time symmetry, and (iii) Bayes' rule. The resulting solution, parameterized by a single constant, is the squared modulus of a sum of complex exponentials of the relativistic action, thereby recovering the Feynman path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics.

Result: The framework demonstrates remarkable precision, with absolute errors as low as 10^{-8}, and successfully reconstructs field distributions under ideal conditions, corroborated by classical EM solutions.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for efficient quantum solutions in microwave engineering, leveraging RL and adaptive strategies to optimize resource utilization and accuracy.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers a promising paradigm for electromagnetic eigenmode analysis, enabling compact representations of complex field interactions and potential exponential speedup over classical numerical solvers. Recent efforts have applied variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based methods to compute waveguide modes, demonstrating the feasibility of simulating TE and TM field distributions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, these studies typically employ manually designed, fixed-depth parameterized quantum circuits and uniform measurement-shot strategies, resulting in excessive quantum resource consumption, limited circuit expressivity, and reduced robustness under realistic noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose an architecture and shot adaptive subspace variational quantum eigensolver for efficient microwave waveguide eigenmode simulation on NISQ devices. The proposed framework integrates a reinforcement learning (RL) based circuit design strategy and an adaptive shot allocation mechanism to jointly reduce quantum resource overhead. Specifically, the RL agent autonomously explores the quantum circuit space to generate hardware-efficient parameterized quantum circuits, while the adaptive measurement scheme allocates sampling resources according to Hamiltonian term weights. Numerical experiments on three- and five-qubit systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accurate estimation of TE and TM mode eigenvalues, with a minimum absolute error down to $10^{-8}$ and reconstructed field distributions under noiseless conditions in excellent agreement with classical electromagnetic solutions.

Abstract: We study distributed similarity estimation for unitary channels (DSEU), the task of estimating the similarity between unitary channels implemented on different quantum devices. We completely address DSEU by showing that, for $n$-qubit unitary channels, the query complexity of DSEU is $Θ(\sqrt{d})$, where $d=2^n$, for both incoherent and coherent accesses. First, we propose two estimation algorithms for DSEU with these accesses utilizing the randomized measurement toolbox. The query complexities of these algorithms are both $O(\sqrt{d})$. Although incoherent access is generally weaker than coherent access, our incoherent algorithm matches this complexity by leveraging additional shared randomness between devices, highlighting the power of shared randomness in distributed quantum learning. We further establish matching lower bounds, proving that $Θ(\sqrt{d})$ queries are both necessary and sufficient for DSEU. Finally, we compare our algorithms with independent classical shadow and show that ours have a square-root advantage. Our results provide practical and theoretically optimal tools for quantum devices benchmarking and for distributed quantum learning.

TL;DR: The paper discusses fundamental aspects of contextual sets in quantum mechanics, particularly in 3D, and challenges the notion of the 'simplest' set by showing smaller alternatives exist. They also highlight that minimal contextual sets can be automatically generated, making them fundamental. The paper examines different types of contextual sets and their definitions.

Motivation: Exploring the fundamental structures in quantum mechanics, such as contextual sets, is crucial for advancing our understanding of quantum theory and potential applications in quantum computing and information.

Method: Mathematical analysis and computational methods were employed to identify, compare, and generate contextual sets across dimensions and their completeness.

Result: The paper demonstrates that smaller 3D contextual sets with fewer complete bases exist, challenges the previous assertion, and shows that minimal sets are readily generated automatically, suggesting the commonality and ubiquity of such structures in quantum contexts.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the foundational understanding of contextual sets in quantum mechanics by identifying and characterizing minimal cases, influencing future research and applications in the field.

Abstract: In Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 190203 (2025) a discovery of the simplest 3D contextual set with 33 vertices, 50 bases, and 14 complete bases is claimed. In this paper, we show that it was previously generated in Quantum 7, 953 (2023) and analyze the meaning, origin, and significance of the simplest contextual sets in any dimension. In particular, we prove that there is no ground to consider the aforementioned set as fundamental since there are many 3D contextual sets with a smaller number of complete bases. We also show that automatic generation of contextual sets from basic vector components automatically yields all known minimal contextual sets of any kind in any dimension and therefore also the aforementioned set in no CPU-time. In the end, we discuss varieties of contextual sets, in particular Kochen-Specker (KS), extended KS, and non-KS sets as well as ambiguities in their definitions.

Conclusion: 构建了一个全面的框架，用于诊断测量驱动的操作性随机性生成，并分析许多体动力学如何重塑量子信息流动。该框架结合 scrambling、pseudorandomness 和测量影响，提供了一个统一的语言来研究这些现象。

Abstract: This work develops tools to understand how quantum information spreads, scrambles, and is reshaped by measurements in many-body systems. First, I study scrambling and pseudorandomness in the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, quantifying pseudorandomness using unitary k-designs and frame potentials. Using Keldysh path integrals with replicas and disorder averaging, I obtain analytic control of the approach to randomness, identify collective modes that delay convergence to Haar-like behavior, and estimate design times as functions of model parameters, clarifying links between scrambling, complexity growth, and random-circuit phenomenology. Second, I construct a field theory for weakly measured SYK clusters. Starting from a system-ancilla description and a continuum monitoring limit, and using fermionic coherent states with replicas and disorder averaging, I derive a nonlinear sigma model that captures measurement back-action and the competition between interaction-induced scrambling and information extraction, predicting characteristic crossover scales and response signatures that distinguish weak monitoring from fully unitary evolution. Third, I develop a strong-disorder renormalization group for measurement-only SYK clusters, based on the SO(2n) replica algebra and Dasgupta-Ma decimation rules. The flow shows features reminiscent of infinite-randomness behavior, but an order-of-limits subtlety renders the leading recursions non-robust, so the analytic evidence for an infinite-randomness fixed point is inconclusive, even though the average second Renyi entropy displays logarithmic scaling. Together, these results provide a unified language to diagnose when many-body dynamics generate operational randomness and how measurements redirect that flow.

Abstract: We introduce quantum parameter estimation with the encoding being via a quantum measurement. We quantify the precision for estimating parameters characterizing a general two-outcome qubit measurement, considering two cases: when the outcomes of the encoding measurement are recorded and when the same are ignored. We find that in a large variety of such estimation scenarios, forgetting the outcomes yields higher precision. We derive a necessary criterion under which remembering the measurement outcomes provides better precision in comparison to the outcome-forgotten strategy. Furthermore, we establish a necessary and sufficient criterion for the simultaneous estimation of two parameters encoded by an arbitrary quantum process, including those involving measurements, using qubit probes, and find when the quantum Cramér$-$Rao bound is valid and achievable. For simultaneous estimation of two parameters characterizing the measurement, we find that the achievable quantum Cramér$-$Rao bound can be a valid precision bound only when the measurement direction depends on the parameters of interest.

Abstract: The opening of Arctic sea routes presents unprecedented opportunities for global trade but poses significant operational and computational challenges due to the dynamic nature of sea ice conditions. This study formulates a multi criteria Arctic route optimization problem that integrates Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) variables into a Constrained Quadratic Model (CQM) and solves it using D Wave's hybrid quantum classical solver. We benchmark the feasibility and scalability of this approach against classical Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) solvers such as Gurobi and CPLEX. Results show that the CQM formulation achieves feasible solutions with stable runtimes as quadratic density increases, demonstrating 10 to 100 times faster convergence and reduced computational time compared with classical solvers, while also improving route smoothness by approximately 10 percent and reducing total length by approximately 1 percent. This reflects the effectiveness of the hybrid quantum annealing approach for Arctic routing problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing queueing systems in service-oriented architectures (SOA) requires efficient methods due to increased service variability and computational demands.

Method: Combined quantum amplitude amplification and simulation techniques to model queueing systems on quantum circuits.

Result: Achieved quantum speedup, with simulation fidelity as high as 0.99 using just 4 qubits.

Conclusion: Opens new possibilities for quantum-enhanced performance analysis in systems with finite buffers and non-Markovian behavior.

Abstract: Finite-capacity single-server queues with general service-time distributions form the backbone of numerous real-world systems, yet classical simulation of performance metrics such as blocking probabilities and delay becomes computationally prohibitive as service variability or required precision increases. This work presents the first coherent quantum circuit for simulating an M/G/1/K queue under arbitrary service-time laws. The circuit encodes the service distribution through a logarithmic-depth ladder of $R_y$ rotations and enforces buffer constraints via a comparator-controlled phase gate, while preserving the quadratic speed-up of amplitude amplification. Grover iterations center on estimating the expected number of customers in the system, yielding provable $O(\sqrt{N})$ variance reduction and closed-form confidence bounds, where $N$ denotes the number of shots. Empirical evaluations on IBM quantum simulators across four service distributions and three traffic intensities demonstrate fidelity above 0.99 with four qubits and above 0.76 with ten qubits, with Jensen-Shannon divergence below 0.11. Waiting-time estimation errors decrease by an order of magnitude as system load approaches capacity and remain within 3% in high-traffic regimes using registers of up to 63 qubits. These results establish the first end-to-end quantum simulation framework for finite-buffer, non-Markovian queueing systems and provide a concrete foundation for quantum-accelerated performance analysis in service-oriented architectures.

Abstract: We investigate the phase sensitivity of a linear two-mode atom interferometer subject to environmental noise, modeled within the framework of open quantum systems with both number-conserving and non-conserving Lindblad operators. Considering several input states, we first study the cases N=1,2 (N number of particles) and perform numerical simulations for N>2. The sensitivity as a function of the holding time can display divergence points where phase estimation becomes impossible, to which we refer as insensitivity points. We characterize their behavior as the input state, particle number, and noise operator are varied, and we find that their positions are independent of the noise intensity. Moreover, while our fixed measurement scheme may favor number-conserving noise at small N (i.e., having better sensitivity), the Cramér-Rao bound reveals that particle non-conserving noise yields strictly lower achievable sensitivity for all particle numbers.

Motivation: The authors argue that current quantum circuit designs are overly generic, limiting their effectiveness for specific tasks like generating geometrically constrained graphs.

Method: The authors evaluate various entanglement topologies and loss functions, measuring their impact on both statistical fidelity and geometric constraints.

Result: Architectures aligned with problem structure improve performance, achieving high geometric validity and matching classical GANs. Architectural choices balance geometric consistency and distributional accuracy.

Conclusion: Task-aware quantum ansatz-topologies can significantly outperform generic designs, with lessons applicable to broader quantum machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) promises theoretical advantages, benefiting computational problems that would not be efficiently classically simulatable. However, much of this theoretical speedup depends on the quantum circuit design solving the problem. We argue that QC literature has yet to explore more domain specific ansatz-topologies, instead of relying on generic, one-size-fits-all architectures. In this work, we show that incorporating task-specific inductive biases -- specifically geometric priors -- into quantum circuit design can enhance the performance of hybrid Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QuGANs) on the task of generating geometrically constrained K4 graphs. We evaluate a portfolio of entanglement topologies and loss-function designs to assess their impact on both statistical fidelity and compliance with geometric constraints, including the Triangle and Ptolemaic inequalities. Our results show that aligning circuit topology with the underlying problem structure yields substantial benefits: the Triangle-topology QuGAN achieves the highest geometric validity among quantum models and matches the performance of classical Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Additionally, we showcase how specific architectural choices, such as entangling gate types, variance regularization and output-scaling govern the trade-off between geometric consistency and distributional accuracy, thus emphasizing the value of structured, task-aware quantum ansatz-topologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in quantum machine learning on NISQ hardware is important due to potential patterns in test accuracy, generalization, and sensitivity to hardware noise for practical applications.

Method: The research involves implementing both pulse-based and gate-based QML algorithms on a classical simulator of a superconducting transmon processor. They train both models under realistic noise conditions and compare their performance using metrics like test accuracy and generalization capabilities.

Result: The pulse-based model shows better resilience to noise, maintaining higher performance over longer periods, but gate-based methods achieve higher accuracy under the same noise conditions.

Conclusion: Pulse-based quantum machine learning shows promise for practical implementation in the NISQ era, especially in noisy environments, but further exploration of gate-based techniques is necessary for achieving higher accuracy in error-prone hardware. The study highlights the need for hardware-native algorithms to outperform and survive in the presence of noise.

Abstract: While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) holds great potential, its practical realization on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware has been hindered by the limitations of variational quantum circuits (VQCs). Recent evidence suggests that VQCs suffer from severe trainability and noise-related issues, leading to growing skepticism about their long-term viability. However, the possibility of implementing learning models directly at the pulse-control level remains comparatively unexplored and could offer a promising alternative. In this work, we formulate a pulse-based variant of data re-uploading, embedding trainable parameters directly into the native system's dynamics. We benchmark our approach on a simulated superconducting transmon processor with realistic noise profiles. The pulse-based model consistently outperforms its gate-based counterpart, exhibiting higher test accuracy and improved generalization under equivalent noise conditions. Moreover, by systematically increasing noise strength, we show that pulse-level implementations retain higher fidelity for longer, demonstrating enhanced resilience to decoherence and control errors. These results suggest that pulse-native architectures, though less explored, may offer a viable and hardware-aligned path forward for practical QML in the NISQ era.

This development supports real-time monitoring of muon flux to guide error correction strategies, aiding fault-tolerant quantum computation.
Implementation of this system enables effective suppression of muon-induced errors in quantum processors, crucial for advancing quantum computing technologies.

Abstract: Ionizing radiation has emerged as a potential limiting factor for superconducting quantum processors, inducing quasiparticle bursts and correlated errors that challenge fault-tolerant operation. Atmospheric muons are particularly problematic due to their high energy and penetration power, making passive shielding ineffective. Therefore, monitoring the real-time muon flux is crucial to guide the development of alternative error-correction or protection strategies. We present the design, simulation, and first operation of a cryogenic muon-tagging system based on Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) for integration with superconducting quantum processors. The system consists of two KIDs arranged in a vertical stack and operated at ~20 mK. Monte Carlo simulations based on Geant4 guided the prototype design and provided reference expectations for muon-tagging efficiency and accidental coincidences due to ambient $γ$-rays. We measured a muon-induced coincidence rate among the top and bottom detectors of (192 $\pm$ 9) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ events/s, in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo prediction. The prototype achieves a muon-tagging efficiency of about 90% with negligible dead time. These results demonstrate the feasibility of operating a muon-tagging system at millikelvin temperatures and open the path toward its integration with multi-qubit chips to veto or correct muon-induced errors in real time.

Result: 仿真结果表明，分布式架构在量子纠错和深度上优于单一架构；而理论分析显示，在适当增加并行生成的贝尔对数量后，分布式架构能够避免阻塞，默认情况下不影响总测试用例数量。

Conclusion: 该研究为分布式量子计算提供了理论基础，证明了在当前约束条件下分散架构的潜力，同时为未来实验提供了指导。

Abstract: The main bottleneck for distributed quantum computing is the rate at which entanglement is produced between quantum processing units (QPUs). In this work, we prove that multiple QPUs connected through slow interconnects can outperform a monolithic architecture made with a single QPU. We consider a distributed quantum computing model with the following assumptions: (1) each QPU is linked to only two other QPUs, (2) each link produces only one Bell pair at a time, (3) the time to generate a Bell pair is $τ_e$ times longer than the gate time. We propose a distributed version of the CliNR partial error correction scheme respecting these constraints and we show through circuit level simulations that, even if the entanglement generation time $τ_e$ is up to five times longer than the gate time, distributed CliNR can achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a shorter depth than both the direct implementation and the monolithic CliNR implementation of random Clifford circuits. In the asymptotic regime, we relax assumption (2) and we prove that links producing $O(t/\ln t)$ Bell pairs in parallel, where $t$ is the number of QPUs, is sufficient to avoid stalling distributed CliNR, independently of the number of qubits per QPU. This demonstrates the potential of distributed CliNR for near-term multi-QPU devices. Moreover, we envision a distributed quantum superiority experiment based on the conjugated Clifford circuits of Bouland, Fitzsimons and Koh implemented with distributed CliNR.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of cooling quantum systems with finite resources in continuous-variable (CV) platforms, establishing fundamental limitations and demonstrating the role of non-Gaussianity in enhancing cooling performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability to cool quantum systems is essential for quantum technologies, and while discrete-variable systems are well-studied, CV systems are becoming increasingly important in quantum information processing. This paper aims to understand the fundamental limitations of cooling in CV systems.

Method: The authors developed a general framework for cooling CV systems by analyzing Gaussian and non-Gaussian operations. They derived a reachable bound on the cooling performance of Gaussian operations and identified the most efficient cooling scheme by optimizing over all protocols that saturate this bound. Additionally, they showed that non-Gaussian resources can enhance the cooling limit by a factor of $p$.

Result: The paper establishes the fundamental limits of CV heat-bath algorithmic cooling. It demonstrates that non-Gaussian resources play a crucial role in surpassing Gaussian cooling barriers by enabling a $p$-fold enhancement of the cooling limit.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the limitations and potential of CV systems for cooling quantum systems. By highlighting the importance of non-Gaussian resources, it opens new avenues for advancing quantum technologies that rely on efficient cooling mechanisms.

Abstract: Cooling quantum systems with finite resources is a central task in quantum technologies and has been extensively explored in discrete-variable settings. As continuous-variable (CV) platforms play an increasingly important role in quantum information processing, it becomes crucial to understand the fundamental limitations of cooling bosonic systems. In this work, we develop a general framework for cooling CV systems, identifying both the constraints imposed by Gaussianity and the advantages enabled by non-Gaussian interactions. We derive a reachable bound on the cooling performance of Gaussian operations that applies to arbitrary cooling architectures. By optimizing over all protocols saturating this bound, we further identify the most efficient scheme, which minimizes dissipated energy for a given number of ancilla modes. Beyond Gaussian operations, we show that $p$-excitation exchange exploits non-Gaussian resources to achieve a $p$-fold enhancement of the cooling limit. Our results establish the fundamental limits of CV heat-bath algorithmic cooling and reveal the crucial role of non-Gaussianity in surpassing Gaussian cooling barriers.

Abstract: A Bernoulli factory is a model for randomness manipulation that transforms an initial Bernoulli random variable into another Bernoulli variable by applying a predetermined function relating the output bias to the input one. In literature, quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory schemes have been proposed, which encode both the input and output variables using qubit amplitudes. This fundamental concept can serve as a subroutine for quantum algorithms that involve Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo methods, or that require data encryption, like in blind quantum computation. In this work, we present a characterisation of the complexity of the quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory by providing a lower bound on the required number of qubits needed to implement the protocol, an upper bound on the success probability and the quantum circuit that saturates the bounds. We also formalise and analyse two different variants of the original problem that address the possibility of increasing the number of input biases or the number of functions implemented by the quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory. The obtained results can be used as a framework for randomness manipulation via such an approach.

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a fundamental challenge in combinatorial optimization, widely applied in logistics and transportation. As the size of TSP instances grows, traditional algorithms often struggle to produce high-quality solutions within reasonable timeframes. This study investigates the potential of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a hybrid quantum-classical method, to solve TSP under realistic constraints. We adopt a QUBO-based formulation of TSP that integrates real-world logistical constraints reflecting operational conditions, such as vehicle capacity, road accessibility, and time windows, while ensuring compatibility with the limitations of current quantum hardware. Our experiments are conducted in a simulated environment using high-performance computing (HPC) resources to assess QAOA's performance across different problem sizes and quantum circuit depths. In order to improve scalability, we propose clustering QAOA (Cl-QAOA), a hybrid approach combining classical machine learning with QAOA. This method decomposes large TSP instances into smaller sub-problems, making quantum optimization feasible even on devices with a limited number of qubits. The results offer a comprehensive evaluation of QAOA's strengths and limitations in solving constrained TSP scenarios. This study advances quantum optimization and lays groundwork for future large-scale applications.

*Kregg Elliot Arms,Martin James McHugh,Joseph Edward Nyhan,William Frederick Reus,James Loudon Ulrich*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We present algorithms to learn Detector Error Models (DEMs) from syndromes without a decoder, validate them on simulated data, apply them to Google's 72- and 105-qubit chips, and use the results to track error rates and identify long-range correlations. Our approach improves upon traditional DEM estimation by better modeling unseen syndromes and provides new insights into quantum error correction experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The accurate estimation of DEMs is essential for improving the reliability and performance of quantum computers. Existing methods often rely on complex decoding algorithms, which can be computationally intensive and may not capture all error correlations effectively. This paper introduces a novel approach that directly learns DEMs from syndromes, potentially simplifying the process while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The authors developed and applied algorithms that learn DEM parameters and structure from syndromes without using a decoder. They employed a likelihood-based method that is tractable for small DEMs and used time-series analysis to track error dynamics over QEC experiments.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can recover known DEMs from simulated data with precision limited by finite-sample effects. When applied to Google's quantum chips, the algorithms provide accurate models of local errors and reveal long-range correlations in the 105-qubit chip, challenging previous assumptions about error mechanisms.

Conclusion: This work offers a significant advancement in DEM estimation, particularly for large-scale quantum systems. By eliminating the need for a decoder, the approach opens new possibilities for real-time characterization and adaptive error correction, enhancing the scalability and reliability of quantum computing systems.

Abstract: We consolidate recent theoretical advances in Detector Error Model (DEM) estimation and formalize several algorithms to learn DEM parameters and structure from syndromes without using a decoder, demonstrating recovery of known DEMs from simulated syndromes with precision limited only by finite-sample effects. We then apply these algorithms to estimate DEMs from Google's 72- and 105-qubit chips. Using a likelihood function that is tractable for small DEMs, we show that DEMs estimated directly from syndromes agree more closely with unseen syndromes than DEMs trained to optimize logical performance, whereas the latter outperform the former as priors for decoders in logical memory experiments. We used a time-series of estimated DEMs to track both global error and specific local errors over the course of a QEC experiment, suggesting applications in online characterization. We employ a sequence of DEM estimation techniques to discover and quantify long-range detector correlations spanning the width of the 105-qubit chip, for which DEM analysis suggests correlated measurement errors rather than high-weight Pauli errors as the most likely explanation. Finally, we present two artifacts in repetition code syndromes that are \emph{not} well-modeled by a DEM: correlated flipping of pairs of adjacent detectors in many consecutive rounds of QEC, and signatures consistent with radiation events occurring more frequently than previously reported.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fabrication defects can be well-handled using a strategy relying on the mid-error-correction-cycle state. In this work we present two improvements to the original prescription. First, we quantify the impact of the choice of a more complete set of gauge operators originally proposed for the hex-grid surface code on the standard square-grid surface code, as well as a new method for excising effectively unused qubits. Second, we leverage the expressivity of the LUCI framework as an intermediate representation, using integer linear programming to find performant physical circuits from the large space of valid LUCI circuits. We show that on the $d = 11$ surface code at $1\%(3\%)$ dropout rate for qubits and couplers, these optimizations allow for a total improvement of $14.5\%(23.6\%)$ over $4d$ round of syndrome extraction using the SI1000 noise model at $0.1\%$ noise.

Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution (QITE) method by introducing a novel approach with multiple imaginary times.

Method: The authors propose the Multiple-Time QITE (MT-QITE) algorithm, which uses multiple imaginary time steps to optimize the preparation of ground states on quantum hardware. Their method incorporates parallelization to handle non-local Hamiltonians and reduces computational costs by strategically partitioning the Hamiltonian.

Result: The results demonstrate that MT-QITE achieves higher fidelity compared to the original QITE algorithm while significantly reducing the measurement budget. Additionally, the algorithm's parallel nature allows for computational advantages in systems with non-local interactions.

Conclusion: MT-QITE represents a significant advancement in quantum algorithms for ground state preparation, offering improved fidelity, reduced resource requirements, and enhanced parallelizability, making it a promising approach for future quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution (QITE) is a powerful method for preparing ground states on quantum hardware. However, executing QITE has costly measurement budgets for general Hamiltonians. Both fidelity and computational cost are strongly dependent on the definition of suitable local domains and Hamiltonian partitions. In this work, we introduce the Multiple-Time QITE algorithm (MT-QITE). We show how using more than one imaginary time substantially improves the fidelity of the resulting ground state as well as the measurement overhead with respect to the previously published QITE algorithm, while preserving its deterministic character and its independence from ad hoc ansatze. Moreover, unlike QITE and other QITE-based algorithms, MT-QITE is parallelizable, and we show that even in Hamiltonians with non-local interactions, partitioning may entail a computational advantage.

Abstract: We present entcalc, a Python and MATLAB package for estimating the geometric entanglement of multipartite quantum states. The package operates as follows: given a multipartite quantum state as input, it outputs an estimate of its geometric entanglement. For pure states, it computes the geometric entanglement together with an estimation error. For mixed states, it provides both lower and upper bounds on the geometric entanglement, thereby identifying an interval in which the true value lies. We provide several methods to compute the lower bound, enabling users to balance accuracy against computational cost. We apply entcalc to several representative examples, including for $3\otimes3$ PPT entangled states, mixtures of GHZ and W states, thermal states of selected three-qubit spin chains, and noisy GHZ and W states. We observe signatures of quantum phase transitions by quantifying entanglement in spin chains. We also demonstrate that entanglement between non-neighbouring sites can be activated by tuning the external magnetic field. In all tested cases, the gap between the lower and upper bounds is found to be very small, indicating that entcalc provides highly accurate estimates of the geometric entanglement for these states.

Result: The research reveals two metastable state attractors in the system, the loss rate, and a unifying framework between steady-state phase-space dynamics and quantum activation processes.

Conclusion: A comprehensive theoretical framework is established for studying quantum bistability, metastability, and decoherence in nonlinear resonators, with direct applications to bosonic qubits and quantum information processing.

Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a single bosonic cavity subject to two-photon driving and two-photon dissipation in the presence of finite detuning. Exploiting a hidden time-reversal symmetry, the Wigner representation and the WKB method, we introduce an effective phase-space potential for description of the steady state. It reveals two attracting points, which are metastable due to quantum fluctuations. By employing the Keldysh real-time path integral formalism, we compute the instanton trajectory governing the quantum activation process between these attractors and establish a fundamental connection with the Wigner representation. This relation unifies the steady-state phase-space description with dynamical quantum activation processes. We also derive an analytical expression for the decoherence rate of the system. Our work provides a coherent theoretical framework for analyzing quantum bistability, metastability, and decoherence in driven-dissipative nonlinear resonators, with direct implications for the design of bosonic qubits and quantum information processing.

Abstract: We develop a framework for learning from noisy quantum experiments, focusing on fault-tolerant devices accessing uncharacterized systems through noisy couplings. Our starting point is the complexity class $\textsf{NBQP}$ ("noisy BQP"), modeling noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot, in general, error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we show that for natural oracle problems, noise can eliminate exponential quantum learning advantages of ideal noiseless learners while preserving a superpolynomial gap between NISQ and fault-tolerant devices. Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings. Together, our results show that the Bell-basis and SWAP-test primitives underlying most exponential quantum learning advantages are fundamentally fragile to noise unless the experimental system has latent noise-robust structure. Thus, realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require understanding how noise-robust physical properties interface with available algorithmic techniques.

Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model has attracted widespread attention due to its relevance to diverse areas of physics, such as high temperature superconductivity, black holes, and quantum chaos. The model is, however, extremely challenging to realize experimentally. In this work, we show how a particular form of Floquet engineering, termed ``kinetic driving'', effectively eliminates single-particle processes and creates quasi-random all-to-all interactions when applied to models of Hubbard type. For the specific case of the Bose-Hubbard model, we explicitly verify that the driven system indeed reproduces SYK physics by direct comparison of the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs). Our findings indicate that a cold-atom realization of kinetic driving -- achieved through modulation of hopping amplitudes in an optical lattice -- offers a practical and accurate platform for quantum simulation of the SYK model.

Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear propagation of light in graded-index multimode fiber, utilizing it as an optical computing unit, and quantify how it employs waveguide modes to process information. Using a time-dependent spatiotemporal propagation model with modal decomposition, we evaluate several benchmark regression and classification tasks and study the modal content of the generated speckles, which couples with a simple digital layer to perform optical computing. Analysis of modal entropy and energy-based mode counts reveals that effective computation is confined to a low-dimensional modal subspace, whose identity depends on the task and propagation regime. This also sets a trade-off between modal richness and nonlinear beam self-cleaning. These results establish modal statistics as practical design metrics for fiber-based optical computers.

Abstract: The generation of white optical vortices is currently constrained by intrinsic trade-offs between spectral bandwidth, conversion efficiency, and temporal pulse integrity in conventional diffractive and geometric-phase approaches. In this work, we theoretically investigate a compensated tandem crossed twisted nematic (TN) liquid crystal architecture that overcomes these fundamental limitations. By developing a rigorous Jones matrix model and defining specific figures of merit for chromatic fidelity, we analyze the impact of manufacturing imperfections and non-adiabatic waveguiding (deviations from the Mauguin regime) on the device performance. We propose and evaluate three distinct compensation strategies, ranging from optimized passive designs for specific manufacturing tolerances to a robust active compensation scheme utilizing a tunable retarder. Our analysis demonstrates that the active approach effectively nullifies parasitic amplitude modulation, enabling the generation of perfectly achromatic vortices with high phase purity across an arbitrary bandwidth. This establishes the compensated tandem TN cell as a superior and versatile platform for high-fidelity white-light singular optics.

Abstract: Localization of a macroscopic number of eigenstates on a real-space boundary, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, is one of the striking topological features emerging from non-Hermiticity. Realizing this effect typically requires periodic (lattice) systems with asymmetry of intersite coupling, which is not readily available in many physical platforms. Instead, it is meticulously engineered, e.g., in photonics, which results in complex structures requiring precise fabrication steps. Here, we propose a simpler mechanism: introducing an asymmetric, purely imaginary potential in a topologically trivial system induces momentum-space localization akin to the skin effect. We experimentally demonstrate this localization using exciton polaritons, hybrid light-matter quasi-particles in a simple engineered `round box' trap, pumped by a laser pump offset from the trap center. The effect disappears if the pump is concentric with the trap. The localization persists and becomes stronger at higher densities of polaritons, when a non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate is formed and the system becomes nonlinear. Our approach offers a new route to realizing skin effects in continuous, non-periodic systems and exploring the interplay of non-Hermiticity, topology, and nonlinearity in macroscopic quantum states.

Abstract: The mixed quantum/classical approach of Skinner and co-workers has been widely used to calculate the line shapes of the infrared spectra of water (H2O), but less attention has been paid to the use of this approach in quantitatively calculating spectral intensity, thereby limiting direct comparisons of calculated and experimental spectra. Here, we extend this theoretical framework to facilitate direct computation of the full complex refractive index of water, replacing the normalized ordinate used in previous studies. Our results for the OH stretching region of H2O capture both the shapes and intensities of the experimental spectra. They reveal that inclusion of the local field effect is crucial to the accurate reproduction of spectral intensity. This extended approach enables new areas of analysis of the bulk, thin-film, and cluster spectra of water.

Abstract: Since the first proof-of-concept demonstrations of photoluminescence-based optical refrigeration, solid-state laser cooling has developed into a credible competitor to conventional cryogenic technologies. Solid-state laser cooling continues to advance as new materials push cooling limits. These developments have created a need to consolidate progress made to date as well as standardize critical experimental considerations needed for reliable and verifiable cooling measurements. This primer therefore outlines essential concepts and requirements, which underpin solid-state laser cooling. The primer summarizes key milestones achieved with cooling-grade, rare-earth-doped glasses and crystals as well as with semiconductors. It additionally highlights emerging applications of solid-state optical refrigeration. To strengthen the consistency and reproducibility of cooling results going forward, two reporting checklists are introduced. They cover materials, cooling metrics, and thermometry. This primer is intended to serve as both a tutorial and a practical reference for incoming and existing researchers involved in solid-state laser-cooling.

Abstract: Vector solitons (VSs), being observed across various fields from optics to Bose-Einstein condensates, are localized structures composed of orthogonal modes bound by nonlinear couplings. Nevertheless, the influence of intermodal linear coupling on the physical properties of this bimodal structure remains to be decently revealed and harnessed. Utilizing an ultrafast fiber laser as a platform, we predict and demonstrate that the linear mode coupling (LMC) induces the deformable VS in terms of the temporal and spectral structures. Weak LMC supports heteronuclear vector solitons built of dissimilar polarization modes, i.e., a single pulse coupled to an orthogonal damped pulse chain. On the other hand, strong LMC facilitates the homonuclear VS composed of polarization modes with similar structures, in the form of soliton compounds featuring caterpillar motions. Our findings reveal new patterns of VSs and open an effective avenue for versatile ultrafast optical sources.

Abstract: The utilization of Kerr nonlinearity in lithium niobate has been extensively investigated over the years. Nevertheless, the practical implementation of Kerr nonlinearity in waveguides has been constrained by the material's inherently low third-order nonlinear coefficients. Here, we present a significant advancement by demonstrating Pockels effect-induced strong Kerr nonlinearity in a periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate waveguide. Both effective four-wave mixing (FWM) and cascaded effective FWM processes are experimentally observed. The induced FWM process achieves a remarkable maximum output power of -8.5 dBm, spanning a wavelength spectrum of over 116.8 nm. Analysis reveals that the induced effective Kerr nonlinearity exhibits a substantial effective nonlinear refractive index as $2.9\times 10^{-15} m^{2}W^{-1}$, corresponding to an effective nonlinear refractive index enhancement factor of $1.6\times 10^{4}$ relative to the intrinsic value. Moreover, a wavelength-converting experiment demonstrates a flat optic-to-optic response over a broadband radiofrequency spectrum, confirming that signal integrity is well preserved after on-chip effective FWM conversion. Therefore, the demonstrated efficient and broadband Pockels effect induced effective Kerr nonlinearity paves the way for novel applications in diverse fields, including spectroscopy, parametric amplification, quantum correlation studies, and wavelength conversion technologies.

Abstract: Reservoir computing, renowned for its low training cost, has emerged as a promising lightweight paradigm for efficient spatiotemporal processing,it remains challenging to realize deep photonic reservoir computing (DPRC) systems, due to the lack of scalable on-chip nonlinearity. Here, we introduce a versatile time delayed DPRC framework that natively supports deep and concurrent spatiotemporal processing entirely in the optical domain. At its core, the system leverages free carrier dynamics in silicon microring resonators to provide the fundamental nonlinearity and short term memory, and these nonlinear nodes are interconnected through true time delay lines that establish shared long-term memory. Benefiting from intrinsic physical nonlinearity and multi-timescale fading memory, this simple yet effective architecture demonstrates remarkable high dimensional representation capabilities. On the NTU RGB D benchmark, the parameter efficient DPRC system achieves superior action recognition accuracies compared to mainstream deep learning models, while requiring only a single shot regression training procedure. We further verify a prototype DPRC chip that excels across diverse dataset classification and time series prediction tasks. It enables a streamlined all optical pipeline between hierarchical layers, delivering a consistent computational density of 334.25 TOPs/mm2, independent of the reservoir depth and three orders of magnitude higher than conventional approaches. Moreover, its performance scales with near-zero hardware overhead by utilizing additional wavelength channels. This DPRC network is highly scalable on a silicon photonic platform, with flexible extension to hundreds of deep reservoir layers and parallel channels, paving the way toward intelligent optoelectronic systems for advanced real time processing and parallel decision making.

Abstract: Conventional approaches to terahertz (THz) pulse generation are restricted by the Fourier-transform limit, which hinders the creation of sources that combine long duration with broad bandwidth--a capability crucial for many spectroscopic and sensing applications. In this work, we overcome this challenge in the terahertz domain using an on-chip gradient waveguide array. The key is to spectrally disperse the pulse into spatially separated channels within a lithium niobate chip, effectively decoupling the design of temporal and spectral properties. We validate the source by distinguishing amino acid mixtures, demonstrating its tailored biosensing potential. This work establishes a novel mechanism for integrated THz generation, offering considerable promise for broadband spectroscopy and on-chip photonics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation is driven by the need for efficient design of ultrahigh-Q optical chiral resonators, which are essential for advanced photonics applications. Traditional methods are time-consuming and inefficient, prompting the use of deep learning for faster solutions.

Method: The method involves introducing a multi-head attention network (MuHAN) specifically tailored for the design of bilayer chiral metasurfaces. The network is trained to accelerate the design process by learning physical principles and performing inverse design of nanoscale structures with ultrahigh Q-factors.

Result: The MuHAN model achieves forward spectral predictions in approximately 10ms, offering thousands of times faster computation compared to finite-difference time-domain simulations. It demonstrates 99.85% accuracy for forward predictions and 99.9% for inverse predictions. The inverse design enables structures with Q-factors as high as 2.9910E5, utilizing chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs). The tool's efficiency supports applications in encryption imaging, laser, and detection.

Conclusion: The paper conclusively shows that deep learning, particularly through the MuHAN model, revolutionizes the design of high-Q optical chiral resonators. This breakthrough not only accelerates research but also paves the way for innovative applications in photonics, including advanced sensing and encryption imaging.

Abstract: High quality (Q) factor optical chiral resonators are indispensable for many chiral photonic devices. Designing ultrahigh Q-factors in chiral metasurfaces traditionally relies on extensive parameter scanning, which is time-consuming and inefficient. While deep learning now provides a rapid design alternative, conventional models still face challenges in accurately predicting ultrahigh Q-factor spectral characteristics. In this study, we introduce a multi-head attention network (MuHAN) to accelerate the design of ultrahigh Q-factor optical chiral resonators in bilayer metasurfaces. MuHAN achieves forward spectral predictions in approximately 10ms, thousands of times faster than finite-difference time-domain simulations, boasting 99.85% and 99.9% accuracy for forward and inverse predictions, respectively. By transferring the learned physical principles, we perform inverse design of nanoscale structures with ultrahigh Q-factors (up to 2.9910E5) based on chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) at minimal computational cost. Our rapid design tool, based on MuHAN, enables high-performance encryption imaging, bridging deep learning with high-Q chiral metasurfaces for advanced sensing, laser, and detection applications.

### [176] [Classical Dirac particle: Mass and Spin invariance and radiation reaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10505)
*Martin Rivas*

Main category: physics.class-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the dynamics of a Dirac particle in an external electromagnetic field, focusing on its center of charge and center of mass trajectories and the implications for energy radiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of elementary particles, particularly Dirac particles, in external fields is fundamental to quantum field theory and particle physics.

Method: The authors use relativistic quantum mechanics, specifically the Dirac equation, and analyze energy and angular momentum conservation along with spin dynamics.

Result: The study reveals that the particle radiates energy when its center of charge and center of mass trajectories differ, and derives a braking term due to radiation reaction in the dynamical equations.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to the theoretical framework of particle radiation and the dynamics of isolated systems in electromagnetic interactions.

Abstract: According to the atomic principle an elementary particle has no excited states and under any interaction, if it is not annihilated, its internal structure cannot be modified. The intrinsic properties are the mass $m$ and the absolute value of the spin in the center of mass frame $S=\hbar/2$. We analyze the closed system made of a single Dirac particle and an external electromagnetic field. The Poincaré invariance of the dynamics implies that the energy, linear momentum and angular momentum of the whole system must be conserved. The Dirac particle has two distinguished points, the center of charge ${\bf r}$ and the center of mass ${\bf q}$. When interacting, the energy expended by the field is the work done by the external Lorentz force along the center of charge trajectory. The variation of the mechanical energy of the particle is the work done by the external Lorentz force along the center of mass trajectory. If these two works are different the excess of energy must be transformed into radiation returning that energy to the field. The accelerated Dirac particle radiates. We analyze the spin dynamics of the Dirac particle under an external electromagnetic field. The requirement that the absolute value of the spin for the center of mass observer cannot be modified by the interaction implies a modification of the dynamical equation which includes a new braking term along the center of mass velocity, that can be interpreted as the radiation reaction force.

### [177] [Influence of the basins of attractions in the register jumps of the clarinet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10721)
*Nathan Szwarcberg,Tom Colinot,Christophe Vergez,Michaël Jousserand*

Main category: physics.class-ph

TL;DR: When operating a clarinet in the first register, stabilizing the second register requires more specific blowing pressure control compared to when starting from a blank state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding clarinet register transitions is crucial for clarinetists aiming to play in different registers and for clarinet manufacturers seeking to improve instrument design.

Method: Numerical analysis involving multiple simulations of register hole activations at different blowing pressures was conducted.

Result: The study revealed that the range of blowing pressures allowing for a stable second register is narrower when the instrument is already in the first register compared to when it is quiet.

Conclusion: This research enhances comprehension of the mechanical principles behind register transitions in clarinets and could inform future design improvements for better stability in both registers.

Abstract: When playing the clarinet, opening the register hole allows for a transition from the first to the second register, producing a twelfth interval. On an artificial mouth, the blowing pressure range where the second register remains stable can be determined by gradually varying the blowing pressure while keeping the register hole open. However, when the register hole is opened while the instrument is already producing the first register, the range of blowing pressures that lead to a stable second register is narrower than the full stability zone of the second register. This phenomenon is investigated numerically by performing multiple hole openings at different times for each blowing pressure value. The evolution of the probability of reaching the second register is computed, and its relationship with the structure of the basin of attraction of the second register is analyzed.
