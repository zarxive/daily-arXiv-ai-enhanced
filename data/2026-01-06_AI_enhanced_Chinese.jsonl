Current methods rely on bespoke hardware and passive, pre-programmed methodologies that are ill-equipped to capture stochastic failure events. Here, using the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's multi-modal toolkit as a case study, we expose the systemic inability of conventional experiments to capture transient phenomena like dendrite initiation. To address this, we propose Heuristic Operando experiments: a framework where an AI pilot leverages physics-based digital twins to actively steer the beamline to predict and deterministically capture these rare events. Distinct from uncertainty-driven active learning, this proactive search anticipates failure precursors, redefining experimental efficiency via an entropy-based metric that prioritises scientific insight per photon, neutron, or muon. By focusing measurements only on mechanistically decisive moments, this framework simultaneously mitigates beam damage and drastically reduces data redundancy.

However, the standard exponential decay analyses of the detector time-series data are often affected by the strong correlations between the fitted parameters and the sensitivity to detector-related fluctuations and outliers. In this study, we present a robust analysis framework for HPGe detector decay data based on pairwise ratios and the Steiner's most frequent value (MFV) statistic. By forming point-to-point ratios of background-subtracted net counts, the dependence on the absolute detector response is eliminated, removing the amplitude-lifetime correlation inherent to conventional regression. The resulting pairwise lifetime estimates exhibit heavy-tailed behavior, which is efficiently summarized using the MFV, a robust estimator designed for such distributions. For the case study, a long and stable dataset from an HPGe detector was used. This data was gathered during a low-temperature nuclear physics experiment focused on observing the 216 keV gamma-ray line in 97-Ru. Using measurements spanning approximately 10 half-lives, we obtain a mean lifetime of tau = 4.0959 +/- 0.0007 (stat) +/- 0.0110 (syst) d, corresponding to a half-life of T1/2 = 2.8391 +/- 0.0005 (stat) +/- 0.0076 (syst) d.

Here, we introduce a nanodiamond-enabled torsion microscopy (DTM) that integrates nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers as orientation markers with micropillar arrays to decouple and quantify nanoscale rotational and translational motions induced by cells. This approach achieves high precision (~1.47 degree rotational accuracy and ~3.13*10-15 Nm torque sensitivity), enabling reconstruction of cellular torsional force fields and twisting energy distributions previously underestimated. Our findings reveal the widespread presence of torsional forces in cell-matrix interactions, introducing \"cellular mechanical modes\" where different adhesion patterns dictate the balance between traction- and torque- mediated mechanical energy transferred to the substrate. Notably, in immune cells like macrophages that generally exert low linear tractions, torque overwhelmingly dominates traction, highlighting a unique mechanical output for specific cellular functions.

Moreover, we reveal the mechanism of the dependence of the transformation between these two spiral phases with distinct chirality on the strength of the relative coefficient of off-diagonal Gamma interactions in the Ising-Gamma model.

To address this, we investigate emergent dynamical behaviors in a wheel network of R\u00f6ssler and Lorenz oscillators that incorporates both pairwise (1-simplex) and higher-order (2-simplex) interactions under three coupling schemes, namely, diffusive, conjugate, and mean-field diffusive coupling. Our numerical analysis reveals four distinct collective behaviors: synchronization, desynchronization, chimera states, and synchronized clusters. To systematically classify these dynamical behaviors, we introduce two statistical measures that effectively capture synchronization patterns among arbitrarily positioned nodes. Applying these measures across all dynamical models and coupling schemes (six different models in total), we show that both pairwise and higher-order interactions crucially influence the emergence and robustness of chimera states. We observe that under pairwise interaction alone, chimera states appear with high prevalence in specific coupling ranges, though the robustness depends on both the coupling scheme and the underlying dynamical system. Incorporation of higher-order interactions reveals that the higher-order interaction underlying diffusive coupling enhances chimera states in both R\u00f6ssler and Lorenz networks; under conjugate coupling, it strengthens chimera states in Lorenz but instead promotes full synchronization in R\u00f6ssler; and under mean-field diffusive coupling, higher-order interactions generally favor synchronization, particularly for R\u00f6ssler oscillators, but promote chimera in the Lorenz system for the intermediate range of its strengths.

However, the viscosity-density coupling effect often compromises accuracy in high-viscosity liquids. Although various decoupling strategies have been proposed, they often suffer from complexity and inefficiency. This study presents an AlN-based PMUT liquid density sensor insensitive to viscosity interference. The sensor employs two identical PMUTs, functioning as transmitter and receiver, respectively. An ultrasonic wave generated by the transmitter is reflected by the liquid surface and detected by the receiver. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that when the excitation frequency remains constant, the amplitude of the received electrical signal exhibits a specific relationship with liquid density, while the viscosity-induced signal amplitude variation becomes negligible. Therefore, after calibrating the PMUT liquid density sensor by fitting the relationship between received signal amplitude and density across 0-100% glycerol solutions, the device can measure densities within this range regardless of liquid type and viscosity. Experimental results show that the sensor can accurately measure the density of the propylene glycol solutions using the glycerol-calibrated fitting formula, with the calculated density error rate between measured propylene glycol solutions using the glycerol-calibrated fitting formula and actual densities remains below 0.125%, demonstrating measurement insensitivity to viscosity differences between the two liquids. The proposed method achieves maximum error rates of less than 2.5% in high-viscosity environments (80%-100% glycerol solutions), which is 20% that of other density measurement methods based on resonant frequency.

While phase sensing offers enhanced sensitivity compared to conventional spectroscopy methods, this sensitivity often makes systems more vulnerable to external factors such as vibrations, introducing instability and noise. In this work, we demonstrate a broadband and AI-enhanced interferometry method, denoted general polarization common-path interferometry (GPCPI), that relaxes the polarization constraints of traditional common-path interferometry. The polarization decoupling feature enables simultaneous amplitude and phase measurements supplemented with deep neural autoencoders to detect phase anomalies in the spectrum through the analysis of second order derivative mapping of the phase profile, enhancing the accuracy of broadband phase measurements. The approach enables an order of magnitude improvement in phase stability compared to state-of-the-art interferometry techniques, leading to higher accuracy in phase sensing. Plasmonic metasurface phase sensing and hyperspectral single-cell dispersion imaging demonstrate the capability and sensitivity of the method over conventional spectroscopy.

Achieving controllable stability and transitions between distinct topological structures is crucial for practical implementations. In this work, we investigate the effect of uniaxial mechanical strain on a magnetic model on the kagome lattice, focusing on skyrmion stability and emergent topological phases. To this end, we consider a Heisenberg model that includes exchange interactions and both in-plane and out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Using a combination of Spin-Lattice Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore uniaxial strain variations in the range of $-10\\%$ to $10\\%$, showing important effects on the phase diagram. For compressive strain, we find that the density of skyrmions in the skyrmion gas (SkG) phase can be tuned and that the stability of this phase extends to higher temperatures. Tensile strain, in contrast, reduces the number of skyrmions and promotes transitions to other magnetic states. Within this regime, strain levels of about ($\\sim4-6\\%$) lead to a change in topological charge, turning skyrmions ($Q=-1$) into antiskyrmions ($Q=+1$).

We approach the problem in terms of a minimax variational calculation based on the exact Gordon solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom ground state. The full Dirac treatment leads to the result that in an assumed variational state of size $R$, when $R$ minimizes the total energy the magnetic moment of the electron assumes its usual value, $e\\hbar/2mc$, but when $R<\\hbar/mc$, the effective electron magnetic moment becomes essentially $eR/2$, softening the hyperfine interaction and eliminating an energy minumum at small $R$. The magnetic moment of the proton is similarly suppressed, and the hyperfine interaction of a small size atom becomes bounded by the kinetic energy, thus assuring stability. We extend the Dirac variational calculation to positronium where we find simple results for the ground state energy and hyperfiine interaction, and then extend this variational calculation to Coulombic atoms of two fermions of arbitrary masses.

The independence of the threshold size of clusters, corresponding to the beginning of the formation of the hcp phase, from the component composition was revealed.

The size increases with repulsive coupling parameter $\u03b2$ in both potentials. A clear scaling law of the size with $\u03b2^{1/3}$ emerges in the MOND case and is confirmed numerically over a wide parameter range, while for the Newtonian potential no simple scaling law exists as the Thomas-Fermi approximation ceases to be valid. For the dynamics, we derive and solve equations for the monopole collective mode.

Despite their key role in the ergodic theory approach to fluid turbulence, identifying UPOs is challenging for two reasons: chaotic dynamics and the high-dimensionality of the spatial discretization. We address both issues at once by proposing a loop convergence algorithm for UPOs directly within a low-dimensional embedding of the chaotic attractor. The convergence algorithm circumvents time-integration, hence avoiding instabilities from exponential error amplification, and operates on a latent dynamics obtained by pulling back the physical equations using automatic differentiation through the learned embedding function. The interpretable latent dynamics is accurate in a statistical sense, and, crucially, the embedding preserves the internal structure of the attractor, which we demonstrate through an equivalence between the latent and physical UPOs of both a model PDE and the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. This allows us to exploit the collapse of high-dimensional dissipative systems onto a lower dimensional manifold, and identify UPOs in the low-dimensional embedding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0 Navier-Stokes \u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5468\u671f\u8f68\u9053\u3002", "motivation": " turbulence \u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7406\u89e3\u5468\u671f\u8f68\u9053\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": " \u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u548c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u9700\u8981\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u62c5\u5fc3\u6307\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u653e\u5927\u3002", "result": " \u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u5468\u671f\u8f68\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5468\u671f\u8f68\u9053\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": " \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5468\u671f\u8f68\u9053\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3 Turbulence\u3002"}}

Yet, how macroscopic coherence emerges from locally collapsed pairing remains elusive. Here, using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we report the impurity-induced pair breaking in an excitonic insulator Ta2Pd3Te5. Individual Te vacancies are found to generate a pair of spectral peaks within the excitonic gap. Their energies depend sensitively on the defect configurations and are continuously tunable by tip electric field, indicating controllable impurity scatterings. Spectral mapping shows spatially anisotropic and electronically coupled electron-hole components of the subgap states. These observations, together with mean-field modelling, suggest an excitonic pair-breaking origin. In the strongly electron-hole imbalanced region, a secondary pair-breaking effect, manifesting as an additional pair of subgap states with distinctly lower energies, can emerge, presenting the interplay of pairing breakings with different excitonic order parameters. Our findings demonstrate the spectroscopic 'fingerprint' of local excitonic depairing at the atomic level, offering a crucial clue to the critical behavior across excitonic condensation.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates the emergence of macroscopic coherence in excitonic insulators by studying impurity-induced pair breaking in the material Ta2Pd3Te5.

However, its scalability has long been constrained by an intrinsic trade-off between bandwidth and the number of parallel chaotic channels. Here, we introduce a programmable \"chaos-on-comb\" architecture that overcomes this limitation using standard electro-optic components. By heterodyning a delayed-feedback chaotic laser with a continuous-wave reference, a broadband chaotic microwave signal is generated to simultaneously drive a cascaded electro-optic comb, imprinting chaotic dynamics across all comb lines and merging them into an ultra-broadband chaotic continuum. Then, incorporating spectrum slicing enables flexible extraction of parallel chaotic channels with preserved statistical independence and per-channel programmability. As a result, we demonstrate a single-channel ultra-broadband optical chaos with an effective bandwidth of 543.8 GHz, and a broadband terahertz noise source with an excess noise ratio of 52.99 \\pm 2.85 dB to validate its flatness. Furthermore, we employ the uncorrelated parallel chaos for ultrafast photonic decision-making in a 256-armed bandit problem, achieving a favourable power-law scaling exponent of 0.86.

For the design of holographic metasurfaces, traditional algorithms require multiple iterations between the metasurface and target planes, resulting in excessive computation time. Here, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed for the fast design of terahertz three-dimensional (3D) holographic metasurfaces. Trained in a self-supervised manner, the PINN eliminates the need for paired input-label datasets. After training, the PINN enables end-to-end mapping between the target holographic patterns and metasurface structures. Both simulation and experimental results of single-plane and 3D multi-plane holography demonstrate that metasurfaces designed by PINN offer higher imaging quality than traditional iterative algorithms. Moreover, the PINN can find approximate solutions of metasurface structures even in physically counterintuitive scenarios, where the holographic patterns of two parallel imaging planes are completely distinct. Furthermore, the inference process of PINN typically takes less than 1 second, much faster than the traditional algorithms requiring iterative computation. Notably, the PINN simultaneously accounts for both phase and amplitude modulation, thereby outperforming traditional phase-only modulation algorithms in handling complex physical scenarios and offering superior imaging quality. This end-to-end design approach has the potential to pave the way for the realization of high-quality, real-time, and large-scale terahertz 3D holographic display technology.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We adopt a continuum topological field theory description, focusing on twisted $BF$ theories with gauge group $G=\\prod_i \\mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ and an $a \\wedge a \\wedge b$ twisted term. This field theory supports Borromean-Rings braiding and realizes non-Abelian topological order, which for $G=(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ admits a microscopic realization via the $\\mathbb{D}_4$ Kitaev quantum double lattice model. We systematically identify all generalized symmetry operators by extracting conserved currents from the equations of motion. Two distinct classes of currents emerge: type-I currents, which generate invertible higher-form symmetries, and type-II currents, which give rise to non-invertible higher-form symmetries. The non-invertibility originates from projectors accompanying the symmetry operators, which restrict admissible gauge-field configurations. We further analyze the fusion rules of these symmetries, showing that invertible symmetries admit inverses, while non-invertible symmetries fuse through multiple channels. Finally, we study mixed anomalies among these generalized symmetries by simultaneously coupling multiple currents to proper types of background gauge fields and examining their gaugeability. We identify two types of mixed anomalies: one cancellable by topological field theories in one higher dimension, and another representing an intrinsic gauging obstruction encoded in the $(3+1)$D continuum topological field theory...", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The redshift depends on the mass and distance of the black hole, the orbital radius of the photon source, as well as the Hubble constant, directly relating these quantities to astrophysical observables, namely, the redshift and the angular position of the test particle on the sky. We apply for the first time this theoretical model, which accounts for the universe expansion through the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, to real astrophysical systems using megamaser galaxies within the Hubble flow.

Here we propose a new approach which enables the quantum simulation of two-dimensional spin systems with interaction strengths that are increased by orders of magnitude. This, together with the unprecedented longevity of trapped ions, opens an avenue for the exploration of phenomena that take place on long timescales, e.g., slow and collective relaxation in frustrated and kinetically constrained systems.

We investigate how the strong electric and magnetic fields that form this trap affect the properties of the Rydberg states and show that spin-spin interaction strengths on the order of MHz are achievable under experimentally realistic conditions.

Along the way, we develop a general formalism to study Hamiltonian lattice models on nontrivial, compact, flat spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u534a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u6676\u683c\u91cd\u5b50\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u66f2\u9762\u4e0a\u5e03\u7f6e\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bca\u65ad\u6676\u683c\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u2019t Hooft\u5f02\u5e38\u3002\u975e\u6676\u683c\u6781\u9650\u7684\u548c\u6676\u683c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u63a8\u5bfc\u6676\u683c\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u975e\u6676\u683c\u89c4\u8303\u2019t Hooft\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6676\u683c\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u2019t Hooft\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u975e\u6676\u683c\u6781\u9650\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u76f8\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u73af\u9762\u6216\u514b\u83b1\u56e0\u74f6\u4e0a\u5e03\u7f6e\u6676\u683c\u91cd\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6676\u683c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u6676\u683c\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u2019t Hooft\u5f02\u5e38\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6676\u683c\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7d27\u81f4\u3001\u5e73\u5766\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6676\u683c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u6676\u683c\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u2019t Hooft\u5f02\u5e38\u5728\u6676\u683c\u4e0e\u975e\u6676\u683c\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u6676\u683c\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u2019t Hooft\u5f02\u5e38\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6676\u4f53\u5f62\u53d8\u66f2\u9762\u4e0a\u5e03\u7f6e\u6676\u683c\u91cd\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bca\u65ad\u2019t Hooft\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u6676\u683c\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6027\u8d28\u3002"}}

To date, efficiency limitations have prevented scaling quantum dot-based interference to the coalescence of more than two photons at a single beamsplitter. We overcome this limitation by combining a state-of-the-art quantum dot source with deterministic demultiplexing, enabling the direct observation of quantum interference fringes arising from up to four photons. We measure high mean interference contrasts of $93.0 \\pm 0.1~\\%$ for two photons, and $84.1 \\pm 1.0~\\%$ for four photons, with the complex fringe structure fully reproduced by a theoretical model. These results reveal the existence of \"deep fringes\" whose minima are unaffected by distinguishable photons, rendering the maximum contrast of four-photon interference highly sensitive to multi-photon emission but robust against photon distinguishability. We predict that these phenomena will extend to interference of larger numbers of photons, with relevance across a range of potential optical quantum technologies. A Fisher information analysis demonstrates that interference fringes from our source can exhibit phase sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit, illustrating potential applications in quantum metrology.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here we unite these two fields to perform minimally invasive-measurements of high aspect-ratio MEMS resonators using the STM tip as both actuator and detector. Operating at cryogenic temperatures, we resolve acoustic modes of millimeter-scale, high-Q membranes with picometer spatial precision, without making use of lasers or capacitive coupling. The tunneling junction introduces negligible back-action or heating, enabling direct access to the intrinsic dynamics of microgram-mass oscillators. In this work we explore three different measurement modalities, each offering unique advantages. Combined, they provide a pathway to quantum-level readout and exquisite high-precision measurements of forces, displacements, and pressures at cryogenic conditions.

By optically driving the cube to rotation rate near 360 RPM, we observe that its angular velocity does not decay smoothly but instead decreases in discrete steps whenever the instantaneous rotation frequency crosses one of several higher-order mechanical modes. We observe rotational dissipation times on the order of a few days. When a weak counteracting radiation-pressure torque is applied, the system unexpectedly stabilizes at a constant rotation rate that persists for about two days, constituting the mechanical analogue of injection locking.

Despite researches across diverse two-dimensional Wigner platforms, the microscopic melting processes through possible intermediate phases remains largely unknown. Here, we present the visualization of electron-lattice melting in monolayer VCl3 on graphite, where two Wigner crystals coexist with markedly different critical temperatures Tc and lattice periods as stabilized by high magnetic field. One Wigner crystal possesses both record-high Tc and electron density, and undergoes melting through an intermediate nematic phase upon decreasing magnetic field. In contrast, the other Wigner crystal with a lower Tc yields a different intermediate phase during melting, exhibiting an anomalous electron liquid with an energy-independent modulation period. First-principles calculations corroborate the band-selective occupations of interface-transferred electrons in the formation of dual Wigner crystals. Our atomically resolved intermediate phases provide crucial insights into the microscopic melting pathways of Wigner crystals, enabling a phase diagram parameterized by both quantum and thermal fluctuations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Linearizing the field equations around this background, we derive the Klein Gordon equation for the curvature perturbation and show that the scalar propagating mode acquires a mass, highlighting how the same scalar degree of freedom governs inflationary dynamics at high curvature and the propagation of gravitational waves in the current accelerating Universe. Using the scalar vector tensor (SVT) decomposition and a decomposition of the perturbed Ricci tensor, we obtain a set of fully gauge invariant propagation equations that isolate the contributions of the scalar, vector, and tensor modes in the presence of matter. We find that the tensor sector retains the two transverse traceless polarizations of General Relativity, while the scalar sector supports a massive breathing-longitudinal mode determined by the massive scalar propagating mode. Through the geodesic deviation equation, computed both in a local Minkowski patch and in fully covariant de Sitter form, we independently recover the same polarization content and identify its tidal signatures.

Indeed, the former completely ignores the acoustic excitation branch - the phonons - of the superfluid, while the latter explicitly takes it into account, as well as the quantum fluctuations induced by the broken-pair continuum. Unlike the first, the second theory (i) reflects the effect of these collective excitations on the system's equation of state, including at zero temperature, (ii) allows the function $g_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}(\\vec{r},\\vec{r}\\,')$ to go at sufficiently large distances strictly below its asymptotic value $(\u03c1/2)^2$ where $\u03c1$ is the gas density, as expected according to the quantum hydrodynamics of Landau and Khalatnikov at low temperatures, and (iii) predicts in the function $g_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(\\vec{r},\\vec{r}\\,')$ at short distances subdominant contributions $|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}\\,'|^2\\ln|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}\\,'|$ in 3D and $|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}\\,'|^2\\ln(-\\ln|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}\\,'|)$ in 2D, alongside the dominant contributions $|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}\\,'|$ in 3D and $|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}\\,'|^2\\ln|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}\\,'|$ in 2D already present in static BCS theory but with a lower coefficient.

Such platforms promise multichannel dissipationless chiral transport and access to correlated phases beyond the conventional C = 1 paradigm. Here, we discover a family of high-Chern-number orbital magnets in twisted monolayer-multilayer rhombohedral graphene, denoted (1+n) with n = 3, 4, and 5. Magnetotransport measurements show pronounced anomalous Hall effects at one and three electrons per moir\u00e9 unit cell when they are polarized away from the moir\u00e9 interface. Across the (1+n) systems, we observe a clear topological hierarchy C = n, revealed by the St\u0159eda trajectories and the quantized Hall resistance.

To facilitate the mathematical operations in electromagnetic (EM) space, here we propose a space-time coding metasurface (STCM) system capable of directly performing calculus operations on the spatial energy distributions of EM waves. By exploiting harmonic characteristics induced by time-varying coding, the responses of meta-atoms at specific harmonics can be flexibly controlled, which enables the metasurface system to address more complex tasks. Owing to its programmability, the STCM can dynamically switch functions in real time to accommodate different calculus tasks. To fully leverage the capability of STCM, we not only present the space-time coding sequences for differentiation and integration of EM waves, but also develop and numerically simulate the space-time coding sequences that can independently and simultaneously implement different calculus operations on the same incident EM waves. To experimentally validate the feasibility of the EM calculus operations, proof-of-concept experiments are conducted using a programmable 2-bit STCM.

In this work, we examine how specific structural features govern charge storage and explain capacitance variations among carbide-derived carbon (CDC) electrodes. Two key methodological and mechanistic advances are introduced. First, we propose a physically motivated, electric-field-based definition of the ion sphere of influence, which avoids the ambiguity of radial distribution function-based cutoffs and enables a more reliable characterization of local ion--electrode interactions. Second, we introduce an ion-resolved channel-width descriptor that quantifies pore accessibility by identifying the narrowest passage a counter-ion must traverse to enter a pore, directly linking accessibility to ion decoordination. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of supercapacitors comprising realistic CDC electrodes and a room-temperature ionic liquid electrolyte under applied potentials, we show that carbon atoms located at the edges of graphitic sheets consistently accumulate higher charge than basal-plane atoms across all electrode types. The fraction of edge atoms increases with structural disorder and correlates with enhanced capacitance, in agreement with recent experimental findings linking disorder to charge storage. Furthermore, analysis of pore size and channel width reveals that ion decoordination is governed primarily by channel width rather than pore size alone.

The effects of particle diameter, charge rate, and pre-existing notches on the failure behaviour of Si particles were systematically analysed. The results showed that the increase in charge rate, particle diameter, and pre-existing notch length leads to larger cracking rates and faster fracturing of the particle. Then, a validated contour map of Si particle's fracture behaviours was developed. Additionally, the influence of pre-existing notch length and charge rate on fatigue damage was examined, and it was found that longer pre-existing notch length and larger charge rate can shorten the particle's cyclic life. Finally, to alleviate the particle fracture, nanopores were introduced in the particle, and the influence of porosity on the fracture behaviours was investigated. The results showed that nanopores can reduce expansion, dissipate global tensile stresses and elongate the crack propagation path.

This Anderson pseudospin description captures the coherent nonequilibrium dynamics of the coupled electron-lattice system. Numerical simulations reveal three distinct dynamical regimes of the CDW order parameter following a quench-locked oscillations, Landau-damped dynamics, and overdamped relaxation-closely paralleling quench dynamics in BCS superconductors and other electronically driven symmetry-breaking phases. Crucially, however, the presence of dynamical lattice degrees of freedom leads to qualitatively different long-time behavior. In particular, while the oscillation amplitude is reduced in the damped regimes, CDW oscillations do not fully decay but instead persist indefinitely due to feedback from the lattice field. We further show that these persistent oscillations are characterized by a nonequilibrium electronic distribution, which provides an intuitive understanding of both their amplitude and the renormalization of the oscillation frequency relative to the bare Holstein phonon frequency.

We studied geometry optimizations, relative stability, atomization energies, Fermi energy, energy gap, electronic properties, electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, and thermodynamic analysis, along with IR and NMR spectra. Consistently, our findings revealed distinct properties and characteristics among different C36 fullerene isomers. The energetic order of C36 fullerene isomers was established as C36-D3h < C36-C1 < C36-Cs < C36-C2 < C36-D2, a trend unaffected by the encapsulation of oxygen. Notably, the D2 isomer displayed the smallest energy gap, indicating higher electrical conductivity compared to other isomers, while it exhibited the largest gap after encapsulation. Furthermore, we observed that the C1 (D2) isomer exhibited the largest (smallest) Electric dipole moment among the studied C36 isomers, whereas the C2 (D2) isomer demonstrated the largest Electric dipole moment among the O@C36 isomers studied. The encapsulation of oxygen in C36 isomers influenced their properties, including alterations in electronic properties, IR, and NMR chemical shifts. A detailed analysis of BSSE corrections showed the tininess of their impact on the analyzed observables, such that uncorrected and BSSE-corrected calculations led to nearly identical results, confirming the robustness and reliability of the B3LYP/6-31G* approach used in this work and, eventually, in other large and rigid fullerenes systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The two-form is dual to a massless scalar, but the wormhole does not have a semiclassical description in terms of the scalar. There is no contradiction here as the duality between the two-form and the scalar is not a simple transformation of classical fields but involves, in Euclidean signature, a Poisson resummation of the sum over fluxes. Because of the need for this Poisson resummation, the scalar field cannot be treated semiclassically in the wormhole throat.

As transistors are scaled to even smaller dimensions, device channels inevitably enter low-dimensional regimes to achieve higher performance. Low-dimensional materials such as atomically thin oxide semiconductors, 2D van der Waals semiconductors, and 1D carbon nanotubes, have thus emerged as key candidates for extending Moore's law. Here, we reveal the fundamental distinction between three-dimensional and low-dimensional conductors arising from disorder-induced electron localization, which leads to the breakdown of Ohm's law and lateral linear scaling. We develop a quantitative model that captures the role of the disordered region, a unique characteristic intrinsically to low-dimensional transistors. Furthermore, the disorder-induced localization framework consistently explains experimental observations in atomically thin In2O3 field-effect transistors across variations in channel length, temperature, thickness, and post-annealing conditions.

Both techniques allow us to calculate the propagation constants in the general case, without approximations. Various non-circular gyrotropic waveguides are considered. The EIE and CEM results are validated against a commercial finite element solver, and the accuracy and computational performance of both methods are benchmarked.

The radar visibility of a road participant depends on its radar cross-section (RCS). While RCS is an inherent property, enhancing it, similar to using reflective vests for optical visibility, can significantly improve radar detection through cooperative target design. However, modern vehicles are not designed for this purpose, and embedded reflectors are not utilized due to the industry's conservative approach and the limited space available on the vehicle's exterior. Rear windshields offer a vast unused area, but they must still serve their primary function and remain transparent. We propose utilizing this area by embedding a reflecting surface that accounts for the interrogation scenario geometry and the angular tilt of the rear windshield, ensuring the wave is retroreflected back to the radar. The surface is realized as an array of thin conductive wires with a periodicity that provides in-phase excitation for the design incidence angle. Given that automotive radars operate in the millimeter-wave regime (77-81 GHz), large-scale surfaces with sub-millimeter manufacturing accuracy are required. This is achieved by imprinting conductive inks, composed of silver nanoparticles and binders, into grooves in the glass. The fabricated 10x10 sq. sm. sample, with around 90% optical transparency, demonstrates an RCS of 8 sq. m., surpassing the typical RCS of a car. Extrapolating this performance to the entire rear window with an embedded meta grating, a typical RCS of 1000 sq. m. can be achieved, thereby enhancing the detectability range by nearly an order of magnitude.

However, capturing the coupled dynamics of the electromagnetic field and of the mirror within a consistent theoretical framework remains challenging. We analyze the problem of the coupling between classical electromagnetic fields in a cavity and a movable mirror, considering both nonrelativistic and relativistic regimes of motion. Starting from the equations of motion for a mirror subject to a generic external potential, we provide a variational formulation of the mirror-radiation interaction. Within this framework, a single-mode variational approximation is introduced, which captures the essential dynamical features of the coupled system. In the special case of a mirror undergoing free motion, the variational method yields an exact solution. This unified treatment highlights the connection between different dynamical regimes and provides a basis for analyzing applications ranging from precision interferometry to relativistic radiation-pressure effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Phase~II appears for all field directions, although its transport response shows moderate directional dependence.

After a brief review of accelerating Kerr black holes, we study the fundamental equations of the Penrose process in this spacetime, examine the stopping conditions required for the repetitive Penrose process, and obtain corresponding numerical results. The conclusions indicate that, apart from the third law of thermodynamics similar to previous cases, accelerating Kerr black holes exhibit stronger energy extraction capabilities compared to Kerr black holes during the repetitive Penrose process. Moreover, in prior studies, the energy utilization efficiency was difficult to exceed $50\\%$. However, in accelerating Kerr black holes, when the decay radius is relatively small, the energy utilization efficiency can exceed $50\\%$, indicating that the reduced extractable energy primarily transforms into extracted energy rather than irreducible mass. On the other hand, when the initial value of the acceleration factor is large, the extractable energy can decrease to nearly zero, which also differs from the case of Kerr black holes in previous studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Penrose\u8fc7\u7a0b", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a0\u901fKerr\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5bf9Penrose\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u52a0\u901fKerr\u9ed1\u6d1e\u540e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76Penrose\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u505c\u6b62\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c", "result": "\u52a0\u901fKerr\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728Penrose\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc750%\u7684\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u7387", "conclusion": "\u52a0\u901fKerr\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5bf9\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u80fd\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd"}}

Here, using the Manchester Inhomogeneous Radiation Chemistry by Linear Expansions (MIRaCLE) toolkit, we introduce and benchmark a novel approach to simulating these processes. Although the initial conditions are determined stochastically, the subsequent time evolution is calculated deterministically using a continuum representation, derived from those initial conditions. This hybrid approach essentially averages over many chemistry ``trajectories'' simultaneously, often converging to the 1% level in one shot, not requiring multiple runs. We demonstrate this new approach through the calculation of time-dependent G-values for e_{aq}^-$, \\dot{\\mathrm{OH}} and other radiolytic products, including at unprecedented dose rates where calculations which would take years with a conventional Monte Carlo approach can be performed in mere hours on a commercial laptop. We demonstrate that the main artifact of continuum modelling can be mitigated by a correction term. These results establish MIRaCLE as a flexible and efficient platform for modelling long-timescale radiolysis, providing a bridge between Monte Carlo approaches and macroscopic reaction--diffusion schemes, with broad implications for radiation chemistry in medicine, energy, and materials science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86MIRaCLE\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u9ad8\u80fd\u7535\u5b50\u5728\u6c34\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u3001\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MIRaCLE\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u5242\u91cf\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u7269\u79cdG\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u51cf\u5c11\u8fde\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "MIRaCLE\u4e3a\u957f\u65f6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u53cd\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

What exactly is meant by an observer is unclear; it could be anything from a few photons with energy just above the Gibbons-Hawking temperature to a gravitationally bound cluster of galaxies. In a recent note I explained that the need for observers can arise from the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry. This longer paper expands on the subject, filling in conceptual arguments that were implicit but not explicitly stated in the earlier paper.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Its violation signifies the breakdown of a classical Markov description of temporal correlations. In this work, we establish a direct analytical connection between KCC violation and non-Markovianity in open quantum dynamics, revealing how memory effects manifest as departures from classical probabilistic consistency. Within a generic two-level open quantum system framework, we establish quantitative connections between the magnitude of KCC violation and key information-theoretic and thermodynamic quantities, such as mutual information, the Fano factor, heat exchange, and entropy production rate, thereby enabling a thermodynamic interpretation of temporal quantum correlations. Furthermore, we uncover formal correspondences between KCC violation, the Leggett-Garg inequality, and the negativity of the Kirkwood-Dirac quasi-distribution, identifying them as complementary witnesses of temporal quantum non-classicality. Our results thus provide a unified framework linking information-theoretic, thermodynamic, and temporal indicators of quantumness in open quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr":

For this, the focus of recent work has been on introducing controlled lateral gradients across ferromagnet/heavy-metal devices, giving variations in thickness, composition, or interface quality. However, the small gradients achievable with common growth techniques limit both the impact of this approach and understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. Here, spin-orbit torques are patterned on a mesoscopic length scale in tungsten thin films using direct-write laser annealing. Through transmission electron microscopy, resistivity, and second harmonic measurements, the continuous transformation of the crystalline phase of W films from the highly spin-orbit coupled, high resistivity $\u03b2$ phase to the minimally spin-orbit coupled, low resistivity $\u03b1$ phase is tracked with increasing laser fluence. Gradients with different steepness are patterned in the tungsten phase to create spin-orbit torque channels and, when interfaced with CoFeB, tungsten wires with a sufficiently strong gradient can switch the magnetization without an applied magnetic field. Therefore, exploiting the unique microstructure of mixed-phase W allows precise control of the local electronic current density and direction, as well as local spin-orbit torque efficiency, providing a new avenue for the design of efficient spintronic devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper demonstrates a method to create controlled spin-orbit torque patterns in tungsten thin films using laser annealing, achieving magnetization switching without external magnetic fields by leveraging microstructures.", "motivation": "Spintronics aims to use spin-orbit torques for magnetization switching without external fields, but achieving this requires precise control over the microstructure of ferromagnet/heavy-metal devices.

The conventional input cascading filters for harmonic rejection can be eliminated, simplifying the circuit topology and reducing loss. Theoretical analyses were carried out and corresponding equations were formulated for the proposed DBR. For validation, two rectifying circuits with/without the DBR operating at 2.2 GHz were fabricated and tested. Using the proposed DBR at 10 dBm RF power, the suppression of the second and third harmonic powers is enhanced by 18.4 and 7.6 dB, respectively.

Conventional photoacoustic systems rely on externally delivered light and are therefore constrained by optical attenuation, limiting imaging depths to several centimeters. Here, we overcome this constraint using a compact, acoustically powered device that provides optical excitation directly from within the target medium. By exploiting the weak attenuation of low-MHz ultrasound, acoustic energy is transmitted through tissue to wirelessly power a pulsed laser diode. The emitted light pulses generate photoacoustic signals that encode local optical absorption at clinically relevant depths, which could enable imaging in regions such as the gastrointestinal tract that are inaccessible to surface-based illumination.

The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\\langle \u0394_{z}\\rangle/\\langle\u0394_{x(y)}\\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings.

However, creating a quantitatively reliable potential energy surface (PES) for this weakly bound system remains a significant computational challenge. In this work, we present a comprehensive, multi-level investigation of the He-Bz interaction, establishing benchmark energies using high-level coupled-cluster singles-and-doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) methods extrapolated to the complete basis set limit and assessing higher-order (CCSDT(Q)) contributions. We use symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) to benchmark it against CCSD(T) and to decompose the interaction into its physical components-confirming it is dominated by a balance between dispersion and exchange-repulsion. A continuous, three-dimensional PES is constructed from discrete ab initio points using multifidelity Gaussian process regression that combines density functional theory results with sparse coupled-cluster energies. The result is a highly accurate PES with sub-cm-1 accuracy that obeys physical laws. This new PES is applied to path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations to study the solvation of 4He atoms on benzene at low temperatures. Our PIMC results reveal qualitatively different solvation behavior, particularly in the filling of adsorption layers, when compared to simulations using commonly employed empirical Lennard-Jones potentials.

Because the emission intensity is heavily influenced by factors such as defect density and oxidation, it is critical to understand how they affect photoluminescence efficiency. However, due to the time-consuming process of identifying individual monolayers, studies of high-quality exfoliated TMDs have been limited to only a few samples. Here, we present an investigation of excited-state lifetimes and spectra for over 200 WSe$_2$ exfoliated monolayers at room temperature. We find a linear correlation between photoluminescence lifetime and intensity across hundreds of monolayers and within individual monolayers. Results from intentional photooxidation experiments indicate that this correlation is due to photoinduced band-edge carrier traps, which introduce a nonradiative decay pathway that competes with exciton emission. Our work highlights the importance of controlling such traps, as they are the primary limitation of bright photoluminescence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Extensive experimental investigations, together with advanced numerical studies, have now revealed a coherent and internally consistent picture of these phases, substantially deepening our understanding of supersolidity in quantum magnetic materials. Beyond their fundamental interest as exotic quantum states, potential applications in highly efficient demagnetization cooling have been supported by a giant magnetocaloric effect observed in candidate materials. Moreover, the possible dissipationless spin supercurrents could open promising perspectives for spin transport and spintronic applications. In this Review, we summarize recent progress on emergent spin supersolids in frustrated triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnets. We survey experimental evidence from thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements and compare these results with theoretical studies of minimal models addressing global phase diagrams, ground state properties, and collective excitations.

Starting from self-dual Yang--Mills configurations, we restrict to \\emph{symmetric instantons} with spatial rotation symmetry so that dimensional reduction preserves conformal equivalence. This requirement maps $\\mathbb{R}^4$ to curved backgrounds with compact directions and, in particular, identifies the reduced configurations with (i) hyperbolic magnetic monopoles of Atiyah type on $H^3\\simeq \\mathrm{AdS}_3$ (from an $SO(2)\\simeq S^1$ symmetry) and (ii) hyperbolic vortices of Witten--Manton type on $H^2\\simeq \\mathrm{AdS}_2$ (from an $SO(3)\\simeq SU(2)$ symmetry). We provide an explicit field map relating the monopole and vortex variables, enabling a unified treatment of these defects within the original four-dimensional setting. Moreover, the hyperbolic monopole on $H^3$ is completely determined by its holographic data on the conformal boundary $S^2_\\infty$, which reduces a non-Abelian Wilson loop placed on $\\partial H^3$ to an Abelian loop determined by the vortex $U(1)$ field (Abelian dominance and monopole dominance), without further dynamical assumptions beyond the symmetry reduction. In the semiclassical dilute-gas regime of these finite-action defects, the framework yields the Wilson area law, thereby providing analytic support for the dual-superconductor picture of confinement.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Counterdiabatic protocols suppress diabatic excitations in finite-time adiabatic evolution, but their practical application is limited by the non-local structure of the required Hamiltonians and the resource overhead of fully digital implementations. Counterdiabatic terms can be expressed as truncated expansions of nested commutators of the adiabatic Hamiltonian and its parametric derivative. Here, we show how this algebraic structure can be efficiently realized in a digital-analog setting using commutator product formulas. Using native multi-qubit analog interactions augmented by local single-qubit rotations, this approach enables higher-order counterdiabatic protocols whose implementation requires a constant number of analog blocks for any fixed truncation order, independent of system size. We demonstrate the method for two-dimensional spin models and analyze the associated approximation errors.

Here, we realize tunable lateral optical force entirely within a fluid environment by using Janus particles: dielectric microspheres half-coated with gold. We show that the lateral optical force arises from scattering asymmetry induced by the asymmetric structure of the particles; it can be tuned by adjusting the polarization angle of a linearly polarized beam, but also particle parameters including their size and orientation.

The family is indexed by the parameter $\u03b6\\in (0,1]$, which determines the range of the theory via the kinetic term constructed from the graph Laplacian raised to the power $\u03b6$. Specifically, $\u03b6=1$ is the short-range theory, while $0<\u03b6<1$ defines the long-range model. Due to the hyperbolic nature of Bethe lattices, the Laplacian lacks a zero mode and exhibits a spectral gap. We find that upon closing this spectral gap by a modification of the Laplacian, the scalar field theories exhibit novel critical behavior in the form of non-trivial fixed points with critical exponents governed by $\u03b6$ and the spectral dimension $d_s=3$. In particular, our analysis indicates the presence of a Wilson-Fisher fixed point for the short range $\u03b6=1$ theory. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor Ising model on the Bethe lattice is known to exhibit mean-field critical exponents.

Using a reward based on the positive time derivative of the trace distance associated with the Breuer-Laine-Piilo measure, we train PPO and SAC agents and benchmark their performance against gradient-based optimal control theory (OCT). While OCT enhances a single dominant backflow peak, RL policies broaden this revival and activate additional contributions in later memory windows, producing sustained positive trace-distance growth over a longer duration.

In general, the two Hall states with opposite Hall conductivities can be regarded as time-reversal pairs coupled to magnetic order, and switching between them relies on reversing the magnetization via an external magnetic field or electric current. Here, we introduce a approach for manipulating anomalous transport through crystal symmetry engineering in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic systems. Based on symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that 2D altermagnets (AM) with out-of-plane N\u00e9el vectors will not host any anomalous Hall transport. Remarkably, breaking the symmetry connecting the two magnetic sublattices, an anomalous Hall response can emerge immediately, and the signs of the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivities can be flexibly controlled by the symmetry-breaking term, thereby realizing tunable sign-reversible anomalous transport. Furthermore, the feasibility of the theoretical scheme is further verified by explicit lattice-model construction. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the realization of crystal symmetry-controlled anomalous transport in a 2D AM material Cr$_{2}$O$_{2}$. The results indicate that Cr$_{2}$O$_{2}$ with out-of-plane N\u00e9el vectors can sequentially exhibit the AHE and quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) under continuous uniaxial strain. Interestingly, the sign reversal between these two effects can be achieved by simply rotating the strain direction by C$_{4z}$ symmetry. The corresponding ANE and its sign reversal are also revealed. Our findings provide a new strategy to manipulate anomalous transport, and should have significant potential applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, the phase transitions and topological protection in anyonic-PT-symmetric systems are systematically investigated in waveguide lattices. In the symmetry-unbroken regime, the arguments of all bulk eigenvalues are constrained to two discrete values separated by \u03c0, leading to distinctive oscillatory propagation dynamics accompanied by controlled amplification or dissipation. In the case of one-dimensional lattice, the energy bands exhibit a gap closing and reopening during phase transition.

This approach avoids the need for gauge-including atomic orbitals (GIAOs), which are typically required to circumvent the unphysical dependence of the CD rotatory strengths on the arbitrary choice of coordinate origin for length gauge (LG) computations. Benchmark VCD spectra are presented for (P)-hydrogen peroxide, (S)-methyloxirane, (1R, 5R)-\u03b1-pinene, and (1R, 4R)-camphor using Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and density functional theory (DFT) methods across a range of basis sets and compared to those obtained from LG, velocity-gauge (VG), and GIAO computations. These analyses show that for VCD the LG(OI) approach does not converge to the basis-set limit as rapidly as the GIAO approach, but does yield similar quality spectra as GIAO for all major VCD peaks for quadruple-zeta-quality basis sets. The LG(OI) and VG VCD spectra are less reliable compared to GIAOs for smaller basis sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we introduce topologically compact edge states protected by SubSy, featuring extreme two-site localization at boundaries of a lattice, without any decay into the bulk. The compactness arises from local destructive interference at the boundary, while topological protection is ensured by SubSy, characterized by quantized winding numbers. Experimentally, we observe compact edge states in laser-written photonic lattices with engineered rhombic-like unit cells, confirming their robustness against perturbations under both chiral symmetry and SubSy conditions.

For weak Kondo coupling, the spins fractionalize into Majorana fermions comprising a gapless Dirac mode and three gapped visons. Integrating out the visions to second order in the Kondo coupling yields effective electron-electron interactions, including a local Hubbard repulsion, a spin-spin interaction whose sign depends on the Kitaev exchange, and a vertex coupling electrons to Majorana fermions.

Utilizing Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data for Sagittarius A*, and assuming the mass prior derived from stellar dynamics, we place a constraint of $l \\lesssim 0.19$.

Conventional first-order stochastic methods (e.g., Adam) are plagued by slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and numerical instability, preventing NQS from reaching the high accuracy required for fundamental science. We address this fundamental optimization bottleneck by introducing the implicitly restarted Lanczos (IRL) method as the core engine for NQS training. Our key innovation is an inherently stable second-order optimization framework that recasts the ill-conditioned parameter update problem into a small, well-posed Hermitian eigenvalue problem. By solving this problem efficiently and robustly with IRL, our approach automatically determines the optimal descent direction and step size, circumventing the need for demanding hyperparameter tuning and eliminating the numerical instabilities common in standard iterative solvers. We demonstrate that IRL enables shallow NQS architectures (with orders of magnitude fewer parameters) to consistently achieve extreme precision (1e-12 kcal/mol) in just 3 to 5 optimization steps. For the F2 molecule, this translates to an approximate 17,900-fold speed-up in total runtime compared to Adam.

Recently, a framework was introduced aiming at extending the thermodynamic formalism to genuine quantum settings, also referred to as autonomous quantum systems: free from external controls, only quantum systems interacting with each other. In this paper, we apply such a thermodynamic framework to common experimental situations of interacting quantum systems. In situations where traditional frameworks detect only heat exchanges, the recent autonomous thermodynamic framework points at work exchanges based on two mechanisms: population inversion and coherence generation / consumption. Such mechanisms are well known in the literature for being related to work expenditure and extraction, in particular in relation with ergotropy, which emphasizes the relevance of the autonomous framework and the limitations of traditional ones. Furthermore, the autonomous framework also identifies a genuine non-unitary mechanism of work exchange related to athermality. %, also pointed out as a resource for work extraction. Finally, in the semi-classical limit, the autonomous framework identifies all energy exchanges as pure work, but distinguishes between local work and interaction energy.\n  Our results show that the autonomous framework provides a refined analysis of work exchange mechanisms in the quantum realm and serves as a consistent approach to analyze thermodynamic processes in realistic quantum devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper compares traditional and autonomous quantum thermodynamic frameworks, showing that the latter reveals new work mechanisms in quantum systems, particularly in semi-classical limits.", "motivation": "Understanding work exchange in quantum systems is crucial for developing efficient quantum devices.", "method": "The paper applies the autonomous framework to analyze energy exchanges in quantum systems, focusing on mechanisms like population inversion and coherence.", "result": "Autonomous framework highlights additional work mechanisms beyond traditional models, especially in semi-classical contexts.", "conclusion": "The study suggests that autonomous thermodynamics offers a more nuanced view for quantum device optimization."}}

We further develop a readout architecture combining spin-to-charge conversion with RF reflectometry on a proximal charge sensor, supported by a cryogenic RF chain optimized for operation at $1$-$4~\\mathrm{K}$. Finally, we outline the cryogenic measurement environment, tuning procedures, and a stepwise benchmarking program targeting single-qubit control, phonon-bandgap suppression of relaxation channels, and resolvable phonon-mediated two-qubit coupling. The resulting module provides a scalable template for medium-range coupling of Ge hole-spin qubits and connects materials and phonon engineering with circuit-level readout, enabling future experimental demonstrations of entangling gates, Bell-state generation, and phonon-enabled quantum sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this context, we consider a zigzag-ordered antiferromagnet with both extended Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) in presence of an external magnetic field to focus on the topological phases demonstrated by the magnon band structure and validated by the transport properties. The hybridization between the up- and down-spin sectors carries evidences of opening bulk gaps in the magnon band structure, giving rise to nontrivial topological phases characterized by finite Chern numbers, chiral edge modes, and a nonzero thermal Hall conductivity. Furthermore, generally speaking, a finite magnon orbital moment can exist and contribute to the Nernst response even when the net spin moment vanishes owing to the fundamental independence of the spin and orbital magnetizations. This motivates us to investigate the magnon orbital moment, orbital Berry curvature, and the resulting orbital Nernst conductivity associated with the magnon bands. We find that a giant orbital Nernst conductivity emerges even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Moreover, the distinction between different topological phases is more lucidly manifested via the orbital Nernst conductivity, thereby highlighting an enhanced sensitivity of the orbital transport to the underlying band topology. For completeness, we briefly discuss the scenario corresponding to a N\u00e9el-ordered spin alignment, which leads to a vanishing Chern number and consequently suppressed thermal Hall and orbital Nernst conductivities compared to the zigzag-ordered case, even in the presence of DMI and Kitaev interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u7ef4 spin-orbit \u8026\u5408\u548c\u5916\u78c1\u573a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u4e00\u7ef4\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u663e\u793a\u51fa Giant \u7f51\u7edc\u8fd0\u8f7d\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u5c5e\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u548c\u8868\u89c2\u8fd0\u8f7d\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u5408 Kitaev \u548c Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya \u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5f02\u5411Heisenberg\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u78c1\u573a\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u78c1\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u80fd\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u5c55\u5f00\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u548c\u8fd0\u8f7d\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec Chern-number \u4e0d\u4e3a\u96f6\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u51c6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa Giant \u8fd0\u8f7d\u4f53\u7387\u7b49\u663e\u8457\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bfe\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Currently, this parameter remains unknown for many materials, and experimental means available for its measurement are considerably lacking. Meanwhile, it remains an unclear issue whether the mean free path of the photogenerated high-energy hot carriers is significantly different from that of the localequilibrium-state carriers near the Fermi surface or around the band edge. Based on the concept of transient grating Fourier transform and utilizing a virtual lock-in amplification technique, we proposed and demonstrated an efficient experimental technique for measuring the mean free path of photocarriers. This method has facilitated direct observation of the photocarrier transport behavior across the transition between diffusive and ballistic motion, from which we surprisingly find that the mean free path of photogenerated hot carriers in Silicon membrane and GaAs quantum well can reach micron scale, more than an order of magnitude larger compared to the electrically-measured one.

Our result show that for the non-rotating case, the shadow remains perfectly circular, with its radius independent of the deformation parameter. For the rotating case, the size of the shadow decreases as the deformation parameter decreases, and the shape of the shadow gradually becomes more flattened. It is worth noting that while the shadow of a rotating black hole remains north-south symmetric for equatorial observers, this symmetry is broken once the observer moves away from the equatorial plane. For an observer in the northern hemisphere, the geometric center of the shadow shifts northward when $D_0<0$ and southward when $D_0>0$, while the opposite behavior occurs for observers in the southern hemisphere. These features in the black hole shadow originating from the scalar field could help us to understand the circular disformal Kerr black hole and generalized scalar-tensor framework of Horndeski gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The computations are performed at the relative 2.5PN order. Using the dynamics derived in the companion paper, we first derive the radiated energy and angular momentum, from which we deduce the equations describing the secular evolution of the orbital elements. We numerically solve for the secular dynamics for various systems. We find that the eccentric corrections to tidal terms induce a dephasing that could potentially be detectable in some regions of the parameter space of gravitational wave sources.

We employ tensor network methods to study such dynamics using interacting scalar and gauge theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, subject to a quench modeling a homogeneously expanding gravitational background. The models considered are the scalar $\u03bb\u03c6^4$ theory and the Schwinger model, i.e. a Dirac fermion coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field which is equivalent via bosonization to a scalar field with a cosine self-interaction. In the free scalar limit, both theories reproduce known analytical results, providing a nontrivial numerical validation of bosonization in curved spacetime for the Schwinger model. Our central finding is that self-interactions lead to a suppression of gravitational particle production compared to the free-field case, as evidenced by two-point functions and the spectra of produced particles. We further examine the behavior of entanglement generation and find that interactions suppress entanglement growth in the $\u03bb\u03c6^4$ theory, while in the Schwinger model, the interplay between suppressed particle production and enhanced inter-particle correlations leads to more complex entanglement behavior.

In this Letter, we introduce a powerful framework, termed multi-bipartition entanglement tomography, which probes the fine structure of entanglement across an exhaustive ensemble of distinct bipartitions. Our cornerstone is the discovery of a ``bond-additive law'', which reveals that the entanglement entropy can be precisely decomposed into a bulk volume-law baseline plus a geometric correction formed by a sum of local contributions from crossed bonds of varying ranges. This law distills complex entanglement landscapes into a concise set of entanglement bond tensions $\\{\u03c9_j\\}$, serving as a quantitative fingerprint of interaction locality. By applying this tomography to Hamiltonian dynamics, random quantum circuits, and Floquet dynamics, we resolve a fundamental distinction between thermalization mechanisms: Hamiltonian thermalized states retain a persistent geometric imprint characterized by a significantly non-zero $\u03c9_1$, while this structure is completely erased in random quantum circuit and Floquet dynamics.

Photoacoustic spectroscopy has proven to combine high sensitivity with appealing features like compactness, wavelength-independent and background-free detection. To date, photoacoustic sensing has mostly been focused on high-pressure applied trace-gas analysis, while accessing the low-pressure regime has been considered not compatible with efficient acoustic wave propagation. However, sensing gas samples at low pressure is the key to get access to high-resolution spectroscopy. Here, we demonstrate that sub-Doppler saturation spectroscopy can be performed on low-pressure trace gases in a cavity-enhanced photoacoustic sensor with mW-level mid-infrared radiation. Moreover, we show that the same setup can be operated at higher pressure, enabling trace-gas detection with 5 parts-per-billion sensitivity with a laser power as low as 35 microwatts.

Further, we investigate the phase transitions and critical phenomena in Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes at the critical points. Such black holes are characterized by its mass ($M$), the dilaton charge ($Q$), and the negative cosmological constant, $\u039b(<0)$. We define a dimensionless parameter $\u03b5=\\bar{J}/{\\bar{Q}^2}$ and express the mass, temperature, volume, and Gibbs free energy in terms of $\u03b5$ and its polynomials. Moreover, we numerically fit the data for the critical points and find that in the appropriate limit, the expressions for critical points would correspond to the respective critical points of the Kerr-AdS black hole thermodynamics. Such a study involves a systematic analysis of temperature, Gibbs free energy, and volume in the extended phase space. We provide an analytical verification of the nature of the phase transitions at the critical points by introducing the Ehrenfest equations. We also check that all three quantities, e.g., the specific heat at constant pressure, $C_P$, the volume expansion coefficient, $\u03b1$, and the isothermal compressibility, $\u03ba_T$, diverge at the critical points. We find the $Prigogine$-$Defay$ ratio using the expressions of $C_P$, $\u03b1$, and $\u03ba_T$, and find that it identically equals unity. Hence, the phase transition behavior of the Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes at their critical points is of second order. In addition, we propose investigating the energy extraction process via the Penrose process.

However, it leads to another tension in the form of a factor of two correction in Hawking's temperature. This discrepancy is concerning because the Rindler temperature is universal and complies with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

In contrast to many existing quantum linear solvers, our method does not rely on oracle access to query entries, relaxing a key practicality bottleneck. In particular, when the rank of the system of interest is sufficiently small and the rows of the matrix of interest admit an appropriate structure, we achieve circuit complexity $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\log m\\right)$, where $m$ is the number of variables and $\\varepsilon$ is the target precision, without dependence on the sparsity $s$, and could possibly be without explicit dependence on condition number $\u03ba$. This shows a significant improvement over previous quantum linear solvers where the dependence on $\u03ba,s$ is at least linear. At the same time, when the rows have an arbitrary structure and have at most $s$ nonzero entries, we obtain the circuit depth $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\log s\\right)$ using extra $\\mathcal{O}(s)$ ancilla qubits, so the depth grows only logarithmically with sparsity $s$.

In quantum information theory, the quantum mutual information, $I(A;B)$, is a measure of correlation between the subsystems $A,B$ in a quantum state, and is defined by the means of the von Neumann entropy: $I\\left(A;B\\right)=S\\left(\u03c1_{A}\\right)+S\\left(\u03c1_{B}\\right)-S\\left(\u03c1_{AB}\\right)$. However, such a computation requires an exponential amount of resources. This is a defining feature of quantum systems, the infamous ``curse of dimensionality'' . Other measures, which are based on R\u00e9nyi divergences instead of von Neumann entropy, were suggested as alternatives in a recent paper showing them to possess important theoretical features, and making them leading candidates as mutual information measures.

Increasing nonlinearity drives a sequence of topological transitions signaled by the appearance of characteristic swallowtail band structures at intermediate interaction strengths and band swapping in the strong nonlinear regime. The band swapping results in quantized fractional windings and double-period Bloch oscillations that are closely related to discrete time crystals.

This review presents a mechanism-based classification of SPEs, offering a physics-oriented framework to clarify the performance limitations of conventional sources, including quantum emitters and nonlinear optical processes. Particular attention is given to hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite quantum dots (HOIP QDs), which provide size- and composition-tunable emission with narrow linewidths and room-temperature operation. Through comparative analysis of physical mechanisms and performance metrics, we show how HOIP QDs may address key limitations of established SPE platforms. Recognizing the constraints of current deterministic sources, we introduce a performance framework to guide the development of scalable SPEs, and examine the theoretical potential of bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) states, discussing how BSV mechanisms could serve as a promising avenue for multiplexable, high-purity photon generation beyond conventional heralded schemes. The review concludes by outlining future directions for integrating HOIP- and BSV-based concepts into scalable quantum photonic architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u53d1\u751f\u5668\uff08SPEs\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u73b0\u72b6\u53ca\u5176\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6280\u672f\u7a81\u7834\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u53d1\u751f\u5668\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6d4b\u63a7\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u5176\u53d1\u5c55\u4ecd\u53d7\u5236\u4e8e\u7eaf\u5ea6\u3001istinguishability\u548c\u53ef\u8c03\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u91c7\u7528\u673a\u5236\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6709\u673a-\u65e0\u673a\u6742\u8d28\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\n\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709SPE\u5e73\u53f0\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5149\u91cf\u5b50\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u6e90\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "HOIP QDs\u901a\u8fc7\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u7ec4\u6210\u53ef\u8c03\u6027\u3001\u7a84\u7ebf\u5bbd\u4ee5\u53ca\u5ba4\u6e29\u5de5\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5149\u91cf\u5b50\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u6e90\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c06\u4eae\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u96f6\u5149\u5b50\u6001\uff08BSV\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9ad8\u7eaf\u5ea6\u5149\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5c06HOIP\u548cBSV\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While quantum error correction (QEC) can suppress noise, its use in quantum sensing is constrained by stringent requirements, including prior noise characterization, restrictive signal-noise compatibility conditions, and measurement-based syndrome extraction with global control. Here we introduce an ICO-based QEC protocol, providing the first application of indefinite causal order (ICO) to QEC. By coherently placing auxiliary controls and noisy evolution in an indefinite causal order, the resulting noncommutative interference enables an auxiliary system to herald and correct errors in real time, thereby circumventing the limitations of conventional QEC and restoring HL scaling. We rigorously establish the protocol for single- and multi-noise scenarios and demonstrate its performance in single-qubit, many-body, and continuous-variable platforms. We further identify regimes in which error correction can be implemented entirely by unitary control, without measurements. Our results reveal ICO as a powerful resource for metrological QEC and provide a broadly applicable framework for noise-resilient quantum information processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

THz radiation is produced by optical rectification in stoichiometric MgO:LiNbO$_3$ using a line-focus geometry, yielding single-cycle pulses of 55 - 92 nJ energy with peak electric fields of 37 - 90 kV/cm. Electro-optic sampling and beam-quality measurements reveal tunable control between central frequency, bandwidth and field amplitude by translating the generation region transversely within the crystal. Using shorter pump pulses preserves THz conversion efficiency, while longer pulses at 100 kHz reduce THz output by up to a factor of four due to cumulative thermal effects. Femtosecond 257.5 nm UV pulses are generated by cascaded fourth-harmonic generation in $\u03b2$-barium borate with conversion efficiencies exceeding 10% at 40 kHz and stable operation up to 600 kHz.

By introducing a non-minimal coupling between a bulk scalar field and the Ricci scalar, we obtain analytic solutions under a flat, four-dimensional Poincar\u00e9-invariant metric with a kink-like scalar configuration. The warp factor exhibits a bell-shaped profile, while the scalar potential forms a symmetric volcano-like structure, characteristic of a finite-thickness brane. The corresponding energy density is regular and localized, featuring a central peak with symmetrically placed negative minima. Through the analysis of linear tensor perturbations, we derive a Schr\u00f6dinger-like equation with supersymmetric factorization, ensuring the absence of tachyonic modes and thus the stability of the background configuration. The effective potential also takes a volcano-like form that supports a localized graviton zero mode, confirming the recovery of four-dimensional gravity on the brane. A numerical study of the massive Kaluza--Klein spectrum reveals the progressive delocalization of massive modes into the bulk.\n  Our results demonstrate a stable and physically consistent thick brane configuration within the Palatini gravity framework, offering new insights into gravity localization and braneworld phenomenology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728Palatini\u91cd\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u539a\u58f3\u72b6-brane\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408 bulk\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u4e0eRicci\u6807\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u76f4\u76844D Poincar\u00e9\u4e0d\u53d8\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\uff0c\u5305\u542bkink\u6807\u91cf\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u6446\u7ebf\u578b\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u52bf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2d\u592e\u6ce2\u5cf0\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002\u7ebf\u6027\u5f15\u529b\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u65e0tachyonic\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u80cc\u666f\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f00\u59cb\u53d1\u751f\u6563\u7126\u5230 Bulk\uff0c\u6807\u91cf\u8c31\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6700\u5927\u5355\u8272\u957f\u5ea6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c Braneworld \u7406\u8bba\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c Braneworld \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bae\u9898\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22 Palatini \u91cd\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u539a\u58f3\u72b6-brane \u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u523b\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5316\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u6563\u7126\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a Braneworld \u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 Palatini \u91cd\u529b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u4eff\u5c04\u8fde\u7cfb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5f15\u5165 bulk \u6807\u91cf\u573a\u4e0e Ricci \u6807\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u5728\u5e73\u76f4 4D Poincar\u00e9 \u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u3002\u5206\u6790\u6446\u7ebf\u578b\u94fa\u6392\u3001kink\u6807\u91cf\u914d\u7f6e\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u8c31\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u5f15\u529b\u6270\u52a8\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 supersymmetric \u56e0\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa Schr\u00f6dinger \u7c7b\u578b\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd tachyonic \u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u5f0f\u9010\u6e10\u6563\u7126\u5230Bulk\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u539a\u58f3\u72b6-brane \u89e3\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6446\u7ebf\u578b\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u52bf\u548c\u4e2d\u592e\u6ce2\u5cf0\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002\u5f15\u529b\u96f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u4e14\u80fd\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u3002\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a k \u9636\u6570\u7684\u6563\u7126\u7387\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5728 Palatini \u91cd\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u9996\u6b21\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u539a\u58f3\u72b6-brane \u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u8be5\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u523b\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u4e3a Braneworld \u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6a21\u5f0f\u9010\u6e10\u6563\u7126\u5230 Bulk \u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u591a\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}

To isolate and identify different features of the source, multipole expansion of radiation field as well as that of the source distribution is crucial. Unlike the waves on Minkowski background, those on de Sitter background do not have a convenient, close form relation among these multipoles of arbitrary order to draw general conclusions. This requires truncation to some multipole order to be employed and a consistency issue arises. This was flagged in \\cite{CHK} as emergence of disallowed $log(r)$ terms in certain asymptotic forms and a particular quadrupolar truncation was proposed which was consistent with the source conservation.\n  In \\cite{NKD80}, it was noticed that a truncated solution while satisfying the wave equation, may fail to satisfy the gauge condition. Truncation in a fully gauge fixed form should not generate the unwanted $log(r)$ terms. In this work, we clarify the consistency issue and also correct a couple of erroneous statements in \\cite{NKD80}. The consistency is analyzed by explicitly integrating the gauge conditions and the source conservation equations over the conformal time. This gives a general procedure for a consistent truncation.

Across these problems, our method inherently satisfies all constraints by construction, converges faster, and achieves higher Approximation Ratios than penalty-based QAOA, while requiring roughly half as many gates.

The dynamics are governed by a master equation derived from an effective Hamiltonian that includes cavity decay.To obtain analytical solutions, the system's quantum state is expanded in the Fock basis up to the two-photon level. Solving the steady-state Schrodinger equation yields probability amplitudes and the analytical conditions for optimal photon blockade. Results confirm that photon blockade is achievable with suitable parameters. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical solutions and numerical simulations for the steady-state, equal-time second-order correlation function, validating both the analytical method and the blockade effect.Numerically, the average intracavity photon number increases significantly under resonance, providing a theoretical pathway for enhancing single-photon source brightness. Furthermore, the driving phase is shown to regulate the optimal blockade region: it shifts the parabolic region within the two-dimensional parameter space of driving strength and OPA nonlinearity and can even reverse its opening direction.The influence of Kerr nonlinearity is also examined. Photon blockade remains robust across a wide range of Kerr strengths. Physical analysis attributes the effect to destructive quantum interference between two distinct excitation pathways that suppress two-photon states.

Besides, laboratory analogue models are employed to study the effects of curved spacetime and explore the design of optical devices. Here, applying the framework of analogue gravity, we reveal the behavior of the optical echo from a pulsed point-like source near a black hole, which is strongly dependent on the interplay of the black hole's photon sphere and the source's duration. We model the Schwarzschild spacetime as a Flamm paraboloid and calculate the echo response, using analytical geodesic solutions and the Huygens-Fresnel principle. Particularly, when the spatial scale of pulse duration is comparable to the photon sphere, continuous ``echo tails\" appear along bright interference fringes in temporal response. Analysis in both the temporal and frequency domains reveals that these echo tails are a signature of resonance between the incoming pulse and the photon sphere.

However, free electrons generally only absorb/emit one photon at a time, while the physical mechanism and phenomena of free electron-two-photon interaction have not been studied yet. Moreover, the relationship between PINEM and Kapitza-Dirac (KD) effect and nonlinear Compton scattering is still unclear. Here we develop the full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction considering the two-photon process. It is revealed that the emission/absorption of two photons by electrons can be greatly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of optical near field, and the quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes can occur in some circumstances, which affects the photon number state, electron energy states and electron-photon entanglement. Meanwhile, it is found that the KD effect (elastic electron-photon scattering) and nonlinear Compton scattering (inelastic electron-photon scattering) are also a kind of two-photon process and the distribution of electrons can be deduced analytically based on the full quantum theory.

Eccentricity and spin-precession are two key observables to infer the origin of a gravitational wave (GW) source. The interpretation of GW source parameters can be plagued by degeneracy, such as the well-known degeneracy between mass and spin. As the field has explored new parameters, questions have been raised about possible degeneracies between eccentricity and spin-precession. Although some state-of-the-art models now include these effects individually, models that incorporate spin-precession and eccentricity are only in their infancy. Until models faithfully cover the complete parameter space of compact binary coalescence, our ability to correctly measure the source parameters and infer the formation of the binary is compromised. Here, we present a study of the distinguishability of these two key parameters. Our work finds that there is indeed a degeneracy between eccentricity and spin-precession; however, it is a highly localized effect. We find that the misidentified eccentricity estimates get worse as the signal gets shorter. Additionally, this misidentification is highly sensitive to the inclination angle of the source system. We provide quantifiable estimates of the potency of this degeneracy in addition to identifying some of the regions of parameter space where this degeneracy exists.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8f68\u9053\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u8fdb\u52a8\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u9000\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u786e\u5b9a\u6e90\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e8c\u4f53\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8303\u56f4\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5f97\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u53c2\u6570\u95f4\u7684\u9000\u5316\u6027\u5bf9\u5206\u6790\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u8fdb\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u8fdb\u52a8\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u9000\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u9000\u5316\u6548\u5e94\u968f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u51cf\u77ed\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4ef0\u89d2\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8986\u76d6\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8c\u4f53\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u3002"}}

In this paper, we investigate how much we can improve upon the standard performance guarantee assuming the initial state is supported on a low-energy subspace.

Technically, we derive the low-energy simulation error with commutator scaling for product formulas by leveraging adiabatic perturbation theory to analyze the time-variant energy spectrum of the underlying Hamiltonian.

In classical computation, a substantial body of work has focused on gradient acceleration, with gradient-adjusted algorithms derived from underdamped Langevin dynamics providing quadratic acceleration over conventional Langevin algorithms.\n  Since both search and sampling algorithms are designed to address learning tasks, we study learning relationship between coined quantum walks and underdamped Langevin dynamics.

This paper examines under which conditions a classical fluid model may reproduce the most basic mathematical formalism of both theories. By assuming that the angular momentum of an irrotational vortex in an inviscid, barotropic, isothermal fluid with sound speed c is equal in magnitude to the reduced Planck constant, and incorporating Korteweg capillary stress, a complex wave equation describing the momentum and continuity equations of a Euler-Korteweg vortex is obtained. When uniform convection is introduced, the weak field approximation of this wave equation is equivalent to Schr\u00f6dinger's equation. The model is shown to yield classical analogues to de Broglie wavelength, the Einstein-Planck relation, the Born rule and the uncertainty principle. Accounting for the retarded propagation of the wavefield of a vortex in convection produces the Lorentz transformation and the Klein-Gordon equation, with Schr\u00f6dinger's equation appearing as the low-Mach-number limit.

We also provide a comparison to Bohmian mechanics: while in the absence of detectors, the arrival times and places of the Bohmian trajectories on the sphere of radius $R$ have asymptotic distribution density given by the same formula as $\u03c3$, their deviation from the detection times and places is not necessarily small, although it is small compared to $R$, so the effect of the presence of detectors on the particle can be neglected in the far-field regime.

It determines the optimal on/off status and dispatch of generating units while satisfying system, operational, and market constraints. Traditionally, UC has been solved using mixed-integer programming, dynamic programming, or metaheuristic methods, all of which face scalability challenges as systems grow in size and uncertainty. Recent advances in quantum computing, spanning quantum annealing, variational algorithms, and hybrid quantum classical optimization, have opened new opportunities to accelerate UC solution processes by exploiting quantum parallelism and entanglement. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing research on the applications of quantum computing for solving the UC problem. The reviewed works are categorized based on the employed quantum paradigms, including annealing-based, variational hybrid, quantum machine learning, and quantum-inspired methods.

Motivated by this question, we study the learnability and cryptographic applications of random open-system dynamics generated by Lindblad-Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan (GKSL) master equations. Working in the affine hull of the GKSL cone, we introduce physically motivated ensembles of random local Lindbladians via a linear parametrisation around a reference generator. On top of this geometric structure, we extend statistical query (SQ) and quantum-process statistical query (QPStat) frameworks to the open-system setting and prove exponential (in the parameter dimension $M$) lower bounds on the number of queries required to learn random Lindbladian dynamics. In particular, we establish average-case SQ-hardness for learning output distributions in total variation distance and average-case QPStat-hardness for learning Lindbladian channels in diamond norm. To support these results physically, we derive a linear-response expression for the ensemble-averaged total variation distance and verify the required nonvanishing scaling in a random local amplitude-damping chain. Finally, we design two Lindbladian physically unclonable function (Lindbladian-PUF) protocols based on random Lindbladian ensembles with distribution-level and tomography-based verification, thereby providing open-system examples where learning hardness can be translated into cryptographic security guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we carry out an in-depth quantum information investigation, deploying two distinct models: The first, semiclassical model can violate the quantum Cramer-Rao bound by several orders of magnitude for weak dissipation and large atom numbers, invalidating the semiclassical approach in this parameter regime. The second model, describing the atoms as a collective spin, respects the Cramer-Rao bound for all parameters. Interestingly, the collective model also predicts Heisenberg scaling for the quantum Fisher information. The comparison of both models shows that Heisenberg scaling is a result of measurement-induced quantum correlation in an otherwise non-interacting quantum system. As the Heisenberg scaling appears in a stationary state of a macroscopic quantum system, it can be thus viewed as a new paradigm in quantum sensing. Intriguingly, the comparison of both models with experimental data can constitute a test for the foundations of quantum mechanics in a macroscopic ensemble of atoms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By applying a parametric drive to a common qubit at precise detunings relative to computational qubits, we directly produce two-, three-, and four-qubit entanglement with state fidelities of 99.4\\%\\pm0.2\\%, 93.4\\%\\pm0.3\\%, and 91.4\\%\\pm0.3\\%, respectively.

This survey offers a comprehensive overview of Bargmann invariants, with a particular focus on their role in shaping the informational geometry of the state space. The core of this review demonstrates how these invariants serve as a powerful tool for characterizing the intrinsic geometry of the space of quantum states, leading to applications in determining local unitary equivalence and constructing a complete set of polynomial invariants for mixed states. Furthermore, we explore their pivotal role in modern quantum information science, specifically in developing operational methods for entanglement detection without the need for full state tomography.

In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This study focuses on hidden information extraction under undetermined signal bits, revealing that most such QPQ protocols face severe security threats even without complex quantum resources.

Despite extensive empirical observations, it remains unclear which features of degenerate ground states are preferentially sampled and why by QA. Here we analyze the final states using degenerate perturbation theory to characterize the preference among them. In this analysis, the adjacency matrix of the graph composed by the ground states naturally emerges, and we can predict the eigenvector centralities (one of the node centralities) are related to the probabilities of these states. We verify this prediction on toy models where degeneracy is lifted at first and second order, and we show that second-order weights encode local barrier information, relating sampling fairness to the flatness of the local energy landscape. Finally, this perspective suggests two practical routes toward fair sampling -- promoting connectivity of the graph and reducing heterogeneity of centralities -- and we illustrate consistency with higher-order drivers and minor-embedding transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates why transverse-field quantum annealing (QA) samples certain degenerate ground states and proposes a method using degenerate perturbation theory to predict state sampling based on eigenvector centralities.", "motivation": "Understanding the sampling behavior of QA for degenerate ground states is crucial for optimizing quantum annealing algorithms for practical applications, especially in fields requiring multiple optimal solutions.", "method": "The authors employ degenerate perturbation theory to analyze the adjacency matrix of the graph formed by degenerate ground states, leading to a prediction about eigenvector centralities affecting state probabilities.

Here we reveal the physical meaning of these mathematical achievements for the quantum mechanical transition probability. We show that this transition probability features a maximum degree of homogeneity in all simple Euclidean Jordan algebras, which includes common finite-dimensional Hilbert space quantum theory. The atomic parts of these algebras or, equivalently, the extreme boundaries of their state spaces can be characterized by purely topological means.

Here, we explore a practical approach to harnessing QZD for robust quantum metrology. By introducing strong inter-particle interactions during the parameter encoding stage, we overcome the typical limitations of previous QZD studies, which have largely focused on single-particle systems and faced challenges where QZD could interfere with the encoding process. We experimentally validate the proposed scheme on a nuclear magnetic resonance platform, achieving near-optimal precision scaling under amplitude damping in both parallel and sequential settings. Numerical simulations further demonstrate the scalability of the approach and its compatibility with other control techniques for suppressing more general types of noise.

They provide a vital tool for studying quantum randomness and have found broad applications in quantum technologies. However, existing research has focused on discrete ensembles, despite that many physical processes, such as in quantum chaos, thermalization, and control, naturally involve continuous ensembles generated from continuous time-evolution. Here we initial the study of continuous unitary designs, addressing fundamental questions about their construction and practical utility. For single-qubit system, we construct explicit unitary 1-design paths from spherical 2-design curves and Hopf fibration theory. For arbitrary dimensions, we develop two systematic construction frameworks, one based on topological bundle theory of the unitary group and the other based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group. On the practical front, our unitary design paths provide analytical solutions to universally robust quantum control. Simulations show they outperform conventional pulse techniques in mitigating arbitrary unknown static noises, demonstrating immediate utility for quantum engineering. Extending unitary designs to the continuous domain not only introduces powerful geometric and topological tools that complement conventional combinatorial and group-theoretic methods, but also enhances experimental feasibility over discrete counterparts which usually involve instantaneous pulses. As an outlook, we anticipate that this work will pave the way for using continuous unitary designs to explore complex quantum dynamics and devise quantum information protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u62d3\u6251\u4e1b\u548cHeisenberg-Weyl\u7fa4\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5355\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u7ef4\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fde\u7eed\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, the unavoidable crosstalk between qubits in current noisy processors impedes the achievement of high gate fidelities and renders full Hilbert-space control optimization prohibitively difficult. Here, we overcome this challenge by reducing the full-system optimization to crosstalk-robust control over constant-sized subsystems, which dramatically reduces the computational cost. Our method effectively eliminates the leading-order gate operation deviations induced by crosstalk, thereby suppressing error rates. Within this framework, we construct analytical pulse solutions for parallel single-qubit gates and numerical pulses for parallel multi-qubit operations. We validate the proposed approach numerically across multiple platforms, including coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers, a nuclear-spin processor, and superconducting-qubit arrays with up to 200 qubits. As a result, the noise scaling is reduced from exponential to linear for parallel single-qubit gates, and an order-of-magnitude reduction is achieved for parallel multi-qubit gates. Moreover, our method does not require precise knowledge of crosstalk strengths and makes no assumption about the underlying qubit connectivity or lattice geometry, thereby establishing a scalable framework for parallel quantum control in large-scale quantum architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We investigate the question of maximal correlations analogous to the maximally entangled states defined in the entanglement theory of multipartite systems. To formalize this, we employ the sheaf-theoretic framework for contextuality, which generalizes non-locality. This provides a new metric for correlations called contextual fraction (CF), which ranges from 0 (non-contextual) to 1 (maximally contextual). Using this, we have defined the absolutely maximal contextual correlations (AMCC), which are maximally contextual and have maximal marginals, which captures the notion of absolutely maximal entangled (AME) states. The Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) box serves as the bipartite example, and we construct various extensions of such correlations in the tripartite case. An infinite family of various forms of AMCC is constructed using the parity check method and the constraint satisfiability problem (CSP) scheme. We also demonstrate the existence of maximally contextual correlations, which do not exhibit maximal marginals, and refer to them as non-AMCC. The results are further applied to secret sharing and randomness extraction using AMCC correlations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

They convert high-level programs into executable hardware instructions - a crucial step in enabling reliable and scalable quantum computation. However, quantum compilation is still in its infancy, and many existing solutions are ad hoc, often developed independently and from scratch. The resulting lack of interoperability leads to significant missed potential, as quantum software tools remain isolated and cannot be seamlessly integrated into cohesive toolchains.\n  The Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) has addressed analogous challenges in the classical domain. It was developed within the LLVM project, which has long powered robust software stacks and enabled compilation across diverse software and hardware components, with particular importance in high-performance computing environments. However, MLIR's steep learning curve poses a significant barrier to entry, particularly in quantum computing, where much of the software stack is still predominantly built by experimentalists out of necessity rather than by experienced software engineers.\n  This paper provides a practical and hands-on guide for quantum software engineers to overcome this steep learning curve. Through a concrete case study linking Xanadu's PennyLane framework with the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), we outline actionable integration steps, highlight best practices, and share hard-earned insights from real-world development. This work aims to support quantum tool developers in navigating MLIR's complexities and to foster its adoption as a unifying bridge across a rapidly growing ecosystem of quantum software tools, ultimately guiding the development of more modular, interoperable, and integrated quantum software stacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To estimate hardware costs, we interpret our protocols as finite Markov processes. This viewpoint allows to cast the expected number of fusion measurements until success as a first passage problem. We then deploy a pipeline of polynomial algorithms to optimize arbitrary graph states, extract fusion networks and find beneficial orderings of fusions with the goal of lowering the corresponding mean first passage times.

Here we present a doubly-connected gradiometric transmon (the ``8-mon\") that incorporates a nano-airbridge to link its two loops. This design preserves full electrical tunability and remains fully compatible with standard X-mon control and readout, requiring no additional measurement overhead. The airbridge interconnect eliminates dielectric loss, which enables the 8-mon to achieve both energy relaxation times $T_{\\rm 1}$ comparable to reference X-mons and, in the small flux-bias regime, a nearly threefold enhancement in Ramsey coherence time $T_{\\rm 2}^*$. This improved $T_{\\rm 2}^*$ reaches the same order as $T_{\\rm 1}$ without employing echo decoupling.

While this perspective captures an important constraint on adiabatic runtimes, it does not fully describe the global structure of spectral evolution in optimization problems with degenerate solution manifolds. In this work, we show that degeneracy alone imposes unavoidable global constraints on spectral flow, even in instances where adiabatic algorithms succeed with high probability. Focusing on digitized quantum adiabatic evolutions, we analyze the eigenphases of the cumulative unitary operator generated along the interpolation path. By explicitly tracking eigenphase trajectories, we demonstrate that multiple spectral bands are forced to interact, braid, and permute before coalescing into a degenerate manifold at the end of the evolution. This global reordering manifests as persistent spectral congestion and nontrivial band permutations that cannot be removed by increasing evolution time or refining the digitization. Using MaxCut instances with controlled degeneracy as a concrete setting, we extract quantitative diagnostics of spectral congestion and explicitly compute the induced band permutations. Our results show that successful adiabatic optimization can coexist with complex and constrained spectral flow, revealing a form of topological obstruction rooted in the global connectivity of eigenstates rather than in local gap closures. These findings highlight intrinsic limitations of gap-based analyses and motivate spectral-flow-based diagnostics for understanding adiabatic algorithms in degenerate optimization landscapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Then, we undertake a systematic study of unital, Hermiticity-preserving maps that are equivariant under natural unitary group actions. Schwarz maps satisfy Kadison's inequality $\u03a6(X^\\ast X) \\geq \u03a6(X)^\\ast \u03a6(X)$ and form an intermediate class between positive and completely positive maps. We completely classify $U(n)$-equivariant on $M_n(\\mathbb C)$ and determine those that are completely positive and Schwarz. Partial classifications are then obtained for the weaker $DU(n)$-equivariance (diagonal unitary symmetry) and for tensor-product symmetries $U(n_1) \\otimes U(n_2)$. In each case, the parameter regions where $\u03a6$ is Schwarz or completely positive are described by explicit algebraic inequalities, and their geometry is illustrated. Finally, we further show that the $U(n)$-equivariant family satisfies $\\mathrm{PPT} \\iff \\mathrm{EB}$, while the $DU(2)$, symmetric $DU(3)$, $U(2) \\otimes U(2)$ and $U(2) \\otimes U(3)$, families obey the $\\mathrm{PPT}^2$ conjecture through a direct symmetry argument. These results reveal how group symmetry controls the structure of non-completely positive maps and provide new concrete examples where the $\\mathrm{PPT}^2$ property holds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e2dCPTP\u3001PPT\u548cSchwarz\u7c7b\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790equivariant\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u901a\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u65b0\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76equivariant\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u901a\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Kadison\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u4ee3\u6570\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u7c7b\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u67d0\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684Schwarz\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728PPT\u548cEB\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u6620\u5c04\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u65b0\u589e\u4e86PPT\u00b2\u731c\u60f3\u9002\u7528\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002"}}

Supplemental material included", "summary": "Bell inequality tests based on high-dimensional entanglement usually require measurements that can resolve multiple possible outcomes. However, the implementation of high-dimensional multi-outcome measurements is often only emulated via a collection of ``click or no-click'' measurements. This reduction of multi-outcome measurements to binary-outcome measurements opens a loophole in high-dimensional tests Bell inequalities which can be exploited by local hidden variable models [Tavakoli et al., Phys. Rev. A 111, 042433 (2025)]. Here, we close this loophole by using four-dimensional photonic path-mode entanglement and multi-outcome detection. We test both the well-known Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequality and a related Bell inequality tailored for maximally entangled states in high-dimension. We observe violations that are large enough to also rule out any quantum model based on entanglement of lower dimension, thereby demonstrating genuinely high-dimensional nonlocality free of the binarisation loophole.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u7ef4\u5149\u8def\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u591a\u7ed3\u679c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u7ed3\u679c\u6d4b\u91cf\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e8c\u5143\u6d4b\u91cf\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7528\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u7ef4ettle\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u88ab\u5c40\u90e8\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7ed5\u8fc7\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728 Bell \u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u907f\u514d\u72af reducemulti-outcome\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e3abinary-outcome\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u662f\u6b64\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u56db\u7ef4\u5149\u8def\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ed3\u679c\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Multiplication-Dimensional\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u548c\u591a\u7ed3\u679c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u4e0a\u8ff0\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u91ca\u653e\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4entanglement\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684Bell\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8fdd\u53cd\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7ea0\u7f20\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7528\u4f4e\u7ef4entanglement\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u5728Bell\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u9650\u5236\u67d0\u4e9b\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ea\u80fd\u5f97\u5230binary\u7ed3\u679c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u65ad\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}
