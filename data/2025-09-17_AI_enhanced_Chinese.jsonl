Here, we introduce LensPlus, a deep learning-based framework that\nenhances the SBP of quantitative phase imaging (QPI) without requiring hardware\nmodifications. By training on paired datasets acquired with low-NA and high-NA\nobjectives, LensPlus learns to recover high-frequency features lost in low-NA\nmeasurements, effectively bridging the resolution gap while preserving the\nlarge field of view and thereby increasing the SBP.

We answer this question\naffirmatively by introducing and analysing a protocol for distributed quantum\nsensing in the continuous-variable regime. We consider a multipartite network\nin which each node encodes a local phase into a shared entangled Gaussian\nstate. We show that the average phase can be estimated with high precision,\nexhibiting Heisenberg scaling in the total photon number, while individual\nphases are inaccessible.

In this\nwork, a thermal transport model for heterostructures under the non-uniform heat\nsource is developed by combining first-principles calculations with Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Temperature, heat flux, and spectral thermal conductance\ndistributions are compared between uniform and non-uniform heat sources. The\neffects of heterostructure height, heat source width, and heat source height on\nthermal transfer characteristics are analyzed for four typical\nheterostructures: GaN/AlN, GaN/Diamond, GaN/Si, and GaN/SiC. The results reveal\nthat non-uniform heat sources have little effect on average interfacial thermal\nconductance but induce pronounced local non-uniformity when the heterostructure\nheight is small. The interfacial thermal conductance near the heat source\nregion is significantly higher than that in other areas. As the heat source\nnon-uniformity increases, the total thermal resistance of the heterostructure\nrises markedly, reaching several times that under uniform heat sources.\nFinite-element calculations fail to capture the combined effects of non-uniform\nheating and microscale dimensions, leading to a severe underestimation of\nheterostructure total thermal resistance.

A correspondence is\nestablished between the discrete stellar eigenmodes and the continuous\ndispersion relation of perturbations around a homogeneous fluid, providing a\nbasis for interpreting our numerical results. We analyze the Newtonian limit\nand assess the impact of relativistic corrections, such as the gravitational\nredshifting of microscopic relaxation timescales. We show that bulk viscosity\ncan significantly affect the behavior of both hydrodynamic and nonhydrodynamic\nfundamental modes, and that, depending on the magnitude of the viscous effects,\nit is the nonhydrodynamic mode that becomes unstable beyond the turning point\nin a sequence of equilibrium configurations. These results provide a useful\nstep toward systematic studies of neutron star quasinormal modes in the\npresence of viscosity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we present a conceptually new solution to\nthis persistent challenge. We demonstrate ultrabroadband photo- and\nelectroluminescence from silicon, enabled by a novel radiative pathway mediated\nby momentum-expanded Heisenberg photonic states that bypass phonon-assisted\ntransitions. This mechanism, previously demonstrated using metallic\nnanoparticles as photon confiners, is now realized in an all-silicon material\nusing embedded sub-1.5 nm silicon nanoparticles to create confined photonic\nstates. The results show excellent agreement with prior studies, confirming\nthat the confinement size, rather than the specific confining material, is the\nmain factor for activating radiative transitions in a momentum-forbidden\nsystem. Consistent with the photonic momentum expansion concept, both photo-\nand electro-driven emissions span the visible and near-infrared spectral\nranges, with electroluminescence visible to the naked eye even under ambient\ndaylight conditions. The simplicity and material-agnostic nature of this\napproach promise compatibility with standard fabrication processes, offering a\npractical and transformative route toward high-performance, all-silicon\nlight-emitting diodes and laser sources. More generally, these findings reveal\nthe emergence of a new hybrid light-matter regime, photonic Heisenberg matter,\nwhere extreme photon confinement directly reshapes the electronic transition\nlandscape.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This fact has been\nverified in a number of scenarios, that involve tides of bosonic fields of\nvarious natures (e.g. scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational), and has\ntriggered active research in trying to identify the underlying reason.\nSurprisingly, two counterexamples have been found recently. The first, concerns\ncharged-field tides on electrically-charged black holes. In that case, however,\nthe response cannot be disentangled from dissipative effects, and might thus be\nargued to not consist of a truly conservative deformation. The second concerns\nfermionic tides on neutral holes. While these yield a purely conservative\nresponse, they lack a classical interpretation, which is the physical regime\nwhere black hole deformability is understood. Here, we consider magnetic\nReissner-Nordstrom black holes and show that electrically-charged, scalar-field\ntides induce non-vanishing tidal Love numbers. We prove that this is a purely\nnon-dissipative effect, in contrast to the cases of rotating or\nelectrically-charged black holes, and hence consists of a genuine deformation.\nIn addition, the magnetic charge resolves common ambiguities in defining Love\nnumbers, so our result does not rely on any regularisation scheme.

When a parameter in such a background exceeds a certain critical value,\nthe speed of the Liouville wall exceeds the speed of light, and there is no\nusual S-Matrix. We examine such backgrounds in the dual $c=1$ matrix model from\nthe point of view of fluctuations of the collective field, and determine the\nnature of the emergent space-time perceived by these fluctuations.

Depending on the active degrees of freedom, different types of\ncollective modes can arise in a FQH state. In this work, we consider spinful\nFQH states in the lowest Landau level (LLL) along the Jain sequence of fillings\n$\\nu{=}n/(2n{\\pm}1)$ and compute the Coulomb dispersion of their spin-flip and\nspin-conserving collective modes in the spherical geometry.

To evaluate the dispersion of density-wave\nstates, we derive the commutation algebra of spinful LLL-projected density\noperators on the sphere, which enables us to extract the gap of the\ndensity-wave excitations from the numerically computed density-density\ncorrelation function, i.e., the static structure factor, of the FQH ground\nstate. We find that the CF excitons provide an accurate description of the\ncollective modes at all wavelengths, while the density-wave states fail to do\nso. Specifically, the spin-flip density wave reliably captures the spin-flip\ncollective mode only for the Laughlin and Halperin states, and that too only in\nthe long-wavelength limit. Interestingly, for spin-singlet primary Jain states,\nthe spin-conserving density mode is inaccurate even in the long-wavelength\nregime.

While static electric-field\ngradients are known to generate charge transport governed by the quantum\nmetric, we show that AC field gradients induce an additional geometric current\nthat vanishes in the DC limit. This response originates from a novel\nband-geometric quantity, the higher-order connection (HOC) tensor, constructed\nfrom cubic products of interband Berry connections. We derive explicit\nexpressions for the AC current and identify the symmetry conditions under which\nit arises. Remarkably, inhomogeneous AC fields can generate an anomalous\nHall-like response even in nonmagnetic systems. Applying the theory to\nBernal-stacked bilayer graphene, we demonstrate that the HOC-induced response\nproduces a measurable Hall current peaking at band edges.

Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of\nnon-Hermitian quantum parameter estimation in the quantum regime, with a\nspecial focus on achieving Heisenberg scaling. We introduce a concise\nexpression for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) that applies to general\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonians, enabling the analysis of estimation precision in\nthese systems. Our findings unveil the remarkable potential of non-Hermitian\nsystems to attain the Heisenberg scaling of $1/t$, where $t$ represents time.\nMoreover, we derive optimal measurement conditions based on the proposed QFI\nexpression, demonstrating the attainment of the quantum Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound.\nBy constructing non-unitary evolutions governed by two non-Hermitian\nHamiltonians, one with parity-time symmetry and the other without specific\nsymmetries, we experimentally validate our theoretical analysis. The\nexperimental results affirm the realization of Heisenberg scaling in estimation\nprecision, marking a substantial milestone in non-Hermitian quantum metrology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u975e\u5384\u5bc6\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u5168\u9762\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u5bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5384\u5bc6\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0Heisenberg\u6807\u5ea6\uff081/t\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u548c\u975e\u5384\u5bc6\u7269\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u5384\u5bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u975e\u5384\u5bc6\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff08\u542bPT\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff09\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6d4b\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u5bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230Heisenberg\u6807\u5ea6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u975e\u5384\u5bc6\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u5bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The hairy\nparameter's impact is more distinct in the low inclination case as the\nazimuthal angle lies within a specific range, but is almost independent of the\nobserver inclination as the azimuthal angle is beyond this specific range.\nFurthermore, the dependence of the hairy parameter's impact on the EVPA is\nstronger with respect to the black hole spin than to the inclination angle.\nThese results could help to further understand the near-horizon polarized\nimages and Horndeski gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u7684\u6bdb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u970d\u043d\u0434\u683c\u65af\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u6781\u5316\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u4ef0\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89c2\u5bdf\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u65cb\u8f6c\u901f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cdEVPA\u3002", "motivation": "\u6781\u5316\u5149\u5411\u5728\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89c6\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u970d\u043d\u0434\u683c\u65af\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684EVPA\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u89c2\u5bdf\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0cEVPA\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": " EVPA\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4e0eblack hole\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u89d2\u5ea6\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6781\u7aef\u9ed1\u6d1e\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Moreover, we assume that the early Universe can be\ndescribed with fewer initial symmetries, thus we abandon the isotropy\nassumption and instead explore anisotropic universes, beginning with the\nsimplest one, namely Bianchi I (BI). The presence of small initial fluctuations\nin the early universe can be well described by perturbations around a\nhomogeneous background. GR is a constrained system, and we apply the so-called\nDirac procedure for constrained systems to derive a gauge-invariant Hamiltonian\nformulation suitable for quantization. In this work, we present how this\nprocedure can be extended to a generic background and its relation to the\nKuchar decomposition. Subsequently, we apply this formulation to a BI universe,\nobtaining new and interesting results on the gauge-invariant representation of\nmatter and geometry perturbations. Contrary to the FLRW case, in which all the\nmodes decouple, in BI we see that scalar and tensor modes do not decouple. We\nshow that new types of gauge-fixing conditions exit in this case. For instance,\na gravitational wave can be encoded into scalar modes, by introducing a new\ngauge which is not valid in FLRW. Furthermore, we make a first step towards a\nconsistent and unified quantization of the composite system made of a\nbackground mode and perturbation modes. Specifically, we study tensor modes in\na FLRW universe. We focus on the relation between the choice of internal time\nof the universe and the quantum evolution it undergoes. Our results indicate\nthat the time reparametrization invariance in general relativity affects the\nquantum evolution of the background and perturbation modes.

It introduces a method for analyzing composite hypothesis testing that highlights the role of channel divergence measures. The work not only contributes to the theoretical foundation of quantum Shannon theory but also provides tools for practical applications in quantum communication and computing. Future research could explore the extension of these results to more general quantum resource theories and their applications in practical quantum technologies."}}
