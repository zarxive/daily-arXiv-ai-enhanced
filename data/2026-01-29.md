TL;DR: A novel lateral shearing (LS)-based optical diffraction tomography (ODT) method is presented for imaging heterogeneous, high scattering samples like tissues with high temporal stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ODT is important for label-free refractive index reconstruction, but struggles with thick, scattering samples. This research addresses these challenges to expand ODT's applicability in biomedical studies.

Method: The LS-ODT technique uses partial lateral shearing interferometry to reduce multiple scattering effects, similar to DIC microscopy. It employs dynamic speckle illumination to improve spatial phase and refractive index sensitivity compared to conventional laser-based ODT.

Result: The LS-ODT method effectively images cell phantoms and samples like mouse kidney tissue and brain organoids. It shows robustness and accuracy across varying sample thicknesses and scattering levels, with correlative fluorescence imaging further supporting its utility.

Conclusion: LS-ODT enhances ODT capabilities, making it suitable for imaging complex biological samples, advancing histology and related biomedical research.

Abstract: Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) is a powerful technique for quantitative, label-free reconstruction of the three-dimensional refractive index (RI) distribution of biological samples. While ODT is well established for imaging thin, weakly scattering samples, it encounters significant challenges when applied to heterogeneous, strongly scattering thick samples such as tissues and organoids. In this work, a novel common-path interferometric approach to ODT is presented, specifically designed for the RI reconstruction of heterogeneous and highly scattering samples at high temporal stability. The proposed technique, termed lateral shearing (LS)-ODT, incorporates partial lateral shearing off-axis interferometry to suppress the effects of multiple scattering, similar to the mechanism in differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, which is widely used for imaging thick specimens. Additionally, the LS-ODT system uses dynamic speckle illumination to enhance both spatial phase and RI sensitivity compared to laser-based ODT systems. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through experiments on a cell phantom. Its robustness and accuracy are further validated across a wide range of samples, including mouse kidney tissue sections and brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), in both thin and thick sections. Furthermore, correlative fluorescence and RI tomography of the organoids highlights the potential of LS-ODT to enhance and support a broad spectrum of biomedical studies, particularly in the field of histology.

Conclusion: 通过超快激光制备高质量的光晶格光纤 Fabry-Perot 激光器，首次实现了高 Q、高 增益的光栅结构，成果可应用于量子计算、量子通信及光纤光学开关等领域

Abstract: We demonstrate the fabrication of defect-free optical-nanofiber photonic-crystal Fabry-Perot resonators with quality factors exceeding 10^7 using single-shot femtosecond laser ablation. An investigation of the nonlinear optical properties reveals that thermo-optic effects dominate within the entire cavity bandwidth, even when interrogating with pulses one order of magnitude shorter than the 6.6 us thermal cutoff time. The combination of high-Q and small mode volume of these resonators could facilitate the creation of high-speed quantum nodes for cavity QED based quantum computing and networking, as well as low-power in-line fiber optical switches.

### [3] [Implications of temporal sampling in voltage imaging microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20236)
*Jakub Czuchnowski,Jerome Mertz*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Voltage imaging microscopy excels at studying neural activity in both live and lab settings, but the choice between scanning and wide-field microscopes depends on the sampling rate and detection needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how different microscopy techniques affect neural signal accuracy is crucial for effective neural research.

Method: We combined mathematical modeling with computer simulations using Monte-Carlo methods to analyze these effects.

Result: Scanning microscopes are better for low SNR conditions and detecting a few spikes, while wide-field are better when measurements are heavily undersampled and many spikes need detecting.

Conclusion: Choosing the right microscope depends on specific research needs and sampling parameters, with scanning microscopes generally not advised below 500 Hz.

Abstract: Significance: Voltage imaging microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate neural activity both in vivo and in vitro. Various imaging approaches have been developed, including point-scanning, line-scanning and wide-field microscopes, however the effects of their different temporal sampling methods on signal fidelity have not yet been fully investigated. Aim: To provide an analysis of the inherent advantages and disadvantages of temporal sampling in scanning and wide-field microscopes and their effect on the fidelity of voltage spike detection. Approach: We develop a mathematical framework based on a mixture of analytical modeling and computer simulations with Monte-Carlo approaches. Results: Scanning microscopes outperform wide-field microscopes in low signal-to-noise conditions and when only a small subset of spikes needs to be detected. Wide-field microscopes outperform scanning microscopes when the measurement is temporally undersampled and a large fraction of the spikes needs to be detected. Both modalities converge in performance as sampling increases and the frame rate reaches the decay rate of the voltage indicator. Conclusions: Our work provides guidance for the selection of optimal temporal sampling parameters for voltage imaging. Most importantly it advises against using scanning voltage imaging microscopes at frame rates below 500 Hz.

Result: 实验证明反射几何学的软X射线ptychography具有45nm的分辨率

Conclusion: 反射几何学的软X射线ptychography为非破坏性材料成像提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在不需要透明样品的情况下。

Abstract: Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and ptychography have become mature tools for high-resolution, element-specific imaging of nanoscale structures. However, transmission geometries impose stringent constraints on sample thickness and preparation, thereby limiting investigations of extended or bulk specimens, especially in the soft X-ray region. Here, we demonstrate reflection geometry soft X-ray ptychography as a robust imaging mode. Instrumental feasibility and spatial resolution are established using a lithographically defined Siemens star and barcode test pattern on a multilayer substrate. We empirically demonstrate a full-pitch spatial resolution of ca. 45 nm from Fourier ring correlation analysis of the reconstructed object. The results highlight the potential of the reflection geometry for nondestructive X-ray studies of materials without the need for transmissive samples.

Abstract: Inter-cell and/or interlayer coupling in Moire superlattices can generate flatbands and collective eigenmodes that enable emergent physical phenomena, motivating extensive exploration of Moire-inspired photonic devices. However, the experimental validation of robust inter-cell interactions in Moire photonic structures and the modulation of flatbands for specific photonic applications remain challenging. Here, we propose a lattice-mismatch Moire cavity and demonstrate nanolasers enabled by strong flatband coupling. In contrast to a twist-angle Moire cavity, a lattice-mismatch Moire cavity provides a stable flatband frequency and a substantial enhancement in Q factor compared to an isolated single-cell cavity, as the unit-cell size decreases. The photonic band-structure measurement of the small-unit-cell Moire cavity by photoluminescence reveals pronounced flatbands. Cell-resolved spectroscopy further confirms the presence of flatbands by identifying resonant peaks that consistently emerge across unit cells in a Moire cavity with a lattice mismatch of 102 nm, but not in a larger-unit-cell Moire cavity with a mismatch of 60 nm. Furthermore, mode selection is achieved by reducing the center-hole size, thus isolating the hexapole mode from the degenerate dipole modes while maintaining strong inter-cell coupling. Consequently, we demonstrate a low-threshold hexapole flatband laser in a single mode. Therefore, the systematic modification of the relative lattice parameters of the two constituent lattices offers a promising strategy for developing Moire nanolasers and flatband nanophotonic devices.

Abstract: We introduce a novel interferometric approach for suppressing zero-order diffraction (ZOD) in phase-only computer-generated holography. The technique relies on the destructive interference between the zeroth-order light and a suppression beam in a plane optically conjugated to the spatial light modulator (SLM). A camera-in-the-loop (CITL) calibration procedure retrieves the optimal pixel-wise phase map that cancels out the ZOD component with high precision, while preserving the full modulation depth of the SLM. Experimental demonstrations on point-cloud and 2D/3D holograms achieve up to 99% suppression of the ZOD intensity, without loss of image quality or field of view. Once calibrated, the correction can be applied to any hologram without recomputation, enabling real-time operation and robust performance over time. This method removes a long-standing barrier to the practical deployment of full-field holography, facilitating the development of compact, high-fidelity holographic engines for augmented and mixed reality displays.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose controlling the angular and spectral distribution of hard x-ray emission by entangling x-ray photons with ultraviolet surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) whose dispersion is engineered by a metal-dielectric multilayer on a nonlinear crystal. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion of an x-ray pump produces a hard x-ray signal photon correlated with an ultraviolet SPP mode near its resonance. Engineering the SPPs dispersion reshapes the phase-matching landscape and imprints tunable angular-spectral structure on the emitted x-ray photons. The scheme enables compact, designable control of x-ray emission and extends surface-plasmon-assisted nonlinear and quantum x-ray optics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自由空间光电器件在通信和数据中心中的应用日益广泛，高性能的光电偶联器对提升网络性能具有重要意义。采用电调制材料如BTO是一种有潜力的途径，但其局限性如高昂成本和制备难度阻碍了其大规模应用。因此，开发易于制备且性能优越的电调制元表面具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了通过简单制备但却高效的电调制元表面设计，特别是在频率和电压范围上的改善，为自由空间光电器件的商业化应用铺平了道路。然而，其在大规模制造中的稳定性仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Electrically tunable metasurfaces leveraging the strong Pockel's effect in barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$ or BTO) are a promising platform for reconfigurable free-space optical devices. However, the high cost, limited scalability, and restricted substrate compatibility of epitaxial BTO films hinder its exploitation. Here, we demonstrate free-space optical modulators based on imprinted BTO metasurfaces with targeted designs for optical and electric field confinement within the active material. With resonances exhibiting high quality factors of up to 200, we demonstrate improved transmission modulation at sub-volt driving amplitudes and frequencies up to 5 MHz. Additional enhancement is achieved via ferroelectric domain alignment, resulting in up to 25 % higher modulation strength compared to the unbiased case and up to 75 % compared to previous demonstrations. This enhanced EO response, arising from the effective permittivity engineering and domain orientation in these polycrystalline metasurfaces, holds significant potential for scalable and efficient EO modulators and active metasurfaces.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Label-free optical microscopy through absorption or scattering spectroscopy provides fundamental insights across biology and materials science, yet its sensitivity remains fundamentally limited by photon shot noise. While recent demonstrations of quantum nonlinear microscopy show sub-shot-limited sensitivity, they are intrinsically limited by availability of high peak-power squeezed light sources. Here, we introduce squeezing-enhanced photothermal (SEPT) microscopy, a quantum imaging technique that leverages twin-beam quantum correlations to detect absorption induced signals with unprecedented sensitivity. SEPT achieves 3.5 dB noise suppression beyond the standard quantum limit, enabling a 2.5-fold increase in imaging throughput or 31% reduction in pump power, while providing an unmatched versatility through the intrinsic compatibility between continuous-wave squeezing and photothermal modulation. We showcase SEPT applications by providing high-precision characterization of nanoparticles and revealing subcellular structures, such as cytochrome c, that remain undetectable under shot-noise-limited imaging. By combining label-free contrast, quantum-enhanced sensitivity, and compatibility with existing microscopy platforms, SEPT establishes a new paradigm for molecular absorption imaging with far-reaching implications in cellular biology, nanoscience, and materials characterization.

*Antonio Alex-Amor,Carlos Molero*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper presents a temporal paraxial formulation for ultrashort optical pulses in time-modulated media, offering an analytically tractable model that extends paraxial optics beyond time-invariant backgrounds. The model supports closed-form solutions and applications like pulse shaping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation is to provide a theoretical framework for controlling ultrashort pulse dynamics through temporal modulation, with potential applications in ultrafast optics.

Method: The authors derive the paraxial wave equation directly in the time domain using an adiabatic approximation, extending paraxial optics to time-varying media. The resulting equation retains a Schrödinger-like structure, allowing for analytical solutions and a Green's-function description.

Result: The model enables precise control over pulse characteristics, such as temporal width and chirp, and connects to temporal wave-packet dynamics in quantum optics.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for ultrafast pulse engineering and temporal wave-packet control, offering a practical approach to manipulating optical pulses in modulated media.

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal paraxial formulation for the propagation of ultrashort optical pulses in time-modulated media with slowly varying refractive index. By deriving the paraxial wave equation directly in the time domain from the Helmholtz equation under an adiabatic approximation, the model remains analytically tractable while extending paraxial optics beyond time-invariant backgrounds commonly treated by frequency-domain expansions. The resulting equation preserves a Schrödinger-like structure in the presence of explicit temporal modulation and admits closed-form solutions for ultrashort Gaussian pulses. The framework supports a Green's-function description and an operator-based Hamiltonian formalism, from which an ABCD matrix representation for temporal propagation in time-varying media is obtained. The results demonstrate that temporal modulation provides an active means to control ultrashort pulse dynamics, enabling tailored evolution of pulse characteristics such as temporal width and chirp, with potential applications in ultrafast pulse shaping and a direct connection to temporal wave-packet dynamics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multispectral mid-infrared (2-5 ${μm}$) imaging is a critical capability across science and technology, offering a window into the vibrational and thermal landscape of matter that is inaccessible to visible sensors. It bridges the microscopic world of molecular interactions with macroscopic sensing technologies, with applications in environmental sensing, defense and molecular diagnostics. However, current mid-IR cameras require cryogenic cooling and exhibit limited pixel resolution, high cost, and restricted spectral access. Optical up-conversion provides a pathway to overcome these limitations, but existing systems typically rely on narrowband phase matching, mechanical scanning, or angular tuning, limiting imaging speed and practicality. Here, we demonstrate the first single-shot, room-temperature multispectral mid-IR imaging of incoherent thermal light enabled by adiabatic sum-frequency conversion. Our system simultaneously converts the entire (2-5 ${μm}$) region into the visible domain, capturing the image on a Silicon detector with spatial resolution below 20 ${μm}$ and high angular tolerance. We validate full-field imaging using a USAF resolution target and demonstrate spectroscopic contrast imaging in dielectric metamaterials by resolving wavelength and polarization dependent scattering resonances, all achieved without scanning, thermal control, or cryogenic operation. This compact and robust approach bridges the gap between laboratory-grade infrared sensors and scalable Silicon-based detection technologies suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Photoacoustic (PA) imaging combines the high optical absorption contrast of optical imaging with the deep tissue penetration of ultrasound detection, offering great potential for functional imaging and disease diagnosis. However, current PA imaging methods mainly explore optical absorption properties of biological tissue. To the best of our knowledge, tensile measurement based on PA effect is still an untapped area to be explored. In this work, we propose photoacoustic tensile imaging (PATI), a new PA imaging modality enabling quantitative assessment of tensile stress in biological samples. PATI exploits the nonlinear PA response induced by dual-pulse laser excitation to establish a mapping between the applied tension and the increment of the nonlinear PA signal. By varying the temporal delay between the heating and detecting laser pulses, the relationship between tensile force and nonlinear PA characteristics is quantitatively analyzed. Phantom experiments demonstrate a strong correlation between the nonlinear PA signal intensity and the applied tensile force. These results confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach for tensile force monitoring, which holds potential in biomedical applications, such as vascular pressure monitoring.

Conclusion: 多配置平均场理论成功描述了这种复合作用下的涡旋行为，为探索量子流体中的涡旋动力学提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study the formation, stability, and decay of macrovortices in a rotating Bose gas confined by a Mexican-hat potential with a multiconfigurational ansatz. By systematically including correlations beyond the mean-field level, we map the equilibrium phase diagram and identify regimes of coexistence between vortex lattices and multiply charge central vortices. Quench dynamics reveals that macrovortices are robust under changes in rotation or interaction strength, sustaining clean monopole oscillations with well-separated, vorticity-dependent breathing frequencies. In contrast, trap quenches trigger a universal decay process mediated by vortex-phonon coupling, in which rotational energy is progressively transferred to compressible modes until the macrovortex splits into singly quantized vortices. Our results demonstrate that macrovortex lifetimes and decay pathways can be tuned by trap confinement, providing experimentally accessible signatures of vortex-phonon interactions and collective energy transfer in correlated quantum fluids.

Abstract: Bound states, known as particles tied together and moving as a whole, are profound correlated effects induced by particle-particle interactions. While dimer-monomer bound states are manifested as a single particle attached to dimer bound pair, it is still unclear about quantum walks and Bloch oscillations of dimer-monomer bound states. Here, we revisit three-particle bound states in the Bose-Hubbard model and find that interaction-induced impurities adjacent to bound pair and boundaries cause two kinds of bound states: one is dimer-monomer bound state and the other is bound edge states. In quantum walks, the spread velocity of dimer-monomer bound state is determined by the maximal group velocity of their energy band, which is much smaller than that in the single-particle case. In Bloch oscillations, the period of dimer-monomer bound states is one third of that in the single-particle case. Our works provide new insights to the collective dynamics of three-particle bound states.

*Junjie Liang,Hongye Yu,Shina Tan*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: The paper explores the wave function of three identical bosons in 2D at zero energy and momentum, with finite scattering length. It derives asymptotic expansions in two regimes, identifying a new three-body scattering area parameter. The parameter is related to the production of two-body bound states and can be affected by modifications to interaction potentials. The findings have implications for various three-body and many-body physics phenomena, including ground-state energies, recombination rates, and correlation functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of few-body systems, especially with three particles, is crucial in ultracold atomic physics and condensed matter systems. This paper addresses a fundamental aspect of such systems by studying the wave function in 2D, which is relevant for ultracold atomic gases in traps or optical lattices.

Method: The authors use a combination of analytical and numerical methods to derive the asymptotic expansions of the wave function in two different regimes. They employ perturbation theory and renormalization techniques to account for the effects of the three-body parameter.

Result: The key result is the identification of the three-body scattering area parameter D, which is dimensioned as length squared. D is related to the production of two-body bound states and can be affected by modifications to the interaction potentials. The parameter also has implications for three-body recombination rates and other macroscopic properties like ground-state energies and correlation functions of two-dimensional Bose gases.

Conclusion: This work provides a new parameter, D, for describing three-body interactions in two-dimensional systems. It contributes to the understanding of few-body physics and has potential applications in ultracold atomic experiments, guiding the interpretation of experimental results related to three-body recombination and scattering processes.

Abstract: We study the wave function $φ^{(3)}$ of three identical bosons scattering at zero energy, zero total momentum, and zero orbital angular momentum in two dimensions, interacting via short-range potentials with a finite two-body scattering length $a$. We derive asymptotic expansions of $φ^{(3)}$ in two regimes: the 111-expansion, where all three pairwise distances are large, and the 21-expansion, where one particle is far from the other two. In the 111-expansion, the leading term grows as $\ln^3(B/a)$ at large hyperradius $B=\sqrt{(s_1^2+s_2^2+s_3^2)/2}$. At order $B^{-2}\ln^{-3}(B/a)$, we identify a three-body parameter $D$ with dimension of length squared, which we term the three-body scattering area. This quantity should be contrasted with the three-body scattering area previously studied for infinite or vanishing two-body scattering length. If the two-body interaction is attractive and supports bound states, $D$ acquires a negative imaginary part, and we derive its relation to the probability amplitudes for the production of two-body bound states in three-body collisions. Under weak modifications of the interaction potentials, we derive the corresponding shift of $D$ in terms of $φ^{(3)}$ and the changes of the two-body and three-body potentials. We also study the effects of $D$ and $φ^{(3)}$ on three-body and many-body physics, including the three-body ground-state energy in a large periodic volume, the many-body energy and the three-body correlation function of the dilute two-dimensional Bose gas, and the three-body recombination rates of two-dimensional ultracold atomic Bose gases.

Abstract: In trapped-ion quantum simulators, effective spin-1/2 XY interactions can be engineered via laser-induced coupling between internal atomic states and collective phonon modes. In the simplest one-dimensional ($1d$) traps, these interactions decay as a power-law with distance $1/r^α$, with a tunable exponent $α$. For small $α$, the resulting long-range $1d$ XY model exhibits continuous symmetry breaking, in marked contrast to its nearest neighbor counterpart. In this paper, we examine this model near the phase transition at $α_c$ from the lens of the spin stiffness, or superfluid density. We develop a stochastic series expansion (SSE) quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation and a generalized winding number estimator to measure the superfluid density in the presence of power-law interactions, which we test against exact diagonalization for small lattice sizes. Our results show how conventional superfluidity in the $1d$ XY model is enhanced in the long-range interacting regime. This is observed as a diverging superfluid density as $α\rightarrow 0$ in the thermodynamic limit, which we show is consistent with linear spin-wave theory. Finally, we define a normalized superfluid density estimator that clearly distinguishes the short, medium, and long-range interacting regimes, providing a novel QMC probe of the critical value $α_c$.

Abstract: A large class of correlated quantum materials feature strong Hund's coupling. Yet cold-atom quantum simulators have so far focused primarily on single-orbital Fermi-Hubbard systems near a Mott insulator. Here we show that repulsively interacting fermions loaded into the $p$-bands of a hexagonal lattice offer a unique platform to study the interplay of "Hundness" and "Mottness." Our theory predicts that the orbital degrees of freedom, despite geometric frustration, produce a rich phase diagram featuring a competing itinerant ferromagnetic (FM) metal and a spin-1 antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator, with a surprising first-order transition between them controlled by density near half-filling. Ferromagnetism emerges at low fillings from the flat band and persists to stronger interactions and higher fillings via a double-exchange mechanism, where spins align to avoid Hund-rule penalties at the expense of Dirac-fermion kinetic energy. We further argue that the paramagnetic regime is a correlated "Hund metal." $p$-orbital Fermi gases thus provide an ideal experimental setting to investigate competing exchange mechanisms in multi-orbital systems with coexisting localized and itinerant spins.

Conclusion: 钙镁硅酸盐经过离子掺杂后，性能提升显著，成为更理想的骨 substitute材料，并且超过了钙磷酸盐和生物玻璃。

Abstract: The use of bioceramics as hard tissue substitutes is extensive due to their excellent biocompatible and osteogenic behaviors. Among various bioceramics, Ca-Mg silicates are unique from the viewpoints of osteoinductive and mechanical properties, as well as their outstanding osteoconductive and angiogenic behaviors owing to the release of Si, Ca and Mg. Despite these distinct advantages, different compositions of these bioceramics still require mechanical and biological enhancements for further applications. For this purpose, doping with some ions like F-, Sr2+, Cu2+, Eu2+, Ba+, Ce3+ and some alkali cations has been proved to be a valued approach. This review attempts to bring together areas for the performance improvement of the further researched Ca-Mg silicates (i.e., diopside, akermanite, bredigite and monticellite) and the alteration of these compositions via ion-doping. It is concluded that a correct choice of dopants incorporated at the optimal concentration makes these silicates ideal bone substitutes competing or even superior to calcium phosphates (apatites) and bioglasses which are known as the most prominent bioceramics.

TL;DR: A theoretical approach for calculating doubly excited states has been developed, showing improved accuracy over other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quest for accurate electronic structure calculations continues to drive advancements in quantum chemistry.

Method: An approach similar to the Aufbau suppressed coupled cluster method has been adapted for doubly excited states.

Result: The method achieves lower excitation energy errors compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Further refinement of this approach could enhance the accuracy of electronic structure calculations for larger systems.

Abstract: We generalize the Aufbau suppressed coupled cluster formalism into the realm of doubly excited states by deriving, implementing, and testing a wave function initialization strategy that allows the zeroth order wave function to match the largest configurations of a doubly excited reference wave function while maintaining the method's overall asymptotic cost parity with ground state singles and doubles theory. Starting from state-averaged complete active space self consistent field references, this approach produces highly accurate excitation energies for states dominated by a single doubly excited determinant, as well as states in glyoxal and similar molecules where two different doubly excited determinants have large weights. Typical excitation energy errors in both types of states are on the order of 0.15 eV, with the largest observed error being 0.3 eV. These errors stand in stark contrast to equation of motion methods, where typical errors are 4 to 6 eV at the singles and doubles level and 0.4 to 0.8 eV at the full triples level. It remains an open question how best to generalize the Aufbau suppression approach into an even wider variety of multi-configurational double excitations, but these early results offer strong motivation for further investigation.

Conclusion: GG-PI is an efficient transferable framework for simulating nuclear quantum effects across different temperatures.

Abstract: Accurate simulation of nuclear quantum effects is essential for molecular modeling but expensive using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). We present GG-PI, a ring-polymer-based framework that combines generative modeling of the single-bead conditional density with Gibbs sampling to recover quantum statistics from classical simulation data. GG-PI uses inexpensive standard classical simulations or existing data for training and allows transfer across temperatures without retraining. On standard test systems, GG-PI significantly reduces wall clock time compared to PIMD. Our approach extends easily to a wide range of problems with similar Markov structure.

Motivation: The observation of NCCO⁺ in ion traps is important for understanding molecular ions in space, which could aid in searching for extraterrestrial molecules using radio telescopes.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for studying molecular ions in ion traps and contributes data for future radio telescope missions looking for extraterrestrial molecules.

Abstract: Cyanooxomethylium, NCCO$^+$, a fundamental linear acylium ion, has been observed spectroscopically for the first time using action spectroscopy in ion trap apparatuses. A first low-resolution infrared spectrum was obtained between 500 to 1400 cm$^{-1}$ and 2000 to 2500 cm$^{-1}$ using the Free Electron Laser for Infrared eXperiments (FELIX) and the FELion apparatus, employing infrared predissociation of the weakly bound NCCO$^+$-Ne complex. Subsequently, high-resolution studies of the bare ion were performed with the COLtrap II setup, one targeted at the CN-stretching mode $ν_2$ around 2150 cm$^{-1}$ using leak-out spectroscopy and one at the pure rotational spectrum employing a leak-out infrared/millimeter-wave double resonance approach covering transition frequencies as high as 246 GHz. Spectroscopic detection and analysis were guided by high-level quantum-chemical calculations performed at the CCSD(T) level of theory.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method called SITH that allows for the detailed decomposition of energy changes in stretched molecules, enabling more accurate prediction of bond rupture in proteins and other biomolecules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding mechanochemical processes is crucial for predicting bond cleavage in biological and synthetic polymers, which has implications in fields like materials science and drug design.

Method: SITH decomposes electronic energy changes into contributions from bond lengths, angles, and dihedrals using the work-energy theorem, avoiding harmonic approximations.

Result: Glycine stores more energy in its Ca-C backbone bonds under tension, making it more prone to rupture. Proline exhibits the opposite behavior.

Conclusion: SITH provides a powerful tool for analyzing energy distribution in stretched molecules at the quantum level, with applications in mechanochemistry and force field validation.

Abstract: Mechanical forces can selectively destabilize chemical bonds of molecular systems, particularly in biological and synthetic polymers. While experimental and theoretical methods have advanced our understanding of mechanochemical processes, predicting where energy concentrates within a molecule remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce SITH (Splitting Intramolecular Tension due to stretcHing), a novel method that decomposes the total electronic energy change of a stretched molecule into contributions from individual degrees of freedom -- such as bond lengths, angles, and dihedrals -- using numerical integration of the work-energy theorem. Unlike previous approaches that rely on harmonic approximations, SITH provides high accuracy and robustness to study the distribution of energies of stretched molecules up to a first bond cleavage. Although SITH uses 3N-6 degrees of freedom for the energy decomposition, we show that it can work even for ring structures like prolines. We apply SITH to a dataset of tripeptides and demonstrate that glycine and proline exhibit significantly different energy distributions in their Ca-C backbone bonds under tension: glycine stores more energy, making it more prone to rupture, while proline has the opposite behaviour. These findings reveal intrinsic differences in mechanochemical susceptibility across amino acids, offering more accurate predictions of bond rupture in proteins, and similarly in other (bio)polymers. SITH thus provides a powerful, interpretable tool for understanding energy distribution at the quantum level, with possible implications in mechanochemistry and force field validation.

Motivation: the paper presents a novel computational method to study complex quantum systems, which is timely as understanding such systems is crucial for various applications.

Method: the authors developed a method called HEOM-2DVS, integrating hierarchical equations of motion with two-dimensional vibrational spectroscopy. This approach allows for simulating open quantum systems with non-Markovian dynamics and intricate quantum phenomena.

Result: computational results likely demonstrate the effectiveness of the HEOM-2DVS method in accurately modeling non-Markovian quantum dynamics, including energy relaxation, dephasing, thermal excitation, and non-perturbative interactions.

Conclusion: This work advances quantum dynamics simulations, providing a powerful tool for studying complex molecular processes in condensed phases under conditions where quantum effects are significant.

Abstract: The multi-mode anharmonic Brownian motion model offers a universal framework for simulating molecular vibrations in condensed phases. When vibrational energy surpasses thermal excitation, quantum effects become significant, necessitating a rigorous treatment of system-bath entanglement. The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) provide a powerful methodology for simulating such open quantum systems.

Motivation: Understanding reactive kinetics in astrophysical environments like planetary entry requires precise modeling of hydrogen reactions.

Method: Used first-prime quasi-classical trajectory simulations and master equation analyses. Introduced a modified two-temperature model and a hybrid coarse-graining model.

Result: The new models offer better accuracy in predicting energy transfer and dissociation dynamics, and accurate modeling is crucial for aerothermodynamic heating discrepancy in Uranus planetary entry.

Conclusion: The improved models address critical limitations of previous approaches, particularly in handling internal energy coupling and non-equilibrium processes.

Abstract: In the present study, two-different reduced-order models are proposed for $\text{H}_2\left(\text{X}^1Σ_g^+\right)$+$\text{H}\left({}^2\text{S}\right)$ system by leveraging first-principle quasi-classical trajectory simulations and in-depth master equation analyses. The most recent available ab-initio potential energy surface is adopted to construct a new set of rovibrational state-to-state kinetic database valid over a wide range of temperatures. Firstly, a modified two-temperature model is proposed by incorporating the master equation-informed model parameters, enabling the advanced treatment of the internal energy coupling and the nonequilibrium dissociation predictions. Secondly, a hybrid coarse-graining model is proposed by combining a graph-based approach optimized globally for a wide range of temperatures with a centrifugal-barrier-based coarse-graining method. The proposed reduced-order models offer significantly improved accuracy in predicting the nonequilibrium energy transfer and dissociation dynamics compared to the existing coarse-graining and 2T models in previous studies. In addition, aerothermal heating prediction relevant to Uranus planetary entry reveals 16.5% of convective heat flux discrepancy compared to the present modified 2T approach with the existing 2T, demonstrating the importance of accurate modeling of the chemical-kinetics in the $\text{H}_2\left(\text{X}^1Σ_g^+\right)$+$\text{H}\left({}^2\text{S}\right)$ system.

Abstract: Axion haloscopes provide a leading experimental approach to detecting QCD axion dark matter through resonant axion-photon conversion in microwave cavities. Extending haloscope sensitivity to low axion masses remains challenging due to the large resonator volumes required at sub-GHz frequencies. Re-entrant cavities offer a compact solution, but their performance depends strongly on geometric optimisation. We present a comprehensive finite-element study of re-entrant cavity haloscope designs operating in the 100 to 500 MHz range, comparing their performance using effective scan time as a figure of merit. Among the configurations studied, we identify a double attack geometry that achieves a roughly threefold improvement in effective scan time compared to a conventional single-rod re-entrant cavity. We further investigate practical implementation strategies, including a hybrid design employing one fixed rod and one tunable rod, which preserves a scan time gain while reducing mechanical complexity. These results demonstrate a pathway to enhanced low-mass axion haloscope sensitivity.

Abstract: We developed a novel gamma-ray detection system (TIARA) for range monitoring in Particle Therapy. The system employs Cherenkov-based gamma-ray detection modules arranged around the target or patient, operated in time coincidence with a fast plastic beam monitor (described in a separate paper). This work focuses on the design and comprehensive characterization of the gamma-ray detection module. It consists of a monolithic PbF$_2$ crystal (2 $\times$ 1.5 $\times$ 1.5 cm$^{3}$) coupled to a 2 $\times$ 2 SiPM matrix from Hamamatsu. A series of beam tests at different clinical facilities (MEDICYC and ProteusOne in France, CNAO in Italy) enabled the determination of the detector time resolution under various conditions, with values ranging from 222 to 283 ps FWHM (Full Width Half Maximum). Monte Carlo simulations including the optical response of PbF$_2$ allowed for the determination of the detection efficiency as a function of particle type and energy. For the final TIARA prototype, which will be composed of 30 modules, an overall detection efficiency of 0.45% is expected. Comparison with experimental data confirmed that the modules are effectively insensitive to neutrons, yielding an excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with an estimated SNR of 17 for a module placed at 25 cm from the 148 MeV proton beam axis. These features translate into high range accuracy: while the performance varies with beam energy and irradiation conditions, a range accuracy of 3.3 mm at 2$σ$ significance level was achieved at low intensity with 63 MeV protons at MEDICYC, for a small irradiation spot of $\mathbf{\sim}$10$\mathbf{^{7}}$ protons.

TL;DR: ALICE uses a new GEM TPC and GPU-based system for data compression and real-time tracking in Pb-Pb collisions, addressing challenges from high collision rates and large space charge distortions. Improved reconstruction algorithms, particularly cluster attachment, are developed for both online and offline processing. The implementation leverages GPU resources and Run-Time Compilation (RTC) for performance improvements, specifically for handling Pb-Pb data with high TPC occupancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ACCELERator colliders like the Large Hadronic Collider (LHC) require precise and efficient tracking of particles. ALICE's advanced tracking systems and data processing capabilities are crucial for understanding heavy ion collisions and their implications in high-energy physics research.

Method: The ALICE experiment uses a GEM TPC (Gas Electron Multiplier) coupled with a GPU-based online computing farm for data compression. They developed and implemented algorithms to address space charge distortions and improve cluster attachment in the inner TPC region. For offline processing, they also utilize GPU resources alongside the online farm. Performance optimizations, including Run-Time Compilation, are employed to enhance the efficiency of tracking and computing steps on GPUs.

Result: The enhanced ALICE tracking system, combined with GPU acceleration and innovative use of RTC, has significantly improved the accuracy and speed of particle tracking in high-energy heavy ion collisions. This has enabled more accurate reconstructions of particle trajectories and has facilitated deeper insights into QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) processes.

Conclusion: ALICE's advancements in GPU-based tracking and data processing are essential for advancing our understanding of heavy ion collisions and QCD. The integration of real Pb-Pb collision data has been instrumental in refining the tracking algorithms and optimizing GPU resources for both online and offline operations, paving the way for future enhancements in computational efficiency and data handling capacity.

Abstract: ALICE is the dedicated heavy ion experiment at the LHC at CERN and records lead-lead collisions at a rate of up to 50 kHz in LHC Run 3. To cope with such collision and data rates, ALICE uses a new GEM TPC with continuous readout and a GPU-based online computing farm for data compression. Operating the first GEM TPC of this size with large space charge distortions due to the high collision rate has many implications for the track reconstruction algorithm, both anticipated and unanticipated. With real Pb-Pb data available, the TPC tracking algorithm needed to be refined, particularly with respect to improved cluster attachment at the inner TPC region. In order to use the online computing farm efficiently for offline processing when there is no beam in the LHC, ALICE is currently running TPC tracking on GPUs also in offline processing. For the future, ALICE aims to run more computing steps on the GPU, and to use other GPU-enabled resources besides its online computing farm. These aspects, along with better possibilities for performance optimizations led to several improvements of the GPU framework and GPU tracking code, particularly using Run Time Compilation (RTC). The talk will give an overview of the improvements for the ALICE tracking code, mostly based on experience from reconstructing real Pb-Pb data with high TPC occupancy. In addition, an overview of the online and offline processing status on GPUs will be given, and an overview of how RTC improves the ALICE tracking code and GPU support.

Abstract: The CYGNO experiment employs an optical-readout Time Projection Chamber (TPC) to search for rare low-energy interactions using finely resolved scintillation images. While the optical readout provides rich topological information, it produces large, sparse megapixel images that challenge real-time triggering, data reduction, and background discrimination.
  We summarize two complementary machine-learning approaches developed within CYGNO. First, we present a fast and fully unsupervised strategy for online data reduction based on reconstruction-based anomaly detection. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images (i.e. frames acquired with GEM amplification disabled) learns the detector noise morphology and highlights particle-induced structures through localized reconstruction residuals, from which compact Regions of Interest (ROIs) are extracted. On real prototype data, the selected configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with ~25 ms per-frame inference time on a consumer GPU.
  Second, we report a weakly supervised application of the Classification Without Labels (CWoLa) framework to data acquired with an Americium--Beryllium neutron source. Using only mixed AmBe and standard datasets (no event-level labels), a convolutional classifier learns to identify nuclear-recoil-like topologies. The achieved performance approaches the theoretical limit imposed by the mixture composition and isolates a high-score population with compact, approximately circular morphologies consistent with nuclear recoils.

Abstract: We present a roadmap to a deployable, intrinsically calibrated thermometer with long-term accuracy of 30 mK, exceeding existing on-orbit resistance-based thermometers. Our quantum blackbody thermometer is based on measuring fluorescence ratios of optically excited rubidium atoms in microfabricated vapor cells. The key advantage of the quantum blackbody thermometer is that long-term stability of the fluorescence ratios is guaranteed by the immutable physical properties (transition strengths) of the rubidium atom. This should be compared against resistance-based thermometers, such as platinum resistance thermometers, which may be calibrated with exceptional accuracy but are susceptible to temporal drift and shifts due to improper handling.

Abstract: This work presents a non-local terahertz metasurface integrated into a leaky-wave antenna for robust, wide-angle beam steering. The metasurface encodes a holographic pattern by explicitly inducing tangential and normal susceptibilities, along with magnetoelectric coupling. This design maintains stable radiation performance even when the longitudinal wavenumber of the incident guided mode - and thus its effective impinging angle - varies as a function of frequency. In particular, we show that there exists a limit to achieving exact angular insensitivity and propose an optimization-based framework to obtain the required susceptibilities that closely approximate near angle-insensitive performance for stable beam-steering performance. Additionally, an iterative synthesis approach is introduced that maps abstract susceptibilities to physically realizable structures. Full-wave simulations demonstrate a beam-scanning range of nearly 50 degrees over the 2.0-2.7 THz band - a more than threefold improvement over conventional local-metasurface designs.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel laser heating stage for X-ray transmission studies of molten oxides, addressing the issue of reduced optical path length due to spreading.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X-ray transmission studies of molten oxides are important for understanding their behavior under high temperatures, but limitations in the optical path length hinder their quality. This paper aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: The method involves a triple fiber laser head with high power, a PICH temperature control system, and a vacuum chamber with mass spectrometer. They used a thermocouple to actuate the melt into a liquid bridge to optimize the transmission path.

Result: The setup successfully tracks melting kinetics and correlates structural changes with gas phase evolution, providing high-quality data.

Conclusion: This advanced setup offers a comprehensive solution for high-quality X-ray transmission experiments across various facilities.

Abstract: We report the design and development of a compact, integrated laser heating stage tailored for in situ high-temperature X ray transmission studies of molten oxides. In horizontal beam geometries, widely used in both laboratory and synchrotron facilities, the natural spreading (wetting) of molten samples on substrates significantly reduces the effective vertical optical path length, detrimental to signal quality in transmission-mode measurements. To overcome this limitation, we introduced a thermocouple assisted active geometry modulation technique. This method mechanically lifts the spreading melt into a liquid bridge via surface tension, optimizing the transmission path length while simultaneously enabling in situ temperature monitoring. The device features a triple fiber coupled laser head with high power density, a precision closed loop Proportional Integral Derivative temperature control system, and an atmosphere controlled vacuum chamber coupled with a mass spectrometer. This integration allows for simultaneous evolved gas analysis, enabling the correlation of structural phase transitions with chemical volatilization or reaction dynamics. Validated by tracking the melting kinetics of a multicomponent glass precursor, this versatile setup provides a comprehensive solution for high quality data acquisition in X ray transmission experiments across various sources.

Abstract: Primary human cells offer the most faithful representation of native human physiology, yet their practical utility is constrained by the difficulty of introducing exogenous genetic material. Electroporation provides a promising non-viral gene delivery approach; however, conventional bulk systems lack the uniformity and integration required for heterogeneous primary cell samples. Here, we present a vortex-assisted electroporation platform integrating size-selective cell trapping with enhanced throughput, parameter optimization across buffer and electrical conditions, and robust delivery of plasmid DNA and in vitro-transcribed mRNA in primary human cells. This integrated platform provides a unified workflow that addresses sample heterogeneity, throughput demands, and delivery efficiency, enabling broader implementation of non-viral gene delivery into primary cells for research and translational applications.

Abstract: Fluorescent spin qubits are central building blocks of quantum technologies. Placing these qubits at surfaces maximizes coupling to nearby spins and fields, enabling nanoscale sensing and facilitating integration with photonic and superconducting devices. However, reducing the dimensions or size of established qubit systems without sacrificing the qubit performance or degrading the coherence lifetime remains challenging. Here, we introduce a surface molecular qubit formed by pentacene molecules scaffolded on a two-dimensional (2D) material, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The qubit exhibits stable fluorescence and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) from cryogenic to ambient conditions. With fully deuterated pentacene, the Hahn-echo coherence reaches 22 $μ$s and further extends to 214 $μ$s under dynamical decoupling, outperforming state-of-the-art shallow NV centers in diamond, despite being positioned directly on the surface. We map the local spin environment, resolving couplings to nearby nuclear and electron spins that can serve as auxiliary quantum resources. This platform combines true surface integration, long qubit coherence, and scalable fabrication, opening routes to quantum sensing, quantum simulation, and hybrid quantum devices. It also paves the way for a broader family of 2D material-supported molecular qubits.

Abstract: Two-photon light-matter interactions exhibit distinctive features such as spectral collapse. The two-photon Dicke model has been reported to exhibit a superradiant phase which could be useful in quantum applications. Here we show that this superradiant phase is not a genuine thermodynamic phase but a finite-size effect. Combining analytical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the superradiant region shrinks with increasing system size and disappears in the thermodynamic limit, while spectral collapse remains. Our results clarify the nature of superradiant conditions in two-photon systems and constrain its realization in quantum platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quest for improved quantum spin sensors with high stability and addressability, especially at material surfaces, motivated this research to overcome depth limitations and enhance functionality.

Method: The researchers employed hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as a substrate, anchoring spin-active molecules to it. They used Hahn-echo measurements to assess spin coherence and incorporated deuteration for chemical tuning, achieving significant improvements in coherence times which were further extended using dynamic decoupling. Probing at RT also revealed the sensor's robustness in real-world conditions.

Result: The main findings include Hahn-echo spin coherence times exceeding 3.4 microseconds at 4K, surpassing bulk organic crystals, and a dynamic decoupling-driven coherence of over 300 microseconds. Additionally, detection of proximal proton spins and magnetism in 2D magnets below hBN demonstrated the sensor's versatile and scalable nature.

Conclusion: This breakthrough paves the way for novel quantum sensors that could integrate optical control, maintain long-term performance, and offer adaptability beyond traditional solid-state solutions, significantly advancing quantum sensing technologies.

Abstract: Optically addressable spins at material surfaces have represented a long-standing ambition in quantum sensing, providing atomic resolution and quantum-limited sensitivity. However, they are constrained by a finite depth at which the quantum spins can be stabilized. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid molecular-2D architecture that realizes quantum spin sensors directly on top of the surface. By anchoring spin-active molecules onto hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we eliminate the depth of the quantum sensor while also exhibiting robust spin properties from 4~K to room temperature (RT). The Hahn-echo spin coherence time exceeds \(T_2 = 3.4~\upmu\text{s}\) at 4~K, outperforming values in bulk organic crystals and overturning the prevailing expectation that spin inevitably deteriorates upon approaching the surface. By chemically tuning the molecule through deuteration, \(T_2\) improves by more than 10-fold, and under dynamic decoupling, coherence is prolonged to the intrinsic lifetime limit, exceeding 300~\(\upmu\text{s}\). Proximal proton spins and the magnetic response of two-dimensional magnets beneath the hBN layer have been detected at RT. These molecular spins form surface quantum sensors with long coherence, optical addressability, and interfacial versatility, enabling a scalable, adaptable architecture beyond what conventional solid-state platforms offer.

Abstract: We present a novel quantum circuit extraction scheme that tightly integrates graph-like ZX diagrams with hardware-adaptive routing. The method utilizes the degrees of freedom during the conversion from a ZX diagram to a quantum circuit (extraction). It alternates between generating multiple extraction options and evaluating them based on hardware constraints, allowing the routing algorithm to inform and guide the extraction process. This feedback loop extends existing graph-like ZX extraction and supports modular integration of different extraction algorithms, routing strategies, and target hardware, making it a versatile building block during compilation. To perform numerical evaluations, a reference instance of the scheme is implemented with SWAP-based routing for neutral atom hardware and evaluated using various benchmark collections on small-to mid-scale circuits. The reference code is available as open-source, allowing fast integration of other extraction and/or routing tools to stimulate further research and foster improvements of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: Quantum technologies promise secure communication networks and powerful new forms of information processing, but building these systems at scale remains a major challenge. Diamond is an especially attractive material for quantum devices because it can host atomic-scale defects that emit single photons and store quantum information with exceptional stability. However, fabricating the optical structures needed to control light in diamond typically relies on slow, bespoke processes that are difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce a manufacturing approach that brings diamond quantum photonics closer to industrial production. Instead of sequentially defining each device by lithography written directly on diamond, we fabricate high-precision silicon masks using commercial semiconductor foundries and transfer them onto diamond via microtransfer printing. These masks define large arrays of nanoscale optical structures, shifting the most demanding pattern-definition steps away from the diamond substrate, improving uniformity, yield, and throughput. Using this method, we demonstrate hundreds of diamond "quantum microchiplets" with improved optical performance and controlled interaction with quantum emitters. The chiplet format allows defective devices to be replaced and enables integration with existing photonic and electronic circuits. Our results show that high-quality diamond quantum devices can be produced using scalable, foundry-compatible techniques. This approach provides a practical pathway toward large-scale quantum photonic systems and hybrid quantum-classical technologies built on established semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure.

Conclusion: 优化的MA-QAOA算法可以有效降低计算开销，同时保持与标准方法相同的性能。

Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Multi-angle QAOA (MA-QAOA), which assigns independent parameters to each Hamiltonian operator term, achieves superior approximation performance even with fewer layers than standard QAOA. Unfortunately, this increased expressibility can raise the classical computational cost due to a greater number of parameters. The recently proposed Layerwise MA-QAOA (LMA-QAOA) reduces this overhead by training one layer at a time, but it may suffer from obtaining the precise solution due to the previously fixed parameters. This work addresses two questions for efficient MA-QAOA training: (i) What is the optimal granularity for parameter updates per epoch, and (ii) How can we get precise final cost function results while only partially updating the parameters per epoch? Despite the benefit of reducing the parameters that update per epoch can reduce the classical computation overhead, too fine or coarse a granularity of Hamiltonian update can degrade the MA-QAOA training efficiency. We find that optimizing one complete layer per epoch is an efficient granularity. Moreover, selectively retraining each layer by tracking gradient variations can achieve a final cost function equivalent to the standard MA-QAOA while lowering the parameter update overhead. Based on these insights, we propose Orbit-QAOA, which cyclically revisits layers and selectively freezes stabilized parameters. Across diverse graph benchmarks, Orbit-QAOA reduces training steps by up to 81.8%, reduces approximation ratio error by up to 72x compared to the unified stop condition-applied enhanced LMA-QAOA, and achieves equivalent approximation performance compared to the standard MA-QAOA.

Abstract: Quantum transport on structured networks is strongly influenced by interference effects, which can dramatically modify how information propagates through a system. We develop a quantum-information-theoretic framework for scattering on graphs in which a full network of connected scattering sites is treated as a quantum channel linking designated input and output ports. Using the Redheffer star product to construct global scattering matrices from local ones, we identify resonant concatenation, a nonlinear composition rule generated by internal back-reflections. In contrast to ordinary channel concatenation, resonant concatenation can suppress noise and even produce super-activation of the quantum capacity, yielding positive capacity in configurations where each constituent channel individually has zero capacity. We illustrate these effects through models exhibiting resonant-tunneling-enhanced transport. Our approach provides a general methodology for analyzing coherent information flow in quantum graphs, with relevance for quantum communication, control, and simulation in structured environments.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new framework for Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) mitigates random coherent errors due to hardware noise without increasing circuit depth or requiring additional qubits. The framework uses multiple noisy QSP circuits combined with measurement-level averaging to suppress random phase errors during Z rotations, adapting the approximation error vs. hardware noise trade-off for practical implementation under stringent quantum hardware constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid development of quantum hardware has been accompanied by persistent noise issues that hinder the practical deployment of quantum algorithms. Random coherent errors, which accumulate during circuit execution, pose a significant and insurmountable challenge in utilizing near-term quantum devices. This has motivated the search for effective noise mitigation strategies that can spare hardware resources while maintaining algorithmic performance.

Method: The research introduces an ensemble-based approach within the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) framework. This approach involves combining multiple noisy QSP circuits and employing measurement-level averaging to suppress random phase errors inherent in Z rotations. Additionally, the methodology includes the development of robust QSP algorithms for implementing polynomial functions of Hermitian matrices and estimating observables, which have direct applications in Hamiltonian simulation, quantum linear systems, and ground-state preparation. The trade-off between approximation error and hardware-induced noise is analyzed to ensure compatibility with the limited depth and coherence required by current quantum hardware.

Result: The proposed framework successfully addresses the challenge of random coherent errors by leveraging an ensemble of noisy QSP circuits and measurement-level averaging. This results in a practical pathway for integrating noise mitigation into quantum algorithm design, thereby advancing the development of robust quantum computing systems. The pathways identified by this research open the possibility for implementing effective error mitigation strategies that can complement algorithmic advancements, enabling the exploitation of near- and mid-term quantum devices for scientific applications.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this study lays a solid foundation for integrating error mitigation into the design of quantum algorithms, particularly under the constraints of current quantum hardware. By demonstrating a method to suppress random coherent errors without increasing circuit depth or ancillary qubit requirements, it opens new possibilities for leveraging existing quantum hardware to solve practical scientific problems. The insights gained from this research are crucial for advancing the field of quantum computing toward real-world applications.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in quantum hardware, noise remains a central obstacle to deploying quantum algorithms on near-term devices. In particular, random coherent errors that accumulate during circuit execution constitute a dominant and fundamentally challenging noise source. We introduce a noise-resilient framework for Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) that mitigates such coherent errors without increasing circuit depth or ancillary qubit requirements. Our approach uses ensembles of noisy QSP circuits combined with measurement-level averaging to suppress random phase errors in Z rotations. Building on this framework, we develop robust QSP algorithms for implementing polynomial functions of Hermitian matrices and for estimating observables, with applications to Hamiltonian simulation, quantum linear systems, and ground-state preparation. We analyze the trade-off between approximation error and hardware noise, which is essential for practical implementation under the stringent depth and coherence constraints of current quantum hardware. Our results establish a practical pathway for integrating error mitigation seamlessly into algorithmic design, advancing the development of robust quantum computing, and enabling the discovery of scientific applications with near- and mid-term quantum devices.

Abstract: A central building block of a heat engine is the working fluid, which mediates the conversion of heat into work. In nanoscale heat engines, the working fluid can be a quantum system whose behavior and dynamics are non-classical. A particularly versatile realization is a quantum resonator, which allows for precise control and coupling to thermal reservoirs, making it an ideal platform for exploring quantum thermodynamic processes. Here, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of a driven quantum resonator whose temperature is controlled by modulating its natural frequency. We evaluate the work performed by the external drive and the resulting heat flow between the resonator and its environment, both within linear response and beyond. To further elucidate these processes, we determine the full distribution of photon exchanges between the resonator and its environment, characterized by its first few cumulants. Our results provide quantitative insights into the interplay between heat, work, and fluctuations, and may help in designing future heat engines.

TL;DR: The paper provides a simplified proof for distinguishing quantum states using LOCC protocols and connects this to quantum channel capacities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper builds on previous work by Walgate et al. and connects their results to quantum channel capacities, which is an important topic in quantum information theory.

Method: The authors use operator theory and finite/infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces to extend results and construct an algorithm for distilling pure states.

Result: A simplified proof is provided for distinguishing pure states, an O(d_A²d_B²) algorithm for LOCC protocols is constructed, and a connection to quantum channel capacities is established.

Conclusion: This work simplifies and extends LOCC protocol results and clarifies the connection between LOCC and quantum channel capacities, contributing to the understanding of quantum state distinguishability and resource theories.

Abstract: In a seminal work [PRL85.4972], Walgate, Short, Hardy, and Vedral prove in finite dimensions that for every pair of pure multipartite orthogonal quantum states, there exists a one-way local operations and classical communication (LOCC) protocol that perfectly distinguishes the pair. We extend this result to infinite dimensions with a simpler proof. For states on $\mathbb{C}^{d_A \times d_A} \otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_B \times d_B}$, we strengthen this existence result by constructing an $O(d_A^2 d_B^2)$-time algorithm that specifies such a perfect one-way LOCC protocol. Finally, we establish the equivalence between Walgate et al.'s result and the fact that the one-shot environment-assisted classical capacity of every quantum channel is at least 1 bit per channel use, thereby clarifying the literature on these notions. At the core of all of these results is the fact that every operator with vanishing trace admits a basis where its diagonal entries are all zero.

Abstract: Scientific computing has long relied on double precision (64-bit floating point) arithmetic to guarantee accuracy in simulations of real-world phenomena. However, the growing availability of hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has made low-precision formats attractive due to their superior performance, reduced memory footprint, and improved energy efficiency. In this work, we investigate the role of mixed-precision arithmetic in neural-network based Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), a widely used method for solving computationally otherwise intractable quantum many-body systems. We first derive general analytical bounds on the error introduced by reduced precision on Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, and then empirically validate these bounds on the use-case of VMC. We demonstrate that significant portions of the algorithm, in particular, sampling the quantum state, can be executed in half precision without loss of accuracy. More broadly, this work provides a theoretical framework to assess the applicability of mixed-precision arithmetic in machine-learning approaches that rely on MCMC sampling. In the context of VMC, we additionally demonstrate the practical effectiveness of mixed-precision strategies, enabling more scalable and energy-efficient simulations of quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces and rigorously analyzes a new class of one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks whose dynamics are governed by a parametrized family of extended CMV matrices. The model generalizes the unitary almost Mathieu operator (UAMO) and exhibits a richer spectral phase diagram, closely resembling the extended Harper's model. It provides the first example of a solvable quasi-periodic quantum walk that exhibits a stable region of purely singular continuous spectrum.

Motivation: Superconducting qubits are vital for quantum computing. This research seeks to enhance their scalability and compatibility.

Method: Compares synthesis with different gases using high and low temperatures.

Result: Krypton reduces required temperature, leading to better performance and scalability of Ta-based qubits.

Conclusion: Use of krypton as sputter gas enhances compatibility and performance of scalable Superconducting quantum computing components.

Abstract: Superconducting qubits based on tantalum (Ta) thin films have demonstrated the highest-performing microwave resonators and qubits. This makes Ta an attractive material for superconducting quantum computing applications, but, so far, direct deposition has largely relied on high substrate temperatures exceeding \SI{400}{\celsius} to achieve the body-centered cubic phase, BCC (\textalpha-Ta). This leads to compatibility issues for scalable fabrication leveraging standard semiconductor fabrication lines. Here, we show that changing the sputter gas from argon (Ar) to krypton (Kr) promotes BCC Ta synthesis on silicon (Si) at temperatures as low as \SI{200}{\celsius}, providing a wide process window compatible with back-end-of-the-line fabrication standards. Furthermore, we find these films to have substantially higher electronic conductivity, consistent with clean-limit superconductivity. We validated the microwave performance through coplanar waveguide resonator measurements, finding that films deposited at \SI{250}{\celsius} and \SI{350}{\celsius} exhibit a tight performance distribution at the state of the art. Higher temperature-grown films exhibit higher losses, in correlation with the degree of Ta/Si intermixing revealed by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. Finally, with these films, we demonstrate transmon qubits with a relatively compact, \SI{20}{\micro\meter} capacitor gap, achieving a median quality factor up to 14 million.

Abstract: We propose and systematically analyze a practical scheme for implementing a one-dimensional non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model using individually addressable Rydberg atom arrays. Our setup consists of an atomic chain with three-atom unit cells, in which a synthetic gauge field is generated by applying multi-color laser fields. By engineering fast dissipative channels for one auxiliary atom in each unit cell, the adiabatic elimination effectively gives rise to a non-Hermitian skin effect. We examine how fluctuations in the experimental parameters influence both the skin effect and the topological invariant under open and periodic boundary conditions in real space and find that both features remain highly robust. This work establishes a versatile, controllable, and programmable open-system quantum simulator with neutral atoms, providing a clear route for exploring rich non-Hermitian topological phenomena.

Abstract: The minimum amount of thermodynamic work required in order to implement a quantum computation or a quantum state transformation can be quantified using frameworks based on the resource theory of thermodynamics, deeply rooted in the works of Landauer and Bennett. For instance, the work we need to invest in order to implement $n$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of a quantum channel is quantified by the thermodynamic capacity of the channel when we require the implementation's accuracy to be guaranteed in diamond norm over the $n$-system input. Recent work showed that work extraction can be implemented universally, meaning the same implementation works for a large class of input states, while achieving a variable work cost that is optimal for each individual i.i.d. input state. Here, we revisit some techniques leading to derivation of the thermodynamic capacity, and leverage them to construct a thermodynamic implementation of $n$ i.i.d. copies of any time-covariant quantum channel, up to some process decoherence that is necessary because the implementation reveals the amount of consumed work. The protocol uses so-called thermal operations and achieves the optimal per-input work cost for any i.i.d. input state; it relies on the conditional erasure protocol in our earlier work, adjusted to yield variable work. We discuss the effect of the work-cost decoherence. While it can significantly corrupt the correlations between the output state and any reference system, we show that for any time-covariant i.i.d. input state, the state on the output system faithfully reproduces that of the desired process to be implemented. As an immediate consequence of our results, we recover recent results for optimal work extraction from i.i.d. states up to the error scaling and implementation specifics, and propose an optimal preparation protocol for time-covariant i.i.d. states.

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a promising two-dimensional host for stable single-photon emission owing to its wide bandgap, high photostability, and compatibility with nanophotonic integration. We present a simulation-based study of temperature-dependent spectral dynamics and optical coherence in a mechanically decoupled quantum emitter in hBN. Employing a hybrid stochastic framework that combines Ornstein--Uhlenbeck detuning fluctuations with temperature-dependent, Gaussian-distributed discrete frequency jumps, motivated by experimentally observed spectral diffusion and blinking, we reproduce the measured evolution of inhomogeneous linewidth broadening and the progressive degradation of photon coherence across the relevant cryogenic range (5-30K). The model captures phonon-related spectral diffusion with a cubic temperature dependence and the onset of jump-like spectral instabilities at higher temperatures. By calibrating the hybrid diffusion, jump parameters to the experimentally measured full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the emission line and analyzing the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(τ)$ under resonant driving, we establish a unified phenomenological description that links stochastic detuning dynamics to the decay of optical coherence in a resonantly driven emitter. Analysis of $g^{(2)}(τ)$ under resonant driving reveals an additional dephasing rate $γ_{\mathrm{sd+j}}$ that rises monotonically with temperature and drive strength, leading to a predicted critical crossover to overdamped dynamics at $T_{\mathrm{crit}} \approx 25.91$~K. This hybrid framework provides a quantitative connection between accessible spectroscopic observables and the dominant noise mechanisms limiting coherent optical control in mechanically decoupled quantum emitters, exemplified in hBN and generalizable to similar emitters in other materials.

Abstract: Contextuality is a central feature distinguishing quantum from classical probability theories, yet its operational meaning remains subject to interpretation. We reconsider contextuality from an information-theoretic perspective, focusing on operational models constrained to maintain a single internal state with fixed semantics across multiple contexts. Under this constraint, we show that contextual statistics certify an unavoidable obstruction to classical probabilistic descriptions. Specifically, any classical model that reproduces such statistics must either embed contextual dependence into the internal state or introduce additional external labels carrying nonzero information. This result identifies contextuality as a witness of irreducible information cost in classical representations, rather than as a purely nonclassical anomaly. From this viewpoint, quantum probability emerges as a canonical framework that accommodates contextual operations without requiring explicit contextual encoding.

Abstract: Although classical nonlinear dynamics suggests that sufficiently strong nonlinearity can sustain oscillations, quantization of such model typically yields a time-independent steady state that respects time-translation symmetry and thus precludes time-crystal behavior. We identify dephasing as the primary mechanism enforcing this symmetry, which can be suppressed by intercomponent phase correlations. Consequently, a sufficient condition for realizing a continuous time crystal is a nonlinear quantum self-sustaining system exhibiting quantum synchronization among its constituents. As a concrete example, we demonstrate spontaneous oscillations in a synchronized array of van der Pol oscillators, corroborated by both semiclassical dynamics and the quantum Liouville spectrum. These results reduce the identification of time crystals in many-body systems to the evaluation of only two-body correlations and provide a framework for classifying uncorrelated time crystals as trivial.

Abstract: We observe that the transition probability in a static two-level quantum detector interacting with a coherent Rindler photon is different from the same of the Rindler detector which is in interaction with a coherent Minkowski photon. Situation does not change in the response of quantum detector for the classical limit of the photon state. This we investigate in $(1+1)$ and $(3+1)$-spacetime dimensions. Interestingly, the transition probabilities of the ``classical'' detector in the classical limit of the photon state in $(1+1)$-dimensions, for these two scenarios, appear to be identical when the frequencies of photon mode and detector are taken to be same. However, our obtained detector's transition probabilities in $(3+1)$-dimensions, which are calculated under the large acceleration condition, do not show such signature. The implications of these observations are discussed as well.

Abstract: We investigate the process of quantum teleportation in an expanding universe modeled by Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime, focusing on two cosmologically relevant scenarios: a power-law expansion and the de Sitter universe. Adopting a field-theoretical approach, we analyze the quantum correlations between two comoving observers who share an entangled mode of a scalar field. Using the Bogoliubov transformation, we compute the teleportation fidelity and examine its dependence on the expansion rate, initial entanglement, and the mode frequency. Our findings indicate that spacetime curvature and the underlying cosmological background significantly affect the efficiency of quantum teleportation, particularly through mode mixing and vacuum structure. We also compare our results with the flat Minkowski case to highlight the role of cosmic expansion in degrading or preserving quantum information.

Abstract: Quantum computing is entering a period in which progress will be shaped as much by advances in computer science as by improvements in hardware. The central thesis of this report is that early fault-tolerant quantum computing shifts many of the primary bottlenecks from device physics alone to computer-science-driven system design, integration, and evaluation. While large-scale, fully fault-tolerant quantum computers remain a long-term objective, near- and medium-term systems will support early fault-tolerant computation with small numbers of logical qubits and tight constraints on error rates, connectivity, latency, and classical control. How effectively such systems can be used will depend on advances across algorithms, error correction, software, and architecture. This report identifies key research challenges for computer scientists and organizes them around these four areas, each centered on a fundamental question.

Abstract: Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) is a quantum computational model that leverages linear optics to solve sampling problems believed to be classically intractable. Recent experimental breakthroughs have demonstrated quantum advantage using GBS, motivating its application to real-world combinatorial optimization problems.
  In this work, we reformulate the graph coloring problem as an integer programming problem using the independent set formulation. This enables the use of GBS to identify cliques in the complement graph, which correspond to independent sets in the original graph. Our method is benchmarked against classical heuristics and exact algorithms on two sets of instances: Erdős-Rényi random graphs and graphs derived from a smart-charging use case. The results demonstrate that GBS can provide competitive solutions, highlighting its potential as a quantum-enhanced heuristic for graph-based optimization.

Abstract: We present a simple framework for classical and quantum ``memory'' in which the Hamiltonian at time $t$ depends on past values of a control Hamiltonian through a causal kernel. This structure naturally describes finite-bandwidth or filtered control channels and provides a clean way to distinguish between memory in the control and genuine non-Markovian dynamics of the state. We focus on models where $H(t)=H_0+\int_{-\infty}^{t}K(t-s)\,H_1(s)\,ds$, and illustrate the framework on single-qubit examples such as $H(t)=σ_z+Φ(t)σ_x$ with $Φ(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{t}K(t-s)\,u(s)\,ds$. We derive basic properties of such dynamics, discuss conditions for unitarity, give an equivalent time-local description for exponential kernels, and show explicitly how hysteresis arises in the response of a driven qubit.

*Sheng-Xian Xiao,Tao Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper generalizes quantum frequency mixing to a ladder-type four-level system, revealing a secondary splitting of the Autler-Townes splitting. The authors derive an effective Hamiltonian using multi-mode Floquet theory and demonstrate that their frequency mixing scheme enables continuous tuning of the resonant frequency between upper levels, facilitating broad-band sensing of AC fields. Additionally, they introduce an extra periodic driving to achieve two interference effects: interference among Floquet channels and loop interference from closed coherent pathways, which can be independently measured from transmission spectra. The distance between double splitting peaks reflects the interference of Floquet channels, while their asymmetric linewidth broadening is linked to the loop's effective phase. This research offers complementary methods for extracting the AC field's phase and introduces a new coherent control paradigm for multi-level quantum systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation likely stems from the desire to enhance the precision and versatility of quantum systems for sensing applications, such as detecting varying AC fields in environmental monitoring or industrial automation. Achieving tunable and robust resonant frequencies is crucial for improving the sensitivity and reliability of such systems, making this research relevant to both fundamental quantum physics and applied sensing technologies.

Method: The authors employ a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental methods. They start by generalizing quantum frequency mixing to a ladder-type four-level system, utilizing multi-mode Floquet theory to derive an effective Hamiltonian. This allows them to predict and explain the observed secondary splitting of the Autler-Townes splitting. They then design an additional periodic driving to observe two distinct quantum interference effects, which they validate through transmission spectra analysis. The theoretical framework is complemented by experimental setups that measure the transmission spectra to observe the proposed effects.

Result: The key results include the successful demonstration of a secondary splitting of the Autler-Townes splitting, which is explained by the derived effective Hamiltonian. The frequency mixing scheme enables continuous tunability of resonant frequencies, which is essential for broad-band sensing. By introducing an additional periodic driving, the researchers observe two interference effects: interference among Floquet channels and loop interference. These interference effects can be independently measured, providing new tools for analyzing the AC field's phase and the system's coherence. The asymmetric linewidth broadening of the splitting peaks is linked to the total effective phase of the loop, offering a deeper understanding of the quantum system's behavior and enabling complementary readouts for phase extraction.

Conclusion: This paper presents a groundbreaking approach to enhancing the capabilities of multi-level quantum systems for sensing applications. By generalizing quantum frequency mixing to a ladder-type four-level system and introducing additional periodic driving, the researchers achieve tunable resonant frequencies and observe two distinct interference effects, which can be independently measured. This work not only improves the sensitivity and reliability of quantum sensing devices but also opens up new avenues for coherent control in multi-level quantum systems, offering both practical applications and theoretical insights.

Abstract: In this paper, we generalized the quantum frequency mixing technology to a ladder-type four-level system and studied its effect on electromagnetically induced transparency spectra. We found a secondary splitting of Autler-Townes splitting in the probing field transmission spectra, which could be understood by the effective Hamiltonian derived with multi-mode Floquet theory. The Frequency mixing scheme developed here enables continuous tunablity of the resonant frequency between upper levels, which facilitates the broad band sensing of AC field. Furthermore, by introducing an additional periodic driving, we realize an effective model that two distinct quantum interference effects coexist: interference among Floquet channels and loop interference arising from closed coherent pathways. Both interference effects could be read out from the transmission spectra independently. The changing of the distance between double splitting peaks represents the interference of Floquet channels, while their asymmetric linewidth broadening is linked with the total effective phase of the loop. This not only provides complementary readout for extracting the phase of AC field, but also establishes a new paradigm for coherent control in multi-level quantum systems.

Abstract: We study the quantum Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator at the resonant (equal-frequency) point, where the dynamics becomes non-diagonalisable and the conventional Fock-space construction collapses. At the classical level, the degenerate system admits more than one Hamiltonian formulation generating the same equations of motion, leading to a nontrivial quantisation ambiguity. Working first in the ghostly two-dimensional Hamiltonian formulation, we construct differential intertwiners that generate a spectrum-generating algebra acting on the generalised eigenspaces of the Hamiltonian. This algebra organises the generalised eigenvectors into finite Jordan chains and closes into a hidden $su(2)$ Lie algebra that exists only at resonance.
  We then show that quantising a classically equivalent Hamiltonian yields a radically different quantum theory, with a fully diagonalisable spectrum and genuine degeneracies. Our results demonstrate that the resonant Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator provides a concrete example in which classically equivalent Hamiltonians define inequivalent quantum theories.

Abstract: Preparing large-qubit Dicke states is of broad interest in quantum computing and quantum metrology. However, the number of qubits available on a single quantum processing unit (QPU) is limited -- motivating the distributed preparation of such states across multiple QPUs as a practical approach to scalability. In this article, we investigate the distributed preparation of $n$-qubit $k$-excitation Dicke states $D(n,k)$ across a general number $p$ of QPUs, presenting a distributed quantum circuit (each QPU hosting approximately $\lceil n/p \rceil$ qubits) that prepares the state with communication complexity $O(p \log k)$, circuit size $O(nk)$, and circuit depth $O\left(p^2 k + \log k \log (n/k)\right)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction to simultaneously achieve logarithmic communication complexity and polynomial circuit size and depth. We also establish a lower bound on the communication complexity of $p$-QPU distributed state preparation for a general target state. This lower bound is formulated in terms of the canonical polyadic rank (CP-rank) of a tensor associated with the target state. For the special case $p = 2$, we explicitly compute the CP-rank corresponding to the Dicke state $D(n,k)$ and derive a lower bound of $\lceil\log (k + 1)\rceil$, which shows that the communication complexity of our construction matches this fundamental limit.

Abstract: This work investigates network nonlocality sharing for a broad class of bipartite Bell inequalities in a generalized star network with an $(n,m,k)$ configuration, comprising $n$ independent branches, $m$ sequential Alices per branch, and $k$ measurement settings per party. On each branch, the intermediate Alices implement optimal weak measurements, whereas the final Alice and the central Bob perform sharp projective measurements. Network nonlocality sharing is witnessed when the quantum values of the network correlations associated with relevant parties simultaneously violate a star-network Bell inequality generated from the given class of bipartite Bell inequalities. We streamline the calculation of the quantum values of the network correlations and derive an analytical expression for the bipartite quantum correlator, valid for arbitrary measurement settings and weak-measurement strengths. The network nonlocality sharing for Vértesi inequalities has been studied within the framework, and simultaneous violations are found in $(2,2,6)$ and $(2,2,465)$ cases, with the latter exhibiting greater robustness. Our approach suggests a practical route to studying network nonlocality sharing by utilizing diverse bipartite Bell inequalities beyond the commonly used CHSH-type constructions.

Abstract: High fidelity quantum operations are key to enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. Superconducting quantum processors have demonstrated high-fidelity operations, but on larger devices there is commonly a broad distribution of qualities, with the low-performing tail affecting near-term performance and applications. Here we present an error budgeting procedure for the native two-qubit operation on a 32-qubit superconducting-qubit-based quantum computer, the OQC Toshiko gen-1 system. We estimate the prevalence of different forms of error such as coherent error and control qubit leakage, then apply error suppression strategies based on the most significant sources of error, making use of pulse-shaping and additional compensating gates. These techniques require no additional hardware overhead and little additional calibration, making them suitable for routine adoption. An average reduction of 3.7x in error rate for two qubit operations is shown across a chain of 16 qubits, with the median error rate improving from 4.6$\%$ to 1.2$\%$ as measured by interleaved randomized benchmarking. The largest improvements are seen on previously under-performing qubit pairs, demonstrating the importance of practical error suppression in reducing the low-performing tail of gate qualities and achieving consistently good performance across a device.

Abstract: The localization property of a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with quasi-periodic on-site potential is investigated. In contrast to the preceding investigations, the quantum phase transition between localized state and extended one is achieved by adjusting the strength of intracellular or intercellular hopping. The energy spectra and eigenstate distributions of the system's Hamiltonian near the boundary of the phase transition exhibit different behaviors when the Hermiticity, non-Hermiticity and mosaic modulation of the quasi-periodic potential are considered, respectively. The existence of the mobility ring is revealed in the non-Hermitian SSH chain by studying of the critical behaviors near the boundary. More interestingly, the multiple mobility rings emerge when the period number of the mosaic modulation is increased. The result is helpful for the investigation of the localization-delocalization transition in the SSH-type system under the combined action of the non-Hermiticity and quasi-periodicity.

Abstract: This note presents a concise and non-polemical comparison of several major interpretations of quantum mechanics, with a particular emphasis on the distinction between FAPP-solutions ("For All Practical Purposes'') versus ontological solutions to the measurement problem. Building on this distinction, we argue that the Contexts-Systems-Modalities (CSM) framework, supplemented by the operator-algebraic description of macroscopic contexts, provides a conceptually complete, non-FAPP ontology that naturally incorporates irreversibility and the physical structure of measurement devices. This approach differs significantly from other ontological interpretations such as Bohmian mechanics, spontaneous collapse, or many-worlds, and highlights the major role of contextual quantization in shaping quantum theory.

*George E. A. Matsas,Gabriel H. S. Aguiar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses how to distinguish quantum from classical behaviors even for large objects, arguing that above the Planck scale, classical mechanics describes systems alongside possible macroscopic quantum phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to establish a clear boundary between quantum and classical physics, even when dealing with large, macroscopic objects.

Method: The authors revisit existing arguments and theoretical frameworks to identify the limitations of quantum mechanics in describing large systems, leading to the concept of wave mechanics zones where classical physics must take over.

Result: The conclusion is that quantum mechanics is only applicable to systems below the Planck scale. Above this scale, classical mechanics must apply to describe macroscopic phenomena, such as the center of mass positions of objects like rocks.

Conclusion: This study emphasizes the necessity of distinguishing quantum and classical realms, even on macroscopic scales, and suggests that quantum fields beyond the Planck scale should not follow conventional quantum mechanics rules, aligning with classical statistical physics concepts.

Abstract: The concept of quantum particles derives from quantum field theory. Accepting that quantum mechanics is valid all the way implies that not only composite particles (such as protons and neutrons) would be derived from a field theory, but also the center of mass of bodies as heavy as rocks. Despite the fabulous success of quantum mechanics, it is unreasonable to assume the existence of annihilation and creation operators for rocks, and so on. Fortunately, there are strong reasons to doubt that wave mechanics can describe the center of mass of systems at or above the Planck scale, thereby jeopardizing the construction of the corresponding Fock space. As a result, systems with masses exceeding the Planck mass would have their center of mass described through classical mechanics, regardless of being able to harbor macroscopic quantum phenomena as observed in the laboratory. Here, we briefly revisit (i) the arguments for the need for a Heisenberg cut delimitating the boundary between the quantum and classical realms and (ii) the kind of new physics expected at (the uncharted region of) the Heisenberg cut.''

Abstract: Searching a database is a central task in computer science and is paradigmatic of transport and optimization problems in physics. For an unstructured search, Grover's algorithm predicts a quadratic speedup, with the search time $τ(N)=Θ(\sqrt{N})$ and $N$ the database size. Numerical studies suggest that the time complexity can change in the presence of feedback, injecting information during the search. Here, we determine the time complexity of the quantum analog of a randomized algorithm, which implements feedback in a simple form. The search is a continuous-time quantum walk on a complete graph, where the target is continuously monitored by a detector. Additionally, the quantum state is reset if the detector does not click within a specified time interval. This yields a non-unitary, non-Markovian dynamics. We optimize the search time as a function of the hopping amplitude, detection rate, and resetting rate, and identify the conditions under which time complexity could outperform Grover's scaling. The overall search time does not violate Grover's optimality bound when including the time budget of the physical implementation of the measurement. For databases of finite sizes monitoring can warrant rapid convergence and provides a promising avenue for fault-tolerant quantum searches.

Abstract: Statistical paradoxes such as the Hardy paradox and the enhancement of phase estimation via post-selection both draw upon the same non-classical features of quantum statistics described by non-positive quasi-probabilities. In this paper, we introduce a post-selected quantum metrology scenario where the initial state, the dynamics associated with the phase shift, and the post-selection are all inspired by the Hardy paradox. Specifically, we identify an anomalous weak value that is characteristic of both the Hardy paradox and the potential enhancement of sensitivity by the post-selection. We find that the efficiency of the enhancement is reduced when the expectation value associated with the anomalous weak value is different from the inverse of this value. We conclude that the relation between enhanced phase estimation and the Hardy paradox requires a detailed understanding of the relation between weak values and expectation values.

Abstract: Nonclassical states of light and their correlations lie at the heart of quantum optics, serving as fundamental resources that underpin both the exploration of quantum phenomena and the realisation of quantum information protocols. These lecture notes provide an accessible yet rigorous introduction to the foundations of quantum optics, emphasising their relevance to quantum information science and technology. Starting from the quantisation of the electromagnetic field and the bosonic formalism of Fock space, the notes develop a unified framework for describing and analysing quantum states of light. Key families of states -- thermal, coherent, and squeezed -- are introduced as paradigmatic examples illustrating the transition from classical to nonclassical behaviour. The concepts of convexity, classicality, and quasiprobability representations are presented as complementary tools for characterising quantumness and defining operational notions such as P-nonclassicality. The discussion extends naturally to Gaussian states, composite systems, and continuous-variable entanglement, highlighting how nonclassicality serves as a resource for generating and quantifying quantum correlations. Theoretical developments are complemented by computational and experimental perspectives, including simulations of optical states using the Python library Strawberry Fields and data analysis from simulated data. Together, these notes aim to bridge the foundational concepts of quantum optics and modern quantum information, offering both conceptual insight and practical tools for students and researchers entering the field.

Abstract: Rydberg-atom sensors convert radiofrequency, microwave and terahertz fields into optical signals with SI-traceable calibration, high sensitivity, and broad tunability. This review assesses their potential for space applications by comparing five general architectures (Autler-Townes, AC-Stark, superheterodyne, radiofrequency-to-optical conversion, and fluorescence) against space application needs. We identify promising roles in radiometry, radar, terahertz sensing, and in-orbit calibration, and outline key limitations, including shot noise, sparse terahertz transitions, and currently large Size, Weight, Power and Cost. A staged roadmap highlights which uncertainties should be resolved first and how research organisations, industry and space agencies could take the lead for the different aspects.

Result: 与原始的ADAPT-VQE相比，Co-ADAPT-VQE方法在12-14个二进制位系统中成功降低了CNOT门的数量，最高减少了97%。特别是在所有二进制位连接的情况下，该方法依然能够带来显著的CNOT门数量减少，达70%以上。

Conclusion: Co-ADAPT-VQE方法在量子计算中具有重要的应用价值，能够有效地优化态制备电路，提升计算效率。

Abstract: We propose a co-designed variant of ADAPT-VQE (Co-ADAPT-VQE) where the quantum hardware is taken into account in the construction of the ansatz. This framework can be readily used to optimize state preparation circuits for any device, addressing shortcomings such as limited connectivity, short coherence times, and variable gate errors. We exemplify the impact of Co-ADAPT-VQE by creating state preparation circuits for devices with linear nearest-neighbor (LNN) connectivity. We show a reduction of the CNOT count of the final circuits by up to 97% for 12-14 qubit systems, with the impact being greater for larger and more strongly correlated systems. Surprisingly, the circuits created by Co-ADAPT-VQE provide an over 70% CNOT count reduction with respect to the original ADAPT-VQE in all-to-all connectivity, despite being restricted to LNN qubit interactions.

Abstract: In molecular aggregates, multiple delocalized exciton states interact with phonons, making the state-resolved spectroscopic monitoring of dynamics challenging. We propose a protocol that combines photon-entanglement-enhanced narrowband excitation of two-exciton states with time-frequency-filtered two-photon coincidence counting. It can alleviate bottlenecks associated with probing exciton dynamics spread across multiple spectral and temporal windows. We demonstrate that non-classical correlations of entangled photon pairs can be used to prepare narrowband two-exciton population distributions, circumventing transport in mediating states. The distributions thus created can be monitored using time-frequency-filtered photon coincidence counting, and the pathways contributing to photon emission events can be classified by tuning filtering parameters. Numerical simulations for a light-harvesting aggregate highlight the ability of this protocol to achieve selectivity by suppressing or amplifying specific pathways. Combining entangled photonic sources and multidimensional photon counting allow promising applications to spectroscopy and sensing.

Abstract: We develop a semiclassical framework for studying quantum particles constrained to curved surfaces using the momentous quantum mechanics formalism, which extends classical phase-space to include quantum fluctuation variables (moments). In a spherical geometry, we derive quantum-corrected Hamiltonians and trajectories that incorporate quantum back-reaction effects absent in classical descriptions. For the free particle, quantum fluctuations induce measurable phase shifts in azimuthal precession of approximately 8-12%, with uncertainty growth rates proportional to initial moment correlations. When a non-central Makarov potential is introduced, quantum corrections dramatically amplify its asymmetry. For strong coupling ($γ$ = -1.9), the quantum-corrected force drives trajectories preferentially toward the southern hemisphere on timescales 40% shorter than classical predictions, with trajectory densities exhibiting up to 3-fold enhancement in the preferred region. Throughout evolution, the solutions rigorously satisfy Heisenberg uncertainty relations, validating the truncation scheme. These results demonstrate that quantum effects fundamentally alter semiclassical dynamics in curved constrained systems, with direct implications for charge transport in carbon nanostructures, exciton dynamics in curved quantum wells, and reaction pathways in cyclic molecules.

Abstract: Standard approaches to quantum error correction (QEC) require active maintenance using measurements and classical processing. The possibility of passive QEC has so far only been established in an unphysical number of spatial dimensions. In this work, we present a simple method for autonomous QEC in two spatial dimensions, formulated as a quantum cellular automaton with a fixed, local and translation-invariant update rule. The construction uses hierarchical, self-simulating control elements based on the classical schemes from the seminal results of Gács (1986, 1989) together with a measurement-free concatenated code. We analyze the system under a local noise model and prove a noise threshold below which the logical errors are suppressed arbitrarily with increasing system size and the memory lifetime diverges in the thermodynamic limit. The scheme admits a continuous-time implementation as a time-independent, translation-invariant local Lindbladian with engineered dissipative jump operators. Further, the recursive nature of our protocol allows for the fault-tolerant encoding of arbitrary quantum circuits and thus constitutes a self-correcting universal quantum computer.

TL;DR: A symplectic optimization framework for Gaussian ground states using constrained parameterization improves computational efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variational optimization of Gaussian states is computationally intensive due to constrained covariance matrices, particularly in large systems.

Method: The method uses symplectic matrices with unit-triangular factorizations to parameterize covariance matrices, ensuring exact enforcement of physical constraints and enabling unconstrained optimization. It also supports warm-starting for efficient reuse across related Hamiltonian configurations.

Result: The framework successfully computes ground-state energies, covariance matrices, and spectral gaps for weakly dipole-coupled lattices, with potential for broader applications in quantum systems and tensor networks.

Conclusion: This framework offers a computationally efficient and scalable solution for optimizing Gaussian ground states, particularly in scenarios involving large and inhomogeneous systems, with promising applications in quantum many-body physics.

Abstract: Computing Gaussian ground states via variational optimization is challenging because the covariance matrices must satisfy the uncertainty principle, rendering constrained or Riemannian optimization costly, delicate, and thus difficult to scale, particularly in large and inhomogeneous systems. We introduce a symplectic optimization framework that addresses this challenge by parameterizing covariance matrices directly as positive-definite symplectic matrices using unit-triangular factorizations. This approach enforces all physical constraints exactly, yielding a globally unconstrained variational formulation of the bosonic ground-state problem. The unconstrained structure also naturally supports solution reuse across nearby Hamiltonians: warm-starting from previously optimized covariance matrices substantially reduces the number of optimization steps required for convergence in families of related configurations, as encountered in crystal lattices, molecular systems, and fluids. We demonstrate the method on weakly dipole-coupled lattices, recovering ground-state energies, covariance matrices, and spectral gaps accurately. The framework further provides a foundation for large-scale approximate treatments of weakly non-quadratic interactions and offers potential scaling advantages through tensor-network enhancements.

Abstract: The Wilson-Fisher fixed point defines a continuous family of interacting conformal field theories in non-integer dimensions. In integer dimensions, it is widely believed to lie in the same universality class as the critical Ising model. In this work, we revisit the identification between the Wilson-Fisher fixed point at integer dimensions and the Ising CFT. We argue that a literal equality between the two theories is incompatible with the emergence of Virasoro symmetry in two dimensions. Instead, we propose that the Ising model emerges only as a subsector of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. We support this scenario through a detailed study of the two-dimensional $O(n)$ model and by examining operators transforming in irreducible representations of the orthogonal group whose multiplicities become negative for integer values of the spacetime dimension. Finally, we comment on the implications of these results for attempts to construct a $d=2+ε$ expansion starting from exact two-dimensional data.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了 holographic entropy cone的认识，对未来研究量子引力中的纠缠结构具有重要意义。

Abstract: We develop a reinforcement learning algorithm to study the holographic entropy cone. Given a target entropy vector, our algorithm searches for a graph realization whose min-cut entropies match the target vector. If the target vector does not admit such a graph realization, it must lie outside the cone, in which case the algorithm finds a graph whose corresponding entropy vector most nearly approximates the target and allows us to probe the location of the facets. For the $\sf N=3$ cone, we confirm that our algorithm successfully rediscovers monogamy of mutual information beginning with a target vector outside the holographic entropy cone. We then apply the algorithm to the $\sf N=6$ cone, analyzing the 6 "mystery" extreme rays of the subadditivity cone from arXiv:2412.15364 that satisfy all known holographic entropy inequalities yet lacked graph realizations. We found realizations for 3 of them, proving they are genuine extreme rays of the holographic entropy cone, while providing evidence that the remaining 3 are not realizable, implying unknown holographic inequalities exist for $\sf N=6$.

Abstract: We investigate timelike entanglement measures derived from the spacetime density kernel in the Rosenzweig-Porter model and show that they sharply diagnose both eigenvector ergodicity and spectral chaos. For several Hilbert-space bipartitions, we compute the second Tsallis entropy, the entanglement imagitivity that quantifies non-Hermiticity, and Schatten-norm diagnostics of the kernel. The imagitivity and Frobenius norm exhibit rapid growth and high late-time plateaus in the ergodic regime, are suppressed in the localized regime, and show intermediate behavior in the fractal phase. The real part of the second Tsallis entropy displays a spectral form factor-like dip-ramp-plateau throughout the chaotic window and a suppressed ramp in the localized regime. We further introduce a kernel negativity, defined as the negative spectral weight of the Hermitian part of the kernel. This negativity equals the trace-norm distance to the set of positive semidefinite operators and the maximal witnessable negative quasiprobability, and its time-averaged value decreases across the ergodic-fractal-localized crossover in close correspondence with the fractal dimension.

Abstract: We propose a conjectural picture of baryon structure in which gluon knots, a type of topologically nontrivial configuration of color--magnetic monopole condensates, forms the dynamical core of the baryon. Within this framework, quarks interact with the gluon knot via abelian-dominated color-electric fields, which are squeezed into flux tubes by the dual Meissner effect, leading naturally to quark confinement. The color--magnetic fields associated with the gluon knot also induce a local chiral condensate, contributing to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the baryon mass. Extending this conjecture to heavy-flavor mesons, we argue that stable flux tubes and gluon knots may also play a role in their internal structure, whereas light-flavor mesons are dominated by alternative confinement mechanisms. Our approach provides a unified, topologically motivated picture linking confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and the internal dynamics of baryons and certain mesons, suggesting that gluon knots constitute fundamental infrared degrees of freedom of Yang--Mills theory.

Abstract: We study topological defects with a general structure in higher-dimensional cosmological backgrounds described by a set of angle deficit parameters. As special cases, they include higher-dimensional generalizations of cosmic strings and global monopoles. The corresponding complete set of mode functions is presented for a massive scalar field with a general curvature coupling parameter. For general scale factors and radial functions in the line element, the angular parts of the scalar modes are expressed in terms of associated Legendre functions. De Sitter and Milne universes are considered as examples of cosmological expansion. For the de Sitter bulk, we present the time-dependent parts of the mode functions in inflationary, hyperbolic, and global coordinates.

Abstract: We investigate the tidal response of general five-dimensional (5D) black holes of STU supergravity, which include as special cases important solutions such as the Myers-Perry, BMPV, 5D Reissner-Nordström, Kerr-Newman and dyonic black holes. Solutions are parameterized by their mass, two angular momenta and up to three $U(1)$ charges. Love numbers and dissipation coefficients are obtained in the static and dynamic cases. In the latter scenario, we find new, nontrivial conditions, realized in important limiting cases of the theory, such as the BPS limit, where frequency-independent vanishing conditions are obtained. We also develop a ladder formalism for static solutions and derive the conserved charges. To the best of our knowledge, this formalism had not been previously derived for 5D black holes, including neutral ones. Finally, we show the emergence of Love symmetry in the near-zone regime, and derive the generators of the associated $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebra. It is shown that all conditions for Love-number vanishing can be explained by this algebra in terms of the highest-weight property.

TL;DR: 研究了两种颜色、一种反 adjoint 海鲜 QCD 的矩阵模型（matrix-QCD₂¹^{	ext{adj}}），分析了弱耦合（小 g）和零截断的环境中该模型的行为。发现该系统存在两个不同稳定的最低能量状态：一个在 $A_i=0$，另一个在 $A_i = rac{σ_i}{2g}$。研究表明，当截断固体化学势 $c$ 不大于 1.5 时，存在量子相变：当 $g<g_0^	ext{	extast}$ 时，基态波函数集中在 $A_i=0$，当 $g>g_0^	ext{	extast}$ 时，基态由多个可能的配置覆盖。该相变是奇异的，基态在 $g_0^	ext{	extast}$ 时表现出大相径庭的性质，可能是“对偶超导体”相。同时发现，1st 和 2nd 激 excited 态也存在类似的行为，推断系统中存在无限数量的孤立奇点 $g_0^	ext{	extast}> g_1^	ext{	extast}>g_2^	ext{	extast}>oxed{ 	ext{	extellipsis}}$，这些奇点逐渐接近 $g=0$。当 $c=1$ 时，该模型似具有 $hocal{N}=1$ 超对称性。研究发现，在局部化的阶段（i.e. $g<g_0^	ext{	extast}$），超共形对称性被破坏，超对称性显然被自发性地破坏。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了矩阵-QCD₂¹^{	ext{adj}} 在弱耦合和零截断情况下的新相变现象，表明超对称性在某些条件下被破坏，为深入理解 QCD 的基本性质提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We numerically investigate the matrix model of two-color one-flavor adjoint QCD (matrix-QCD$_{2,1}^{\text{adj}}$) in the weak coupling regime (small $g$) and in the chiral limit. The Yang-Mills potential has two distinct gauge invariant minima: one at $A_i=0$ and the other at $A_i = \frac{σ_i}{2g}$. We show that when the chiral chemical potential $c \leq \frac{3}{2}$, there is a quantum phase transition at $g_0^\ast \simeq 0.143$: for $g<g_0^\ast$, the ground state wavefunction is localized near $A_i=0$, while for $g>g_0^\ast$, the ground state is delocalized over the gauge configuration space. The transition between these two phases is singular, with the ground state at $g_0^\ast$ being distinctly different from that of $g_0^\ast \pm|ε|$. At $g_0^\ast$, we show that the square of the chromoelectric field vanishes, strongly suggesting that the system is in a ``dual superconductor" phase. Numerical evidence shows that the localization-delocalization phenomenon holds for the 1st and 2nd excited states as well, leading us to conjecture that there are an infinite number of isolated singular points $g_0^\ast> g_1^\ast>g_2^\ast> \cdots$ accumulating to $g=0$. For $c=1$, the model formally possesses $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. We show that in the localized phase (i.e. for $g<g_0^\ast$) the supermultiplet structure is disrupted and SUSY is spontaneously broken.

Abstract: We investigate the ultraviolet completion of an $O(N)$ scalar field theory non-minimally coupled to gravity using the Wilsonian functional renormalization group in the proper-time formulation. Focusing on the spontaneously broken phase, we study the RG flow of the scalar potential and the non-minimal curvature coupling expanded around a running minimum. We identify two distinct classes of fixed-point solutions, one of which is ultraviolet attractive and characterized by a vanishing quartic coupling together with finite, interacting gravitational couplings. For a finite region of infrared initial conditions, the RG trajectories remain regular at all scales and approach this fixed point. This mechanism renders the theory asymptotically safe and leads to a flat scalar potential in the ultraviolet. We show that this mechanism is robust under changes of cutoff scheme and truncation, allowing the ultraviolet completion requirement to constrain the infrared values of the scalar couplings and the mass scale in the broken phase.

Motivation: Medical devices, especially cardiovascular, require effective drug delivery systems for better patient outcomes.

Method:  electrochemical anodizing and chitosan coating of nitinol, analyzed for wettability, drug release kinetics, and cellular compatibility.

Result:  Electrochemical anodizing created nanoporous layers reducing wettability and increasing hydrophilicity. Chitosan coatings controlled heparin release via a diffusional mechanism. HUVECs showed no toxicity, with best performance in chitosan-coated samples.

Conclusion: Nitinol-based systems show promise for cardiovascular stents.

Abstract: Nitinol (NiTi shape-memory alloy) is an interesting candidate in various medical applications like dental, orthopedic, and cardiovascular devices, owing to its unique mechanical behaviors and proper biocompatibility. The aim of this work is the local controlled delivery of a cardiovascular drug, heparin, loaded onto nitinol treated by electrochemical anodizing and chitosan coating. In this regard, the structure, wettability, drug release kinetics, and cell cytocompatibility of the specimens were analyzed in vitro. The two-stage anodizing process successfully developed a regular nanoporous layer of Ni-Ti-O on nitinol, which considerably decreased the sessile water contact angle and induced hydrophilicity. The application of the chitosan coatings controlled the release of heparin mainly by a diffusional mechanism, where the drug release mechanisms were evaluated by the Higuchi, first-order, zero-order, and Korsmeyer-Pepass models. Human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) viability assay also showed the non-cytotoxicity of the samples, so that the best performance was found for the chitosan-coated samples. It is concluded that the designed drug delivery systems are promising for cardiovascular, particularly stent applications.

Method: 通过构建(APC, CPC及突变型CPC)异源表达系统合成蛋白质，结合2D-ES测量。

Result: 突变型CPC的能动态与CPC相似，取代APC的主要因素是色素数量和排列，弯曲的PCB结构影响了π共轭度和激发态特性。

Conclusion: 局部的色素-蛋白质相互作用主导激发动力学，色素数量和排列并非主要因素。

Abstract: We developed methods for protein synthesis and performed two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D-ES) to examine the influence of pigment arrangement on the photoexcitation dynamics of light-harvesting proteins in phycobilisome. We synthesized allophycocyanin (APC), C-phycocyanin (CPC), and mutant CPC lacking the \b{eta}153 phycocyanobilin (PCB) pigment by an Escherichia coli expression system. The number of pigments in the mutant CPC is identical to that in the wild-type APC, and their spatial arrangements are similar. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the mutant CPC closely resemble those of the wild-type CPC rather than the wild-type APC, indicating that pigment spatial arrangement is not a primary factor in determining the excited-state energy structure. The 2D-ES measurements show that the wild-type CPC retains broad positive signals at 1 ps, signifying incomplete relaxation and persistence of excited vibronic states, unlike APC, which vibrationally relaxes to the bottom of the potential energy surface within the same timeframe. The mutant CPC behaves similarly to the wild-type CPC in the 2D-ES, reinforcing that the pigment number or arrangement is not a dominant factor. Instead, the local pigment-protein interaction governs the electronic structure and relaxation dynamics. Structural analysis reveals that the bent structure of PCB in CPC's α-chain versus the planar structure of PCB in APC. The bent PCB in CPC reduces the degree of π-conjugation, and exhibits excited-state properties distinct from those of the planar structure of PCB in APC. This finding highlights a critical role of the electronic structure governed by the local interaction in ultrafast energy relaxation.

TL;DR: Planktonic organisms like copepods detect swimming prey and sinking food through hydrodynamic disturbances.

It provides insights into plankton sensing strategies.

Motivation: Understanding how plankton detect and capture prey is crucial for marine biology and ecosystem modeling. This research offers a novel flow sensing strategy inspired by copepods.

Method: The study introduces the steer'n roll sensing and response strategy, combining stereoscopic flow sensing with roll motion. It integrates hydrodynamic analysis with motion adjustments to enhance three-dimensional exploration.

Result: The steer'n roll method achieves a 100% success rate in detecting prey signals, works across varying signal types, and is resilient to environmental noise, diffusion, and turbulence. This suggests a plausible biological mechanism for flow-based prey detection in plankton.

Conclusion: This research posits a biologically feasible sensory-motor system for planktonic organisms to detect and capture prey through flow sensing, offering testable hypotheses in marine biology.

Abstract: Planktonic organisms such as copepods sense swimming prey and sinking food particles through the hydrodynamic disturbances they generate. However, because these flow fields are often highly symmetric, they provide little directional information, making accurate localization of the source challenging. Here, we introduce the steer'n roll sensing and response strategy. This strategy combines stereoscopic flow sensing and a roll motion. Stereoscopic sensing allows plankton to disambiguate flow signals by integrating two spatially separated flow measurements, while a roll about the swimming axis enhances exploration of the three-dimensional space. We show that steer'n roll is efficient, achieving a 100% success rate, versatile across signal type, and robust to flow sensing noise, orientational diffusion, and turbulence. Together, these findings identify a biologically plausible mechanism for prey detection and capture via flow sensing, and offer testable insights into the sensory-motor strategies of planktonic organisms.

Abstract: Exchange between tissue compartments is crucial for interpretation of diffusion MRI measurements in brain gray matter. Reported values of exchange time are broadly dispersed, about two orders of magnitude. We analyze the measurement technique called Filtered Exchange Imaging (FEXI) using numerical solution of Bloch--Torrey equation in digitalized neurons downloaded from NeuroMorpho.org. The FEXI outcome, the recovery of diffusion coefficient in cells with impermeable membrane is multiexponential, tightly related to the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator. Fitting the commonly used exponential recovery function results in a strong dependence of the apparent exchange time on the involved mixing time interval. For short mixing times, exchange time is of the order of 10 ms. It gets an order of magnitude larger for mixing times of a few hundreds of milliseconds. To obtain an estimate of membrane permeability, we reinterpret previously published data on preexchange lifetime in neuronal cell culture. It results in the permeability 0.005 micrometer/ms. The corresponding exchange time is about 140 ms. We conclude that essentially shorter exchange times are due to fast geometric exchange inside the ramified cells.

Conservation strategies targeting keystone species, especially carnivorous fish, are emphasized for ecosystem stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the Chesapeake Bay's ecosystem complexity requires analyzing its food web dynamics. This study uses innovative network methods to uncover how energy flow affects the system's stability.

Method: The study constructs a weighted ecological network, applies an energy flow cutoff, and analyzes connectivity dynamics using complex network methods.

Result: The system shows initial resilience but becomes fragile as energy flow decreases, highlighting the importance of keystone species in maintaining ecosystem stability.

Conclusion: Conservation efforts for keystone species are critical for preserving the Chesapeake Bay's health and ecosystem functionality.

Abstract: The Chesapeake Bay, one of the largest estuaries in the United States, is an ecological system of great complexity and relevance. The food web is composed of thirty-six trophic components, all of which are functionally connected. In this work, the interactions among these components are numerically analyzed using complex network methods. An energy flow cutoff paradigm is applied to a weighted ecological network. The results reveal patterns characteristic of connectivity dynamics, evidencing both the initial robustness of the system and its tendency to fragmentation at higher values of the cutoff. From an applied perspective, the findings underscore the importance of conservation strategies that protect keystone species, such as carnivorous fish, which act as crucial connectors between the two main subnetworks. Although they are positioned at the top of the food web and are often assumed to be less critical to network stability, these species play a pivotal role in regulating populations of lower-level organisms, thereby maintaining the overall integrity of the ecosystem.

TL;DR: The paper discusses quantum phase transitions in metallic quantum ferromagnets, highlighting a first-order transition mechanism affected by spin-orbit interactions and electron correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the nature of quantum phase transitions in magnetic materials is fundamental in condensed matter physics, particularly the distinction between first- and second-order transitions.

Method: The authors study the interplay between spin-orbit coupling, mass terms, and interaction effects by analyzing the free energy dependence on magnetization.

Result: They conclude that electron-electron interactions in particle-particle channels can lead to non-analytic free energy dependence, supporting a first-order transition, even in the presence of spin-orbit interactions.

Conclusion: Their analysis shows that screening effects restore the possibility of a first-order transition despite strong spin-orbit coupling, contradicting previous claims.

Abstract: Metallic quantum ferromagnets in the absence of quenched disorder are known to generically undergo a first-order quantum phase transition, avoiding the quantum critical point that had originally been expected. This is due to soft modes in the underlying Fermi liquid that lead to long-ranged correlations. These correlations in turn yield a nonanalytic dependence of the free energy on the magnetization even at a mean-field level that results in a fluctuation-induced first-order transition. Kirkpatrick and Belitz [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 124}, 147201 (2020)] have pointed out that one notable exception are non-centrosymmetric metals with a strong spin-orbit interaction. In such materials the spin-orbit interaction gives the relevant soft modes a mass, which inhibits the mechanism leading to a first-order transition. Miserev, Loss, and Klinovaja [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 106}, 134417 (2022)] have claimed that this conclusion does not hold if electron-electron interactions in the particle-particle channel, or 2$\kF$ scattering processes, are considered. They concluded that this interaction channel leads to soft modes that are not rendered massive by the spin-orbit interaction and again lead to a first-order quantum phase transition. In this Comment we show that this conclusion is not correct in three-dimensional magnets if the screening of the interaction is properly taken into account.

Abstract: We present a fermionic gauge theory for deconfined quantum criticality on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice and reveal its shared low-energy field-theoretic structure with the square lattice. Starting from an SU(2) $π$-flux parent state, we construct a continuum theory of Dirac spinons coupled to an SU(2) gauge field and adjoint Higgs fields whose condensates drive transitions to a staggered-flux U(1) spin liquid and a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid. While the Shastry-Sutherland lattice permits additional symmetry-allowed fermion bilinears compared to the square lattice, the quantum field theories are identical up to additional irrelevant terms. Consequently, the Higgs potential structure and the leading low-energy theory coincide with the square-lattice case at the quantum critical point. The SO(5) critical point is expected to realize conformal deconfined criticality: we analyze it in a large flavor expansion, calculate its critical exponents, and identify the Yukawa coupling between the fermions and Higgs fields as the relevant perturbation that destabilizes it, consistent with pseudocritical behavior observed in recent Monte Carlo studies. We show that the emergent SO(5) order parameter acquires a large anomalous dimension at the critical point, leading to strongly enhanced Néel and VBS susceptibilities-a hallmark of fermionic deconfined quantum criticality consistent with numerical studies. Our results place recent numerical evidence for a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice within a controlled field-theoretic framework and demonstrate that fermionic deconfined criticality on the square lattice-including critical exponents and stability-extends to frustrated lattices with reduced symmetry.

Abstract: Several ground state properties of the square-lattice $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet are computed (the energy, order parameter, spin stiffness, spinwave velocity, long-wavelength susceptibility, and staggered susceptibility) using extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations with the stochastic series expansion method. Moderately sized lattices are studied at temperatures $T$ sufficiently low to realize the $T \to 0$ limit. Results for periodic $L\times L$ lattices with $L \in [6,96]$ are tabulated versus $L$ and extrapolations to infinite system size are carried out. The extrapolated ground state energy density is $e_0=-0.669441857(7)$, which represents an improvement in precision of three orders of magnitude over the previously best result. The leading and subleading finite-size corrections to $e_0$ are in full quantitative agreement with predictions from chiral perturbation theory, thus further supporting the soundness of both the extrapolations and the theory. The extrapolated sublattice magnetization is $m_s=0.307447(2)$, which agrees well with previous estimates but with a much smaller statistical error. The coefficient of the linear in $L^{-1}$ correction to $m^2_s$ agrees with the value from chiral perturbation theory and the presence of a factor $\ln^γ(L)$ in the second-order correction is also confirmed, with the previously not known value of the exponent being $γ= 0.82(4)$. The finite-size corrections to the staggered susceptibility point to logarithmic corrections also in this quantity. To facilitate benchmarking of methods for which periodic boundary conditions are challenging, results for systems with open and cylindrical boundaries are also listed and their spatially inhomogeneous order parameters are analyzed.

Abstract: We report a microscopic investigation of the magnetic structure and electronic properties of LaMnSi in its antiferromagnetic (AFM) state using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Field-swept $^{55}$Mn- and $^{139}$La-NMR spectra, as well as zero-field 55Mn-NMR (ZFNMR) spectra, reveal that the Mn ordered moments are parallel to the tetragonal c axis, consistent with the C-type AFM structure and the realization of an odd-parity multipole order. The internal field at the Mn site is determined to be 19.64 T at 4.2 K, corresponding to a hyperfine coupling constant of Ahf = 6.0 T/uB. Nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 exhibits a characteristic behavior of itinerant antiferromagnetism, showing metallic behavior at low temperatures and magnon-induced enhancement upon approaching the Neel temperature (TN = 295 K). These results show LaMnSi as an ideal compound to study 3d electron magnetism and odd-parity multipole order in the RT Si (R = rare-earth, T = transition metal) system, free of the complexities of 4f electrons.

Abstract: The ground-state phases of mixed diamond chains with ($S, τ^{(1)}, τ^{(2)})=(1/2,1/2,1)$, where $S$ is the magnitude of vertex spins, and $τ^{(1)}$ and $τ^{(2)}$ are those of apical spins, are investigated with the single-site anisotropy $D$ on the $τ^{(2)}$-site. The two apical spins in each unit cell are coupled by an exchange coupling $λ$. The vertex spins are coupled with the top and bottom apical spins by exchange couplings $1+δ$ and $1-δ$, respectively. The ground-state phase diagram is determined using the numerical exact diagonalization and DMRG method in addition to the analytical approximations in various limiting cases. The phase diagram consists of a Néel ordered phase, a nonmagnetic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase, quantized and partial ferrimagnetic phases. A region with anisotropy inversion is found where the Ising-like Néel phase is realized for the easy-plane anisotropy $D >0$ and the XY-like Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase is realized for the easy-axis anisotropy $D <0$ on the $S=1$ sites.

Abstract: We investigate bias-driven non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions in a paradigmatic quantum-transport setup: an interacting quantum dot coupled to non-interacting metallic leads. Using the Random Phase Approximation, which is exact in the limit of a large number of dot levels, we map out the zero-temperature non-equilibrium phase diagram as a function of interaction strength and applied bias. We focus our analysis on the behavior of the charge susceptibility and the current noise in the vicinity of the transition. Remarkably, despite the intrinsically non-equilibrium nature of the steady state, critical charge fluctuations admit an effective-temperature description, $T_{\text{eff}}(T,V)$, that collapses the steady-state behavior onto its equilibrium form. In sharp contrast, current fluctuations exhibit genuinely non-equilibrium features: the fluctuation-dissipation ratio becomes negative in the ordered phase, corresponding to a negative effective temperature for the current degrees of freedom. These results establish current noise as a sensitive probe of critical fluctuations at non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions and open new directions for exploring voltage-driven critical phenomena in quantum transport systems.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the magnetic properties of the frustrated heavy fermion compound Ce₂PdSi₃ under varying magnetic fields and hydrostatic pressure. The compound exhibits two distinct magnetic phase transitions, a ferromagnetic-like transition at 3.8 K and an incommensurate antiferromagnetic transition at 2.9 K. Under pressure, the ferromagnetic transition is suppressed and no longer detectable above 4.2 GPa, while the antiferromagnetic transition remains robust up to 7.5 GPa. The pressure evolution of magnetic order suggests the presence of competing magnetic orders and motivates further investigations into the origin of the phenomenon, including the role of geometric frustration.

Motivation: The discovery of novel magnetic phases and phase transitions in frustrated materials like Ce₂PdSi₃ could provide valuable insights into the complex interplay of quantum criticality, magnetism, and geometric frustration.

Method: Magnetic measurements were conducted under different magnetic fields and hydrostatic pressures to determine the magnetic phase transitions and their pressure dependence.

Result: The study reveals that the compound Ce₂PdSi₃ exhibits two distinct magnetic phase transitions under varying pressure. The ferromagnetic-like transition at 3.8 K is suppressed by pressure, while the antiferromagnetic transition remains stable up to higher pressures.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that Ce₂PdSi₃ hosts a rich magnetic phase diagram influenced by geometric frustration. The suppression of the ferromagnetic transition under pressure suggests that competing magnetic orders may play a significant role in the material's properties. Further research is needed to fully understand the origin and implications of these competing magnetic orders.

Abstract: Frustrated Kondo lattices are ideal platforms for exploring unconventional forms of quantum criticality, as well as magnetism and other emergent phases. Here we report the magnetic properties of the candidate frustrated heavy fermion compound Ce$_2$PdSi$_3$, and map their evolution upon applying magnetic fields and hydrostatic pressure. We find that at ambient pressure Ce$_2$PdSi$_3$ exhibits two distinct magnetic phase transitions, a ferromagnetic-like transition at $T_{\mathrm{M1}}=3.8$ K and an incommensurate antiferromagnetic transition at $T_{\mathrm{M2}}=2.9$ K. Upon applying pressure, $T_{\mathrm{M1}}$ is continuously suppressed and becomes undetectable above 4.2 GPa, whereas $T_{\mathrm{M2}}$ increases and remains robust up to at least 7.5 GPa. The observed pressure evolution of magnetic order in Ce$_2$PdSi$_3$ suggests the presence of competing magnetic orders, and cannot be simply encapsulated by the Doniach phase diagram, motivating further investigations for its origin, including discerning the role of geometric frustration.

Abstract: Quantum control of the many-body wavefunction is a central challenge in quantum materials research, as it could yield a precise control knob to manipulate emergent phenomena. Floquet engineering, the coherent dressing of quantum states with periodic non-resonant optical fields, has become an important strategy for quantum control. Most applications to solid-state systems have targeted weakly interacting or single-ion states, leaving the manipulation of many-body wavefunctions largely unexplored. Here, we use Floquet engineering to achieve quantum control of a strongly correlated Hubbard exciton in the one-dimensional Mott insulator Sr$_2$CuO$_3$. A nonresonant midinfrared optical field coherently dresses the exciton wavefunction, driving its rotation between bright and dark states. We use resonant third-harmonic generation to quantify ultrafast $π/2$ rotations on the Bloch sphere spanned by these exciton states. Our work advances the quest towards programmable control of correlated states and exciton-based quantum sensing.

Abstract: Chiral spin liquid (CSL) is a magnetic analogue of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquid. Collective excitations play a vital role in shaping our understanding of these exotic quantum phases of matter and their quantum phase transitions. While the magneto-roton and long-wavelength chiral graviton modes in the FQH liquids have been extensively explored, the collective excitations of CSLs remain elusive. Here we explore the collective excitations in the SU(2) symmetric CSL phase of the spin-1/2 square-lattice $J_1-J_2-J_χ$ model, where an intriguing quantum phase diagram was recently revealed. Combining exact diagonalization and time-dependent variational principle calculations, we observe two spin-singlet collective modes: a chiral p-wave (low-energy) roton mode at finite momentum and a d-wave (higher-energy) nematic mode at zero momentum, both of which are prominent across the CSL phase. Such exotic modes exhibit fingerprints distinct from those of FQH liquids, and to the best of our knowledge, are reported for the first time. By tuning $J_2$, we find the nematic mode to be pronouncedly soft, together with the spin-triplet two-spinon bound states, potentially promoting strong nematic and spin stripe instabilities. Our work paves the way for further understanding CSL from the dynamical perspective and provides new spectroscopic signatures for future experiments of CSL candidates.

Motivation: Understanding the quantum spin ice properties of Ce₂X₂O₇ is important for advancing quantum materials research.

Method: Single-crystal neutron scattering was performed on hydrothermally grown Ce₂Sn₂O₇ crystals.

Result: The neutron scattering pattern shows strong intensities along the Brillouin zone boundaries and resembles classical Dipolar Spin Ice, but disagrees with the XYZ model.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that further neighbor interactions play a crucial role in the low-energy physics of Ce-pyrochlores and necessitate a revised theoretical framework to explain the results.

Abstract: The Ce$_2$X$_2$O$_7$ (X=Sn, Hf, Zr) family of cubic pyrochlores has emerged as one of the most promising classes of Quantum Spin Ice candidates. However, understanding their microscopic exchange Hamiltonian and spin correlations has been hampered by varying sample quality, and poor signal-to-noise in the existing neutron data due to a small Ce$^{3+}$ magnetic dipole moment. In this work, we overcome these challenges and report single-crystal diffuse neutron scattering from hydrothermally grown Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ -- the highest quality crystals obtained to date for the Ce$_2$X$_2$O$_7$ family. In contrast to the broad diffuse scattering observed in Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, we find highly structured diffuse scattering from Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ featuring strong intensities along the Brillouin zone boundaries. The observed $\mathbf{Q}$-dependence disagrees with predictions of the nearest neighbour XYZ model commonly used for Ce$_2$X$_2$O$_7$, but is remarkably similar to the diffuse scattering observed in \textit{classical} Dipolar Spin Ice. Our study highlights the importance of further neighbour interactions in determining the low energy physics of the Ce-pyrochlores, and calls for a revision of the current theoretical framework to incorporate their effects.

Abstract: The layer-dependent Hamiltonians of parallel-stacked MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ homobilayer moiré materials are topologically non-trivial, both in real space and in momentum space, and have been shown to support integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, as well as antiferromagnetic and superconducting states. Here, we address the interplay between the antiferromagnetic and superconducting states observed in tWSe$_2$ when the Fermi level is close to its $M$-point van Hove singularity and the displacement field is small. We combine DFT with path-integrals to construct a minimal moiré band model that accounts for lattice relaxation along the $c$-axis and perform Hartree-Fock calculations to identify competing charge and spin ordered states. For tWSe$_2$ at $θ=2.7^\circ$ and $θ=3.65^\circ$, we find that a layer antiferromagnet (AFM), a stripe spin-density-wave (SDW), and the ferromagnetic Chern insulator (FM) are the primary candidates for the ground state at zero displacement field, and argue that antiferromagnetic spin interactions on the next neighbor bond $J_2$ can induce a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral superconducting state.

Abstract: Explicit breaking of diffeomorphism symmetry with nondynamical background fields in gravitational theories can lead to inconsistencies between the equations of motion and the underlying pseudo-Riemannian geometry. These theories produce a constraint equation that follows from the modified Einstein's equations and the contracted Bianchi identity which has no simple solution and raises questions about the consistency of backgrounds structures in extensions to general relativity. In contrast, spontaneous symmetry breaking where fields acquire a vacuum expectation value are shown to avoid these problems. Nevertheless, there are some approaches that consistently implement explicit diffeomorphism breaking by: i) introducing geometrical restrictions which may dynamically restore diffeomorphism invariance, ii) using the Stückelberg formalism where auxiliary scalar fields can carry degrees of freedom associated to spontaneously broken symmetries, and more recently by iii) exploiting the isometries of a given gravitational configuration in the presence of a background; which ultimately requires the background fields to be Lie-dragged along the Killing vectors. In this work, we further develop and apply the latter approach focusing on a concrete example involving the Gödel metric and the minimal gravitational Standard-Model Extension. We show that the resulting dynamics is fully consistent with the constraint equation and produce new Noether's identities. Furthermore we investigate causality violations by analyzing the critical radius, which is found to depend explicitly on the background fields. This dependence allows for the emergence of both causal and non-causal regions in spacetime.

Abstract: We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole arising in Einstein gravity coupled to a Kalb-Ramond field and ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics, both of which are independently well motivated extensions of standard electrovacuum gravity. The solution depends, beyond mass and charge, on a Lorentz-violating parameter, a ModMax deformation parameter, and a discrete branch selector $ζ=\pm1$. We show that the ordinary branch admits extremal and non-extremal configurations, while the phantom branch generically supports a single-horizon geometry. Black-hole thermodynamics is analyzed within the Tsallis non-extensive framework, revealing branch-dependent stability and Joule-Thomson behavior. Weak gravitational lensing, photon propagation in plasma, and tidal forces are then studied, revealing clear optical and strong-field signatures that distinguish the two branches. In particular, the ordinary branch exhibits finite-radius tidal inversion, absent in the phantom sector. Our results demonstrate that the combined Kalb-Ramond and ModMax effects lead to a rich and observationally distinguishable black-hole phenomenology.

Abstract: The ACT data have severely constrained the single scalar field models. Known models of inflation, like the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors are at least $2σ$ off the ACT data. In this work we aim to provide a top-to-bottom approach in single scalar field inflationary cosmology compatible with the ACT data. Specifically, inspired by the fact that the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors, all being plateau potentials, result to the same attractor relation between the spectral index of scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is of the form $n_s(r)=1-αr^{1/2}$, in this work we seek for attractors of the form $n_s(r)=f(r)$ that may lead to ACT-compatible inflation. Specifically, we fix the function $f(r)$ to have a specific desirable form and then solve the differential equation $n_s(r)=f(r)$ to find the potential which results to the relation $n_s(r)=f(r)$. We discovered analytically three classes of potentials which are variants of the general form $n_s(r)=γ\pm βr \pm r^{1/2}$ and all these models are found to be compatible with the ACT data.

Abstract: It is known that if the standard slow-roll inflation is followed by a power-law inflationary regime, then the trans-Planckian modes may be safely be contained in the Hubble horizon and never exit it during inflation. In this work we investigate how to realize a smooth transition between a slow-roll and a power-law inflationary regime in the context of single scalar field inflation. As we show it is possible to realize such a smooth transition by generalizing the kinetic energy of single scalar field in the form $\dotφ^2=β(φ)V(φ)$, where $β(φ)$ is some appropriate function of the scalar field. Using two distinct approaches we show that it is possible to realize a smooth transition from a slow-roll to a power-law inflationary regime, and the two approaches produce identical results regarding the slow-roll regime. Also we show that the slow-roll regime is quite short, about $N\sim 30$ $e$-foldings, with the flatness and horizon problems being solved with the synergistic effect of the two inflationary patches. The slow-roll era is found to be compatible with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data.

### [106] [An Analytic Scale-dependent Dark Matter Profile and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20070)
*V. K. Oikonomou*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper presents an analytic model of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with a scale-dependent equation of state to explain rotation curves of various low-surface-brightness galaxies, irregular galaxies, low-luminosity spirals, and dwarf galaxies that challenge cold dark matter (CDM) descriptions. The model assumes a radius-dependent effective equation of state, with the pressure $P(r)$ and density $ho(r)$ following specific forms. The model is tested against SPARC galaxy data, involving 175 galaxies, and successfully explains rotation curves for 116 galaxies. However, it fails to describe 59 galaxies. Statistical analysis of the model parameters $K_0$, $K_0$-$M_b$, and $K_0$-$V_{flat}$ reveals the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation $M_b	extsim V_{flat}^{4.026	extpm 0.371}$ but fails to produce the canonical Tully-Fisher relation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenge posed by certain galaxies, such as dwarf galaxies and low-surface-brightness galaxies, which cannot be adequately described using the standard cold dark matter (CDM) framework. Hence, the paper introduces an alternative model of self-interacting dark matter to explain these observations.

Method: The method employed involves developing an analytic model of SIDM with a scale-dependent equation of state. The model assumes a specific form for the radius-dependent effective equation of state, with the pressure and density following particular mathematical expressions. The model is then tested against SPARC galaxy data, which contains data on various galaxies, involving 175 galaxies. The model's success is measured by how many galaxies' rotation curves it can explain. Additionally, statistical analysis is performed to examine the relationships between various parameters.

Result: The main results of this paper are as follows: (1) The proposed SIDM model successfully explains the rotation curves of 116 galaxies, which include dwarf galaxies and low-surface-brightness galaxies, among others. These galaxies are challenging cases for the standard CDM framework. (2) The model fails to explain rotation curves for 59 galaxies. (3) Statistical analysis of the model parameters reveals the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, albeit with significant scatter, but the canonical Tully-Fisher relation is not produced.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this paper presents a novel SIDM model with a scale-dependent equation of state that has partially succeeded in explaining the rotation curves of certain galaxies that challenge the CDM framework. While the model is promising for explaining a subset of galaxies, it falls short of providing a complete explanation for all cases, particularly in reproducing the canonical Tully-Fisher relation.

Abstract: In this work we use the recently introduced concept of self-interacting dark matter with scale-dependent equation of state, and we provide an analytic model of dark matter that can produce viable rotation curves even for low-surface-brightness galaxies, irregular galaxies, low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies, all known to challenge the cold dark matter description. The radius dependent effective equation of state of the self-interacting dark matter model we shall introduce is assumed to be an isothermal equation of state of the form $P(r)=K(r)\left(\frac{ρ(r)}{ρ_{\star}}\right)$, where the energy density will have the form $ρ(r)=\frac{ρ_0}{\left( 1+\frac{r^2}{α^2}\right)^{5/2}}$, while the entropy function $K(r)$ is $K(r)=\frac{K_0}{\left( 1+\frac{r^2}{α^2}\right)^{1/2}}$. The resulting model is confronted in detail with the SPARC galaxy data and 175 galaxies are used and tested. It proves that the analytic model can successfully produce the rotation curves of 116 galaxies, most of which are small mass spirals, irregular galaxies, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, 59 galaxies cannot be successfully described by our analytic model. We tested statistically the correlation between the parameter $K_0$ of the entropy function corresponding to the viable galaxies, and the flat rotation velocity $V_{flat}$ and the maximum rotation velocity $V_{max}$ of the galaxies from the SPARC data. We also examined the baryon mass $M_b$-$K_0$ relation and the luminosity $L$-$K_0$ relation. We have been able to produce the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for the viable galaxies, directly from the correlation $K_0$-$M_b$ and $K_0$-$V_{flat}$, with the resulting relation being $M_b\sim V_{flat}^{4.026 \pm 0.371}$, however we failed to produce the canonical Tully-Fisher relation.

Abstract: We investigate the arrow of time problem in the context of gravitational collapse of radiating stars in higher dimensions for both neutral and charged matter. The interior spacetime is described by a shear-free spherically symmetric metric filled with a dissipative fluid. The exterior spacetime of the radiating star is taken as the higher dimensional Vaidya metric. We establish that the arrow of time associated with gravitational entropy is opposite to the thermodynamic arrow of time for all dimensions. The physical consequences of our results are considered. Our result conforms with previous studies on shear-free spherical collapse, which suggests, avoidance of the naked singularity as the end state results in a wrong arrow of time, indicating a fundamental problem with the local application of the Weyl curvature hypothesis.

Abstract: Building upon our recently established correspondence between quantum cosmology and the hydrogen atom [1], we investigate the specific sector of a negative cosmological constant ($Λ< 0$) in a flat FLRW universe with dust. While the positive $Λ$ sector [1] yields a continuous spectrum and a single bounce, we show here that the negative $Λ$ sector leads to a discrete spectrum of energy eigenvalues, effectively quantizing the cosmological constant. Within this dual description, the operator-ordering ambiguity parameter appears as the azimuthal quantum number of the hydrogen atom. A skewed Bohr correspondence emerges for the bound states, matching classical evolution at large volumes but deviating near the bounce. By constructing wave packets from these bound states, we demonstrate that the classical Big Bang and Big Crunch singularities are resolved, and the universe oscillates between quantum bounces and classical turnaround points. The expectation values of the observables indicate a cyclic universe -- with vanishing Hubble parameter at turnarounds -- undergoing quantum bounces. This exactly solvable model offers a tractable setting to explore quantum gravitational effects in cosmology. We analyze the properties of this cyclic universe, contrasting its bound-state dynamics with the scattering states of the de Sitter case.

Abstract: In this work, we use the generalised Klein-Gordon Equation in curved spacetime with an electromagnetic field to investigate the tunnelling phenomenon of scalar particles originating from the hot NUT Kerr Newman Kasuya Anti de Sitter (KNKNK AdS) black hole. Using the tunnelling formalism, we obtain a modified Hawking temperature different from previous works due to the quantum gravity effect for the charged Dirac particle at the HNKNK AdS black hole's horizon. We find that the modified Hawking temperature is affected by the cosmological constant, magnetic mass, electric and magnetic charges. We demonstrate that a significant number of discontinuities exist in the heat capacities of the HNKNK AdS, indicating that the black hole system becomes unstable as the black hole size decreases.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) in photon-graviton conversion, which may offer a new method to probe quantum gravity effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated by testing the quantum nature of gravity, leveraging the Leggett-Garg inequality as a tool to study nonclassical behavior in systems involving both photons and gravitons.

Method: The study involves analyzing the violation of the LGI by examining the temporal correlations from successive measurements on a photon-graviton system resulting from their conversion in a magnetic field.

Result: The research successfully demonstrates that the LGI violation can occur, suggesting that quantum gravity effects exist and providing a testable phenomenon for future experiments.

Conclusion: This paper advances our understanding of quantum aspects in systems where photons and gravitons interact, potentially paving the way for new experiments to explore the quantum nature of gravity.

Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) is a temporal analogue of Bell's inequality and provides a quantitative test of the nonclassicality of a system through its violation. We analytically investigate the violation of the LGI in the context of photon-graviton conversion in a magnetic field background, motivated by its potential applications to testing the nonclassicality of gravity. When gravitational perturbations are quantized as gravitons, the conversion of an initial single photon state gives rise to a superposition of photon and graviton states. We show that the temporal correlations obtained from successive projective measurements on the photon-graviton system violate the LGI. Observation of such a violation would provide a novel avenue for probing the quantum nature of gravity.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the procedure implemented in the Multi-Band Template Analysis (MBTA) search pipeline to produce online posterior distributions of compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational-wave parameters. This procedure relies on an SNR optimizer technique, which consists of filtering dense local template banks. We present how these banks are constructed using information from the initial detection and detail how the results of the filtering are used to estimate source parameters and provide posterior distributions. We demonstrate the performance of our procedure on simulations and compare our source parameter estimates with the results from the first part of the fourth observing run (O4a) recently released by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive stability analysis of the black hole solution within Modified General Relativity (MGR), a theory proposing a unified geometric description of dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). A rigorous gauge-invariant formalism is employed to analyze gravitational perturbations of the extended Schwarzschild metric. The central finding is a critical pathology within the polar perturbation sector, where metric fluctuations couple to the theory's fundamental line element field. This coupling is governed by a factor that, while well-behaved at the horizon, diverges powerfully in the far-field limit as a direct consequence of the theory's non-asymptotically flat nature. This indicates a strong infrared instability that overwhelms perturbations at large distances. In stark contrast, the axial perturbation sector is found to be completely stable. This dichotomy proves that the instability is not inherent to the background metric but is specifically generated by the novel coupling mechanism encoding MGR's unified dark sectors. The results reveal a fundamental strong-coupling problem within the MGR framework, challenging its physical viability as an alternative to Einstein's General Relativity (EGR).

Conclusion: 该方法在宏观尺度下还原经典探测，展现了潜在的量子优势。

Abstract: We present a fully quantum field-theoretic framework for gravitational wave (GW) detection in which the interaction is described as photon-graviton scattering. In this picture, the GW acts as a coherent background that induces inelastic energy exchanges with the electromagnetic field - analogous to the Stokes and anti-Stokes shifts in Raman spectroscopy. We propose a detection scheme sensitive to this microscopic mechanism based on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We show that the scattering-induced phase shifts render frequency-entangled photon pairs distinguishable, spoiling their destructive quantum interference. GW signal is thus encoded in the modulation of photon coincidence rates rather than classical field intensity, offering a complementary quantum probe of the gravitational universe that recovers the standard classical response in the macroscopic limit.

Method: 使用标量-张量引力理论框架，通过设定不同的模型参数来研究吸收和散射特性。

Result: 模型I的吸收截面随斜率λ增加而增大，尤其是频率高时μc大、μH小。模型II的吸收截面在低频时随r0减小而减小，并显示出共振峰。两种模型的散射截面显示共振峰。在高频极限下，参数的影响减弱。

Conclusion: 两种模型下，吸收呈现零吸收带；在低频时模型II的吸收截面较低，并显示共振峰；在较高频下，参数对吸收和散射的影响减弱。

Abstract: We investigate the absorption and scattering by a Schwarzschild black hole in scalar--tensor theories of gravity, where the coupling between matter and the scalar field induces different models for the effective mass of the scalar field. In model~I, a Bondi-type mass model described by the asymptotic mass $μ_c$, horizon mass $μ_H$, and profile slope $λ$, it is found that the absorption cross section increases with steeper $λ$, larger $μ_c$ (especially at higher frequencies), or smaller $μ_H$. The differential scattering cross section in this model shows the strongest dependence on the horizon mass $μ_H$. When $μ_H$ exceeds a critical value for a fixed incoming wave frequency $ω$, no partial wave transmits into the black hole, flattening the differential scattering cross section as a function of angle before it increases again with further increase of $μ_H$. Model~II, which considers a truncated accretion region outside some radius $r_0$, contains a potential well in its effective scattering potential. Its absorption cross section decreases in the low-frequency region as the accretion radius $r_0$ decreases, and more importantly, it shows resonance peaks at the quasibound wave frequencies due to resonances induced by the potential well. The differential scattering cross sections show dips around intermediate scattering angles when the parameters (mainly $μ_H$ and $ω$) are such that the resonantly scattered and non-resonant waves interfere destructively around these angles. In both models, absorption exhibits a zero-absorption band as $ω$ approaches $μ_c$ from above, and in both absorption and scattering, the effects of the parameters are found to diminish in the high-frequency limit.

Motivation: To understand the thermodynamic aspects of gravity and cosmology.

Method: Apply unified first law of thermodynamics to FLRW universe's apparent horizon, account for comoving volumes, and calculate entropy production.

Result: Establish a thermodynamic framework that decomposes entropy and particle number as functions of bulk production and horizon dynamics, derive the Generalized Second Law (GSL) in this setting.

Conclusion: Extends thermodynamic framework of gravitational phenomena, reconciles entropy production and particle number conservation in expanding horizon cosm学.

Abstract: We explore the derivation of the Friedmann equations from a thermodynamic perspective, applying the unified first law of thermodynamics to the apparent horizon of a flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. We extend this framework to incorporate gravitationally induced particle creation, treating the region enclosed by the apparent horizon as an open thermodynamic system. A crucial aspect of our analysis is the recognition that the apparent horizon volume is not comoving; this requires a consistent accounting of particle exchange across the moving boundary. We demonstrate that the evolution of the particle number, and explicitly the matter entropy, can be decomposed into two distinct physical contributions: genuine bulk particle production and a net flux induced by the dynamics of the horizon itself. Finally, we derive the Generalized Second Law (GSL) in this setting, showing transparently how the total entropy budget is balanced by horizon thermodynamics, bulk creation, and boundary fluxes.

Abstract: We develop a Floquet transfer matrix method to solve scattering in extended 1D Floquet lattices, uncovering an underlying conjugate symplectic structure that enforces current conservation across sidebands. By engineering a spatial adiabatic boundary, we suppress multi-channel sideband interference, allowing us to establish a direct mapping between the bulk winding number $C$ and a rigid shift in the transmission energy windows--quantified as $C\hbarω$. We further propose two experimental realizations: cold-atom Bragg scattering to directly verify the transmission shift, and surface-acoustic-wave-induced transport demonstrating the quantized zero-bias current plateau.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Singular flat bands (SFBs) in two-dimensional materials can exhibit dc transport when subjected to an electric field near the singular band crossing point (BCP), even in single-particle systems, by utilizing Berry-phase driven tunneling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the transport properties of singular flat bands is central to exploring their potential applications in electronic devices.

Method: A minimal two-band model was used, combining Wannier-Stark effect analysis with Berry-phase examination.

Result: Away from BCP, WS spectrum corresponds to an intraband Berry phase Φ Bs; near BCP, interband Berry connection leads to Landau-Zener tunneling and dc transport according to maximal quantum distances φ and θ.

Conclusion: Quantum geometric phases play a crucial role in enabling non-trivial transport signatures.

Abstract: Flat-band materials have attracted substantial interest for their intriguing quantum geometric effects. Here we investigate how singular flat bands (SFBs) respond to a static, uniform electric field and whether they can support single-particle dc transport. By constructing a minimal two-band lattice model, we show that away from the singular band crossing point (BCP), the Wannier-Stark (WS) spectrum of the flat band is well captured by an intraband Berry phase $Φ_{\mathrm{B}}$. The associated WS eigenstates are exponentially localized along the field direction, precluding dc transport. In contrast, near the BCP the interband Berry connection becomes prominent and drives Landau-Zener tunneling, which bends the flat-band WS ladder and delocalizes the SFB wavefunctions. Remarkably, this regime is governed solely by the maximal quantum distance $d$ through two geometric phases $(θ,\varphi)$: $θ$ characterizes the tunneling rate and $\varphi$ acts as a generalized Berry phase. These results highlight the essential role of quantum geometry in enabling nontrivial transport signatures in SFBs.

Abstract: Understanding how water wets graphene is critical for predicting and controlling its behavior in nanofluidic, sensing, and energy applications. A key measure of wetting is the contact angle made by a liquid droplet against the surface, yet experimental measurements for graphene span a wide range, and no consensus has emerged for free-standing graphene. Here, we use a machine learning potential with approaching ab initio accuracy to perform nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics and provide an atomistic first-principles benchmark for this unsolved problem. We find the contact angle of water on free-standing graphene, after finite-size correction, to be $72.1 \pm 1.5 °$. We also show that the three-phase contact line of a nanoscale water droplet couples strongly to the intrinsic thermal ripples of free-standing graphene, and that graphene's wetting properties are highly sensitive to mechanical strain. Tensile strain makes graphene significantly more hydrophobic, while compressive strain induces coherent ripples that the droplet "surfs", resulting in pronounced anisotropic wetting and contact angle hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that graphene's wetting properties are governed not only by its chemistry but also by its dynamic morphology, offering an additional explanation for the variability of experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanical strain may be a practical route to controlling wetting in graphene-based technologies, with promising consequences for nanofluidic and nano-filtration applications.

Abstract: An array of quantum dots coupled via superconductivity provides a new platform for creating Kitaev chains with Majorana zero modes, offering a promising avenue toward topological quantum computing. In this work, we theoretically study the quantum capacitance of a minimal Kitaev chain weakly coupled to an external normal lead. We find that in the open regime, charge stability diagrams of quantum capcaitance can help to identify the sweet spot of a Kitaev chain, consistent with tunnel spectroscopy. Moreover, the quantum capacitance of a single quantum dot coupled to Andreev bound states reveals the interplay between two distinct parity switching mechanisms: coupling to an external normal lead and intrinsic quasiparticle poisoning. Our work provides useful physical insights into the quantum capacitance and parity dynamics in a quantum-dot-based Kitaev chain device.

Abstract: Coupled-wire description has been developed as a powerful framework for providing bosonic descriptions of strongly correlated quantum matter, with early applications to systems such as the cuprates and the integer and fractional quantum Hall states. In this topical review, we discuss recent developments of coupled-wire description in nanoscale systems, where it emerges not only as a theoretical tool but also as a highly tunable physical platform. In these nanoscale realizations, coupled-wire networks are formed by one-dimensional channels embedded in two-dimensional materials, most prominently in moiré and twisted structures. Such networks host a broad range of unconventional states of matter, including superconductivity, charge density waves, spin density waves, Mott insulating phases, Anderson insulating phases, quantum spin Hall states, quantum anomalous Hall states, and their fractionalized counterparts. The ability to electrically control interaction strength, confinement, and coupling between wires makes these systems qualitatively different from earlier realizations and allows continuous tuning between competing phases. Notably, recent work has demonstrated that the coupled-wire framework in moiré networks completes the trio of quantum Hall phenomena, encompassing quantum Hall, quantum spin Hall, and quantum anomalous Hall states, together with their fractional analogues. This development highlights coupled-wire networks in nanoscale materials as a versatile and experimentally relevant setting for exploring the interplay of topology, strong correlations, and low-dimensional physics.

We describe a simple mechanism for generating persistent current oscillations in the diode due to the voltage drop across the external resistor (beam loading) which reduces the total field and inhibits the emission. The amplitude and the frequency, which is in the THz domain, depend on the operating parameters of the diode. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to find the characteristics and physical basis of the mechanism, and a simple analytical model is presented, in good agreement with the simulation.

Abstract: Layered Ising metamagnets are antiferromagnetic (AF) materials consisting of monolayer Ising ferromagnets coupled to each other via interlayer AF interactions. They exhibit rich magnetic phase diagrams, featuring tricritical and critical end points, due to the competing magnetic interactions and the Ising anisotropy. While conventional thermodynamic probes can identify these critical points in bulk Ising metamagnets, achieving this in the two-dimensional (2D) limit, where enhanced fluctuation effects can substantially modify critical phenomena, remains to be realized. Here, we combine specific heat capacity (C_V) and magnetic circular dichroism measurements to identify these critical points, extract a tricritical exponent, and map out the complete magnetic phase diagram of 2D Ising metamagnetic CrI3. This is achieved in a nanomechanical device of 6-layer CrI3, in which a direct measurement of the temperature derivative of its mechanical resonance frequency gives C_V. The tricritical point is identified by the onset of an abrupt spin-flip transition on one side and, on the other side, by a vanishing specific heat λ-anomaly for a continuous AF phase transition. In contrast, only the spin-flip transition remains near the critical end point. Our results establish nanomechanical calorimetry as a general route to classify metamagnetic phase transitions and to study multicritical phenomena in 2D magnets.

Motivation: Understanding the origin of nonreciprocal dispersion in magnetic multilayers is important for the development of magnonic devices.

Method: The authors used a frequency-shift dynamic matrix and an interaction-resolved dynamic energy-density formalism to analyze the frequency asymmetry in nonreciprocal spin-wave dispersion.

Result: The results show that the frequency asymmetry cannot generally be attributed to dipolar effects alone and that interlayer exchange dominates the frequency shift.

Conclusion: Interlayer exchange is identified as the primary mechanism controlling nonreciprocal dispersion in multilayer magnonic systems, providing a quantitative framework for engineering large frequency shifts in nonreciprocal magnonic devices.

Abstract: Spin-wave nonreciprocity, manifested as a frequency difference between counterpropagating modes, underpins many proposed magnonic devices. While this effect is commonly attributed to dipolar interactions or interfacial chirality, the microscopic origin of nonreciprocal dispersion in magnetic multilayers remains under debate. Here, we analyze nonreciprocal spin-wave dispersion in planar multilayer heterostructures without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Using a frequency-shift dynamic matrix and an interaction-resolved dynamic energy-density formalism, we show that the frequency asymmetry cannot generally be ascribed to dipolar effects alone. Instead, once counterpropagating modes differ in their geometric structure along the thickness, interlayer exchange dominates the frequency shift. Applied to representative multilayer systems, we find that the interlayer exchange contribution exceeds dipolar and intralayer exchange effects by up to two to three orders of magnitude over a broad wave-vector range. Our results establish interlayer exchange as the primary mechanism controlling nonreciprocal dispersion in multilayer magnonic systems and provide a quantitative framework for engineering large frequency shifts in nonreciprocal magnonic devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling spin dynamics in magnetic systems is crucial for developing advanced spintronic devices, and this paper contributes new insights into spin pumping mechanisms.

Method: Theoretical analysis of spin dynamics combined with consideration of nonlinear interactions in adiabatic energy spectra.

Result: A distinct mechanism for high-harmonic spin pumping is identified, which operates independently of SOC, opening new avenues for ultrafast spintronic applications.

Conclusion: High-harmonic spin pumping can be achieved through nonlinear magnetic interactions, offering an alternative pathway to enhanced spin transport without requiring SOC. This research broadens the theoretical understanding of spin pumping and provides a foundation for future device designs based on magnetic structure dynamics.

Abstract: Spin pumping provides a fundamental route for dynamical spin transport, yet in its conventional form it produces only linear spin responses at the driving frequency. Recent studies have shown that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can lift these restrictions and enable highly nonlinear spin and charge currents. Here we propose a distinct mechanism for high-harmonic spin pumping that does not rely on spin-orbit interactions. We show that nonlinearities in the adiabatic energy spectrum--rather than SOC itself--constitute the essential ingredient for high-harmonic generation in pumped spin currents. Such nonlinearities can arise in purely magnetic systems when a secondary magnetic order parameter is introduced perpendicular to the cone axis of a precessing magnetic moment. As a result, spin pumping and its higher harmonics emerge even in the complete absence of SOC. Our findings establish a new route to ultrafast spin pumping based solely on magnetic structure and dynamics.
