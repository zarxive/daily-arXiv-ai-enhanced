Abstract: Extreme weather events emerge from the chaotic dynamics of the atmosphere.
Adaptive chaos control has been applied to Lorenz models in this context.
Weather Jiu-Jitsu is a control paradigm that seeks to steer trajectories away
from dangerous weather regimes using small, well-timed perturbations. The
seasonally forced, non-autonomous Lorenz model has a much more complex
attractor than similar atmospheric toy models used to demonstrate the potential
of control in the existing literature. Noise or stochastic terms can also
significantly increase the complexity of control via small perturbations. We
present the first example of finite time adaptive chaos control for a
seasonally forced and noise perturbed Lorenz84 model. We demonstrate two
strategies for triggering control: (1) local Lyapunov exponents (LLE), and (2)
transition probabilities for the latent states of a non-homogeneous Hidden
Markov Model (NHMM). The second approach is new. It is motivated by thinking of
future applications to a latent embedding space of planetary atmospheric
circulation that would get us closer to real world analyses. The NHMM triggers
are found to coincide with strongly positive LLE regimes, confirming their
dynamical interpretability. Thus, latent-state triggers complement instability
diagnostics and provide a conceptual bridge to weather foundation models where
hidden states are already identified and could be used for triggering control.

### [2] [Evaluation of Wafer-Scale SOT-MRAM for Analog Crossbar Array Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25853)
*Samuel Liu,Chen-Yu Hu,Xinyu Bao,Ming-Yuan Song,Jean Anne C. Incorvia*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper presents a high-performing SOT-MRAM device with 2-bit quantization and stochastic training achieving 95% MNIST accuracy. The low energy dissipation, fast operation, and low device-to-device variation make it suitable for memory-efficient neural network applications. The results demonstrate the potential of SOT-MRAM as a memory- and energy-limited applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for efficient neural network applications has necessitated the development of memory-efficient computing solutions. Crossbar arrays using SOT-MRAM have shown promise in alleviating computational strain associated with vector-matrix multiplications.

Method: The authors fabricated 300 mm-compatible SOT-MRAM devices with a 150% tunnel magnetoresistance ratio. They employed methods such as fast (2 ns) operation, low voltage (<1 V) operation, and techniques like 2-bit quantization aware training and noisy training to mitigate issues. The devices were tested for their performance in binary neural network training and probabilistic graph modeling.

Result: The SOT-MRAM devices demonstrated consistent performance with 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset. The low energy dissipation (350 fJ), low voltage operation (<1 V), and low write noise (0.1%) highlight their efficiency. Additionally, the devices showed potential in implementing probabilistic graph modeling, with reduced conductance noise improving performance. The bi-stable anisotropy and stochastic switching further enhanced their functionality for stochastic training of binary neural networks.

Conclusion: SOT-MRAM-based crossbar arrays represent a promising solution for memory- and energy-limited neural network applications. The demonstrated performance and flexibility suggest that SOT-MRAM could be effectively integrated into future memory architectures to enhance computational efficiency and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Analog crossbar arrays consisting of emerging memory devices can greatly
alleviate the computational strain required by vector matrix multiplications
for neural network applications. The ability to produce spin orbit
torque-magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) at wafer-scale positions
SOT-MRAM as a strong memory candidate. In this work, we fabricate and measure
300 mm-compatible SOT-MRAM with 150% tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, fast (2
ns) and low voltage (<1 V) operation, low energy dissipation (350 fJ), low
write noise (0.1%), and low device-to-device variation of 10%. Through 2-bit
quantization aware training and noisy training as mitigation techniques, the
measured SOT-MRAM devices attain 95% on MNIST. The bi-stable anisotropy and
stochastic switching of SOT-MRAM can additionally be leveraged for stochastic
training of binary neural networks, able to reach ideal accuracy for a single
device. Lastly, the devices were evaluated on implementation of probabilistic
graph modeling and the interplay of tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, probability
curve distribution, and conductance noise was shown to reduce potential errors
in implementation. Through these results, SOT-MRAM is shown to be a uniquely
effective candidate for implementation of crossbar accelerators in memory- and
energy-limited applications, able to take advantage of stochastic operation and
bi-stability to beneficial results in neural network applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in the scaling of spin qubits have led to the development of
sparse architectures where spin qubits are distributed across multiple quantum
dots. This distributed approach enables qubit manipulation through hopping and
flopping modes, as well as protocols for spin shuttling to entangle spins
beyond nearest neighbors. Therefore, understanding spin tunneling across
quantum dots is fundamental for the improvement of sparse array encodings.
Here, we develop a microscopic theory of a minimal sparse array formed by a
hole in a double quantum dot. We show the existence of spin-dependent magnetic
corrections to the tunnel couplings that help preserve existing sweet spots,
even for quantum dots with different $g$-factors, and introduce new ones that
are not accounted for in the simplest models. Our analytical and numerical
results explain observed sweet spots in state-of-the-art shuttling and cQED
experiments, are relevant to hopping and flopping modes, and apply broadly to
sparse array encodings of any size.

Abstract: Parametric excitation in coupled mechanical systems has enabled advances in
sensing, computation, and phonon control. The function of distinct phase modes
using parametric driving remains insufficiently explored. Here, we investigate
the nonlinear and parametric response of degenerate phase modes in a Double
Ended Tuning Fork (DETF) resonator. Our measurements reveal pronounced
nonlinearity and parametric amplification in the out-phase mode, attributed to
the dominant contribution of the coupling beam, while the in-phase mode remains
predominantly linear. Uniquely, we demonstrate parametric excitation through
the coupling spring, enabling selective amplification and de-amplification
controlled via the relative phase between harmonic and parametric drives. A
parametric gain of $\sim$13 dB is achieved in the out-phase mode, with
phase-dependent modulation of amplification, indicating its suitability for
signal processing, logic operations, and memory elements based on degenerate
modes. These results establish a new approach to exploiting mode-specific
nonlinear dynamics in coupled resonators for emerging applications in sensing
and phononic control.

Conclusion: PdSe₂是一种理想的层状量子材料，展示了在超快时间尺度下的独特光响应。

Abstract: We use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES)
combined with density functional theory to investigate ultrafast carrier
dynamics in low-symmetry layered semiconducting PdSe$_2$. The indirect bandgap
is determined to be 0.55~eV. Following photoexcitation above this gap, we
resolve a valence band shift and broadening, both lasting less than a
picosecond, consistent with bandgap renormalization and carrier scattering,
indicative of strong many-body interactions. Subsequently, hot carriers
populate the conduction band minimum and are captured by defect states. A
surface photovoltage (SPV) of $\sim$ 67~meV emerges, persisting for over 50~ps,
driven by defect-assisted charge separation. The formation of native vacancies,
promoted by the low-symmetry lattice, likely gives rise to the mid-gap states
responsible for this long-lived SPV response. Detailed analysis of TR-ARPES
spectra disentangles the contributions of bandgap renormalization, carrier
scattering, defect states, and SPV. These findings establish PdSe$_2$ as a
prototypical layered quantum material exhibiting exotic photoresponses on
ultrafast timescales.

### [6] [Hall-Type and Unidirectional Spin Pumping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26208)
*Ping Li,Chengyuan Cai,Tao Yu*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A Hall-type, unidirectional spin pumping mechanism is proposed using magnetization dynamics to emit near-field electromagnetic radiation, enabling highly efficient spin current generation in low-dimensional spintronic and orbitronic devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper proposes a mechanism for generating Hall-type spin pumping, which is efficient and suitable for future spintronic and orbitronic applications.

Method: The method involves analyzing magnetization dynamics in the context of near-field electromagnetic radiation and its influence on spin pumping.

Result: The result is a robust, efficient, and unidirectional spin pumping mechanism that can be used for generating and manipulating spin currents in low-dimensional devices.

Conclusion: This approach provides a new way to efficiently generate spin currents for advanced spintronic and orbitronic devices.

Abstract: Conventional spin pumping, driven by magnetization dynamics, is longitudinal
since the pumped spin current flows normal to the interface between the
ferromagnet and the conductor. We predict \textit{Hall-type/transverse} and
\textit{unidirectional} spin pumping into conductors by near-field
electromagnetic radiation emitted by, \textit{e.g.}, magnetization dynamics.
The joint effect of the electric and magnetic fields results in a pure spin
current flowing parallel to the interface, i.e., a Hall-type spin pumping,
which is highly efficient due to the strong coupling to the electric field.
Such a transverse spin current is unidirectional, with the spatial distribution
controlled by the magnetization direction. Our finding reveals a robust
approach for generating and manipulating spin currents in future
low-dimensional spintronic and orbitronic devices.

Abstract: The bound electron-hole pairs known as excitons govern the optical properties
of insulating solids. While their behavior in equilibrium is well-understood
theoretically, the nonequilibrium regime at high excitation densities-where
phenomena like electron-hole liquids emerge - is less explored. This thesis
presents a first-principles study of excitons in two-dimensional materials. We
use the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to investigate their
properties from equilibrium to nonequilibrium conditions. We first demonstrate
how increasing photo-excited carrier density leads to a redshift-blueshift
crossover of excitons. We then show that electron-phonon interactions
critically modify optical spectra and exciton lifetimes at finite temperatures.
Finally, we unify these effects to demonstrate the formation of an
electron-hole liquid phase above a critical carrier density and below a
critical temperature. Our work identifies how enhanced Coulomb interactions in
two dimensions can stabilize this phase at significantly higher temperatures,
proposing promising material candidates for observing these collective states.

### [8] [Experimental Milestones Towards Majorana Braiding with Acoustic Metamaterials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26598)
*Jackson Saunders,Emil Prodan,Camelia Prodan*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the experimental implementation of a fully general Kitaev chain with complex-valued order parameter and site-varying synthetic chemical potential using a passive multilayer acoustic resonator design, showing the reproducibility of key symmetries and the topological phase diagram, and the presence of Majorana-like edge modes localized at domain walls and in the bulk spectral gap. The system demonstrates precise control over mode positioning and validates the stability of the modes and the spectral gap under continuous and complex variations of the order parameter, establishing the fundamental building blocks for experimental implementation of complete braiding protocols toward accessible non-abelian physics and topologically protected information processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper seems to be the exploration and experimental verification of topological phases of matter, specifically focusing on the Kitaev chain, which is a fundamental model in the study of Majorana fermions and topological superconductors. The ability to implement such a system experimentally opens up avenues for understanding and potentially utilizing non-abelian anyons for topologically protected quantum computation.

Method: The method employed in this paper involves the use of a passive multilayer acoustic resonator design to create a synthetic chemical potential that varies across the lattice sites. The researchers fabricated a laboratory model of this system and conducted experiments to verify its ability to reproduce the theoretical predictions of the Kitaev chain, including the presence of topological phases and Majorana-like edge modes. They also tested the system's responsiveness to variations in the complex order parameter.

Result: The key results of the paper are as follows: the experimental setup faithfully reproduced the theoretical predictions of the Kitaev chain, with specific symmetries and a topological phase diagram. The researchers observed Majorana-like edge modes localized at the engineered domain walls and within the bulk spectral gap. They also demonstrated the ability to precisely control the positioning of these modes through smooth spatial variations of the synthetic chemical potential $
u$. Additionally, the stability of the modes and the spectral gap was validated under continuous and complex variations of the order parameter $
u$. These findings confirm the fundamental building blocks required for implementing complete braiding protocols, which are essential for non-abelian quantum computation.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper successfully demonstrates the experimental implementation of a generalized Kitaev chain with a complex-valued order parameter and site-varying synthetic chemical potential. Through precise control over the system's parameters and verification of its topological properties, the researchers have established the foundational components necessary for experimental implementations of braiding operations, opening new possibilities for studying non-abelian anyons and topologically protected information processing.

Abstract: Here we show the first experimental implementation of the fully general
Kitaev chain with complex-valued order parameter $\Delta$ and site-varying
synthetic chemical potential $\mu$, using a passive multilayer acoustic
resonator design and fabrication. Our laboratory model faithfully reproduces
the key symmetries and the topological phase diagram of the model, and displays
robust Majorana-like edge modes spatially localized at smoothly engineered
domain walls and energetically localized in the middle of the bulk spectral
gap. We demonstrate precise control over mode positioning through smooth
spatial variations of $\mu$, and validate the stability of the modes and of the
spectral gap under continuous and complex variations of $\Delta$ -- both
critical requirements for topological braiding operations. These results
establish and validate the fundamental building blocks for experimental
implementation of complete braiding protocols, opening concrete pathways toward
accessible non-abelian physics and topologically protected information
processing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures allow the engineering of electronic and
magnetic properties by the stacking different two-dimensional vdW materials.
For example, orbital hybridisation and charge transfer at a vdW interface may
result in electric fields across the interface that give rise to Rashba
spin-orbit coupling. In magnetic vdW heterostructures, this in turn can drive
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction which leads to a canting of local
magnetic moments at the vdW interface and may thus stabilise novel 2D magnetic
phases. While such emergent magnetic "interphases" offer a promising platform
for spin-based electronics, direct spectroscopic evidence for them is still
lacking. Here, we report Zeeman effects with Land\'e $g$-factors up to
$\approx230$ at the interface of graphene and the vdW ferromagnet
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. They arise from a magnetic interphase in which local-moment
canting and itinerant orbital moments generated by the non-trivial band
topology of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ conspire to cause a giant asymmetric level splitting
when a magnetic field is applied. Exploiting the inelastic phonon gap of
graphene, we can directly access the buried vdW interface to the Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$
by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. Systematically analyzing the Faraday-like
screening of the tip electric field by the graphene, we demonstrate the
tunability of the constitutional interface dipole, as well as the Zeeman
effect, by tip gating. Our findings are supported by density functional theory
and electrostatic modelling.

Abstract: The interaction between hydrogen atoms and carbon nanoparticles is a
fundamental process governing the properties of carbonaceous materials in
environments ranging from combustion systems to the interstellar medium. This
study investigates the effects of controlled atomic hydrogen exposure on young
and mature soot nanoparticles, generated in premixed ethylene-air flames, and
deposited on substrates. We employed a multi-technique approach to characterize
the chemical, mechanical, and electrical evolution of the films. In-situ
infrared spectroscopy revealed non-monotonic behavior: an initial increase in
aliphatic CH bonds was observed, followed by a decrease at higher hydrogen
fluences. This was accompanied by a continuous decrease in the aromatic C=C
signal. Atomic force microscopy showed a significant increase in the Young's
modulus of the film for both sample types after hydrogenation. This mechanical
change was correlated with an increase in the I(D)/I(G) ratio from Raman
spectroscopy. Furthermore, both macroscopic current vs. voltage and local
scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements demonstrated a notable increase in
electrical conductivity. For single just-formed soot particles, moreover, a
hydrogen-induced transformation from a semiconductive to a semi-metallic nature
was observed. The collective evidence points towards an H-induced CC
cross-linking mechanism within the nanoparticle films. We propose that atomic
hydrogen facilitates the formation of radical sites, which promotes covalent
bond formation between adjacent particles or molecular units, creating a more
interconnected and rigid network, with smaller interlayer distance. These
findings provide crucial insights into the structural evolution of carbonaceous
materials in hydrogen-rich environments, with direct implications for
understanding soot formation and for the tailored design of carbon-based
materials.

Conclusion: 该研究为实现灵敏度更高的时间 resolve 原子干涉ometry 提供了理论支持和实验方法。

Abstract: Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as
gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires
precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase
noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in
the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse
its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline,
large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework
to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in
position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations.
Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation
experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency
also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of
the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of
its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability.
Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of
magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this
limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved
phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the
wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift
gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity
operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam
characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation,
time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.

Result: 在圆柱壳结构中，他们成功实现了基于正导热特性的可靠热缺损和补偿效果。

Conclusion: 这种方法为反设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Illusion effects-where one object appears as another-arise from the
non-uniqueness of physical systems, in which different material configurations
yield identical external responses. Conventional approaches, such as coordinate
transformation, map equivalent configurations but provide only specific
solutions, while analytical or numerical optimization methods extend these
designs by minimizing scattering yet remain constrained by model assumptions
and computational cost. Here, we exploit this non-uniqueness through a
data-driven framework that uses a variational autoencoder to compress
high-dimensional thermal-field data into a compact latent space capturing
geometrical relations between configurations and observations. In this latent
space, thermal illusion corresponds to finding configurations that minimize
geometric distance to a target configuration, with thermal cloaking as a
special case where the target is free space. Specifically, we demonstrate the
concept in a cylindrical shell with anisotropic thermal conductivities
enclosing a core of arbitrary conductivity, achieving robust thermal illusion
and cloaking using only positive conductivities. Such a latent-space distance
approach provides a refreshed perspective for achieving illusion and can be
applied to inverse-design problems in other classical wave systems.

TL;DR: A platform for single-molecule confinement using thermally induced wrinkle networks in exfoliated hBN, compatible with wide-field fluorescence microscopy, with applications in nanobiology and biomolecule sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable single-molecule localization, transport, and sensing with spatial confinement, temporal resolution, and efficient background suppression. The challenge is to achieve guided motion in one-dimensional confinement using 2D materials like hBN.

Method: Exfoliated hBN is used, and thermal treatment induces wrinkle networks. These wrinkle networks act as nanochannels for biomolecule confinement. Structural characterization includes AFM, SEM, fluorescence imaging, and KPFM. A graphene/hBN heterostructure is used to suppress background fluorescence.

Result: Stable confinement of biomolecules, demonstrated by long-term retention of aqueous solutions in nanochannels. Selective DNA localization and imaging in 1D channels with reduced background fluorescence.

Conclusion: A scalable, lithography-free platform for 2D confinement of biomolecules with applications in sensing and nanobiology.

Abstract: Fluorescence-based single-molecule localization, transport, and sensing
require spatial confinement to extend the molecule's residence time during
imaging, sufficient temporal resolution to capture fast dynamics, and efficient
fluorescence background suppression. Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer
large-area, atomically flat surfaces suitable for massively parallel in-plane
biomolecule imaging, yet achieving guided motion in one-dimensional
confinements using top-down nanofabrication remains challenging. Here, we
demonstrate that thermally induced wrinkles in exfoliated hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) act as self-assembled nanochannels that enable biomolecule
confinement and imaging under wide-field fluorescence microscopy. By
controlling annealing parameters and substrate properties, we obtain scalable
and reproducible wrinkle networks whose densities and morphologies can be
tuned. Structural characterization using atomic force and scanning electron
microscopy is complemented by fluorescence imaging and Kelvin probe force
microscopy, confirming that aqueous solutions fill and remain stably retained
within the nanochannels for periods exceeding 10 hours. We further achieve
selective ATTO647N-DNA localization and imaging in the one-dimensional channels
through the formation of a graphene/hBN vertical heterostructure. The graphene
overlayer serves as a quenching mask that suppresses background fluorescence
both from high-strain hBN regions and from DNA adsorbed on top of the 2D layer.
Overall, these results provide a scalable, lithography-free route for creating
planar nanofluidic confinements fully compatible with single-molecule imaging.
This platform enables fundamental nanobiology studies as well as on-chip
biomolecule transport and sensing applications.

### [14] [Tailored heat treatments to characterise the fracture resistance of critical weld regions in hydrogen transmission pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26624)
*D. R. Chalfoun,J. Parker,M. Gagliano,E. Martínez-Pañeda*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: A new protocol is presented to characterize the toughness of weld HAZ microstructures by replicating heat-affected zones in bulk specimens through tailored heat treatments. The study investigates the influence of microstructures, manufacturing era, and steel grades on the fracture resistance and hydrogen embrittlement of these regions, revealing reduced fracture resistance and higher susceptibility in the HAZ under hydrogen pressure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the structural integrity of hydrogen transport pipelines, particularly focusing on the weld HAZ, which is prone to failure. This understanding is crucial for developing robust safety measures and maintenance protocols.

Method: The protocol involves manufacturing bulk specimens with microstructures representative of the HAZ through tailored heat treatments. These specimens are then tested under various conditions to assess fracture resistance and hydrogen embrittlement.

Result: The research reveals that HAZ microstructures exhibit significant reduced fracture resistance and enhanced hydrogen embrittlement, with initiation toughness values as low as 32 MPa√m. This indicates a critical need to address the influence of these microstructures and hard zones in pipeline design and maintenance.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of considering microstructural and hard, brittle zone effects in the design and assessment of HAZ within hydrogen transport pipelines, highlighting the necessity for enhanced safety measures and maintenance strategies to mitigate potential failures.

Abstract: A new protocol is presented to directly characterise the toughness of
microstructural regions present within the weld heat-affected zone (HAZ), the
most vulnerable location governing the structural integrity of hydrogen
transport pipelines. Heat treatments are tailored to obtain bulk specimens that
replicate predominantly ferritic-bainitic, bainitic, and martensitic
microstructures present in the HAZ. These are applied to a range of pipeline
steels to investigate the role of manufacturing era (vintage versus modern),
chemical composition, and grade. The heat treatments successfully reproduce the
hardness levels and microstructures observed in the HAZ of existing natural gas
pipelines. Subsequently, fracture experiments are conducted in air and pure H2
at 100 bar, revealing a reduced fracture resistance and higher hydrogen
embrittlement susceptibility of the HAZ microstructures, with initiation
toughness values as low as 32 MPa$\sqrt{\text{m}}$. The findings emphasise the
need to adequately consider the influence of microstructure and hard, brittle
zones within the HAZ.

*Sayedus Salehin,Syed Shaheer Uddin Ahmed,Uzay Tefek,Laura Weirauch,M. Selim Hanay*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: Microplastics are a significant environmental health concern, but current detection methods are limited by cost, size, and throughput. Portable sensors based on microwave cytometry with shape recognition could address these issues by eliminating reliance on spherical particle assumptions. This advancement allows for more accurate shape analysis of non-spherical particles, improving environmental monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing concern over microplastic污染 highlights the need for reliable and efficient detection methods. Current tools are hindered by high costs, portability issues, and limited throughput.

Method: Microwave cytometry combined with machine learning is used to analyze particle shapes. A random forest model is trained to decode microwave resonator responses and low-frequency impedance signals, enabling shape recognition without optical input.

Result: The system accurately measures the major and minor axes of ellipsoidal particles with <8% relative error and calculates their dielectric permittivity. This method removes shape assumptions, enhancing detection capabilities.

Conclusion: Microwave cytometry with machine learning offers a portable, high-throughput solution for microplastic sensing, paving the way for better environmental monitoring technologies.

Abstract: Microplastics are increasingly recognized as a global environmental health
threat, yet their detection and characterization remain constrained by the
cost, form factor, and throughput of existing analytical tools. Portable
micro/nanotechnology-based sensors are emerging to address this need, but most
rely on the assumption of spherical particle geometry in their operating
principle, limiting their relevance for environmental analysis. Here, we
overcome this limitation by advancing microwave cytometry with machine
learning-enabled shape recognition. Microwave cytometry is a flow-through
electronic platform that integrates microwave resonator responses with
low-frequency impedance signals to capture the dielectric signatures of
individual particles. Using microscopy-derived shape measurements as ground
truth, we trained a random forest model to decode these information-rich
waveforms. Once trained, the system operates without optical input, enabling
electronic-only determination of particle geometry. We demonstrate extraction
of the major and minor axes of ellipsoidal microparticles with <8% relative
error on average and use these predictions to derive the dielectric
permittivity of ellipsoid particles. This approach removes long-standing shape
assumptions in microplastic sensing and establishes a pathway toward portable,
high-throughput, morphology-aware detection technologies.

Abstract: Electronic and photonic chips revolutionized information technology through
massive integration of functional elements, yet phonons as fundamental

large-scale programmable phononic integrated circuits (PnICs) for complex

Abstract: Artificial transmission lines built with lumped-element inductors and
capacitors form the backbone of broadband, nearly quantum-limited
traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs). However, systematic design
methods for TWPAs, and more generally artificial transmission lines, are
lacking. Here, I develop a general synthesis framework for lossless artificial
transmission lines by borrowing from periodic structure theory and passive
network synthesis. These complementary approaches divide the design space:
periodic loading synthesis employs spatial modulation of frequency-independent
components, while filter synthesis employs frequency-dependent responses in
spatially-uniform components. When tailoring transmission lines for parametric
processes, nonlinear elements are added, typically nonlinear inductances in
superconducting circuits, while ensuring energy and momentum conservation
between interacting tones. Applying this framework, I design a kinetic
inductance TWPA with a novel phase-matching architecture, and a backward-pumped
Josephson TWPA exploiting an ambidextrous i.e., right-left-handed transmission
line.

Abstract: We propose that the broad architecture of the renormalization group flow in
quantum field theories is, at least in part, fixed by unitarity. The precise
statement is summarized in the Unitarity Flow Conjecture, which states that the
non-linear $S$-matrix identities obtained by imposing unitarity imply those
needed to derive the renormalization group equations. As a proof of principle,
we verify this conjecture to all loops at the leading and subleading
logarithmic order in the four-dimensional massless $\lambda\phi^4$ theory using
on-shell techniques, without reference to any counterterms or Feynman diagrams.

### [19] [$λφ^4$ as an Effective Theory in de Sitter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25826)
*Sebastian Cespedes,Zhehan Qin,Dong-Gang Wang*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: EFTs are powerful tools for describing UV physics, but scalar fields in de Sitter space exhibit new phenomena when the cutoff is below the horizon scale. This paper explores effective theories with a variable cutoff linked to an integrated-out hidden sector, analyzing tree- and loop-level matching between the effective λφ⁴ theory and UV realizations. Results show that the theory remains unitary when the cutoff is much larger than H, but becomes a mixed state and diffusive when the cutoff is lower. At leading order, the EFT remains local and reproduces the same effective quartic coefficient. Loop corrections lead to a sign flip in the quartic coupling, consistent with stochastic formalism predictions. Non-unitary effects play a significant role in cosmological EFTs and their validity is illustrated within and beyond perturbation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of effective field theories in different cosmological scenarios, particularly in de Sitter space, is crucial for addressing fundamental questions in high-energy physics and cosmology. This paper aims to explore the implications of varying the cutoff scale in scalar field theories and its impact on the unitarity and validity of the effective description.

Method: The authors employ a systematic approach, starting with the construction of effective theories with variable cutoffs linked to an integrated-out hidden sector. They perform analytic computations at tree- and loop-level to match the effective λφ⁴ theory with possible UV realizations. The analysis includes both unitary and non-unitary regimes, with a focus on the cutoff dependence of the effective quartic coupling and its implications for the theory's unitarity.

Result: The key findings of this paper are as follows: 1) When the cutoff is much larger than the horizon scale H, the effective theory remains unitary. 2) When the cutoff is lowered below H, the system evolves into a mixed state, and diffusive effects emerge. 3) At leading order, the EFT remains local and reproduces the same effective quartic coefficient as in the unitary regime. 4) Loop corrections lead to a sign flip in the quartic coupling, aligning with results from the stochastic formalism. 5) These findings highlight the role of non-unitary effects in cosmological EFTs and illustrate their validity within and beyond perturbation theory.

Conclusion: This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of effective field theories with variable cutoffs in de Sitter space, shedding light on the interplay between unitarity, non-unitarity, and the validity of effective descriptions in cosmological scenarios. The results emphasize the importance of considering non-unitary effects in understanding the behavior of scalar field theories in expanding universes and provide a valuable framework for future studies in this area.

Abstract: Effective field theories (EFTs) provide a powerful framework to parametrise
unknown aspects of possible ultraviolet (UV) physics. For scalar fields in de
Sitter space, however, new emergent phenomena can arise when the cut-off scale
of the theory lies below the horizon scale $H$, as seen in the stochastic
formalism of inflation. In this work, we study EFTs that, at leading order,
reproduce the standard quartic theory in de Sitter, but with a variable cut-off
identified with the mass of an integrated-out hidden sector. We perform the
complete analytic computation for the tree- and loop-level matching between the
effective $\lambda\phi^4$ theory and two possible UV realisations. We find that
when the cut-off is much larger than the horizon, the theory admits a unitary
description, up to exponentially suppressed corrections. In contrast, when the
cut-off is lowered below $H$, the system evolves into a mixed state and
diffusive effects emerge. Nevertheless, at leading order, the EFT remains local
and reproduces the same effective quartic coefficient as in the unitary regime.
Furthermore, for the EFT matching at the loop-level, the effective quartic
coupling changes sign and becomes negative as the cut-off decreases, in
agreement with the result obtained from the stochastic formalism. In general,
for cosmological EFTs, our findings highlight the role of non-unitary effects
and illustrate their regimes of validity, within and beyond perturbation
theory.

Abstract: The short-distance singular structure of the two-point function of a free
scalar field in curved spacetime has a universal behavior that characterizes
well-behaved states (called Hadamard states). This includes a non-analytic term
proportional to the Ricci scalar curvature known as the Hadamard tail. This is
usually derived by solving a differential equation for the Green's function of
a Klein-Gordon field in curved spacetime. We present an alternative derivation
which leverages the equivalence principles and makes use of perturbative field
theory methods. This allows for the computation of the short-distance singular
behavior of correlators of QFTs in curved space, including for interacting
field theories, where the traditional Green's function strategy cannot be
easily generalized. As an example, we apply these ideas to the two-point
function of two scalar primary operators of an arbitrary Conformal Field Theory
placed in an arbitrary curved background.

Abstract: Gravity and gauge theory are concretely linked by the double copy. Although

its associated thermal spectrum, and horizon-dependence, emerges from the

*Arvin Shahbazi-Moghaddam*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: How singularities behave is unclear. A proof of the generalized second law (GSL) in holographic brane-world models at the species scale $cG$ non-perturbatively constrains singularity resolution without evading Penrose's criteria. Explicit examples: BTZ black holes evolve to worse singularities, while null singularities on the Rindler horizon resolve due to species-scale effects. Under the GSL, similar constraints apply beyond brane-worlds to any theory with a geometric ultraviolet (UV) scale where classical general relativity breaks down.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding spacetime singularities and their resolution within the framework of general relativity and quantum mechanics is a fundamental problem in theoretical physics.

Method: Holographic brane-world models and explicit examples of black hole solutions (e.g., BTZ black hole) are used to demonstrate the validity of the generalized second law (GSL) at the species scale $cG$.

Result: The proof of the generalized second law (GSL) in holographic brane-world models at the species scale $cG$ allows for non-perturbative constraints on singularity resolution.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for further studies on singularity resolution mechanisms within and beyond brane-world models, emphasizing the role of the generalized second law in constraining such processes.

Abstract: What happens at spacetime singularities is poorly understood. The
Penrose-Wall singularity theorem constrains possible scenarios, but until
recently its key assumption--the generalized second law (GSL)--had only been
proven perturbatively, severely limiting this application. We highlight that
recent progress enables a proof of the GSL in holographic brane-world models,
valid non-perturbatively at the species scale $cG$ (with $c$ the number of
matter fields and $G$ Newton's constant). This enables genuine constraints: an
outer-trapped surface in the Einstein gravity regime implies geodesic
incompleteness non-perturbatively at the species scale. Conversely, any genuine
resolution must evade Penrose's criteria. We illustrate both possibilities with
explicit examples: the classical BTZ black hole evolves to a more severe
singularity, while a null singularity on the Rindler horizon is resolved, both
by species-scale effects. Subject to the GSL, these constraints on singularity
resolution apply beyond brane-worlds: namely, in any theory with a geometric UV
scale--roughly, where the metric remains well-defined but classical Einstein
gravity breaks down.

### [29] [Equivalent class of Emergent Single Weyl Fermion in 3d Topological States: gapless superconductors and superfluids Vs chiral fermions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25959)
*Gabriel Meyniel,Fei Zhou*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: We propose a method to construct 3D lattice models with a single Weyl cone by leveraging spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking, avoiding the usual no-go theorem, and explore three pathways involving fermionic topological symmetry-protected states (SPTs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to circumvent the no-go theorem for a single Weyl cone in 3D lattices while exploring pathways that preserve topological order and symmetry, specifically through the use of SPTs and symmetry-breaking fields.

Method: The method involves three paths: (a) inducing a gapless topological quantum critical point with a change in winding number $
u = 2$ by breaking $T$-symmetry from a gapped SPT, (b) generating gapless nodal points by applying $T$-symmetry breaking fields to an SPT, and (c) a hybrid approach combining (a) and (b).

Result: The result shows that all studied lattice models with a single Weyl fermion are equivalent to topological quantum critical points in DIII class topological superconductors or their dual superconducting nodal point phases, forming an equivalent class with protected topological order.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that this approach provides a route to realizing 3D lattice models with a single Weyl cone while respecting topological protection through symmetry-breaking mechanisms in SPTs and superconductors.

Abstract: In this article, we put forward a practical but generic approach towards
constructing a large family of $(3+1)$ dimension lattice models which can
naturally lead to a single Weyl cone in the infrared (IR) limit. Our proposal
relies on spontaneous charge $U(1)$ symmetry breaking to evade the usual no-go
theorem of a single Weyl cone in a 3d lattice. We have explored three concrete
paths in this approach, all involving fermionic topological symmetry protected
states (SPTs). Path a) is to push a gapped SPT in a 3d lattice with
time-reversal symmetry (or $T$-symmetry) to a gapless topological quantum
critical point (tQCP) which involves a minimum change of topologies,i.e.
$\delta N_w=2$ where $\delta N_w$ is the change of winding numbers across the
tQCP. Path b) is to peal off excessive degrees of freedom in the gapped SPT via
applying $T$-symmetry breaking fields which naturally result in a pair of
gapless nodal points of real fermions. Path c) is a hybrid of a) and b) where
tQCPs, with $\delta N_w \geq 2$, are further subject to time-reversal-symmetry
breaking actions. In the infrared limit, all the lattice models with single
Weyl fermions studied here are isomorphic to either a tQCP in a DIII class
topological superconductor with a protecting $T$-symmetry, or its dual, a
$T$-symmetry breaking superconducting nodal point phase, and therefore form an
equivalent class. For a generic $T$-symmetric tQCP along Path a), the
conserved-charge operators span a six-dimensional linear space while for a
$T$-symmetry breaking gapless state along Path b), c), charge operators
typically span a two-dimensional linear space instead. Finally, we pinpoint
connections between three spatial dimensional lattice chiral fermion models and
gapless real fermions that can naturally appear in superfluids or
superconductors studied previously.

Abstract: We develop a fully covariant, analytic framework for Josephson phenomena in
static curved spacetimes and specialize it to the Schwarzschild exterior. The
formulation rests on two invariant elements: the gauge-invariant condensate
momentum that governs phase dynamics and the conserved current whose
hypersurface flux encodes transport for an observer at infinity. Using the
timelike Killing field to relate proper and asymptotic quantities, we derive a
redshifted AC Josephson law in which the asymptotic phase-evolution rate is
proportional to the difference of redshifted voltage drops, i.e. to $V_i^\infty
\equiv \alpha_i V_i^{\rm proper}$; equivalently, it depends on $\alpha_i
V_i^{\rm proper}$ for local control. Under RF drive specified at infinity, the
Shapiro-step loci are invariant (expressed in asymptotic voltages) while
propagation phases set any apparent lobe translation. For DC transport, a
short-junction solution on a static slice yields the proper current-phase
relation; mapping to asymptotic observables gives a single-power redshift
scaling of critical currents, $I_{c,\infty}\propto \alpha I_c^{\rm proper}$,
whereas power scales as $P_\infty\propto \alpha^2 P_{\rm proper}$. In a
"vertical" dc-SQUID with junctions at different radii, gravity does not shift
the DC interference pattern at linear order; it produces a small envelope
deformation and an amplitude rescaling. Gravity does not alter the local
Josephson microphysics; it reshapes the clocks and energy accounting that
define measurements at infinity. The resulting predictions are gauge- and
coordinate-invariant, operationally stated in terms of an experimenter who can
control (proper vs. asymptotic bias), and remain analytic from the weak-field
regime to the near-horizon limit.

Abstract: We derive new families of quantum null energy inequalities (QNEIs), i.e.
bounds on integrated null energy, in quantum field theories in two and higher
dimensions. These are universal, state-independent lower bounds on semi-local
integrals of $\langle T_{vv} \rangle$, the energy-momentum flux in a null
direction, and the first of this kind for interacting theories in higher
dimensions. Our ingredients include the quantum null energy condition (QNEC),
strong subadditivity of von Neumann entropies, defect operator expansions, and
the vacuum modular Hamiltonians of null intervals and strips. These results are
fundamental constraints on null energy in quantum field theories.

Motivation: 研究额外维度的几何对强子引力理论中的能量动量张量UV依赖性的影响，探讨不同自旋场在额外维度中的行为差异以及如何实现能量动量张量的抵消。

Method: 研究了多种标量和旋度场在任意维度下的传播，计算了5维传播函数，并分析了能量动量张量的UV依赖性随额外维度坐标y的变化。通过构建额外维度的几何模型，测试不同背景下自我能动的抵消可能性。

Result: 只有当额外维度为平直或AdS空间时，才能在能量动量张量UV依赖性中实现玻色子和费米子贡献的抵消。这表明平直或AdS空间是能量上较为有利的选择，这在额外维度的动态中导致了空间必须为平直或AdS。

Conclusion: 分析表明，为了实现能量动量张量UV发散的抵消，额外维度必须是平直或AdS空间。这可能暗示额外维度的动力学限制了空间的几何结构为最energetic有利的选项。

Abstract: We discuss the cancellation of the ultraviolet cutoff scale $\Lambda_{\rm
cut}$ in the calculation of the expectation value of the five-dimensional (5D)
energy-momentum tensor $\langle T_{MN}\rangle$ ($M,N=0,1,\cdots,4$). Since 5D
fields feel the background geometry differently depending on their spins, the
bosonic and the fermionic contributions to the $\Lambda_{\rm cut}$-dependent
part $\langle T_{MN}\rangle^{\rm UV}$ may have different profiles in the extra
dimension. In that case, there is no chance for them to be cancelled with each
other. We consider arbitrary numbers of scalar and spinor fields with arbitrary
bulk masses, calculate $\langle T_{MN}\rangle$ using the 5D propagators, and
clarify the dependence of $\langle T_{MN}\rangle^{\rm UV}$ on the
extra-dimensional coordinate $y$ for a general background geometry of the extra
dimension. We find that if the geometry is not flat nor (a slice of) anti-de
Sitter (AdS) space, it is impossible to cancel $\langle T_{MN}\rangle^{\rm UV}$
between the bosonic and the fermionic contributions. This may suggest that the
flat (or AdS) space is energetically favored over the other geometries, and
thus the dynamics forces the compact space to be flat (or AdS).

Abstract: The dual formulations of an infinite tower of tree-level soft theorems in
asymptotically flat spacetimes for scattering amplitudes in the standard
energy-momentum basis and for correlators of a 2D celestial conformal field
theory imply a correspondence between the celestial operator product expansion
(OPE) and the higher spin charge bracket. We apply such correspondence to
provide first a prescription to solve the double-soft limit ambiguity in the
mixed-helicity sector of celestial OPEs. Furthermore, demanding the charge
OPE/bracket correspondence to remain valid when operators are shadow
transformed, we construct an algorithm to compute shadow celestial OPEs. We
first test the algorithm by recovering results in the previous literature
involving the celestial energy-momentum tensor; we then apply it to both
gravity and Yang-Mills theory and generalize the OPE derivation to arbitrary
spins.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work, we study the classical phase space for the gravitational
degrees of freedom along a null ray. We construct gauge-invariant observables
localized on a null ray segment that commute with those localized on the
complement; thus, the phase space describes a genuine gravitational subsystem
compatible with both locality and diffeomorphism invariance. Our construction
employs 'dressing time' (a null time coordinate built from spin 0 gravitational
degrees of freedom) as a dynamical reference frame. The existence of such a
frame depends on the use of edge mode variables, which we argue are generally
required to upgrade a local gauge-fixing condition to a global 'frame-fixing'.
To analyze the effects of quantum diffeomorphism anomalies on these structures,
we then establish an 'effective' classical description in which the
Raychaudhuri equation, symplectic form, and edge mode variables all acquire
Virasoro-type deformations. Within this framework, we identify three distinct
diffeomorphism actions: reparametrizations (gauge transformations),
reorientations (physical symmetries of the reference frame), and dressed
reparametrizations. Each acquires its own central extension and plays a
different crucial role in the effective theory. The resulting structures
provide a foundation for quantizing gravitational null ray segments, including
promoting dressing time to a genuine quantum reference frame.

*Alexander Soloviev*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: We demonstrate the existence of a hydrodynamic attractor in the Mueller-Israel-Stewart framework for a fluid in a specific hyperbolic geometry related to dS₃×ℝ, showing how hydrodynamics emerges at late times even when the Knudsen number exceeds unity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding fluid dynamics in various spacetime geometries can help us model high-energy physics phenomena, such as the behavior of quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions.

Method: We used the Mueller-Israel-Stewart equations within the context of non-conformal fluid dynamics, analyzing solutions in a hyperbolic slicing of dS₃×ℝ spacetime.

Result: Typical solutions approach a hydrodynamic attractor rapidly at late times, unlike Gubser flow where both the Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers become small at intermediate times.

Conclusion: This study opens new avenues for applying hydrodynamic attractors to systems with non-trivial geometries, such as those encountered in high-energy particle physics experiments.

Abstract: We report on the existence of a hydrodynamic attractor in the
Mueller-Israel-Stewart framework of a fluid living in the novel geometry
discovered recently by Grozdanov. This geometry, corresponding to a hyperbolic
slicing of dS$_3\times\mathbb{R}$, complements previous analyses of attractors
in Bjorken (flat slicing) and Gubser (spherical slicing) flows. The fluid
behaves like a sharply localized droplet propagating rapidly along the
lightcone, reminiscent of wounded nuclei in the CGC picture. Typical solutions
approach the hydrodynamic attractor rapidly at late times despite a Knudsen
number exceeding unity, suggesting that the inverse Reynolds number captures
hydrodynamization more faithfully since the shear stress vanishes at late
times. This is in stark contrast to Gubser flow, which has both the Knudsen and
inverse Reynolds number becoming small for intermediate times. We close with a
comparison to Weyl-transformed Bjorken flow and discuss possible
phenomenological applications.

Abstract: We compute the ladder operators for static tidal perturbations to
higher-dimensional black holes. These operators map between solutions of the
relevant equation of motion at different multipole orders. We focus on spin 0,
1 and 2 perturbations to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole and on spin 0
perturbations to the 5D Myers-Perry black hole. The ladder structure, used in
conjunction with the existence of special ground state solutions, explains why
the Love numbers of these higher-dimensional black holes vanish for specific
combinations of the multipole moment and number of spacetime dimensions. This
generalizes previous work on a ladder symmetry explanation for the vanishing of
4D black hole static Love numbers to higher dimensions.

*Shu-Yu Li,Xian Gao*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores spatially covariant vector field theories losing Lorentz and U(1) symmetries, leading to a specific number of degrees of freedom. The analysis identifies conditions to reduce the degrees of freedom, classifying the theories into three types based on their constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the degrees of freedom in gauge theories is crucial for exploring their behavior and potential applications in physics, especially when symmetries are broken.

Method: The authors employ a Hamiltonian constraint analysis to identify conditions that eliminate one longitudinal mode, reducing the degrees of freedom from three to two. They classify the theories into three types based on the nature of constraints.

Result: The paper successfully classifies the theories into three distinct types and recovers the Maxwell theory as a special case of Type-III theories.

Conclusion: The classification provides a comprehensive understanding of how Lorentz and U(1) symmetry breaking affects vector field theories and their degrees of freedom.

Abstract: We investigate a class of spatially covariant vector field theories on a flat
background, where the Lagrangians are constructed as polynomials of first-order
derivatives of the vector field. Because Lorentz and $\mathrm{U}(1)$
invariances are broken, such theories generally propagate three degrees of
freedom (DOFs): two transverse modes and one longitudinal mode. We examine the
conditions under which the additional longitudinal mode is eliminated so that
only two DOFs remain. To this end, we perform a Hamiltonian constraint analysis
and identify two necessary and sufficient degeneracy conditions that reduce the
number of DOFs from three to two. We find three classes of solutions satisfying
these degeneracy conditions, corresponding to distinct types of theories.
Type-I theories possess one first-class and two second-class constraints,
type-II theories have four second-class constraints, and type-III theories
contain two first-class constraints. The Maxwell theory is recovered as a
special case of the type-III theories, where Lorentz symmetry is restored.

Abstract: In this letter we show that the one-loop QCD $\beta$-function can be obtained
from an index theorem on twistor space. This is achieved by recalling that the
$\theta$-angle of self-dual gauge theory flows according the one-loop
$\beta$-function. Rewriting self-dual gauge theory as a holomorphic theory on
twistor space this flow can be computed as the anomaly to scale invariance. The
one-loop Weyl anomaly coefficient $a-c$ can be recovered similarly.

Abstract: We study wavepackets that propagate across (a) topological interfaces in

nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such
a defect by identifying its Hilbert space with the virtual bond dimension of
the matrix product operator representing defect lines. Our work both gives an
operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue
of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory.

Abstract: Tritium plays a critical role in nuclear fusion power plant designs and dryer
beds are an essential tool for managing tritiated water vapor. A series of
tests were performed to investigate the ability of a saturated dryer to
preferentially adsorb heavy water vapor. The design of passive tritiated
control systems is feasible by utilizing a dryer's ability to preferentially
trap heavier isotopologues of water. This work investigates this displacement
phenomenon and the effect of the heavy water humidity on the dryers
performance. Significant displacement was observed when a humid stream of heavy
water was diverted through a dryer pre-saturated with light water, as indicated
by changes in the partial pressures of $D_2O$ and $H_2O$. After the capture of
heavy water in the bed, the subsequent rise in $D_2O$ partial pressure depended
on the humidity of heavy water in the gas stream. Higher humidity values lead
to faster and steeper mass transfer profiles in the dryer, which could be
empirically fit with sigmoid curves.

Conclusion: 高压处理对压力传感器性能影响有限。

Abstract: In certain applications, pressure transducers may be exposed to high

functionality afterwards. We compared the performance of two MKS
Granville-Phillips 390 Micro-Ion Gauges against each other, one that had been
exposed to 10,000 Torr and the other had never been exposed to pressures above
1000 Torr. Our results show that the differences in the readings between the
gauges were within the range of uncertainty specified by the manufacturer
indicating negligible impact due to the exposure to high pressure.
Additionally, the high pressure exposure did not compromise the leak integrity
of the gauge.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel monolithic pixel sensor called H2M, which integrates analog front-end (AFE) and digital pulse processing into a compact design to address backside thinning challenges while maintaining MIP detection performance. The H2M sensor achieves a MIP detection efficiency of 99% at 205 electrons with a maximum fake-hit rate of 1/500 ns frame, demonstrating performance comparable to fully-analog sensors. Backside thinning is shown to reduce material costs without degrading detection efficiency, even at a chip thickness of 21 micrometers. Circuit simulations and a compact digital cell library are developed to optimize future chip submissions. The results are validated through laboratory and test beam measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for cost-effective yet high-performance imaging sensors in various applications, such as X-ray and CT imaging, necessitates innovative approaches to address challenges in sensor design and manufacturing.

Method: The research employs a combination of digital-on-top design methodology, modified CMOS manufacturing processes, and a compact digital cell library to integrate AFE and digital pulse processing onto a single chip. Performance evaluation includes laboratory measurements, test beam simulations, and circuit simulations. Additionally, a Monte Carlo simulation approach is used to investigate and model the behavior of the sensor.

Result: The H2M sensor demonstrates a significant reduction in material budget through backside thinning, achieving the same MIP detection performance as fully-analog sensors. The non-uniform in-pixel response is attributed to local potential wells in low electric field regions, and circuit simulations successfully model and mitigate this behavior.

Conclusion: The H2M sensor represents a promising solution for compact, high-performance imaging sensors. Backside thinning enables material budget optimization without compromising detection performance, making it suitable for cost-sensitive applications. The integration of AFE and digital pulse processing, along with advanced simulation tools, paves the way for future advancements in monolithic pixel sensor design.

Abstract: The H2M (Hybrid-to-Monolithic) is a monolithic pixel sensor manufactured in a
modified \SI{65}{\nano\meter}~CMOS imaging process with a small collection
electrode. Its design addresses the challenges of porting an existing hybrid
pixel detector architecture into a monolithic chip, using a digital-on-top
design methodology, and developing a compact digital cell library. Each square
pixel integrates an analog front-end and digital pulse processing with an 8-bit
counter within a \SI{35}{\micro\meter}~pitch.
  This contribution presents the performance of H2M based on laboratory and
test beam measurements, including a comparison with analog front-end
simulations in terms of gain and noise. A particular emphasis is placed on
backside thinning in order to reduce material budget, down to a total chip
thickness of \SI{21}{\micro\meter} for which no degradation in MIP detection
performance is observed. For all investigated samples, a MIP detection
efficiency above \SI{99}{\%} is achieved below a threshold of approximately 205
electrons. At this threshold, the fake-hit rate corresponds to a matrix
occupancy of fewer than one pixel per the \SI{500}{\nano\second}~frame.
  Measurements reveal a non-uniform in-pixel response, attributed to the
formation of local potential wells in regions with low electric field. A
simulation flow combining technology computer-aided design, Monte Carlo, and
circuit simulations is used to investigate and describe this behavior, and is
applied to develop mitigation strategies for future chip submissions with
similar features.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种非干涉型电光张量成像方法（iDTT），用于定量重建晶体材料中的三维电光张量，无需破坏性实验和传统的具有破坏性的仪器设施，能够实现三维的3D信息的非破坏性测量。

Motivation: 随着对晶体材料和复杂材料特性需求的增加，传统的X射线衍射和电子显微镜等方法在 HAVE to specialize facilities 和提供完整的三维信息方面有其局限性。因此，开发一种无需破坏性实验且能提供完整三维信息的非破坏性成像方法成为一个重要的研究课题。

Abstract: Biaxial anisotropy, arising from distinct optical responses along three
principal directions, underlies the complex structure of many crystalline,
polymeric, and biological materials. However, existing techniques such as X-ray
diffraction and electron microscopy require specialized facilities or
destructive preparation and cannot provide full three-dimensional (3D)
information. Here we introduce incoherent dielectric tensor tomography (iDTT),
a non-interferometric optical imaging method that quantitatively reconstructs
the 3D dielectric tensor under incoherent, polarization-diverse illumination.
By combining polarization diversity and angular-spectrum modulation, iDTT
achieves speckle-free and vibration-robust mapping of biaxial birefringence
with submicron resolution. Simulations and experiments on uniaxial and biaxial
samples validate its quantitative accuracy. Applied to mixed and
polycrystalline materials, iDTT distinguishes crystal types by their
birefringent properties and reveals 3D grain orientations and boundaries. This
approach establishes iDTT as a practical and accessible tool for quantitative,
label-free characterization of biaxial anisotropy in diverse materials.

TL;DR: A new imaging method for thyroid FNAB improves diagnostic precision by integrating refractive index maps with color cytology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thyroid FNAB has limitations in staining variability and subcellular contrast, which hinder its diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Developed a refractive index-correlated pseudocoloring (RICP) framework combining digital micromirror device-based holography (HT) with RGB LED illumination.

Result: RICP enhances contrast, preserves color fidelity, and enables quantitative analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic features for better diagnosis.

Conclusion: This method bridges conventional color cytology with quantitative optical imaging, improving diagnostic precision in thyroid pathology.

Abstract: Conventional bright-field (BF) cytology of thyroid fine-needle aspiration
biopsy (FNAB) suffers from staining variability and limited subcellular
contrast. Here, we present a refractive index-correlated pseudocoloring (RICP)
framework that integrates quantitative refractive index (RI) maps obtained by
holotomography (HT) with color BF images to enhance diagnostic
interpretability. The imaging platform combines a digital micromirror device
(DMD)-based HT system with an RGB LED illumination module, enabling
simultaneous acquisition of RI tomograms and BF images from PAP-stained thyroid
samples. The RICP algorithm adaptively embeds RI-derived structural information
into the least-occupied hue channel, preserving color fidelity while enhancing
nuclear and cytoplasmic contrast. Applied to benign and malignant thyroid
clusters, RICP revealed diagnostically relevant features such as nucleoli,
lipid droplets, and nuclear irregularities, and hue-saturation analysis
quantitatively differentiated cytological categories. This perceptually
grounded, label-free framework bridges conventional color cytology and
quantitative optical imaging for improved diagnostic precision.

TL;DR: Pink-beam Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy (pDFXM) trading higher angular resolution for increased diffraction intensity depending on sample deformation, suitable for scenarios requiring integrated intensities rather than axial strain mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  microscopy techniques are widely used in material science for studying microstructures and deformation, this paper compares pDFXM with traditional DFXM providing insights into their relative performance and applications

Method:  The paper presents a systematic analysis comparing pDFXM and DFXM using analytical expressions, numerical simulations, and experimental data focusing on resolution, diffraction intensity, and angular degradation due to crystal deformation

Result:  pDFXM shows increased diffraction intensity under sample deformation but tenfold degradation in angular resolution along certain directions, chromatic aberrations are absent for perfect crystals but significant under condensed illumination, weak-beam conditions remain feasible with potential for improved signal-to-noise ratio, and higher incident flux leads to notable beam heating effects

Conclusion:  The trade-offs between resolution and intensity in pDFXM make it suitable for specific applications requiring intensity measurements while acknowledging limitations in axial strain mapping.

Abstract: Pink-beam Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy (pDFXM) is a powerful emerging
technique for time-resolved studies of microstructure and strain evolution in
bulk crystalline materials. In this work, we systematically assess the
performance of pDFXM relative to monochromatic DFXM when using a compound
refractive lens (CRL) as the objective. Analytical expressions for the spatial
and angular resolution are derived and compared with numerical simulations
based on geometrical optics and experimental data. The pink-beam configuration
provides an increased diffraction intensity depending on the deformation state
of the sample, accompanied by a general tenfold degradation in angular
resolution along the rocking and longitudinal directions. This trade-off is
disadvantageous for axial strain mapping, but can be advantageous in cases
where integrated intensities are needed. For a perfect crystal under parallel
illumination with a pink beam, our results show that chromatic aberration is
absent, whereas under condensed illumination it becomes significant. The
aberration is shown to depend strongly on the local distortion of the crystal.
Weak-beam imaging conditions, such as those required for resolving
dislocations, are shown to remain feasible under pink-beam operation and may
even provide an improved signal-to-noise ratio. The higher incident flux,
enhanced by nearly two orders of magnitude, is quantified in terms of beam
heating effects, and implications for optimized scanning protocols are
discussed.

TL;DR: The paper compares two post-compression techniques, HCF and MPC, used to improve the efficiency and quality of femtosecond laser pulses. HCF achieves better efficiency and improved beam quality, while MPC shows similar results. Both techniques are effective for generating high-quality extreme ultraviolet sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is likely to explore methods for improving the efficiency and quality of high-power femtosecond laser systems, which are important for various applications in science and industry.

Method: The method involves using a high-power ytterbium-doped fiber laser to generate pulses and apply both HCF and MPC techniques. The performance of each technique is evaluated through numerical simulations, spatial wavefront analysis, and measurements of photon flux.

Result: HCF produces 27 fs pulses with >50% efficiency, while MPC achieves 34 fs pulses with >88% efficiency. Spatial wavefront analysis shows that HCF acts as a modal filter, improving beam quality, whereas MPC introduces aberrations due to cumulative mirror errors. Photon flux characterization reveals that both techniques enhance high harmonic generation.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that post-compression techniques based on self-phase modulation are effective for boosting the intensity of femtosecond laser systems. Additionally, the paper suggests that further improvement in spatial wavefront quality could be achieved using HCF as a single compressor or output component of a cascade compressor.

Abstract: We compared the performance of two post-compression techniques, a gas-filled
hollow-core fiber (HCF) and a multi-pass cell (MPC), using a high-power
ytterbium-doped fiber laser. The HCF produced 27 fs pulses from 230 fs inputs
at >50% efficiency, whereas the MPC achieved 34 fs pulses with significantly
higher efficiency (>88%). Both results aligned well with numerical simulations.
Crucially, spatial wavefront analysis revealed that the HCF acts as a modal
filter, improving beam quality, whereas the MPC introduces aberrations through
cumulative mirror errors. Furthermore, we characterize the photon flux of high
harmonic generation driven by the post-compressed pulses from the HCF and MPC.
These finding highlights that post-compression technique based on self-phase
modulation is efficient for the intensity boosting of femtosecond laser system,
providing opportunities for generating high quality extreme ultraviolet (XUV)
sources. In addition, further improvement of spatial wavefront quality is
suggested using the HCF as a single compressor or output component of the
cascade compressor.

Conclusion: 通过该方法，可以高效制备高质量的光子器件，为量子技术和紧凑光子电路奠定了基础。

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides are pivotal for
next-generation photonic devices due to their exceptional optical properties
and strong light-matter interactions. However, their atomic thinness renders
them susceptible to damage during nanoscale fabrication. Focused ion beam
technology, while offering precise defect engineering for tailoring
optoelectronic properties, often induces collateral damage far beyond the
target region, compromising device performance. This study addresses the
critical challenge of preserving the intrinsic optical characteristics of 2D
TMDCs during FIB patterning. We demonstrate that conventional dielectric
encapsulation fails to protect 2D TMDCs from gallium ion-induced damage,
leading to persistent defects and quenched optical responses in patterned
microstructures. In contrast, polymeric encapsulation with PMMA (polymethyl
methacrylate) effectively mitigates damage by acting as a sacrificial layer
that absorbs ion impact, thereby preserving the optical properties of the
underlying TMDC. Furthermore, we leverage XeF2-assisted Ga ion beam direct
patterning, which significantly reduces collateral damage, minimizes Ga ion
implantation, and enables precise anisotropic material removal, yielding
ultra-smooth sidewalls critical for high-quality photonic resonators. This
combined approach of PMMA encapsulation and XeF2-assisted FIB patterning offers
a robust, cost-effective, and scalable single-step fabrication route for
integrating 2D TMDCs into high-performance photonic devices, thereby
maintaining their intrinsic optical functionality essential for advancing
quantum technologies and compact optical circuits.

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: HIV capsids can pass through nuclear pores despite their size due to their surface properties and physical interactions. Wetting and capillarity models explain their movement by reorienting, confinement effects, translocation mechanics, and symmetry-breaking energetics, all influenced by their shape.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how HIV enters the nucleus is crucial for developing antiretroviral therapy and preventing infection. This study aims to uncover the physical mechanisms behind this process.

Method: The study used analytical models of wetting and capillarity combined with numerical simulations of sharp and diffuse-interface approaches to study HIV capsid dynamics in nuclear pores.

Result: The research found that HIV capsids reorient during entry due to asymmetric forces, confinement limits penetration, translocation mechanics depend on structural changes, and symmetry-breaking affects energy requirements. These findings highlight the importance of capsid geometry.

Conclusion: A physical basis for HIV's capsid shape emerges from its ability to navigate nuclear pores through these mechanisms, offering insights into its infectivity and potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: The protective capsid encasing the genetic material of Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) has been shown to traverse the nuclear pore complex (NPC) intact,
despite exceeding the passive diffusion threshold by over three orders of
magnitude. This remarkable feat is attributed to the properties of the capsid
surface, which confer solubility within the NPC's phase-separated,
condensate-like barrier. In this context, we apply the classical framework of
wetting and capillarity -- integrating analytical methods with sharp- and
diffuse-interface numerical simulations -- to elucidate the physical
underpinnings of HIV nuclear entry. Our analysis captures several key
phenomena: the reorientation of incoming capsids due to torques arising from
asymmetric capillary forces; the role of confinement in limiting capsid
penetration depths; the classification of translocation mechanics according to
changes in topology and interfacial area; and the influence of (spontaneous)
rotational symmetry-breaking on energetics. These effects are all shown to
depend critically on capsid geometry, arguing for a physical basis for HIV's
characteristic capsid shape.

Abstract: The disorder operator, as an easily measured non-local observable, displays
great potential in detecting intrinsic information of field theories. It has
been systematically studied in 1d and 2d quantum systems, while the knowledge
of 3d is still limited. The disorder operator associated with U(1) global
symmetry exhibits rich geometric dependence on the shape of the spatial region
at a quantum critical point, meanwhile, (3+1)D is the upper critical dimension
for O(N) criticalities, both of which pose a challenge for exploring the
disorder operator in high dimensions. In this work, we investigate the scaling
behaviors of disorder operators in (3+1)D O(3) models through large-scale
quantum Monte Carlo simulation combined with theoretical analysis. The
universal contributions, such as the current central charge, have been revealed
in our calculation, which establishes a concrete link between lattice
simulations and continuum field theory. This work opens new avenues for
experimental and numerical exploration of universal properties at quantum
critical points in (3+1)D models.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper presents a study on the Mott transition, showing that a $f Z_2$ symmetry-breaking in momentum space leads to universal scaling in the charge gap and compressibility. The Widom line temperature obeys universal scaling independent of lattice geometry, and the computational approach validates predictions for cold-atom systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding universal scaling behaviors in quantum phase transitions, particularly in the Mott transition, is key to explaining material properties and phase behavior in condensed matter physics.

Method: Numerical analysis of the Hubbard model on various lattice structures, employing computational approaches to validate theoretical predictions.

Result: The study finds universal scaling in charge gap, compressibility's order parameter, Widom line temperature, and confirms predictions for the Hubbard model using cold-atom simulations.

Conclusion: The $f Z_2$ universality explains the observed scaling behaviors in the Mott transition, corroborated by computational evidence for cold-atom systems.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the Mott transition exhibits universal scaling as a
consequence of the breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in momentum space. A
direct consequence of this discrete symmetry breaking is the charge or Mott gap
itself. From extensive numerics, we proffer that it is the charge
compressibility that acts as the underlying order parameter as it is zero in
the insulator and non-zero in the metallic state. Additionally, the Widom line
(temperature of the extremum of the compressibility) obeys a universal scaling
of $T_m=0.39U$ deep into the insulating state directly from $Z_2$ universality.
Furthermore, the temperature at which the second derivative of the
compressibility has a minimum is independent of lattice geometry, exhibiting a
universal scaling of $|U-U_c|^\alpha$ where $\alpha\approx 1$. Finally, our
computational approach reproduces the key features of the doping dependence of
the compressibility demonstrated in recent cold-atom quantum simulators of the
Hubbard model, thereby corroborating our conclusions on $\mathbb{Z}_2$
universality.

Abstract: Arrays of semiconductor quantum dots provide a powerful platform to design
correlated quantum matter from the bottom up. We establish a predictive
framework for engineering local electron pairing in these artificial molecules
by systematically deploying three control levers: lattice geometry, orbital
hybridization, and external electric fields. Using Hartree-Fock simulations on
canonical 3D clusters from the tetrahedron (Z = 3) to the FCC lattice (Z = 12),
at and near half-filling, we uncover three fundamental design principles. (i)
Geometric Hierarchy: The resilience to Coulomb repulsion U is dictated by the
coordination number Z, which controls kinetic delocalization. (ii) Orbital
Hybridization: Counter-intuitively, inter-orbital hopping t_orb acts not as a
simple suppressor of pairing, but as a sophisticated control knob that enhances
double occupancy at moderate U by engineering the on-site energy landscape.
(iii) Field Squeezing: An electric field robustly induces pairing by forcing
charge localization, an effect most potent in low-connectivity clusters. These
principles form a blueprint for deterministically targeting charge and spin
correlations in quantum-dot-based quantum hardware.

Abstract: We generalize the Hyperbolic Fracton Model from the $\{5,4\}$ tessellation to
generic tessellations, and investigate its core properties: subsystem
symmetries, fracton mobility, and holographic correspondence. While the model
on the original tessellation has features reminiscent of the flat-space lattice
cases, the generalized tessellations exhibit a far richer and more intricate
structure. The ground-state degeneracy and subsystem symmetries are generated
recursively layer-by-layer, through the inflation rule, but without a simple,
uniform pattern. The fracton excitations follow exponential-in-distance and
algebraic-in-lattice-size growing patterns when moving outward, and depend
sensitively to the tessellation geometry, differing qualitatively from both
type-I or type-II fracton model on flat lattices. Despite this increased
complexity, the hallmark holographic features -- subregion duality via Rindler
reconstruction, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for mutual information, and
effective black hole entropy scaling with horizon area -- remain valid. These
results demonstrate that the holographic correspondence in fracton models
persists in generic tessellations, and provide a natural platform to explore
more intricate subsystem symmetries and fracton physics.

two separate zero-area loop Sagnac interferometers operating at 1550 nm and 830

training with magnetic field. While a finite field Kerr measurement yielded
optical rotation expected from the Pauli susceptibility of the itinerant
carriers, no signal was detected at zero-field to within the noise floor limit
of the apparatus of below $\sim$100 nanoradians. Simultaneous coherent
reflection measurements confirm the sharpness of the charge order transition in
the same optical volume as the Kerr measurements. Application of strain to
reveal a hidden flux-ordered magnetic state did not result in a finite Kerr
effect.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that reducing the thickness of SrRuO3 films from a 3D metal to a 2D metal transforms its magnetic and electronic properties significantly, resulting in a semiconducting antiferromagnet with extraordinary magnetic and electrical characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the magnetic and electronic properties of two-dimensional SrRuO3 films is crucial for advancing materials science and spintronics research, particularly in exploring unconventional magnetoresistance and dimensional effects.

Method: A combination of experimental techniques, including X-ray diffraction, magnetoresistance measurements, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations was employed to investigate the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of SrRuO3 films of varying thicknesses.

Result: The research reveals that decreasing the film thickness of SrRuO3 from 3D to 2D materials causes a shift in its magnetic and electronic states. The system transitions from a metallic ferromagnet to a semiconducting antiferromagnet, and key evidence of an A-type antiferromagnetic order is provided through temperature-dependent magnetic and transport measurements.

Conclusion:  This work paves the way for using SrRuO3 in novel antiferromagnetic spintronic applications and highlights the potential of two-dimensional materials for manipulating correlated electron states. The findings underscore the importance of dimensional reduction in engineering magnetic properties at the nanoscale and could inspire further exploration of similar transformations in other materials.

Abstract: SrRuO3 is a canonical itinerant ferromagnet, yet its properties in the
extreme two-dimensional limit on a (111) crystal plane remain largely
unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a complete transformation of its ground state
driven by dimensional reduction. As the thickness of (111)-oriented SrRuO3
films is reduced to a few unit cells, the system transitions from a metallic
ferromagnet to a semiconducting antiferromagnet. This emergent
antiferromagnetism is evidenced by a vanishing magnetic remanence and most
strikingly, by the appearance of an unconventional twelve-fold anisotropic
magnetoresistance. First-principles calculations confirm that an A-type
antiferromagnetic order is the stable ground state in the ultrathin limit. Our
findings establish (111) dimensional engineering as a powerful route to
manipulate correlated electron states and uncover novel functionalities for
antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Abstract: We study bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in (2+1)
dimensions with symmetry $G = G_{\text{space}}\times K$, where
$G_{\text{space}}$ is a general wallpaper group and
$K=\text{U}(1),\mathbb{Z}_N, \text{SO}(3)$ is an internal symmetry. In each
case we propose a set of many-body invariants that can detect all the different
phases predicted from real space constructions and group cohomology
classifications. They are obtained by applying partial rotations and
reflections to a given ground state, combined with suitable operations in $K$.
The reflection symmetry invariants that we introduce include `double partial
reflections', `weak partial reflections' and their `relative' or `twisted'
versions which also depend on $K$. We verify our proposal through exact
calculations on ground states constructed using real space constructions. We
demonstrate our method in detail for the groups p4m and p4g, and in the case of
p4m also derive a topological effective action involving gauge fields for
orientation-reversing symmetries. Our results provide a concrete method to
fully characterize (2+1)D crystalline topological invariants in bosonic SPT

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper investigates the phases and phase transitions in a one-dimensional alternating mixed-spin chain with frustration and anisotropy, employing exact diagonalization and DMRG methods to explore the ground state properties and phase transitions at finite temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the phase behavior of quantum magnetic systems is crucial for advancing our knowledge of low-dimensional quantum materials and their potential applications in quantum technologies.

Method: The authors used exact diagonalization for small system sizes and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method for larger systems to analyze ground state properties and finite-temperature behavior.

Result: The study reveals that moderate frustration induces a phase transition from a ferrimagnetic state to an anti-ferromagnetic ground state. Weak easy-plane anisotropy disrupts ferrimagnetic order, leading to an antiferromagnetic phase. Under strong frustration and anisotropy, a novel spin density wave-like phase is observed.

Conclusion: The findings provide a comprehensive phase diagram of the alternating mixed-spin chain under frustration and anisotropy, highlighting the interplay between these factors in determining exotic phases and phase transitions.

Abstract: We investigate the phases and phase-transitions in one-dimensional
alternating mixed-spin (1/2-1) chain in the presence of both frustration and
anisotropy. Frustration is introduced via next-nearest-neighbor interactions,
while single-ion anisotropy is incorporated at each lattice site. Our results
show that moderate frustration can drive a phase transition from a
ferrimagnetic state to an anti-ferromagnetic ground state. Remarkably, the
presence of a weak easy-plane anisotropy destabilizes the ferrimagnetic order,
also leading to the emergence of an antiferromagnetic phase. Interestingly,
under strong frustration and anisotropy, the system exhibits signatures of a
novel phase with spin density wave (SDW)-like modulation . We explore these
anomalous phase transitions by employing exact diagonalization (ED) for small
system sizes and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to
characterize ground state properties for larger system sizes. We also
investigate the finite-temperature behavior across various phases using the
ancilla-based time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) approach. The primary
objective of this work is to elucidate the phase structure of alternating
mixed-spin chains under the combined effects of frustration and anisotropy. The
primary objective of this work is to elucidate the intricate interplay between
frustration and anisotropy in identifying the exotic phases and
phase-transitions in alternating mixed-spin chains. Our findings contribute to
a deeper understanding of mixed-spin quantum systems and may offer insights for
future theoretical and experimental studies.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The study investigates the nonequilibrium dynamics of charge density waves in a pumped one-dimensional Hubbard superlattice with staggered onsite Coulomb interactions at half-filling, using time-dependent exact diagonalization. The system exhibits commensurate charge correlations in equilibrium, but under laser excitation, a commensurate-to-incommensurate transition in charge order is observed, driven by sublattice-selective doublon-holon dynamics. This transition is influenced by laser frequency and intensity, offering a potential optical strategy for controlling charge order in quantum materials.

Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to understand and control the nonequilibrium dynamics of charge density waves in quantum materials, with potential applications in quantum computing and spintronic devices.

Method: The researchers used time-dependent exact diagonalization to investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a pumped one-dimensional Hubbard superlattice with staggered onsite Coulomb interactions at half-filling under laser excitation.

Result: The study found that a commensurate-to-incommensurate transition in charge order is observed under laser excitation, driven by sublattice-selective doublon-holon dynamics. The laser frequency and intensity determine whether excitations predominantly destabilize the charge order on the weakly or strongly interacting sublattice.

Conclusion: This work provides valuable insights into the mechanisms controlling charge order in superlattice-based quantum materials and opens up new avenues for designing optical strategies to manipulate charge order in such systems.

Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of charge density waves in a
pumped one-dimensional Hubbard superlattice with staggered onsite Coulomb
interactions at half-filling, using time-dependent exact diagonalization. In
equilibrium, the system exhibits commensurate charge correlations consistent
with the superlattice periodicity. Under laser excitation, the charge
correlation function exhibits distinct behaviors across four representative
frequencies, spanning both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. Notably, we
observe a laser-induced commensurate-to-incommensurate transition in the charge
order, manifested by a shift in the peak wavevector of the charge structure
factor. This transition is driven by sublattice-selective doublon-holon
dynamics, where the laser frequency and intensity determine whether excitations
predominantly destabilize the charge order on the weakly or strongly
interacting sublattice. Our analysis of the excitation spectrum and
site-resolved correlation dynamics reveals the underlying mechanisms of this
transition. These results suggest a promising optical strategy for controlling
charge order in superlattice-based quantum materials.

Abstract: Monolayer 1T-TaS$_2$ hosts a star-of-David charge-density wave (CDW) that
stabilizes a low-temperature Mott-insulating state. Recent time-resolved
spectroscopies indicate a coupling between the CDW amplitude mode and the
electronic correlation strength, yet the role of the screened Coulomb
interaction remains unclear. Using the constrained random-phase approximation,
we show that the CDW amplitude modifies the bare and screened on-site
interactions, leading to sizable variations in the effective Hubbard U. Our
combined density functional and dynamical mean-field theory calculations reveal
that the Hubbard bands shift in concert with the CDW amplitude, and that a
reduced distortion drives a transition from a Mott insulator to a correlated
metal. These results demonstrate a direct link between lattice distortions and
Coulomb interactions in transition-metal dichalcogenides, providing a
microscopic mechanism for light-induced control of correlated phases in
two-dimensional quantum materials.

Abstract: Topological phases in two-dimensional quantum lattice models are often
studied on cylinders for revealing different topological properties and making
the problem numerically tractable. This makes a proper understanding of
finite-circumference effects crucial for reliably extrapolating the results to
the thermodynamic limit. Using matrix product states, we investigate these
effects for the Laughlin-1/2 phase in the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard model, which
can be viewed as the lattice discretization of the bosonic quantum Hall problem
in the continuum. We propose a scaling of the model's parameters with the
cylinder circumference that simultaneously approaches the continuum and
thermodynamic limits. We find that different scaling schemes yield distinct
topological signatures: we either retrieve a spontaneous formation of charge
density wave ordering reminiscent of the Tao-Thouless states, known from the
continuum problem on thin cylinders, or we find uniform states with a
topological degeneracy that can be identified as minimally entangled states
known from studies of chiral spin liquids on cylinders. Finally, we carry out a
similar analysis of the non-Abelian Moore-Read phase in the same model. Our
results clarify the role of symmetries in numerical studies of topologically
ordered states on cylinders and highlight the role of lattice effects.

Abstract: Motivated by recent observations of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in the
vicinity of superconducting (SC) phases, we study fractional quantum
(anomalous) Hall-superconductor heterostructures in the presence of $U(1)$
order-parameter fluctuations and particularly focus on the case of $\nu = 2/3$
quantum Hall states leading to $\mathbb Z_3$ parafermions. We first employ a
phenomenological field theory to qualitatively determine the phase diagram.
Furthermore, we generalize a previously established alternating pattern of
superconductor and tunneling regions, coupled to fractional quantum Hall edge
states, to map the problem onto a topological Josephson junction chain
involving lattice parafermions. Using density matrix renormalization group
simulations, we establish a phase diagram composed of Mott insulating phases
and two different Luttinger liquids whose fundamental excitations carry charges
2e and $2e/3$, respectively. In agreement with analytical considerations using
conformal field theory, we numerically find transitions of
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type as well as a continuous $\mathbb Z_3
\times U(1)$ second-order phase transition characterized by central charge c =
9/5. We finally extract information about a possible ground state degeneracy
and comment on the stability of parafermionic edge states in the presence of
fluctuations. These theoretical foundations can be expected to be of practical
importance for gate-defined FCI-SC heterostructures in moir\'e materials, in
which broad superconducting transitions indicative of strong order parameter
fluctuations were observed.

Abstract: The interplay between non-trivial band topology and strong electronic
correlations is a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. We
investigate this competition on a two-leg ladder model with a p-wave-like
hybridisation between the legs. This model hosts a symmetry-protected
topological phase in its non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix
renormalisation group algorithm, we compute the comprehensive quantum phase
diagram in the presence of a repulsive inter-leg density-density interaction.
Our analysis, based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum,
reveals a fascinating dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. We
find a non-trivial change in the value of the edge entanglement entropy as we
include interaction. Furthermore, we find that the phase boundary separating a
trivial insulator phase and a topological one with winding number two remains
robustly pinned at its non-interacting location, irrespective of the
interaction strength. Variation of the effective conformal field theory's
central charge near the critical line explains the robustness of the gap. In
contrast, the transition to an insulating phase with winding number one is
heavily renormalised, with the critical line shifting significantly as the
interaction increases. By successfully mapping the phase diagram and
identifying the distinct behaviours of the phase boundaries, our work clarifies
how interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a
topological phase.

TL;DR: Phase fluctuations play a crucial role in the competition between charge order and superconductivity in cuprates. At low photon fluence, superconductivity is suppressed, enhancing charge order. At high fluence, both order parameters are suppressed extendedly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper investigates the dynamic competition between charge order and superconductivity in cuprates, which is a key aspect of the physics of correlated electron materials. Understanding the role of phase fluctuations in such systems is essential for advancing our knowledge of nonthermal phase transitions and coupled order parameters.

Method: The researchers employ time-resolved resonant X-ray scattering combined with a space- and time-dependent nonperturbative model to study the intertwined evolution of charge order and superconductivity in cuprate/manganite heterostructures. This approach allows them to capture both amplitude and phase dynamics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior under varying photon fluence.

Result: The study reveals that phase fluctuations influence the competition between charge order and superconductivity. Specifically, at low photon fluence, superconductivity is suppressed, enhancing charge order. At high fluence, both order parameters remain suppressed for an extended time window due to the decoupling between amplitude and phase dynamics and the delayed recovery of phase coherence.

Conclusion: This work underscores the importance of phase fluctuations in understanding the dynamic competition between order parameters in cuprates. The findings provide valuable insights into the interplay between competing phases and the role of phase fluctuations in nonthermal phase transitions in correlated electron systems.

Abstract: Phase fluctuations are a key factor distinguishing nonthermal (ultrafast) and
thermal phase transitions. Charge order in cuprates is characterized by
short-range coherence while competing with superconductivity, and as such, it
provides a representative case to study the role of phase fluctuation in
coupled order parameter dynamics. In this work, we investigated the intertwined
evolution of charge order and superconductivity in cuprate/manganite
heterostructures using time-resolved resonant X-ray scattering. The resulting
dynamics are analyzed within a space- and time-dependent nonperturbative model
capturing both amplitude and phase dynamics. At low fluence, photo-induced
suppression of superconductivity results in a nonthermal enhancement of charge
order, underscoring the dynamic competition between charge order and
superconductivity. With increasing fluence, the slowing down of melting and
recovery dynamics is observed, indicating a critical role of phase
fluctuations. At high fluence, both charge order and superconductivity remain
suppressed for an extended time window due to decoupling between amplitude and
phase dynamics and the delayed recovery of phase coherence. Our work
underscores the importance of phase fluctuation for understanding the dynamic
competition between order parameters in cuprates.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Spin polarons are bound states of electrons and spin-flips that form above
spin polarized electronic insulators.These bound states conventionally form in
one of two settings: in frustrated lattices with dispersive bands -- where the
motion of an electron preferences binding a nearby spin-flip -- or in
topological flat bands -- where the Chern number enforces an effective dipolar
interaction between electrons and spin flips. In this work, we report the
formation of a spin polaron in a context that doesn't fall cleanly into either
of these paradigms. In particular, we study the one-dimensional Mielke-Tasaki
chain, a paradigmatic model of flat band ferromagnetism, which has an exact
ferromagnetic ground state, trivial band topology, and quenched kinetic energy
in its lowest band. Despite these features, our density matrix renormalization
group simulations reveal the presence of spin polarons upon electron doping
this model. More surprisingly, combining these numerics with analytic
calculations, we show that polaron binding occurs when the interaction-induced
kinetic energy of the model is zero -- contrary to intuition from kinetic
magnetism -- and the glue binding the electrons and spin-flips arises from weak
mixing with the model's dispersive band -- contrary to what occurs in
topological flat bands. Our results open the doors to exploring how the quantum
geometry of flat bands drives the formation of exotic charge carriers.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Mechanism of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) remains one
of the central problems in strongly correlated topological systems. The most
intriguing question is about the nature of the normal state: is the Cooper pair
formed from small Fermi surface or large Fermi surface? In this work we point
out the possibility of a symmetric pseudogap metal with small hole pockets,
dubbed as second Fermi liquid (sFL). In the sFL phase at $\nu=-2-x$, there is a
two-component picture: two electrons mainly localize on the AA sites and form a
paired singlet due to anti-Hund's coupling mediated by the optical phonon,
while additional holes form small Fermi surfaces. The sFL phase corresponds to
an intrinsically strongly interacting fixed point and violates the perturbative
Luttinger theorem. We develop a unified framework to describe both a
renormalized Fermi liquid (FL) and an sFL phase. We propose that the normal
state of the TBG superconductor is the sFL phase, but it evolves toward the FL
phase under increasing hole doping. The superconducting phase emerges from the
sFL phase by transferring pairing of local moments to the mobile carriers.
Interestingly, the superconducting gap can exhibit a nematic nodal
$p_x$-pairing symmetry. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first unified
theory that explains both the pseudogap metal above $T_c$ and the two-gap
nematic superconductivity below it.

Abstract: We study the thermal Casimir effect in ideal Bose gases with spin-orbit (S-O)
coupling of Rashba type below the critical temperature for Bose-Einstein
condensation. In contrast to the standard situation involving no S-O coupling,
the system exhibits long-ranged Casimir forces both in two and three dimensions
($d=2$ and $d=3$). We identify the relevant scaling variable involving the
ratio $D/\nu$ of the separation between the confining walls $D$ and the S-O
coupling magnitude $\nu$. We derive and discuss the corresponding scaling
functions for the Casimir energy. In all the considered cases the resulting
Casimir force is attractive and the S-O coupling $\nu$ has impact on its
magnitude. In $d=3$ the exponent governing the decay of the Casimir force
becomes modified by the presence of the S-O coupling, and its value depends on
the orientation of the confining walls relative to the plane defined by the
Rashba coupling. In $d=2$ the obtained Casimir force displays singular behavior
in the limit of vanishing $\nu$

Motivation: Understanding ultrafast electron dynamics in Rydberg gases through femtosecond laser experiments and simulations.

Method: Experimen with ultracold 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate, tuning laser to two-photon ionization threshold, and using molecular dynamics simulations.

Result: Simulations explain the ultrafast dynamics causing the transition to a Rydberg gas, differing from previous expectations.

Conclusion: Framework for studying ultracold plasmas and Rydberg gases with femtosecond lasers and beyond.

Abstract: Within femtoseconds the strong light field of an ultrashort laser pulse can
excite and ionize a few thousand atoms in an ultracold quantum gas. Here we
investigate the rich many-body dynamics unfolding in a $^{87}$Rb Bose-Einstein
condensate after exposure to a single femtosecond laser pulse. By tuning the
laser wavelength over the two-photon ionization threshold, we adjust the
initial energy of the electrons and can thus investigate the transition from an
ultracold plasma to a dense Rydberg gas.
  Our experimental setup provides access to the kinetic energy of the released
electrons, which allows us to distinguish between bound, free and plasma
electrons. The large bandwidth of the ultrashort laser pulse makes it possible
to overcome the Rydberg blockade which fundamentally limits the density in
excitation schemes with narrow-band lasers.
  To understand the many-body dynamics at the microscopic level, we employ
molecular dynamics simulations where the electrons are modeled as individual
particles including collisional ionization and recombination processes. We find
that the ultrafast dynamics within the first few nanoseconds is responsible for
the final distribution of free, bound and plasma electrons and agrees well with
the experimental observation. We find distinctly different dynamics compared to
the expected transition from an ultracold neutral plasma to a dense Rydberg
gas.

Abstract: Atomtronic quantum sensors based on trapped superfluids offer a promising
platform for high-precision inertial measurements where the dynamics of
quantized vortices can serve as sensitive probes of external forces. We
analytically investigate persistent current oscillations between two
density-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate rings and show that the vortex
dynamics is governed by low-energy acoustic excitations circulating through the
condensate bulk. The oscillation frequency and damping rate are quantitatively
predicted by a simplified hydrodynamic model, in agreement with Bogoliubov-de
Gennes analysis and Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. We identify the critical
dissipation separating persistent oscillations from overdamped vortex
localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that periodic modulation of the
inter-ring barrier at resonant frequencies enables controlled vortex transfer
even when the condensates are well separated in density. These results clarify
the role of collective hydrodynamic modes in circulation transfer and establish
a framework for employing vortex dynamics in atomtronic quantum technologies.

Abstract: The famous two-fluid model of finite-temperature superfluids has been
recently extended to describe the mixed classical-superfluid dynamics of the
newly discovered supersolid phase of matter. We show that for rigidly rotating
supersolids one can derive a more appropriate single-fluid model, in which the
seemingly classical and superfluid contributions to the motion emerge from a
spatially varying phase of the global wavefunction. That allows to design
experimental protocols to excite and detect the peculiar rotation dynamics of
annular supersolids, including partially quantized supercurrents, in which each
atom brings less than $\hbar$ unit of angular momentum. Our results are valid
for a more general class of density-modulated superfluids.

Conclusion: 本文通过对修正 Chaplygin 气体模型下的不同暗能量方程状态参数化模型的吸收入研究，揭示了黑洞吸收入在随宇宙演化过程对暗能量和宇宙压力随时间变化的高度敏感性。该研究不仅深化了我们对黑洞在宇宙学中的行为理解，还为探索暗能量与宇宙加速膨胀之间的可能物理联系提供了重要的信息，有助于未来研究黑洞吸收入与量子引力耦合的潜在关系。

Abstract: We investigate the evolution of black hole mass within a cosmological
background modeled by a Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG) under various dark energy
equation of state parametrizations, including Linear, Logarithmic, CPL, JBP,
FSLL-II, and Barboza--Alcaniz (BA) models. The logarithmic mass ratio
$\log_{10}[M(z)/M_0]$ is found to be highly sensitive to the redshift-dependent
evolution of $\omega(z)$, with gentle slopes in Linear, Logarithmic, and CPL
models indicating quasi-static accretion, steep slopes in JBP corresponding to
rapid late-time variations, and non-monotonic behaviour in FSLL-II and BA
highlighting transient suppression or enhancement of accretion due to repulsive
dark energy effects. Peaks, minima, and amplitude offsets in the mass ratio
reflect the dynamic interplay between horizon thermodynamics, the evolving
pressure of the MCG, and cosmic expansion, illustrating how the black hole mass
growth is directly influenced by both the temporal evolution of dark energy and
the effective gravitational potential of the surrounding cosmic fluid. Our
results demonstrate that black hole accretion acts as a sensitive probe of the
time-dependent cosmic pressure landscape and provides physical insights into
the coupling between local strong gravity and global accelerated expansion.

Abstract: Quasi-topological gravities (QTGs) are higher-curvature extensions of
Einstein gravity in $D\geq 5$ spacetime dimensions. Throughout the years,
different notions of QTGs constructed from analytic functions of polynomial
curvature invariants have been introduced in the literature. In this paper, we
show that all such definitions may be reduced to three distinct inequivalent
notions: type I QTGs, for which the field equations evaluated on a
single-function static and spherically symmetric ansatz are second order; type
II QTGs, whose field equations on general static and spherically symmetric
backgrounds are second order; and type III QTGs, for which the trace of the
field equations on a general background is second order. We show that type II
QTGs are a subset of type I QTGs and that type III QTGs are a subset of type II
QTGs modulo pure Weyl invariants. Moreover, we prove that type II QTGs possess
second-order equations on general spherical backgrounds. This allows us to
prove that any theory satisfying a Birkhoff theorem is a type II QTG, and that
the reverse implication also holds up to a zero-measure set of theories. For
every theory satisfying Birkhoff's theorem, the most general spherically
symmetric solution is a generalization of the Schwarzschild spacetime
characterized by a single function which satisfies an algebraic equation.

Abstract: Non-minimal couplings between matter and curvature tensors arise in many
different contexts. Such couplings modify solutions of general relativity (GR)
and therefore can be probed in various astrophysical systems. A particularly
interesting scenario arises if dark matter experiences non-minimal couplings,
as dark matter densities are expected to spike in the vicinity of binary black
hole mergers. This gives a novel setting for simultaneously studying dark
matter and (beyond) GR physics via observations of gravitational waves (GWs).
In this work, we explore effects of various non-minimal couplings on GWs by
working with a model-independent parameterization for left- and right-handed GW
strains. We extend the parameterization proposed in
\cite{Jenks:2023pmk,Daniel:2024lev} to include early-universe effects, and we
write down the generic solution assuming slowly-varying matter fields. We then
systematically apply our results to three models: Kalb-Ramond dark matter with
dimension-four operators, axion-dilaton-Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet
dimension-five operators, and dimension-six couplings to a (dark) vector field.

Abstract: This work investigates a generalized holographic dark energy (HDE) model
defined by a polynomial expansion in the Hubble parameter, incorporating the
first three leading terms proportional to $H^{2}$, $H^{4}$, and $H^{6}$ through
a variable parameter in the expression for the energy density. The analysis is
developed within the framework of a spatially flat

non-interacting matter and this HDE fluid. We derive the complete set of
Friedmann equations to study the cosmic evolution and subsequently examine the
system for the existence of thermodynamic $P-V$ type phase transitions.
Finally, a comprehensive comparison with the predictions of the standard

Abstract: We analyze quasinormal modes, grey-body factors, and absorption
cross-sections of a massive scalar field in the background of a Schwarzschild
black hole surrounded by a Hernquist dark-matter halo. The quasinormal spectrum
is obtained through the higher-order WKB method and verified by time-domain
evolution, showing consistent results. The field mass increases the oscillation
frequency and reduces the damping rate, producing longer-lived modes, while
variations in the halo parameters lead to moderate shifts in the spectrum. The
grey-body factors reveal a suppression of low-frequency transmission and a
displacement of their main features toward higher frequencies, resulting in a
corresponding shift in the absorption cross-section.

Abstract: In this work, we study how the spin of particle modes influences particle
creation, greybody factors, absorption, and evaporation of a black hole within
the framework of modified electrodynamics in $f(R,T)$ gravity, recently
proposed in Ref. [1]. All spin sectors -- scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial
-- are analyzed to obtain the corresponding features. For particle creation, we
consider massless bosonic and fermionic perturbations to determine the
respective particle densities. Analytical expressions for the greybody factors
are derived, with suitable approximations for the tensor and spinorial cases.
The absorption cross section is computed numerically, and using the
Stefan-Boltzmann law, we estimate the black hole evaporation lifetime. The
associated energy and particle emission rates are also discussed, along with
the correspondence between quasinormal modes and greybody factors.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: A general relativistic multifluid model extending GRMHD with multiple relativistic fluids interacting through a shared electromagnetic field is presented. It incorporates non-ideal effects and avoids some limitations of GRMHD, enabling simulations of larger Lorentz factors and higher magnetizations with better stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the applicability of hydrodynamic models in extreme astrophysical scenarios like neutron stars and black holes.

Method: The model is derived from general relativistic kinetics, incorporating multiple fluids and electromagnetic fields. A numerical scheme is developed and validated against GRMHD.

Result: The multifluid model shows enhanced robustness and accuracy, allowing for simulations of extreme conditions such as high Lorentz factors and strong magnetic fields without losing stability.

Conclusion: The proposed multifluid model overcomes limitations of GRMHD, providing a more reliable tool for studying extreme astrophysical phenomena involving relativistic fluids and electromagnetic fields.

Abstract: The equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) have
become the standard mathematical framework for modeling high-energy plasmas in
curved spacetimes. However, the fragility of the primitive variable
reconstruction operation in GRMHD, as well as the difficulties in maintaining
strong hyperbolicity of the equations, sharply limit the applicability of the
GRMHD model in scenarios involving large Lorentz factors and high
magnetizations, such as around neutron stars. Non-ideal effects, such as
electron inertia and Hall terms, are also neglected, and the absence of an
explicitly evolved electric field precludes the self-consistent modeling of the
strong poloidal fields found around spinning black holes, which are known to be
crucial for jet formation. Here, we present a general relativistic multifluid
model which strictly generalizes the GRMHD equations, consisting of an
arbitrary number of relativistic fluid species interacting with a shared
electromagnetic field via an explicit coupling of their source terms, thus
allowing for the incorporation of non-ideal effects. We sketch how our model
may be derived from general relativistic kinetics (via moments of the
relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation), as well as how GRMHD may be recovered
in the single-fluid limit as the mobility of charge carriers goes to infinity.
We present a numerical scheme for solving the general relativistic multifluid
equations, and validate it against the analogous scheme for the GRMHD
equations. Since the primitive variable reconstruction operation for our
multifluid model is purely hydrodynamic, and therefore independent of the
magnetic field, the resulting solver is highly robust, and able to simulate
significantly larger Lorentz factors and higher magnetizations (across both
black hole and neutron star spacetimes) than GRMHD without loss of either
accuracy or stability.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper presents a joint data analysis pipeline for the anisotropic stochastic cosmological gravitational-wave background (SGWB) using a network of TianQin, LISA, and Taiji detectors. It demonstrates that the detector network can reconstruct the angular power spectrum of the SGWB up to multipole moment l=14, providing valuable insights into the spatial distribution of galactic compact binaries and early universe imprints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying the SGWB is crucial for understanding the early universe and the distribution of galactic compact binaries. Current methods for analyzing the SGWB are limited, so developing a more comprehensive analysis pipeline is motivated by the need for better insights.

Method: The paper establishes a dedicated data analysis pipeline that combines Gaussian, stationary, and unpolarized point sources from various sky locations with a random sky map. It uses maximum likelihood estimation in pixel space to reconstruct the angular distribution of the SGWB.

Result: The analysis shows that the detector network can reconstruct the angular power spectrum of the SGWB up to a maximum multipole moment of l=14. This result significantly enhances the capability to study the spatial distribution of galactic compact binaries and physical imprints from the early universe.

Conclusion: This work opens a new avenue for studying the anisotropic SGWB using a multi-detector network, paving the way for more detailed studies of the early universe and galactic compact binaries.

Abstract: Future space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as TianQin, LISA, and
Taiji are expected to conduct joint observations. Such a multi-detector network
will provide complementary viewing angles for the anisotropic stochastic
gravitational-wave background (SGWB), thereby significantly enhancing the
capability to reconstruct and localize its spatial distribution. In this paper,
we have established the first dedicated data analysis pipeline for the
anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background using a joint network of
TianQin, LISA, and Taiji. Our analysis incorporates both Gaussian, stationary,
and unpolarized point sources from diverse sky locations as well as a random
sky map. We have performed full-sky map reconstruction in pixel space using
maximum likelihood estimation to extract the angular distribution of the SGWB.
The results demonstrate that, when considering the detector noise, the
TianQin+LISA+Taiji detector network can reconstruct the angular power spectrum
of the stochastic background up to a maximum multipole moment of $l = 14 $,
which can provide valuable information for studies on the spatial distribution
of galactic compact binaries and physical imprints from the early Universe.

*María Pía Piccirilli,Gabriel León,Rosa-Laura Lechuga-Solis,Daniel Sudarsky*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper presents a quantum collapse-based inflationary model that explains cosmic structure and suppresses long-wavelength CMB modes to avoid eternal inflation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address two motivations: explaining primordial cosmic structure and suppressing long-wavelength CMB modes to avoid eternal inflation.

Method: The model uses quantum collapse theories within continuous stochastic mechanisms and semiclassical gravity to predict a non-conventional scalar spectrum modulated by two new parameters in the collapse rate.

Result: The model successfully explains the low-l anomaly in the CMB by producing a low-ℓ suppression in the spectrum, aligning with Planck 2018 data.

Conclusion: The model simultaneously solves the cosmic structure problem and prevents eternal inflation, supported by Planck data.

Abstract: We revisit an inflationary scenario in which primordial inhomogeneities arise
from a quantum collapse, a stochastic mechanism described in the context of
quantum collapse theories in its continuous version and within semiclassical
gravity. The predictions of the model show a non-conventional scalar spectrum
governed by two new parameters in the collapse rate, whose aim is twofold: on
one side, to account for the primordial cosmic structure, and on the other to
explain the suppression amplitude associated with long-wavelength modes,
thereby eliminating the occurrence of eternal inflation. Furthermore, this
model can contribute to accounting for the lack of power anomaly in the low $l$
angular power spectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Using the
latest data from the Planck (2018) collaboration, we establish observational
constraints on the model parameters, which produce a characteristic low-$\ell$
suppression in the cosmic microwave background spectrum. We conclude that the
Planck data support the solution presented in the previous works, in other
words, that the model allows us to solve simultaneously the emergence of the
cosmic structure and, at the same time, avoid the eternal inflation scenario.

these weighted curvatures have a natural interpretation in terms of warped

Abstract: The thermodynamic properties of black holes have been extensively studied
through analogies with classical systems, revealing fundamental connections
between gravitation, entropy, and quantum mechanics. In this work, we extend
the thermodynamic framework of black holes by incorporating charge and
analyzing its role in entropy production. Using an analogy with charged
rotating soap bubbles, we demonstrate that charge contributes to the total
angular momentum and affects the entropy-event horizon relationship. By
applying the Gouy-Stodola theorem, we establish a consistent thermodynamic
formulation for charged black holes, showing that the first law of
thermodynamics remains valid in this context. Furthermore, we explore the
behavior of the partition function from the perspective of a distant observer,
revealing that charge effects diminish with increasing distance. These findings
reinforce the thermodynamic interpretation of black holes and provide insights
into the interplay between charge, rotation, and entropy in gravitational
systems.

Conclusion: 该研究首次在量子耗散系统中观察到了非线性动力学现象，为非正规量子动力学和量子耗散系统的研究提供了重要证据，为理解量子与经典动力学的本质区别提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Unitary and dissipative models of quantum dynamics are linear maps on the
space of states or density matrices. This linearity encodes the superposition
principle, a key feature of quantum theory. However, this principle can break
down in effective non-Hermitian dynamics arising from postselected quantum
evolution. We theoretically characterize and experimentally investigate this
breakdown in a dissipative superconducting transmon circuit. Within the
circuit's three-level manifold, no-jump postselection generates an effective
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian governing the excited two-level subspace and an
anti-Hermitian nonlinearity. We prepare different initial states and use
quantum state tomography to track their evolution under this effective,
nonlinear Hamiltonian. By comparing the evolution of a superposition-state to a
superposition of individually-evolved basis states, we test linearity and
observe clear violations which we quantify across the exceptional-point (EP)
degeneracy of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the analysis to density
matrices, revealing a breakdown in linearity for the two-level subspace while
demonstrating that linearity is preserved in the full three-level system. These
results provide direct evidence of nonlinearity in non-Hermitian quantum
evolution, highlighting unique features that are absent in classical
non-Hermitian systems.

Abstract: We design and demonstrate heuristic quantum advantage with peaked circuits
(HQAP circuits) on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum processor. Through
extensive experimentation with state-of-the-art classical simulation
strategies, we identify a clear gap between classical and quantum runtimes. Our
largest instance involves all-to-all connectivity with 2000 two-qubit gates,
which H2 can produce the target peaked bitstring directly in under 2 hours. Our
extrapolations from leading classical simulation techniques such as tensor
networks with belief propagation and Pauli path simulators indicate the same
instance would take years on exascale systems (Frontier, Summit), suggesting a
potentially exponential separation. This work marks an important milestone
toward verifiable quantum advantage, as well as providing a useful benchmarking
protocol for current utility-scale quantum hardware. We sketch our protocol for
designing these circuits and provide extensive numerical results leading to our
extrapolation estimates. Separate from our constructed HQAP circuits, we prove
hardness on a decision problem involving generic peaked circuits. When both the
input and output bitstrings of a peaked circuit are unknown, determining
whether the circuit is peaked constitutes a QCMA-complete problem, meaning the
problem remains hard even for a quantum polynomial-time machine under commonly
accepted complexity assumptions. Inspired by this observation, we propose an
application of the peaked circuits as a potentially quantum-safe encryption
scheme~\cite{chen2016report,kumar2020post,joseph2022transitioning,dam2023survey}.
We make our peaked circuits publicly available and invite the community to try
additional methods to solve these circuits to see if this gap persists even
with novel classical techniques.

purification of entanglement with minimal resource overhead is critical. In
particular, we demonstrate the use of the new method in an optimization
procedure enabled by the fast simulation, that discovers GHZ distillation
circuits far outperforming the state of the art. Fine-tuning to arbitrary noise
models is possible as well. We also show that the method naturally extends to
graph states that are local Clifford equivalent to GHZ states.

Abstract: We examine the quantum dynamics of a large spin in the presence of static and
rotating magnetic fields. By mapping the system onto a gas of non-interacting
spin-1/2 particles, we derive exact analytical results for the dynamics with
different initial states. The dynamics exhibit periodic oscillations between
two maximally stretched states, irrespective of how large the spin is. Further,
we observe periodic transitions between sublevels with magnetic quantum numbers
of opposite signs. Additionally, the dynamics features the periodic transfer of
the spin to the maximally stretched state starting from a superposition state.
The evolution of the dipole moment is also explored in each case, and as
expected, it is precessing about the instantaneous, resultant magnetic field.
Furthermore, we extend our analysis to a pair of spins, taking into account the
dipole-dipole interactions between them. We analyze how the ground state
entanglement between the spins depends on the external fields. The quantum
dynamics of the two spins reveal entanglement resonances and kinks, which can
be identified from the energy spectrum when weak transverse field strengths are
considered. Finally, we discuss the regime in which the dipolar interactions
are relatively weak.

TL;DR: Many-body spin-boson states enable quantum-enhanced displacement sensing achieving Heisenberg limit accuracy and a faster protocol for their preparation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Displacement sensing in metrology faces limitations from traditional methods, and realizing quantum-enhanced sensors that leverage many-body systems presents a key challenge.

Method: Used spin-dependent squeezed (SDS) states, combining spin and bosonic modes with conditional squeezing based on an auxiliary spin. Employed second-order sidebands in trapped ions and a scalable preparation protocol using hybrid spin-boson states.

Result: SDS states are proven optimal, reaching Heisenberg limit accuracy in displacement sensing. The protocol for SDS state preparation is significantly faster, achieving 15 times greater efficiency with 8.7 dB of spin-dependent squeezing compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SDS state-based sensing protocols provide a foundational approach to achieving Heisenberg-limited displacement sensing, with demonstrated practical advantages in terms of speed and resource efficiency, making them viable for applications in quantum metrology such as single-photon scattering and dark matter searches.

Abstract: Displacement sensing is a fundamental task in metrology. However, the
development of quantum-enhanced sensors that fully utilize the available
degrees of freedom in many-body quantum systems remains an outstanding
challenge. We propose novel many-body displacement sensing schemes that use
spin-dependent squeezed (SDS) states -- hybrid spin-boson states whose bosonic
squeezed quadrature is conditioned on an auxiliary spin. We prove that SDS
states are \emph{optimal}, i.e. their quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound saturates
the Heisenberg limit. We propose explicit measurement sequences that can be
readily implemented in systems such as trapped ions. We also introduce a
scalable state-preparation protocol and numerically demonstrate the preparation
of $8.7$~dB of spin-dependent squeezing $15$ times faster than the standard
approach using second-order sidebands in trapped ions. The potential
applications of our sensing protocols range from measuring single-photon
scattering to searches for dark matter.

Abstract: We study the emergence of quantum memory effects in a spin-boson system at
finite temperature driven by an external time-periodic force. Quantifying
memory effects by the trace-distance based measure for non-Markovianity and
performing numerical simulations employing the hierarchical equations of motion
approach, we find a pronounced peak structure when plotting the
non-Markovianity measure as a function of the driving amplitude. This
distinctive feature is interpreted using Floquet theory and the
Floquet-Lindblad master equation, associating the peaks with the degeneracies
of the quasienergy spectrum which lead to a strong enhancement of the
relaxation times of the system. These results suggest strategies for the
efficient control of non-Markovianity in open quantum systems by periodic
driving.

Abstract: A synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator (SPOPO) operating at 93
MHz is used to generate squeezed states at 1035 nm. The system features a
counter-propagating beam at the same wavelength as the quantum state, which
simultaneously actively stabilizes the cavity and, after transmission, acts as
the local oscillator for homodyne detection. By deriving the local oscillator
directly from the SPOPO cavity, the setup establishes an intrinsically
excellent spatial mode overlap and high interference visibility, forming a
distinctive self-referenced architecture. Two spatial light modulators enable
precise spectral shaping of both the pump and the local oscillator in amplitude
and phase, allowing investigation of the spectral properties of the generated

SPOPO configurations, including regimes with varied finesse and escape
efficiency. Representative measurements, including homodyne traces and
squeezing levels as functions of pump power and local oscillator bandwidth,
demonstrate the performance of the system. Theoretical simulations based on a
multimode singular-value-decomposition model reproduce well the measured
dependence of squeezing on pump power and LO bandwidth, confirming the accuracy
of the description and the robustness of the setup. Measured squeezing levels
up to -3.3 dB are achieved, corresponding to -5.7 dB at SPOPO output,
evidencing the robustness and versatility of this platform for stable pulsed

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum computation can be formulated through various models, each
highlighting distinct structural and resource-theoretic aspects of quantum
computational power. This paper develops a unified categorical framework that
encompasses these models and their interrelations using the language of double
categories. We introduce double port graphs, a bidirectional generalization of
port graphs, to represent the quantum (horizontal) and classical (vertical)
flows of information within computational architectures. Quantum operations are
described as adaptive instruments, organized into a one-object double category
whose horizontal and vertical directions correspond to quantum channels and
stochastic maps, respectively. Within this setting, we capture prominent
adaptive quantum computation models, including measurement-based and
magic-state models. To analyze computational power, we extend the theory of
contextuality to an adaptive setting through the notion of simplicial
instruments, which generalize simplicial distributions to double categorical
form. This construction yields a quantitative characterization of computational
power in terms of contextual fraction, leading to a categorical formulation of
the result that non-contextual resources can compute only affine Boolean
functions. The framework thus offers a new perspective on the interplay between
adaptivity, contextuality, and computational power in quantum computational
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutral atom quantum computers face a bottleneck in their readout time, which delays quantum error correction and program execution. This tradeoff between speed and accuracy in readout is critical for scaling quantum systems.

Method: The GANDALF framework uses image denoising and translation to reconstruct clear signals from short, low-photon measurements, enabling reliable classification with reduced readout times.

Result: The GANDALF framework successfully reduces logical error rates by up to 35x and overall QEC cycle time by 1.77x compared to existing CNN-based readout methods for cesium neutral atom arrays.

Conclusion: This breakthrough in quantum computing architecture addresses a key limitation in scaling neutral atom systems by leveraging image denoising and optimization techniques.

Abstract: Neutral atom quantum computers hold promise for scaling up to hundreds of
thousands of qubits, but their progress is constrained by slow qubit readout.
Measuring qubits currently takes milliseconds-much longer than the underlying
quantum gate operations-making readout the primary bottleneck in deploying
quantum error correction. Because each round of QEC depends on measurement,
long readout times increase cycle duration and slow down program execution.
Reducing the readout duration speeds up cycles and reduces decoherence errors
that accumulate while qubits idle, but it also lowers the number of collected
photons, making measurements noisier and more error-prone. This tradeoff leaves
neutral atom systems stuck between slow but accurate readout and fast but
unreliable readout.
  We show that image denoising can resolve this tension. Our framework,
GANDALF, uses explicit denoising using image translation to reconstruct clear
signals from short, low-photon measurements, enabling reliable classification
at up to 1.6x shorter readout times. Combined with lightweight classifiers and
a pipelined readout design, our approach both reduces logical error rate by up
to 35x and overall QEC cycle time up to 1.77x compared to state-of-the-art
CNN-based readout for Cesium (Cs) Neutral Atom arrays.

Abstract: We study the impact of static disorder on a globally-controlled
superconducting quantum computing architecture based on a quasi-two-dimensional

Specifically, we examine how fabrication-induced inhomogeneities in qubit

and the fidelity of fundamental quantum operations. Using numerical
simulations, we quantify the degradation in performance due to disorder and
identify single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates, and quantum

we rely on pulse optimization schemes, and, in particular, on the GRAPE

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose digitized counterdiabatic quantum sampling (DCQS), a hybrid
quantum-classical algorithm for efficient sampling from energy-based models,
such as low-temperature Boltzmann distributions. The method utilizes
counterdiabatic protocols, which suppress non-adiabatic transitions, with an
iterative bias-field procedure that progressively steers the sampling toward
low-energy regions. We observe that the samples obtained at each iteration
correspond to approximate Boltzmann distributions at effective temperatures. By
aggregating these samples and applying classical reweighting, the method
reconstructs the Boltzmann distribution at a desired temperature. We define a
scalable performance metric, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the
total variation distance, to quantify convergence toward the exact Boltzmann
distribution. DCQS is validated on one-dimensional Ising models with random
couplings up to 124 qubits, where exact results are available through
transfer-matrix methods. We then apply it to a higher-order spin-glass
Hamiltonian with 156 qubits executed on IBM quantum processors. We show that
classical sampling algorithms, including Metropolis-Hastings and the
state-of-the-art low-temperature technique parallel tempering, require up to
three orders of magnitude more samples to match the quality of DCQS,
corresponding to an approximately 2x runtime advantage. Boltzmann sampling
underlies applications ranging from statistical physics to machine learning,
yet classical algorithms exhibit exponentially slow convergence at low
temperatures. Our results thus demonstrate a robust route toward scalable and
efficient Boltzmann sampling on current quantum processors.

TL;DR: A novel method for characterizing polarization channels in quantum-classical networks is introduced using a combination of classical tracking systems and quantum process tomography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As quantum networks expand to deployed systems, the need for effective channel characterization becomes critical, especially in non-strict unitary environments.

Method: A hybrid in situ benchmarking approach combining classical polarization tracking with quantum process tomography is used to measure and correct for noise in nonunitary channels.

Result: The method successfully enables continuous characterization of noisy channels, improving quantum-classical communication reliability.

Conclusion: This framework bridges classical and quantum systems, advancing robust quantum network operation.

Abstract: The active stabilization of polarization channels is a task of growing
importance as quantum networks move to deployed demonstrations over existing
fiber infrastructure. However, the uniquely strict requirements for
high-fidelity qubit transmission complicate the extent to which classical
solutions may apply to future quantum networks, particularly in terms of
recognizing noise sources present in low-flux, nonunitary channels. Here we
introduce a novel in situ benchmarking approach that augments a classical
polarization tracking system, limited to unitary correction, with
simultaneously transmitted quantum light for ancilla-assisted process
tomography of the full quantum map. Implemented in a local-area quantum
network, our method uses the reconstructed map both to validate the classical
compensation and to expose noise sources it fails to capture. A sliding
measurement window that continuously updates the estimated quantum process
further increases sensitivity to rapid channel fluctuations. Our results should
unlock new opportunities for in situ channel characterization in
quantum-classical coexistence networks.

*Rui Yang,Zheng Shi,Zhirong Lin,Waltraut Wustmann*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Josephson parametric devices benefit from coupling to their transmission line via a bandpass filter to overcome the gain-bandwidth trade-off. While existing analysis assumes weak coupling, this work performs a non-perturbative circuit analysis considering strong coupling effects, leading to a more accurate quantum model. The results demonstrate that non-Markovian dynamics can significantly impact the device's bandwidth, offering new design insights for Josephson parametric devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Josephson parametric devices are used in superconducting quantum computing, but their performance is limited by a gain-bandwidth trade-off. This paper explores how coupling these devices to transmission lines via bandpass filters can overcome this limitation, particularly through non-perturbative analysis.

Method: The paper employs non-perturbative circuit analysis in terms of dressed transmission-line modes for resonant coupling circuits. It extends beyond the weak-coupling treatment typically used in cQED analysis by considering the strong frequency dependence of coupling coefficients. This leads to the development of a non-Markovian quantum Langevin equation with a frequency-dependent self-energy of the coupling.

Result: The analysis reveals that non-Markovian dynamics significantly impact the device's bandwidth. The results show that the gain profiles are strongly modified compared to their Markovian counterparts. Bandwidth broadening occurs not only in the established parameter regime but also in off-resonant parameter regimes where the real part of the self-energy is large.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights for designing Josephson parametric devices with improved bandwidth performance by utilizing simple coupling networks.

Abstract: Josephson parametric devices are widely used in superconducting quantum
computing research but suffer from an inherent gain-bandwidth trade-off. This
limitation is partly overcome by coupling the device to its input/output
transmission line via a bandpass filter, leading to wider bandwidth at
undiminished gain. Here we perform a non-perturbative circuit analysis in terms
of dressed transmission-line modes for representative resonant coupling
circuits, going beyond the weak-coupling treatment. The strong frequency
dependence of the resulting coupling coefficients implies that the Markov
approximation commonly employed in cQED analysis is inadequate. By retaining
the full frequency dependence of the coupling, we arrive at a non-Markovian
form of the quantum Langevin equation with the frequency-dependent
complex-valued self-energy of the coupling in place of a single damping
parameter. We also consistently generalize the input-output relations and
unitarity conditions. Using the exact self-energies of elementary filter
networks -- a series- and parallel-LC circuit and a simple representative
bandpass filter consisting of their combination -- we calculate the generalized
parametric gain factors. Compared with their Markovian counterpart, these gain
profiles are strongly modified. We find bandwidth broadening not only in the
established parameter regime, where the self-energy of the coupling is in
resonance with the device and its real part has unity slope, but also within
off-resonant parameter regimes where the real part of the self-energy is large.
Our results offer insight for the bandwidth engineering of Josephson parametric
devices using simple coupling networks.

*Shanyan Chen,Ali Al-Bayaty,Xiaoyu Song,Marek Perkowski*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: $(n+1)$-	extit{bit Toffoli} gates are decomposed for quantum circuits with support qubits (	extit{Stesso}). The method is shown to improve 	extit{quantum costs} compared to compositions using standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum circuit optimization is crucial for future quantum computing. Reducing the number of quantum operations is essential for practical applications.

Method: The paper introduces a new method called Stesso, utilizing support (ancilla) qubits to decompose Toffoli gates.

Result: The decomposition method results in lower quantum costs for $(n+1)$-	extit{bit Toffoli} gates compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: Stesso offers an optimized approach for decomposing multi-qubit Toffoli gates with potential practical applications in quantum computing.

Abstract: An $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gate is mainly utilized to construct other quantum
gates and operators, such as Fredkin gates, arithmetical adders, and logical
comparators, where $n \geq 2$. Several researchers introduced different methods
to decompose $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates in a quantum circuit into a set of
standard 3-bit Toffoli gates or a set of elementary quantum gates, such as
single-qubit and two-qubit gates. However, these methods are not effectively
reconfigurable for linearly connected symmetrical structures (layouts) of
contemporary quantum computers, usually utilizing more ancilla qubits. This
paper introduces a new structural design method to effectively decompose
$(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates by utilizing configurable ancilla qubits, which we
named the ``support qubits". Collectively, we call our decomposition method for
symmetrical structures using support qubits the ``step-decreasing structures
shaped operators (Stesso)". The main advantage of Stesso is to configurable
construct different decomposed operators of various polarities and intermediate
sub-circuits, such as Positive Polarity-Stesso, Mixed Polarity-Stesso, and
Generalized-Stesso. With Stesso, it has been experimentally proven that
$(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates always have lower quantum costs than using
conventional composition methods.

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for quantum-coherent nonlinear
interferometry in which the nonlinear medium is modeled as active
electron-phonon quantum systems rather than a passive $\chi^{(2)}$ converter.
By explicitly retaining the quantum coherence of the coupled
electron-phonon-photon dynamics, our model describes a two-stage buildup of
entanglement - first between signal and idler photons and subsequently between
idler photons mediated by material coherence. This coherent light-matter
interaction imprints the internal dynamics of the medium onto the
interferometer output, yielding phase-sensitive interference that enables
indirect readout of terahertz-band signal modes via near-infrared detection.
The results reveal a route toward entanglement-assisted terahertz sensing and
establish a general framework for treating nonlinear quantum media as active
components in interferometric architectures.

Abstract: We propose a practical hybrid decoding scheme for the parity-encoding
architecture. This architecture was first introduced by N. Sourlas as a
computational technique for tackling hard optimization problems, especially
those modeled by spin systems such as the Ising model and spin glasses, and
reinvented by W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller to develop quantum annealing
devices. We study the specific model, called the SLHZ model, aiming to achieve
a near-term quantum annealing device implemented solely through geometrically
local spin interactions. Taking account of the close connection between the
SLHZ model and a classical low-density-parity-check code, two approaches can be
chosen for the decoding: (1) finding the ground state of a spin Hamiltonian
derived from the SLHZ model, which can be achieved via stochastic decoders such
as quantum annealing or classical Monte Carlo samplers; (2) using deterministic
decoding techniques for the classical LDPC code, such as belief propagation and
bit-flip decoder. The proposed hybrid approach combines the two approaches by
applying bit-flip decoding to the readout of the stochastic decoder based on
the SLHZ model. We present simulations demonstrating that this approach can
reveal the latent potential of the SLHZ model, realizing soft-annealing concept
proposed by Sourlas.

Abstract: We propose a fundamentally new design strategy of light-pulsed atom
interferometry (LPAI) with a single atomic beam splitter. A traditional
$\pi/2$-pulse Raman beam is employed to render a small momentum transfer at the
initial state. After a short period of evolution during which physical relevant
information can be loaded, a quantum weak measurement is applied to the
internal state of the atoms. The final information will be detected from the
transmission spectrum of a probe light to obviate the measurement of
florescence signal. An effective amplification of the order of $10^3$ about the
momentum offset is achieved in our simulation employing $Cs$ atoms with current
experimental condition. Our proposal offers a cost-effective, high-accuracy
measurement and readout strategy for LPAI. Furthermore, the strategy makes the
physical setup much simpler and more compact offering new direction towards
portable sensitive LPAI.

Abstract: We study nonstabilizerness on the information lattice, and demonstrate that
noninteger local information directly indicates nonstabilizerness. For states
with a clear separation of short- and large-scale information, noninteger total
information at large scales $\Gamma$ serves as a witness of long-range
nonstabilizerness. We propose a folding procedure to separate the global and
edge-to-edge contributions to $\Gamma$. As an example we show that the
ferromagnetic ground state of the spin-1/2 three-state Potts model has
long-range nonstabilizerness originating from global correlations, while the
paramagnetic ground state has at most short-range nonstabilizerness.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Maximum Matching problem has a quantum query complexity lower bound of
$\Omega(n^{3/2})$ for graphs on $n$ vertices represented by an adjacency
matrix. The current best quantum algorithm has the query complexity
$O(n^{7/4})$, which is an improvement over the trivial bound $O(n^2)$.
Constructing a quantum algorithm for this problem with a query complexity
improving the upper bound $O(n^{7/4})$ is an open problem. The quantum walk
technique is a general framework for constructing quantum algorithms by
transforming a classical random walk search into a quantum search, and has been
successfully applied to constructing an algorithm with a tight query complexity
for another problem. In this work we show that the quantum walk technique fails
to produce a fast algorithm improving the known (or even the trivial) upper
bound on the query complexity. Specifically, if a quantum walk algorithm
designed with the known technique solves the Maximum Matching problem using
$O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ queries with any constant $\epsilon>0$, and if the
underlying classical random walk is independent of an input graph, then the
guaranteed time complexity is larger than any polynomial of $n$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay between quantum chaos, thermalization, and quantum error correction is crucial for advancing quantum theory and developing quantum technologies.

Method: The authors utilize the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and the matrix ansatz to analyze the out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC) and derive bounds on dynamical fluctuations, providing a precise link between the three phenomena.

Result: A quantitative relation is derived, linking the error of a quantum error-correcting code to information scrambling (measured by the Lyapunov exponent) and the dynamics of thermalization.

Conclusion: This work bridges three key areas of quantum many-body physics, revealing how quantum chaos constrains information preservation in thermalizing systems, with implications for fault-tolerant quantum computing and the physics of black holes.

Abstract: Quantum error correction, thermalization, and quantum chaos are fundamental
aspects of quantum many-body physics that have each developed largely
independently, despite their deep conceptual overlap. In this work, we
establish a precise link between all three in systems that satisfy the
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and exhibit a well-defined hierarchy
of time scales between dissipation and scrambling. Building on the ETH matrix
ansatz and the structure of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), we show
that the chaos bound directly constrains the error of an approximate quantum
error-correcting code. This establishes a quantitative relation between
information scrambling, thermalization, and correctability. Furthermore, we
derive bounds on dynamical fluctuations around the infinite-time average and on
fluctuation-dissipation relations, expressed in terms of both the code error
and the Lyapunov exponent. Our results reveal how the limits of quantum chaos
constrain information preservation in thermalizing quantum systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper extends the understanding of quantum channel discrimination by introducing the concept of antidiscrimination in the presence of entangled states.

Method: The authors explore quantum channels and their properties by considering entangled states of a specific dimensionality and analyzing measurable outcomes.

Result: For even-dimensional entangled states, three projective measurements exhibit unique antidiscriminable behavior that product states lack.

Conclusion: This work highlights the role of entanglement in quantum channels beyond discrimination, suggesting potential applications in quantum information processing and cryptography.

Abstract: Piani and Watrous [Phys. Rev. Lett.102, 250501 (2009)] proved that all
entangled states are useful for discrimination of quantum channels. We pose the
same question in the context of antidiscrimination of quantum channels. We
partially answer this by showing that for every $d\otimes d$ entangled state
(with even $d$), there exist three projective measurements which are
antidiscriminable (but not discriminable) with that input state but those three
measurements are not antidiscriminable with the product probe.

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为量子网络提供了实用的制备方法，还加深了我们对 multipartite 系统中量子纠缠结构的理解，展示了如何更有效地利用量子资源优化网络性能。

Abstract: In quantum networks, after passing through noisy channels or information
processing, residual states may lack sufficient entanglement for further tasks,
yet they may retain hidden quantum resources that can be recycled. Efficiently
recycling these states to extract entanglement resources such as genuine
multipartite entanglement or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs is essential for
optimizing network performance. Here, we develop a tripartite entanglement
distillation scheme using an eight-photon quantum platform, demonstrating
entanglement superactivation phenomena which are unique to multipartite
systems. We successfully generate a three-photon genuinely entangled state from
two bi-separable states via local operations and classical communication,
demonstrating superactivation of genuine multipartite entanglement.
Furthermore, we extend our scheme to generate a three-photon state capable of
extracting an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair from two initial states lacking this
capability, revealing a previously unobserved entanglement superactivation
phenomenon. Our methods and findings offer not only practical applications for
quantum networks, but also lead to a deeper understanding of multipartite
entanglement structures.

Abstract: The Lotka-Volterra model is a paradigm for self-organized predator-prey
oscillations in far-from-equilibrium systems, yet testing it in real-world
ecosystems is hindered by uncontrollable microscopic parameters. Here, we
propose a quantum analogue of predator-prey dynamics using a tunable
two-dimensional Rydberg atom array. Through mean-field analysis and numerical
simulations based on the open-system discrete truncated Wigner approximation,
we demonstrate that Rydberg excitations exhibit predator-prey cycles on
microsecond timescales. We show that quantum coherence drives spontaneous
symmetry breaking, while long-range interactions stabilize global oscillations
against quantum-noise-induced desynchronization. We further reveal that quantum
jump induce quasicycles whose amplitude scales inversely with the square root
of the system size. Our work extends the study of predator-prey models to the
quantum realm and advances quantum simulation stratagies that leverage
engineered many-body nonequilibrium effects.

Abstract: Simulation of the time-dynamics of fermionic many-body systems has long been
predicted to be one of the key applications of quantum computers. Such
simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical
to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and
materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to
clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of
all previous digital quantum simulations has been matched by classical methods,
and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale
quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we
implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System
Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit
system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the
periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge
separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the
limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical
simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum
device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the
effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between
charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by
classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum
computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the

our model highlights an efficiency threshold for unconditional advantage of
single photons over laser along with insights on the interplay between

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Bell inequality violation is the phenomenon where multiple non-communicating
parties can exhibit correlations using quantum resources that are impossible if
they can only use classical resources. One way to enforce non-communication is
to apply a latency constraint: the parties must all produce outputs after they
receive their inputs within a time window shorter than the speed of light delay
between any pair of parties. If this latency constraint is relaxed so that a
subset of the parties can communicate, we can obtain a new set of inequalities
on correlations that extends Bell inequalities in a very natural way. Moreover,
with this relaxed latency constraint, we can also have quantum communication
between a subset of parties and thereby achieve possible quantum violations of
these new inequalities. We ultimately wish to answer the fundamental question:
"What are the physically realizable correlations between multiple parties under
varying latency constraints?" To answer this question, we introduce
latency-constrained games, a mathematical framework that extends nonlocal games
to the setting where a subset of parties can communicate. The notion of
latency-constrained games can have real-world applications, including high
frequency trading, distributed computing, computer architecture, and
distributed control systems.

Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs) exploit collective quantum resources to surpass the

cavity-coupled QBs governed by Dicke and Tavis--Cummings models under Gaussian
driving and open-system dynamics. Finite-size scaling laws
$\mathcal{O}(N)\!\sim\!N^{\alpha}$ demonstrate an optimal region of relaxation
and dephasing where coherent driving stabilizes entanglement entropy growth for
thermodynamic observables (maximum energy $E_{\mathrm{max}}$, charging time
$\tau$, and maximum power $\bar{P}_{\mathrm{max}}$) and for qubit and cavity
entanglement entropies. The Dicke model exhibits entropy-suppressed extensive
behavior, while the Tavis--Cummings model achieves super-extensive scaling with
$\alpha_{E_{\mathrm{max}}}\!\in\![1.08,1.26]$, $\alpha_{\tau}\!\approx\!-0.49$,
$\alpha_{\bar{P}_{\mathrm{max}}}\!\in\![1.57,1.73]$, supported by qubit-cavity
entanglement. We demonstrate that dissipation can act as a stabilizer source,
yielding scaling benchmarks that are relevant to several experimental

Method: The authors propose a framework based on a specially designed input state using a linear combination technique. This approach modifies the set of states reachable by the original circuit, enhancing accuracy while preserving efficiency.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates consistently higher accuracy in ground-state preparation across different model systems (transverse-field Ising, cluster-Ising, and Fermi-Hubbard models) compared to standard VQAs, achieving this under the same gate budget.

Conclusion: The results highlight input-state design as a powerful complement to circuit design in realizing VQAs that are both expressive and trainable. This framework provides a general approach to address the key challenge in VQAs, paving the way for more effective quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) face an inherent trade-off between
expressivity and trainability: deeper circuits can represent richer states but
suffer from noise accumulation and barren plateaus, while shallow circuits
remain trainable and implementable but lack expressive power. Here, we propose
a general framework to address this challenge by enhancing the VQA performance
with a specially designed input state constructed using a linear combination
technique. This approach systematically modified the set of states reachable by
the original circuit, enhancing accuracy while preserving efficiency. We
provide a rigorous proof that such framework increases the expressive capacity
of any given VQA ansatz, and demonstrate its broad applicability across
different ansatz families. As applications, we apply the method to ground-state
preparation of the transverse-field Ising, cluster-Ising, and Fermi-Hubbard
models, achieving consistently higher accuracy under the same gate budget
compared with standard VQAs. These results highlight input-state design as a
powerful complement to circuit design in realizing VQAs that are both
expressive and trainable.

### [120] [Quadratic Quantum Speedup for Finding Independent Set of a Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26395)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  paper demonstrates a quadratic speedup in quantum adiabatic algorithms for finding independent sets in graphs compared to classical algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  investigating quantum adiabatic algorithms and their potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems like finding independent sets in graphs.

Method:  used mathematical analysis including magnus expansion in interaction picture and numerical simulations to analyze quantum adiabatic algorithm's performance.

Result:  quantum algorithm achieves O(n^2) time complexity for finding large independent sets, and O(n) for size-2, outperforming classical O(n^2) algorithm.

Conclusion:  quantum adiabatic algorithm exhibits quadratic speedup over classical methods for independent set problems.

Abstract: A quadratic speedup of the quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA) for finding
independent sets (ISs) in a graph is proven analytically. In comparison to the
best classical algorithm with $O(n^2)$ scaling, where $n$ is the number of
vertexes, our quantum algorithm achieves a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ for
finding a large IS, which reduces to $O(n)$ for identifying a size-2 IS. The
complexity bounds we obtain are confirmed numerically for a specific case with
the $O(n^2)$ quantum algorithm outperforming the classical greedy algorithm,
that also runs in $O(n^2)$. The definitive analytical and numerical evidence
for the quadratic quantum speedup benefited from an analytical framework based
on the Magnus expansion in the interaction picture (MEIP), which overcomes the
dependence on the ground state degeneracy encountered in conventional energy
gap analysis. In addition, our analysis links the performance of QAA to the
spectral structure of the median graph, bridging algorithmic complexity, graph
theory, and experimentally realizable Rydberg Hamiltonians. The understanding
gained provides practical guidance for optimizing near-term Rydberg atom
experiments by revealing the significant impact of detuning on blockade
violations.

Abstract: We present a practical design framework for high-fidelity quantum control in
coupled Kerr-nonlinear oscillators, directly addressing the challenge of
spectral crowding. We show that systematic spectral degeneracies, which hinder
selective addressing, are a direct consequence of rational Kerr-nonlinearity
ratios ($K_1/K_2$). Our solution is a universal architectural principle:
engineer this ratio to be a complex rational value, approximating an
incommensurate number to systematically eliminate parasitic resonances. Using a
Magnus expansion, we derive a complete effective Hamiltonian, including all
Stark-shift corrections, to accurately target transitions. We numerically
validate this framework by demonstrating protocols for the deterministic
synthesis of NOON states, and high-photon-number Fock states (e.g., $n=4$),
achieving ideal fidelities exceeding $\mathcal{F}>99.9\%$. The protocols are
shown to be robust against environmental decay and thermal effects. This work
provides an architectural blueprint for bosonic processors in circuit QED and
establishes foundational principles that could inform future designs of
multi-mode quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantum Random Number Generators provide true physical randomness based on
quantum processes, essential for cryptographic and scientific applications.
However, practical implementations face challenges in robustness and
verifiability: ensuring that the entropy source remains secure and stable over
time, and enabling independent confirmation of randomness quality without
compromising security. We present a system based on a simple looped beam
splitter architecture that uses only passive optical components. The device
features an intrinsic self-testing mechanism derived from the stability of
detection-probability ratios, allowing continuous validation of correct
operation. In addition, the same physical process generates two independent
random sequences with identical entropy: a private sequence, used for secure
applications, and a public one, enabling external statistical verification with
zero mutual information between them. This approach demonstrates that robust,
self-testing, and publicly verifiable quantum randomness can be achieved with
minimal optical complexity without jeopardizing security.

*Hashir Kuniyil,Asad Ali,Saif Al-Kuwari*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We explore the limits of spatial resolution in quantum imaging using entangled photon pairs and identify a unified model for phase-matching, nonlinear crystals, and pump size to optimize resolution and entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge in quantum imaging by proposing a unified model to optimize both spatial resolution and entanglement, which are often conflicting requirements.

Method: We develop a mathematical framework that incorporates phase-matching, crystal properties, pump size, and spectral filtering to analyze and model the transverse correlations in both near and far-field planes. The model explicitly considers both degenerate and non-degenerate Type-I SPDC processes.

Result: Through our model, we demonstrate that narrowband signal filtering can influence frequency-angle mixing, and by incorporating crystal length, pump beam waist, and spectral filtering, we effectively minimize conditional position uncertainty. This leads to enhanced spatial resolution while maintaining multimode structures necessary for imaging. Additionally, we correct the apparent degradation of entanglement caused by birefringent walk-off in bulk crystals, thereby recovering the correct correlation ridges and improving entanglement strength.

Conclusion: Our findings provide practical design rules for optimizing quantum microscopy and ghost imaging setups, enabling simultaneous high spatial resolution and robust entanglement certification. These quantitative relationships guide the selection and optimization of experimental parameters for practical applications in quantum imaging.

Abstract: Quantum imaging with entangled photon pairs promises performance beyond
classical limits, yet phase-matching, nonlinear crystal properties, and pump
size jointly constrain its ultimate spatial resolution. We develop a unified
model that relates these factors to the transverse correlations observed in
both near and far-field planes, treating both degenerate and non-degenerate
Type-I SPDC processes equally. By explicitly incorporating crystal length, pump
beam waist, and spectral filtering into the biphoton amplitude, we demonstrate
that narrowband signal filtering influences frequency-angle mixing. This
approach minimizes conditional position uncertainty, particularly in
non-degenerate SPDC scenarios, which enhances spatial resolution while
maintaining the necessary multimode structure for imaging. We further analyze
birefringent walk-off in bulk crystals and demonstrate that its apparent
degradation of entanglement, such as weakened transverse anti-correlations and
inflated Reid products, can be corrected. This correction follows frequency
non-degeneracy and walk-off-aware reconstruction, recovering the correct
correlation ridge and improving entanglement strength. The framework provides
quantitative design rules that link filter bandwidth, crystal length, and pump
waist to achievable resolution. Our results offer practical guidance for
optimizing quantum microscopy and ghost imaging setups, where achieving high
spatial resolution and robust entanglement certification simultaneously is
crucial.

Abstract: Network nonlocality, a recently noted form of nonlocality has been shown to
have distinctive features, marking a significant departure from the notion of
standard Bell nonlocality in the context of quantum correlations. On a
pragmatic front, it has gained significant importance as researchers worldwide
actively engage in the study on quantum networks. However, as typical to any
quantum resource, network nonlocality is also vulnerable to environmental
noise, which sometimes prove to be detrimental. Environmental interactions are
modeled in terms of quantum channels. In the present study, we introduce and
characterize network nonlocality breaking channels. Network nonlocality
breaking channels model environmental influences which results in the loss of
resource, i.e., the system loses its nonlocal resource due to such
interactions. The study is done in the ambit of some suitably chosen
inequalities in (i) linear networks and (ii) star-shaped networks. Further, the
loss in full network nonlocality is also studied. Furthermore, we also
characterize quantum channels according to their ability in preserving quantum
resources, i.e., they do not break network nonlocality, which enables one to
identify useful quantum channels in networks. The study is vindicated by
illustrations from various noise models like depolarizing and dephasing
channels.

Abstract: Quantum catalysts enable transformations that otherwise would be forbidden,
offering a pathway to surpass conventional limits in quantum information
processing. Among them, embezzling catalysts stand out for achieving
near-perfect performance while tolerating only minimal disturbance, bridging
the gap between ideal and practical catalysis. Yet, this superior capability
comes at a cost: Each use slightly degrades the catalyst, leading to an
inevitable accumulation of imperfection. This gradual decay defines their most
distinctive property -- reusability -- which, despite its fundamental
importance, remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish a quantitative
framework to characterize the operational lifetime of embezzling catalysts,
focusing on their role in entanglement distillation and extending the analysis
to quantum teleportation. We show that the catalytic advantage inevitably
diminishes with repeated use, deriving bounds on the maximum effective reuse
rounds for a desired performance gain. Our results uncover the finite
reusability of catalysts in quantum processes and point toward sustainable
strategies for quantum communication.

Conclusion: 该论文在量子测距领域提供了一种新的方法，利用许多体相互作用或时变项 Hamiltonians，尤其在耗散系统中具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Super-Heisenberg scaling, which scales as $N^{-\beta}$ with $\beta>1$ in
terms of the number of particles $N$ or $T^{-\beta}$ in terms of the evolution
time $T$, is better than Heisenberg scaling in quantum metrology. It has been
proven that super-Heisenberg scaling can be achieved when the Hamiltonian of
the system involves many-body interactions or the time-dependent terms. We
demonstrate that nonlinear quantum scrambling facilitates the achievement of
super-Heisenberg scaling $T^{-\beta}$ when the generator of the parameter is
time-independent. More importantly, in dissipative systems, we can still obtain
super-Heisenberg scaling in the friction model. In the optical cavity system,
an exponential improvement in measurement precision over time can be achieved
by combining injected external squeezing and intracavity squeezing. Our work
provides an optimal method for leveraging nonlinear resources to enhance the
measurement precision of the driving field.

Abstract: Allowing the order of quantum operations to exist in superposition is known
to open new routes for thermodynamic tasks. We investigate a quantum heat
engine where energy exchanges are driven by generalized measurements, and the
sequence of these operations is coherently controlled in a superposition of
causal orders. Our analysis explores how initial correlations between the
working medium and the controller affect the engine's performance. Considering
uncorrelated, classically correlated, and entangled initial states, we show
that entanglement enables the superposed causal order to generate coherence in
the working medium, thereby enhancing work extraction and efficiency beyond the
separable and uncorrelated cases. Finally, we present a proof-of-principle
simulation on the IBM Quantum Experience platform, realizing a quantum switch
of two measurement channels with tunable strengths and experimentally
confirming the predicted efficiency enhancement enabled by correlation-assisted
superposed causal order.

Result: By applying these methods to optimize a JTWPA with SNAILs, the researchers achieved significant performance improvements in weak signal amplification.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable tool for the design and optimization of advanced superconducting circuits with nonlinear components.

Abstract: In this contribution we present JosephsonCircuitsOptimizer.jl (JCO), a

for Julia. It models superconducting circuits that include Josephson junctions
(JJs) and other nonlinear elements within a lumped-element approach, leveraging
harmonic balance, a frequency-domain technique that provides a computationally
efficient alternative to traditional time-domain simulations. JCO automates the
evaluation of optimal circuit parameters by implementing Bayesian optimization
with Gaussian processes through a device-specific metric and identifying the
optimal working point to achieve a defined performance function. This makes it
well suited for circuits with strong nonlinearity and a high-dimensional set of
coupled design parameters. To demonstrate its capabilities, we focus on
optimizing a Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier (JTWPA) based on
Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLements (SNAILs), operating in
the three-wave mixing regime. The device consists of an array of unit cells,
each containing a loop with multiple JJs, that amplifies weak quantum signals

optimization strategies, the framework supports the systematic development of
superconducting circuits for a broad range of applications.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenge of selecting the optimal mitigation method for specific quantum applications, particularly as hardware improvements and error correction advancements are expected to further reduce logical error rates.

Method: The authors propose a systematic approach involving the creation of quantitative metrics, qualitative criteria, application-specific certifications, a taxonomy of mitigation methods, and a comprehensive evaluation framework to design and assess mitigation strategies tailored to specific hardware.

Result: The framework presented in the paper enables a future-proof comparison of mitigation methods, taking into account ongoing advancements in logical gate quality and characterizing the effectiveness of mitigation strategies based on scalability, efficiency, and robustness.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by highlighting that accurate and precise characterization of hardware issues is the most significant factor in achieving efficient mitigation, providing a robust methodology for developing and evaluating mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Numerous mitigation methods exist for quantum noise suppression, making it
challenging to identify the optimum approach for a specific application;
especially as ongoing advances in hardware tuning and error correction are
expected to reduce logical error rates. In order to facilitate the future-proof
application-dependent comparison of mitigation methods, we develop a set of
quantitative metrics that account for continual improvements in logical gate
quality. We use these metrics to define qualitative criteria (e.g. scalability,
efficiency, and robustness to characterised imperfections in the mitigation
implementation), which we combine into application-specific certifications. We
then provide a taxonomy of linear mitigation methods, characterising them by
their features and requirements. Finally, we use our framework to produce and
evaluate a mitigation strategy. A mitigation strategy is a collections of
mitigation methods and compilation procedures designed to mitigate all relevant
errors for a given piece of characterised hardware. Our example mitigation
strategy is targeted at mitigating the outputs of hardware suffering from
stochastic noise and/or rotational errors. We find the most significant
determinant of efficient mitigation is accurate and precise characterisation.

*Sumit Mukherjee,Jonte R. Hance*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the implications of Wigner's Friend paradox in a causal setting, introducing a new inequality violation in quantum mechanics under specific assumptions. It argues that relaxing these assumptions still results in quantum incompatibility, emphasizing the foundational importance of the paradox. More details below:


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum paradoxes and their foundational implications is key to advancing quantum theory. This paper contributes by examining the causal dynamics and testing the robustness of previous results.

Method: The authors build on the Local Friendliness Theorem and introduce Axiological Time Symmetry (ATS). They derive a causal inequality and test its violation by quantum mechanics. They also explore a weaker version of AOE to assess the necessity of its strength in the original assumption.

Result: Quantum mechanics violates the derived inequality and a weaker version of the assumption, showing that even with relaxed conditions, the incompatibility persists. This highlights the deep foundational issues arising from Wigner's Friend paradox in relativistic scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper strengthens the case that Wigner's Friend paradox is fundamental to quantum theory, particularly in causal structures. It underscores the need for further exploration of these paradoxes to understand the limits of classical notions of time and causality in quantum mechanics.

Abstract: Wigner's Friend-type paradoxes challenge the assumption that events are
absolute -- that when we measure a system, we obtain a single result, which is
not relative to anything or anyone else. These paradoxes highlight the tension
between quantum theory and our intuitions about reality being
observer-independent. Building on a recent result that developed these
paradoxes into a no-go theorem, namely the Local Friendliness Theorem, we
introduce the Causal Friendliness Paradox, a time-ordered analogue of it. In
this framework, we replace the usual locality assumption with Axiological Time
Symmetry (ATS), and show that, when combined with the assumptions of
Absoluteness of Observed Events (AOE), No Retrocausality (NRC), and Screening
via Pseudo Events (SPE), we obtain a causal inequality. We then show that
quantum mechanics violates this inequality and is therefore incompatible with
at least one of these assumptions. To probe which assumption might be
incompatible, we then examine whether AOE in its entirety is essential for this
no-go result. We propose a weaker, operational form of AOE that still leads to
inequalities that quantum mechanics violates. This result shows that even under
relaxed assumptions, quantum theory resists reconciliation with classical
notions of absolute events, reinforcing the foundational significance of
Wigner's Friend-type paradoxes in timelike scenarios.

Abstract: We study the problem of adding native pulse-level control to heterogeneous
High Performance Computing-Quantum Computing (HPCQC) software stacks, using the
Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS) as a case study. The goal is to expand the
capabilities of HPCQC environments by offering the ability for low-level access
and control, currently typically not foreseen for such hybrid systems. For
this, we need to establish new interfaces that integrate such pulse-level
control into the lower layers of the software stack, including the need for
proper representation.
  Pulse-level quantum programs can be fully described with only three low-level
abstractions: ports (input/output channels), frames (reference signals), and
waveforms (pulse envelopes). We identify four key challenges to represent those
pulse abstractions at: the user-interface level, at the compiler level
(including the Intermediate Representation (IR)), and at the backend-interface
level (including the appropriate exchange format). For each challenge, we
propose concrete solutions in the context of MQSS. These include introducing a
compiled (C/C++) pulse Application Programming Interface (API) to overcome
Python runtime overhead, extending its LLVM support to include pulse-related
instructions, using its C-based backend interface to query relevant hardware
constraints, and designing a portable exchange format for pulse sequences. Our
integrated approach provides an end-to-end path for pulse-aware compilation and
runtime execution in HPCQC environments. This work lays out the architectural
blueprint for extending HPCQC integration to support pulse-level quantum
operations without disrupting state-of-the-art classical workflows.

Abstract: We characterize various dynamical phases of the simplest version of the
quantum kicked-top model, a paradigmatic system for studying quantum chaos.
This system exhibits both regular and chaotic behavior depending on the kick
strength. The existence of the $2$-DTC phase has previously been reported
around the rotationally symmetric point of the system, where it displays
regular dynamics. We show that the system hosts robust $2$-DTC and dynamical
freezing (DF) phases around alternating rotationally symmetric points.
Interestingly, we also identify $4$-DTC phases that cannot be explained by the
system's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry; these phases become stable for higher values
of angular momentum. We explain the emergence of higher-order DTC phases
through classical phase portraits of the system, connected with spin coherent
states (SCSs). The $4$-DTC phases appear for certain initial states that are
close to the spiral saddle points identified in the classical picture.
Moreover, the linear entropy decreases as the angular momentum increases,
indicating enhanced stability of the $4$-DTC phases. We also find an emergent
conservation law for both the $2$-DTC and DF phases, while dynamical
conservation arises periodically for the $4$-DTC phases.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a general form of a two-parameter family of local
interactions between quantum walkers conditioned on the internal state of their
coins. By choosing their particular case, we systematically study the impact of
these interactions on the dynamics of two initially localized and noncorrelated
walkers. Our general interaction framework, which reduces to several previously
studied models as special cases, provides a versatile platform for engineering
quantum correlations with applications in quantum simulation, state
preparation, and sensing protocols. It also opens up the possibility of
analyzing many-body interactions for larger numbers of walkers.

Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of quantum impurity models remains a fundamental
challenge due to the complex memory effects that arise from system-environment
interactions. Of particular interest are two-time correlation functions of an
impurity, which are central to the characterization of these many-body systems,
and are a cornerstone of the description of correlated materials in dynamical
mean field theory (DMFT). In this work, we extend our previous work on the
extrapolation of single-time observables to demonstrate an efficient scheme for
computing two-time impurity correlation functions, by combining the
non-Markovian quantum Mpemba effect (NMQMpE) with a dynamical map-based
framework for open quantum systems. Our method is benchmarked against exact and
known accurate results in prototypical impurity models for both fermionic and
bosonic environments, demonstrating significant computational savings compared
to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents **FlowQ-Net**, a generative framework for automated quantum circuit design using GFlowNets. It efficiently synthesizes quantum circuits with multiple design objectives, outperforming existing methods significantly while maintaining accuracy, even under noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient quantum circuit design is crucial for NISQ devices, where resources are limited and error-prone. Traditional methods often struggle with combinatorial growth and suboptimal resource usage, necessitating a more efficient automated approach.

Method: FlowQ-Net employs a stochastic policy with GFlowNets to construct circuits sequentially. It uses a flexible reward function to balance multiple design objectives like performance, depth, and gate counts.

Result: FlowQ-Net generates circuits 10-30 times more compact than baseline methods without sacrificing accuracy and performs well under realistic quantum noise.

Conclusion: The framework represents a promising advancement in automated quantum circuit design, paving the way for more efficient algorithms and applications in quantum computing.

Abstract: Designing efficient quantum circuits is a central bottleneck to exploring the
potential of quantum computing, particularly for noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices, where circuit efficiency and resilience to errors are
paramount. The search space of gate sequences grows combinatorially, and
handcrafted templates often waste scarce qubit and depth budgets. We introduce
\textsc{FlowQ-Net} (Flow-based Quantum design Network), a generative framework
for automated quantum circuit synthesis based on Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets). This framework learns a stochastic policy to construct circuits
sequentially, sampling them in proportion to a flexible, user-defined reward
function that can encode multiple design objectives such as performance, depth,
and gate count. This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverse
ensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization.
We demonstrate the efficacy of \textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set of
simulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatz
design for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and image
classification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing. Circuits
designed by \textsc{FlowQ-Net} achieve significant improvements, yielding
circuits that are 10$\times$-30$\times$ more compact in terms of parameters,
gates, and depth compared to commonly used unitary baselines, without
compromising accuracy. This trend holds even when subjected to error profiles
from real-world quantum devices. Our results underline the potential of
generative models as a general-purpose methodology for automated quantum
circuit design, offering a promising path towards more efficient quantum
algorithms and accelerating scientific discovery in the quantum domain.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Unextendible product bases(UPBs) are central to the study of local
distinguishability of orthogonal product states. While their connection to
quantum nonlocality via Bell inequalities is well established, their link to
quantum contextuality remains largely unexplored. We establish a graph
theoretic connection between contextuality and UPBs. First, an equivalence
between Klyachko-Can-Binicio\u{g}lu-Shumovsky (KCBS) vectors and the Pyramid
UPB is shown and then by constructing a one parameter family of UPB vectors, a
quantitative connection between `contextuality strength' and bound entanglement
of states associated with the corresponding UPB is demonstrated. This
equivalence is extended to generalized KCBS vectors and the GenPyramid UPB. A
new class of minimal UPBs in $\mathbb{C}^3 \otimes \mathbb{C}^n$ is constructed
using Lov\'asz-optimal orthogonal representations (LOORs) of cycle graphs and
their complements which we term the GenContextual UPB. Any minimal UPB in this
dimension is shown to be graph-equivalent to the GenContextual UPB. We briefly
discuss the distinguishability properties of GenContextual UPB. In the reverse
direction, we observe that the constituent vectors of the QuadRes UPB are LOORs
of Paley graphs. The structural properties of these graphs make them suitable
candidates for constructing noncontextuality inequalities, thereby establishing
a bidirectional connection between quantum contextuality and UPBs.

Abstract: We investigate the power spectral density emitted by a superconducting
artificial atom coupled to the end of a semi-infinite transmission line and
driven by two continuous radio-frequency fields. In this setup, we observe the
generation of multiple frequency peaks and the formation of frequency combs
with equal detuning between those peaks. The frequency peaks originate from
wave mixing of the drive fields, mediated by the artificial atom, highlighting
the potential of this system as both a frequency converter and a frequency-comb
generator. We demonstrate precise control and tunability in generating these
frequency features, aligning well with theoretical predictions, across a
relatively wide frequency range (tens of MHz, exceeding the linewidth of the
artificial atom). The extensive and simple tunability of this frequency
converter and comb generator, combined with its small physical footprint, makes
it promising for quantum optics on chips and other applications in quantum
technology.

Abstract: We present a quantum-enhanced protocol for detecting wave-like dark matter
using an array of $N$ entangled superconducting cavities initialized in an
$m$-photon Fock state. By distributing and recollecting the quantum state with
an entanglement-distribution operation, the scan rate scales as $N^2(m+1)$
while thermal excitation is the dominant background, significantly
outperforming classical single-cavity methods under matched conditions. We
evaluate the robustness of our scheme against additional noise sources,
including decoherence and beamsplitter infidelity, through theoretical analysis
and numerical simulations. In practice, the key requirements, namely high-Q
superconducting radio-frequency cavities that support long integration times,
high-fidelity microwave beamsplitters, and universal cavity control, are
already available on current experimental platforms, making the protocol
experimentally feasible.

TL;DR: MAI protocols improve metrology and quantum correlation detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the use of measurement-after-interactions (MAI) protocols to enhance the detection of quantum correlations, such as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering and mode entanglement in non-Gaussian states, under noisy conditions.

Method: The authors employ theoretical analysis and simulations to demonstrate that linear measurements alone can detect these quantum correlations with increased noise robustness.

Result: The results show that MAI protocols enable the detection of quantum correlations in non-Gaussian states even in the presence of noise.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for robust quantum metrology and entanglement detection in practical scenarios with noise.

Abstract: Additional state evolutions performed before measurement, also called
measurement-after-interactions (MAI) protocols, have shown a great potential
for increasing the sensitivity of metrological scenarios. Here, we go beyond
this result and show that MAI techniques can significantly enhance the
detection capability of witnesses for quantum correlations. In particular, we
show the possibility of detecting Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering and mode
entanglement of non-Gaussian states from linear measurements only. Moreover, we
show that such approach allows for a significantly higher noise robustness.

Conclusion: 该研究为构建量子计算架构提供了新思路。

Abstract: Wigner negativity and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) are key
nonclassical resources that enable computational advantages and broader
quantum-information tasks. In this work, we prove two theorems for multimode
continuous-variable systems that relate these nonclassical resources. Both
theorems show that "enough" Wigner negativity -- either a large-enough Wigner
negativity volume along a suitably-chosen two-dimensional slice, or a
large-enough nonclassicality depth of the centre-of-mass of a system --
certifies the presence of GME. Moreover, violations of the latter inequality
provide lower bounds of the trace distance to the set of non-GME states. Our
results also provide sufficient conditions for generating GME by interfering a
state with the vacuum through a multiport interferometer, complementing
long-known necessary conditions. Beyond these fundamental connections, our
methods have practical advantages for systems with native phase-space
measurements: they require only measuring the Wigner function over a finite
region, or measuring a finite number of characteristic function points. Such
measurements are frequently performed with readouts common in circuit/cavity
quantum electrodynamic systems, trapped ions and atoms, and circuit quantum
acoustodynamic systems. As such, our GME criteria are readily implementable in
these platforms.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes GME witnesses using phase-space measurements, outperforming current methods with fewer settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating GME in CV systems with limited qubit readouts is challenging, prompting the need for efficient alternatives.

Method: Leverages phase-space measurements with Gaussian unitaries, offering five specific schemes using parity, displacement, and beamsplitters.

Result: The witnesses detect known CV GME states and are robust to noise.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable fewer measurement settings than full tomography, making them practical for current architectures.

Abstract: Many existing genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) witnesses for
continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems typically rely on quadrature
measurements, which is challenging to implement in platforms where the CV
degrees of freedom can be indirectly accessed only through qubit readouts. In
this work, we propose methods to implement GME witnesses through phase-space
measurements in state-of-the-art experimental platforms, leveraging controlled
Gaussian unitaries readily available in qubit-CV architectures. Based on two
theoretical results showing that sufficient Wigner negativity can certify GME,
we present five concrete implementation schemes using controlled parity,
displacement, and beamsplitter operations. Our witnesses can detect
paradigmatic GME states like the Dicke and multipartite $N00N$ states, which
include the W states as a special case, and GHZ-type entangled cat states. We
analyze the performance of these witnesses under realistic noise conditions and
finite measurement resolution, showing their robustness to experimental
imperfections. Crucially, our implementations require exponentially fewer
measurement settings than full tomography, with one scheme requiring only a
single measurement on auxiliary modes. The methods are readily applicable to
circuit/cavity quantum electrodynamics, circuit quantum acoustodynamics, as
well as trapped ions and atoms systems, where such dichotomic phase-space
measurements are already routinely performed as native readouts.

Conclusion: 通过最小化量子纠缠资源和技术的结合，该框架为扩大量子计算规模提供了更高效的方法。

Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) provides a promising route toward
scalable quantum computation, where entanglement-assisted LOCC and circuit
knitting represent two complementary approaches. The former deterministically
realizes nonlocal operations but demands extensive entanglement resources,
whereas the latter requires no entanglement yet suffers from exponential
sampling overhead. Here, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates these
two paradigms by performing circuit knitting assisted with a limited amount of
entanglement. We establish a general theoretical formulation that yields lower
bounds on the optimal sampling overhead and present a constructive protocol
demonstrating that a single shared Bell pair can reduce the overhead to the
asymptotic limit of standard circuit knitting without requiring classical
communication. This hybrid approach enhances both sampling and entanglement
efficiency, enabling more resource-practical implementations of distributed
quantum computation.

Abstract: High-fidelity spin readout is a crucial component for quantum information
processing with optically interfaced solid-state spins. Here, we propose and
investigate two theoretical protocols for fast single-shot readout of
cavity-coupled single T center electronic spins. For fluorescence-based
readout, we selectively couple one of the T center spin-conserving transitions
to a single-mode photonic cavity, exploiting the enhancement of the
fluorescence emission and cyclicity. For reflection-based readout, we leverage
the spin-dependent cavity reflection contrast to generate the qubit readout
signal. We show that the cavity reflection approach enables high-fidelity spin
readout even when the T center only has a modest cyclicity. With realistic
system parameters, such as cavity quality factor $Q = 2\times10^5$ and T center
optical linewidth $\Gamma/2\pi = 100$ MHz, we calculate a single-shot readout
fidelity exceeding 99% within 8.7 $\mu$s for both spin readout protocols.

Abstract: We employ real-space, real-time time-dependent density functional theory
(TDDFT) combined with Ehrenfest dynamics to investigate ultrafast
intermolecular relaxation following inner-valence ionization in hydrated
pyrrole. This time-dependent approach treats electronic and nuclear motions
simultaneously, allowing the description of electronic excitation, charge
transfer, ionization, and nuclear motion.When the initial vacancy in the O 2s 1
state is created on the water molecule, the system predominantly undergoes
intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) and electron-transfer mediated decay
(ETMD), accompanied by pronounced charge transfer between pyrrole and water. In
contrast, ionization of the pyrrole site for N 2s electron leads to both ICD
and Auger decay channels. These results demonstrate that the decay dynamics are
strongly governed by the initial vacancy location, offering microscopic insight
into intermolecular energy-transfer mechanisms in hydrated molecular systems.

For cationic AAA a machine-learned potential energy surface (ML-PES) trained on

neutral AMA the NH- and OH-stretch spectra are strongly red-shifted below 3000

Abstract: Oxide-water interfaces govern a wide range of physical and chemical processes
fundamental to many fields like catalysis, geochemistry, corrosion,
electrochemistry, and sensor technology. Near solid oxide surfaces, water
behaves differently than in the bulk, exhibiting pronounced structuring and
increased reactivity, typically requiring ab initio-level accuracy for reliable
modeling. However, explicit ab initio calculations are often computationally
prohibitive, especially if large system sizes and long simulation time scales
are required. By learning the potential energy surface (PES) from data obtained
from electronic structure calculations, machine learning potentials (MLPs) have
emerged as transformative tools, enabling simulations with ab initio accuracy
at dramatically reduced computational expense. Here, we provide an overview of
recent progress in the application of MLPs to atomistic simulations of
oxide-water interfaces. Specifically, we review insights that have been gained
into the reactivity of interfacial systems involving the dissociation and
recombination of water molecules, proton transfer processes between the solvent
and the surface and the dynamic nature of aqueous oxide surfaces. Moreover, we
discuss open challenges and future possible research directions in this rapidly
evolving but challenging field.

Abstract: Instanton theory has arisen as a practical tool for calculating tunneling
splittings in molecular systems. Unfortunately, the original formulation of
instanton theory fundamentally breaks down when trying to calculate the level
splitting in asymmetric double wells, as there is no imaginary-time periodic
orbit connecting the two non-degenerate minima. We have therefore developed a
new formulation of instanton theory based on a projected flux correlation
function that is applicable to these asymmetric systems. Comparison with exact
quantum-mechanical results in one- and two-dimensional models demonstrates that
it has a reasonably high accuracy, similar to that reported for instanton
theory in the symmetric case. The theory is then applied to study tunneling
between non-degenerate minima in the biomolecule $\alpha$-fenchol, for which we
find good agreement with experiment. Finally, we use the connection to
instanton rate theory, which is also derived from flux correlation functions,
to discuss the often misunderstood relationship between tunneling splittings
and reaction rate constants.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the limitations of coarse-grained (CG) models in molecular dynamics simulations and presents a knowledge distillation framework to improve CG model accuracy by training on denoised forces and energies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of computational expense in molecular dynamics simulations for large systems, highlighting the need for efficient models while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The proposed method involves training an initial CG neural network potential (teacher) using CG-mapped forces to denoise labels, which are then used to train refined CG models (student) in both single- and ensemble-training setups.

Result: The results show that training a student model on ensemble teacher-predicted forces and per-bead energies significantly improves the quality and stability of CG force fields.

Conclusion: This approach provides a viable solution to enhance the accuracy of CG models by leveraging knowledge distillation, offering a balance between computational efficiency and simulation fidelity.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an integral tool for studying the
atomistic behavior of materials under diverse conditions. However, they can be
computationally demanding in wall-clock time, especially for large systems,
which limits the time and length scales accessible. Coarse-grained (CG) models
reduce computational expense by grouping atoms into simplified representations
commonly termed beads, but sacrifice atomic detail and introduce mapping noise,
complicating the training of machine-learned surrogates. Moreover, because CG
models inherently include entropic contributions, they cannot be fit directly
to all-atom energies, leaving instantaneous, noisy forces as the only
state-specific quantities available for training. Here, we apply a knowledge
distillation framework by first training an initial CG neural network potential
(the teacher) solely on CG-mapped forces to denoise those labels, then distill
its force and energy predictions to train refined CG models (the student) in
both single- and ensemble-training setups while exploring different force and
energy target combinations. We validate this framework on a complex molecular
fluid - a deep eutectic solvent - by evaluating two-, three-, and many-body
properties and compare the CG and all-atom results. Our findings demonstrate
that training a student model on ensemble teacher-predicted forces and per-bead
energies improves the quality and stability of CG force fields.

Abstract: Rydberg excited states of molecules pose a challenge for electronic structure
calculations because of their highly diffuse electron distribution. Even large
and elaborate atomic basis sets tend to underrepresent the long-range tail,
overly confining the Rydberg state. An approach is presented where the
molecular orbitals are variationally optimized for the excited state using a
plane wave basis set in Hartree-Fock calculations, followed by configuration
interaction calculations on the resulting reference. Using excited state
optimized plane wave orbitals greatly enhances the convergence of the many-body
calculation, as illustrated by a full configuration interaction calculation of
the 2s Rydberg state of H$_2$. A neural-network-based selective configuration
interaction approach is then applied to calculations of the 3s, 3p$_x$ and
3p$_y$ states of H$_2$O and the 3s and 3p$_z$ states of NH$_3$. The obtained
values of excitation energy are in close agreement with experimental
measurements as well as previous many-body calculations based on sufficiently
diffuse atomic basis sets. Previously reported high-level calculations limited
to atomic basis sets lacking extra diffuse functions, such as aug-cc-pVTZ, give
significantly higher estimates due to confinement of the Rydberg states.
