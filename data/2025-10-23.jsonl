In this work, the EMCD signal is\nmeasured in STEM mode at semi-convergence angles ranging from \\alpha=\\ 2-10\\\nmrad\\ using iron samples with high structural perfection. We observe that the\nrelative EMCD signal remains very similar for all convergence angles, which is\nin good agreement with simulations. The improvement in the signal-to-noise\nratio as compared to earlier works is due to better crystalline quality of the\nFe sample, high control of the sample orientation, better control over sample\nthickness, and factors such as higher beam current and the use of a fast and\nsensitive hybrid-pixel electron detector. One of the key factors to remove\nexperimental ambivalences is the use of an acquisition geometry where the two\nconjugate EMCD spectra are acquired simultaneously. Furthermore the high\ncrystalline quality Fe sample enables the acquisition of statistical entities\nof spectra at the same sample orientation, which in turn results in high SNR\nEMCD signals.

However, the effect is usually based on dipole resonances\nin the particles. Recently, it has been shown that quadrupole and octupole\nresonances can exhibit comparable, or even higher near-field enhancement. In\nthis work, we focus on the near-field enhancement by a metasurface composed of\ngold-disc dimers arranged in a rectangular array. We find that, owing to an\noctupole plasmon resonance coupled to a surface lattice resonance,\nexceptionally high near-field enhancement in the dimer gaps can be achieved in\nthe visible spectral range. To gain insight into the effect, we develop an\nanalytical model for the effective dipole and octupole polarizabilities of the\nparticles in an array, and discover, that at decreasing array periods, the\ndipole polarizability tends to vanish, while the octupole polarizability\nrapidly increases. Hence, octupole resonances can find applications in\nhigh-density arrays of plasmonic resonators. We propose a method to numerically\nevaluate multipole polarizabilities of a single particle, applying it to the\ngold dimer that we consider. The influence of the array on the effective\npolarizabilities is then verified by numerical calculations and a good\nagreement is obtained. Our results may open new avenues for investigating the\nproperties of periodic plasmonic structures based on higher-order multipole\nresonances and their applications."}

However, whether these signatures reflect a genuine\nphase of nonequilibrium quantum matter or persist only over finite length\nscales is an active area of research. We address this question in a free\nfermionic chain subject to continuous monitoring of lattice-site occupations.\nAn unraveling phase $\\varphi$ interpolates between measurement schemes,\ncorresponding to different stochastic unravelings of the same Lindblad master\nequation: For $\\varphi = 0$, measurements disentangle lattice sites, while for\n$\\varphi = \\pi/2$ they act as unitary random noise, yielding volume-law\nsteady-state entanglement. Using replica Keldysh field theory, we obtain a\nnonlinear sigma model describing the long-wavelength physics. This analysis\nshows that for $0 \\leq \\varphi < \\pi/2$, entanglement ultimately obeys an area\nlaw, but only beyond the exponentially large scale $\\ln(l_{\\varphi,*}) \\sim\nJ/[\\gamma \\cos(\\varphi)]$, where $J$ is the hopping amplitude and $\\gamma$ the\nmeasurement rate.

In this paper, we employ the formalism of quantum walks to\ninvestigate how the topology of the battery and the chirality of the\nHamiltonian influence its performance as an energy storage unit. We analyze\narchitectures of battery cells based on ring, complete, and wheel graph\nstructures and analyze their behavior in the presence of noise. Our results\nshow that these structures exhibit distinct ergotropy scaling, with the\ninterplay between chirality and topology providing a tunable mechanism to\noptimize work extraction and enhance robustness against decoherence. In\nparticular, chirality enhances ergotropy for complete quantum cells, without\naltering the linear scaling with size, whereas in ring cells, it bridges the\nperformance gap between configurations with odd and even number of units.\nAdditionaly, chirality may be exploited to force degeneracies in the\nHamiltonian, a condition that can spare the ergotropy to vanish in the presence\nof pure dephasing. We conclude that topology and chirality are key resources\nfor improving ergotropy, offering guidelines to optimize quantum energy devices\nand protocols."}

We show that this implies a domain of analyticity of\nthe retarded Green's function $G^R(\\omega,{\\bf k})$ of local lattice operators\nas a function of complex frequency $\\omega$ and momentum ${\\bf k}$, similar to\nthe lightcone analyticity property of relativistic field theories. Low-energy\neffective descriptions of the dynamics must be consistent with this microscopic\nanalyticity constraint. We consider two canonical low-energy fermionic Green's\nfunctions describing non-Fermi liquids, the marginal Fermi liquid and the\n`Hertz liquid'. The pole in these Green's functions must be outside of the\nLieb-Robinson domain of analyticity for all complex momenta captured by the\nlow-energy theory. We show that this constraint upper bounds the magnitude of\nthe dimensionless non-Fermi liquid coupling in certain Hertz liquids.

We first calculate the Wigner negativity of Hawking radiation in\nthe PSSY model directly using the gravitational path integral, and show that\nthe negativity is $O(1)$ before the Page transition, but becomes exponentially\nlarge past the Page transition. We also derive a universal, information\ntheoretic formula for the negativity which interpolates between the two\nextremes. We then study the Wigner negativity of radiation in a dynamical model\nof black hole evaporation. In this case, the negativity shows a sharp spike at\nearly times resulting from the coupling between the black hole and the\nradiation system, but at late times when the system settles down, we find that\nthe negativity satisfies the same universal formula as in the PSSY model.\nFinally, we also propose a geometric formula for Wigner negativity in general\nholographic states using intuition from fixed area states and random tensor\nnetworks, and argue that a python's lunch in the entanglement wedge implies a\nstabilizer complexity which is exponentially large in $\\frac{1}{8G_N}$ times\nthe difference between the areas corresponding to the outermost and minimal\nextremal surfaces."}

However, these stronger measurements\nof motion are naturally accompanied by increased back-action. Here we show how\nresolving the broadband thermal noise spectrum reveals back-action-induced\ncorrelations in the noise from many mechanical modes, even those well-separated\nin frequency. As a result, the observed spectra can deviate significantly from\npredictions of the usual single-mode and (uncorrelated) multimode models over\nthe broad band, notably even at the mechanical resonance peaks. This highlights\nthat these effects must be considered in all systems exhibiting measurement\nback-action, regardless of whether the resonances are spectrally isolated or\nthe readout noise is high enough that the noise peaks appear consistent with\nsimpler models. Additionally, these correlations advantageously allow the\nthermal noise spectrum to reach a minimum -- equivalent to that of a single\nmode -- in a band far from the resonance peak, where the mechanical\nsusceptibility is comparatively stable against frequency noise."}

By integrating a quantum dot inside\na graphene spherical shell and tuning the local optical response of hybrid\nmodes via voltage-bias, we achieve continuous and reversible control over the\ndecay rate, leading to significant enhancement or suppression of dipole\nemission from near- to far-infrared regime.
