Applying these holographic consistency conditions, we identify broad classes of scalar potentials that are incompatible with a well-defined dual description.

In particular, making the standard assumption that the CFT dual to a stable AdS vacuum must be realized as a worldvolume theory of a brane in string theory, we show that the brane selects an infinite-distance limit in moduli space where parametric scale separation is forbidden. Furthermore, the steepness and positivity of the potential are restricted in that infinite distance direction. We also find that requiring the validity of the effective theory in the future vacuum, a natural holographic criterion, automatically enforces the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) for classical cosmological solutions with positive potentials.

While nanophotonic platforms offer a route to enhance chiral light-matter interactions, existing device concepts for chiral sensing remain heuristic, resulting in limited chiral enhancement and control over chiral hotspot placement within nanostructures. Here, we introduce an inverse-design framework that directly optimizes superchiral near fields in photonic nanostructures and demonstrate its powerful opportunities for enantioselective analysis. We first show that freeform achiral metasurfaces can be optimized to achieve an 800-fold chiral density enhancement, with fully customizable chiral hotspot placement for direct molecular interaction. We further demonstrate ultrasensitive detection of chiral analytes and achieve a 116-fold increase in detection sensitivity over the native enantiomeric response. Lastly, we extend our platform to determine chiral-molecule concentration and resolve enantiomeric excess in chiral mixtures. Our framework offers a generic route to enabling nanophotonic platforms for detecting chiral compounds and can be integrated with a broad range of spin-based photonic materials for applications in valleytronics, chiral emission control, and topological photonics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The other displays a more sophisticated model that supports multiple topological zero modes and topological $\u03c0$ modes in a tunable manner. By subjecting both models to perturbations such as a finite onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder, these features exhibit distinct responses. In particular, while generally all topological edge modes are robust against such perturbations, the nonHermitian skin effect is easily suppressed and revived by, respectively, the onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder in the first model, but it could be insensitive to both perturbations in the second model.

The scheme relies on an energy cutoff $\u039b$ which removes the quasi-resonant couplings, enabling the dressing of the particles into quasiparticles via a unitary transformation. The dynamics of the quasiparticles is then restricted to low-energy transitions and is fully determined by an effective Hamiltonian which unifies the Landau interaction function $f$ and the collision amplitude in a single amplitude $\\mathcal{A}$ regularized by $\u039b$.

We consider (i) the different parameters of a Mexican-hat-type dispersion of the valence band, which hosts a VHS at the band edge, and (ii) the presence of regular VHS or higher-order VHS (HOVHS). We find that for a given spin-degenerate Mexican-hat-shaped valence band, where a trion and exciton can form, trion formation becomes more favourable as the Mexican-hat dispersion becomes narrower. Also, we show that if the electronic band structure contains an HOVHS, then both the exciton and trion dispersion will also contain such a singularity. Therefore, a HOVHS in the valence band can suitably change the density of states (DOS) of the bound-state particle and lead to the generation of new states, which could impact the optical properties of the system.

This measurement is performed via detection of electrons and protons in delayed coincidence using custom large-area segmented silicon drift detectors. We present the characterization of one such detector system to establish the proton energy and timing response, using a dedicated proton accelerator. The detected proton peak was studied for 25 keV, 30 keV, and 35 keV incident protons on a set of detector segments and multiple cooling cycles over a one year period. Ionization losses were consistent with models of the detector dead layer with thicknesses less than 100nm. The detected proton peak was stable within the uncertainty from energy calibration (0.2 keV).

While it is commonly attributed to conformational rearrangements, the underlying dynamical mechanisms remain poorly understood. The contact cluster model of allostery [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 10731] identifies localized groups of highly correlated contacts that mediate interactions between secondary structure elements. This framework proposes that allostery proceeds through a multistep process involving cooperative contact changes within clusters and communication between distant clusters, transmitted through rigid secondary structures. To demonstrate the validity and generality of the model, this Perspective employs extensive molecular dynamics simulations ($\\sim 1\\,$ms total simulation time) of four different photoswitchable PDZ domains and studies how different domains, ligands and perturbations influence both the contact clusters and their dynamical evolution. These analyses reveal several recurring clusters that represent shared flexible structural modules, such as loops connecting $\u03b2$-sheets, and show that the characteristic timescales of the nonequilibrium protein response can be directly associated with the motions of individual contact clusters. Thus, the dynamic decomposition of PDZ domains into contact clusters uncovers a modular, dynamics-based architecture that underlies and facilitates long-range allosteric communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates allostery in proteins, focusing on how contact clusters mediate long-range communication.

Quantum entanglement, through squeezed and GHZ states, enables sensing beyond classical limits. However, such a quantum advantage has so far been confined to two-mode bosonic systems, as analogous multi-mode squeezed states are non-trivial to prepare. Here, we develop a Monte-Carlo based optimization technique which can be used to efficiently engineer a Hamiltonian control-sequence for multi-mode bosonic systems to prepare multi-mode squeezed states. Specifically, we consider a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice, relevant for applications in gravimetry and gradiometry, and demonstrate that metrologically useful squeezed states can be generated using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian which includes on-site atomic interactions, tunable via Feshbach resonances. By analyzing the distribution (density) of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) over the Hilbert space, we identify a characteristic \\textit{intermediate scaling} of the QFI: $\\mathcal{O}(N^2 L+L^2 N)$, which lies between the standard quantum limit (SQL) and the Heisenberg limit (HL) for $N$ atoms in $L$ modes. We show that in general, within the Hilbert space there is a finite, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ measure subset of Hilbert space with an intermediate QFI scaling. Therefore, one can find a Hamiltonian control sequence using a Monte Carlo optimization over random control sequences, that produces a state with intermediate scaling of the QFI. We assume an experimentally accessible range of the control parameters in the Hamiltonian resources and show that the intermediate scaling can be readily achieved.

However, the plate structure is easily damaged during long-term service or when it is impacted by foreign objects. Such a damage may lead to serious safety accidents. Beamforming and L-shaped sensor cluster (LSSC) localization method can be used to locate the damage on the plate. However, when using beamforming or LSSC localization method to locate the damages on plate-like structures, there exists blind area. In this paper, by combining the beamforming and LSSC localization method, a fan-shaped sensor cluster is proposed through arranging five sensors in a fan shape, which can effectively reduce the blind areas. The positions of damages on the plate can be accurately detected by using two groups of fan-shaped sensor clusters and one sensor for transmitting the excitation signal. The feasibility of the fan-shaped sensor cluster localization method is verified through numerical simulations and experiments, and the results are compared with those obtained by using the T-shaped sensor cluster. The results show that the fan-shaped sensor cluster can more accurately identify the damages at different positions.

The cavity mode is partially compensated through a feedback circuit, which reduces its linewidth but retains its dissipative nature. By tuning the compensation strength and dissipative coupling strength, we reach a system cooperativity of unity, marking the lasing threshold and the formation of a zero-linewidth polariton mode. This mode also corresponds to a perfect Friedrich-Wintgen bound state in the continuum. Further increase of the cooperativity drives the system into the strong dissipative coupling regime, where magnon polariton amplification arises between two real frequency scattering poles.

A plastic scintillating fiber (SciFi) detector with a one-dimensional SiPM array offers a compact, high-resolution solution. However, scaling up the detector area and spatial resolution demands reducing the number of readout channels while maintaining detector performance. To address this challenge, this work presents a multiplexing scheme based on a diode-based symmetric charge division circuit combined with a position-encoding algorithm. Circuit simulations confirm the feasibility of the multiplexing design and guide the selection of suitable diodes to preserve SiPM signal integrity. Electronic tests show that the proposed design exhibits low crosstalk among electronic channels, and preserves linearity over a dynamic range spanning a few to several hundred photoelectrons. Cosmic-ray measurements further demonstrate that the multiplexed SciFi detector achieves a detection efficiency above 95\\% and a spatial resolution of about 0.65~mm, with only minor degradation compared to direct readout.

Because standard OT configurations do not provide direct access to the axial position, axial detection typically relies on temporal fluctuations in forward-scattered optical power to infer the position of the particle. This approach generally assumes a linear-response regime in which the signal arises from the interference between the forward scattered and the nonscattered optical fields; however, under certain conditions, the backward-scattered contribution becomes non-negligible, leading to deviations from the linear response. Here, we present a simple yet comprehensive model for axial detection in standard OT while explicitly accounting for the backward-scattered field. Together with experimental validation, this framework neatly explains the standing-wave response observed when the backward-scattered field interferes with the nonscattered and the forward-scattered components, enabling accurate estimation of trap stiffness and particle diffusion under more general conditions.

This is borne out in the mathematics, where mixed state algorithms have always required more sophisticated techniques to design and analyze than pure state algorithms. We present a new approach to tomography demonstrating that, contrary to this belief, state-of-the-art mixed state tomography follows easily and naturally from pure state algorithms.\n  We analyze the following strategy: given $n$ copies of an unknown state $\u03c1$, convert them into copies of a purification $|\u03c1\\rangle$; run a pure state tomography algorithm to produce an estimate of $|\u03c1\\rangle$; and output the resulting estimate of $\u03c1$. The purification subroutine was recently discovered via the \"acorn trick\" of Tang, Wright, and Zhandry. With this strategy, we obtain the first tomography algorithm which is sample-optimal in all parameters. For a rank-$r$ $d$-dimensional state, it uses $n = O((rd + \\log(1/\u03b4))/\\varepsilon)$ samples to output an estimate which is $\\varepsilon$-close in fidelity with probability at least $1-\u03b4$. This algorithm also uses poly$(n)$ gates, making it the first gate-efficient tomography algorithm which is sample-optimal even in terms of the dimension $d$ alone. Moreover, with this method we recover essentially all results on mixed state tomography, including its applications to tomography with limited entanglement, classical shadows, and quantum metrology. Our proofs are simple, closing the gap in conceptual difficulty between mixed and pure tomography.

An electromagnetic resonator is used to probe the parity of the qubit-ensemble. The action of sequential measurements allows the nonclassicality of whole ensemble to manifest itself, in the ideal case, irrespective of its size. This enables to probe the macroscopic limits of quantum mechanics as the qubit-ensemble is, effectively, a single large spin of many $\\hbar$ units. Even as $\\hbar \\rightarrow 0$ in comparison to the total angular momentum of the ensemble, a constant amount of violation of MR is found in the noiseless case. However, environmental decoherence and inhomogeneity of qubit-electromagnetic field couplings precipitate the quantum-to-classical transition.

Consequently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to streamline their design process. Reconfigurable multi-state metamaterials (RMMs) with adjustable parameters can switch their optical characteristics between different states upon external stimulation, leading to numerous applications. However, existing deep learning-based inverse design methods fall short in considering reconfigurability with multi-state switching. To address this challenge, we propose CoSP, an intelligent inverse design method based on contrastive pretrained large language model (LLM).

Pure skyrmionium lattices are unstable against elongation distortions and relax into the spiral phase, but even a small fraction of skyrmions acts as topological \"pins\" that stabilize diverse mixed Skm--Sk crystals. We classify these states by topological stoichiometry (Skm$_n$Sk$_m$) and show that each composition hosts multiple metastable polymorphs with distinct plane-group symmetries. Structural transformations between polymorphs are achieved by varying the lattice spacing, suggesting experimental control via pressure or strain. The collective spin dynamics is explored for both in-plane and out-of-plane AC magnetic fields. The resulting absorption spectra show resonant modes beyond the two rotational and one breathing mode of conventional skyrmion lattices. We identify hybrid excitations unique to Skm--Sk crystals, including (i) deformation-assisted rotations, where skyrmions acquire polygonal shapes and rotate, and (ii) orbital modes, where breathing skyrmioniums induce circular motion of confined skyrmions without changing their size. Mode frequencies span sub-GHz to above 10 GHz, consistent with exchange and DMI energy scales. Our results establish skyrmionium-based meta-matter as a versatile platform for tunable, topologically heterogeneous magnetic lattices with rich structural and dynamical properties, paving the way for reconfigurable magnonic and spintronic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

How to efficiently test their quantumness at these scales? We show that the violation of Macrorealism (MR), being the fact that classical systems possess definite properties that can be measured without disturbances, provide a fruitful avenue to this aim. The No Disturbance Condition (NDC) - the equality used here to test MR - can be violated by two consecutive parity measurements on $N$ qubits and found to be independent of $N$ under ideal conditions. However, realistic noisy QCs show a quantum-to-classical transition as $N$ increases, giving a foundationally-motivated scalable benchmarking metric. Two methods are formulated to implement this metric: one that involves a mid-circuit measurement, probing the irreversible collapse of the wavefunction, in contrast to the reversible entanglement generated in the other. Both methods are designed to be clumsiness-loophole free: the unwanted classical disturbances are negligible within statistical error. Violation of MR is detected on a IBM QC up to $N = 38$ qubits, increasing $N$ by one order of magnitude over best known results of MR. Two QCs are benchmarked using the proposed NDC metric, showing a three-fold improvement in their quantumness from one generation to the next.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This method also motivates a simple variational solution which yields the lowest energy known to date ($0.6812$ in the same units) to arise out of an analytical variational solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ea4\u53c9\u51f9\u69fd\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u4e2a\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\uff0c\u4ea4\u70b9\u5468\u56f4\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u52bf\u9631\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u8350\u4e86\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u96c5\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u80fd\u50ac\u751f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u89e3\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u6027\u8d28\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u548cPossible device applications\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u96c5\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u53d8\u5206\u6cd5\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\u4e3a0.659606\u5355\u4f4d\uff0c\u53d8\u5206\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a0.6812\u5355\u4f4d\uff0cconfined within troughs\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u65b0\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Each module or trap can perform only one operation at a time, resulting in low intra-trap parallelism, but there is no restriction on operations happening on independent traps, enabling high inter-trap parallelism. Unlike their superconducting counterparts, the design space for QCCDs is relatively flexible and can be explored beyond current grid designs. In particular, current grid-based architectures significantly limit the performance of many promising, high-rate codes such as HGP codes and BB codes, suffering from numerous trap to trap ``roadblocks\", forcing serialization and destroying the inherent parallelism of these codes.. Many of these codes are highly parallelizable, meaning that with appropriate hardware layouts and matching software schedules, execution latency can be reduced. Faster execution, in turn, reduces error accumulation from decoherence and heating, ultimately improving code performance when mapped to realistic hardware. To address this, we propose Cyclone, a circular software-hardware codesign that departs from traditional 2D grids in favor of a flexible ring topology, where ancilla qubits move in lockstep. Cyclone eliminates roadblocks, bounds total movement, and enables high levels of parallelism, resulting in up to ~4$\\times$ speedup in execution times. With HGP codes, Cyclone achieves up to a 2$\\times$ order of magnitude improvement in logical error rate, and with BB codes, this improvement reaches up to a 3$\\times$ in order of magnitude.Spatially, Cyclone reduces the number of required traps and ancilla qubits by $2\\times$.The overall spacetime improvement over a standard grid is up to $\\sim 20 \\times$, demonstrating Cyclone as a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional 2D QCCD architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This paper presents a numerical study of distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) hybrid III-V-on-silicon lasers, analyzing design trade-offs and optimization strategies based on supermode theory. The III-V section of the design incorporates InAs/(Al)GaAs quantum dots (QDs), which offer improved temperature insensitivity at the cost of more complex III-V/Si optical coupling, due to the high refractive index of (Al)GaAs. Consequently, many current laser designs rely on silicon waveguides with a thickness exceeding 220 nm, which helps coupling but limits their compatibility with standard CMOS technologies. To address this challenge, we perform detailed simulations focusing on 220-nm-thick silicon waveguides. We first examine how the mode profiles jointly depend on the silicon waveguide dimensions and the geometry and composition of the III-V stack. Based on this analysis, we propose a novel epitaxial design that enables effective III-V/Si coupling, with the optical mode strongly confined within the III-V waveguide in the gain section and efficiently transferred to the silicon waveguide in the passive sections.

We also touch upon the challenges we currently have in testing GR and the potential path forward to detect a credible violation of GR, should one exist in the data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u90e8\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5728\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5c1a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u53ef\u80fd\u68c0\u9a8c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5f15\u529b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u603b\u7ed3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u5229\u7528\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u68c0\u9a8c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u68c0\u9a8c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u672a\u5f97\u51fa\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u7075\u654f\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u66f4\u957f\u671f\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e00\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

The non-Abelian operator size depends on the operator's nonlocal structure and is organized by an SU(2) algebra. Operators associated with large total angular momentum are relatively simple, while those with small angular momentum are more complex. Operator growth is thus characterized by a reduction in angular momentum and can be probed using out-of-time-ordered correlators. Using the charge-conserving Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, we derive an exact classical master equation that governs the size distribution, the distribution of an operator expanded in this basis, for arbitrary system sizes. The resulting dynamics reveal that the size distribution follows a chi-squared form, with the two conserved charges jointly determining the overall time scale and the shape of the distribution. In particular, single-particle operators retain a divergent peak at large angular momentum throughout the time evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86U(1)\u5bf9\u79f0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0a\u91cd\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u7b97\u7b26\u5c3a\u5bf8\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7b97\u7b26\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u89e3\u653e\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u51fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7b97\u7b26\u6f14\u5316\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u7b97\u7b26\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u653e\u5c04\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7b97\u7b26\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548cSU(2)\u4ee3\u6570\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5c3a\u5bf8\u57fa\u5e95\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5e26\u7535\u8377\u5b88\u6052\u7684\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7b97\u7b26\u5c3a\u5bf8\u9075\u5faa\u5361\u65b9\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f62\u72b6\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u7b97\u7b26\u5728\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u9ad8\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u53d1\u6563\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u7b26\u6f14\u5316\u53ca\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u653e\u5c04\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u7b97\u7b26\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

In this work, we develop a unified framework for these two dS holographic models by introducing a composite flow that incorporates both $T\\bar{T}$ and $T\\bar{T}+\u039b_2$ deformations. We propose that this composite flow corresponds to the inward motion of a spacelike boundary from the asymptotic infinity of dS spacetime, traversing the cosmological horizon and approaching the worldline of a static observer.

Stage I solves carrier-population and current equations at a single point, driven by a chirped super-Gaussian pulse. By fixing bandwidth and normalizing for intensity, we isolate a chirp-only response of plasma density, which exceeds unity and shows a consistent advantage for negative over positive chirp. Stage II propagates the field in water via the angular-spectrum method and applies the same equations across space. Normal dispersion reverses the trend: the chirp-only plasma density decreases as chirp grows, negative chirp remains less detrimental, and suppression is strongest for longer FTL pulses (e.g., 80 fs) due to dispersion-induced temporal spreading and spatio-temporal desynchronization.

Here, we reveal that quantum geometry significantly modifies phonon dichroisms through electron-phonon interactions in solids that break time-reversal and spatial inversion symmetries. Specifically, the circular phonon dichroism is primarily dominated by the heat magnetic moments, while the linear phonon dichroism depends on the heat Drude weight, a thermal analog of band Drude weight.

Progress has been made in the covariant formulation of LQG, but the tools do not carry over to the canonical formulation. These tools are graphical by nature, describing space with spin networks to make calculations in LQG more intuitive to the human hand.\n  Recently, a new notation for working with spin networks has been used by arXiv:2412.20272 to offer the first accurate numerical results in canonical LQG by allowing the underlying graphs to change throughout the calculation, though they are forced to concede visual intuitiveness. In this thesis, we offer a more radical rephrasing of spin network calculations by translating them into the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus, extending previous attempts to translate into the standard (qubit) ZX-calculus (arXiv:2111.03114). Specifically, we derive the mixed-dimensional ZX-diagrams representing the generating objects of spin networks and the rules for the Penrose Spin Calculus (arXiv:2511.06012), and use these to present the ZX-form and correctness of \"loop removal\". We also derive the forms for several fundamental LQG objects in the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus for the first time. This gives us a high-level, intuitive graphical language that retains a flexibility to handle changing graph structures, and thus we argue positions the PSC as the new definitive language for canonical LQG.\n  Furthermore, we investigate the possibility for a matrix-like normal form for spin networks deriving from a novel perspective of the PSC in terms of W-nodes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c06\u56fe\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684PSC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u89c4\u8303\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u7684.motion\u7814\u7a76\u3002Method\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86ZX\u56fe\u8868\u7684ADE\u4ee3\u6570 Districts\u6765 remodel spin\u7f51\u7edc\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5bf9\u524d\u4eba\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u3002Result\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u6210\u529f\u5c06PSC\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684XY-latin\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u89c4\u8303\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0cZX\u56fe\u8868\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c4\u8303\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bd5\u56fe\u5c06\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u96be\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165ZX\u56fe\u8868\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u66f4\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06ZX\u56fe\u8868\u7684ade\u4ee3\u6570 district\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0spin\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5c06PSC\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6709\u9650\u7ef4zx\u56fe\u8868\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86PSC\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u89c4\u8303\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u7684LQG\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u7ef4zx\u56fe\u8868\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u76f4\u89c2\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Most theoretical works to date rely on the brute-force exact diagonalization which is limited to the one partially occupied band. In this work, we present strong evidence that the effect of higher lying bands cannot be ignored due to strong interband interactions. To tackle these effects, we introduce a non-perturbative driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG) method, originally developed for problems in quantum chemistry. We apply this methodology to twisted MoTe2 at fractional hole fillings of \u03bd = 1/3 and 2/3 across a spectrum of twist angles. Our results show that at \u03bd = 1/3, the many-body excitation energy gaps are substantially reduced compared to the one-band treatment. For \u03bd = 2/3, we find that the dynamic correlations stemming from interband interactions stabilize fractional Chern insulating phases at larger twist angles, consistent with the experimental findings. By examining the correlated orbitals and their single-particle topological features, we demonstrate that this stabilization at higher twist angles arises predominantly from the dynamic correlations, rather than conditions on the single-particle quantum geometric tensor.", "AI": {"tldr": "Twisted MoTe2 exhibits fraction quantum Hall states, but interband interactions are significant and must be considered.", "motivation": "Understanding fraction quantum Hall states in twisted materials is crucial for advancing quantum technologies and materials science.", "method": "A non-perturbative driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG) method was applied to twisted MoTe2 at \u03bd = 1/3 and 2/3 across various twist angles.", "result": "Interband interactions significantly affect the many-body excitation energy gaps and stabilize fractional Chern insulating phases at larger twist angles.", "conclusion": "Higher twist angles stabilize fraction quantum Hall states primarily due to dynamic correlations from interband interactions rather than single-particle quantum geometric tensor conditions."}}

Such strain-induced axial fields produce a flat band near zero-energy, triggering nucleation of a charge density-wave, featuring a staggered pattern of fermionic density between two sublattices, and the Haldane phase fostering intra-sublattice circulating currents with a net zero magnetic flux for weak nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. Sufficiently weak on-site Hubbard repulsion destabilizes such flat bands toward the formation of a magnetic phase that simultaneously supports antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders in the whole system. While the magnetization in the bulk and boundary cancel each other, the Ne\u00e9l order is of the same sign everywhere, thereby yielding a global antiferromagnet. Throughout, we draw parallels between these findings and the well-studied qualitatively similar results on a 3-fold rotational symmetric strained honeycomb lattice, thereby unifying the phenomenon of axial magnetic catalysis for Dirac fermions, encompassing the ones living on the Euclidean plane. Finally, we show that with a specific class of non-Hermiticity, manifesting via an imbalance in the hopping amplitudes between two sublattices in the opposite directions, magnitudes of all these orders can be boosted substantially when all the eigenvalues in the noninteracting systems are real, staging a non-Hermitian amplification of axial magnetic catalysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u9762\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\u7684\u54c8 \u83b7\u53d6 tardyon \u9759\u6001\u548c\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u53cc\u66f2\u9762\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u54c8 \u7684\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8fd1\u90bb\u8f8f\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728{10,3}\u548c{14,3}\u53cc\u66f2\u9762\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u7814\u7a76\u54c8 \u7684\u7279\u6027locking-down \u54c8type\u548c\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u53cc\u66f2\u9762\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u54c8\u5728\u9759\u6b62\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u7c92\u5b50-\u6001\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5728\u5f3a\u8f6c\u77e9\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u66f2\u9762\u54c8 \u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u54c8\u7279\u6027\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Here we propose theoretically and illustrate experimentally a different approach to the construction of HOTIs. This approach utilizes lattices with incomplete unit cells and achieves localized modes of topological origin across a broader parameter space. When truncation disrupts translational symmetry by cutting through the interior of multiple unit cells, boundary modes in our system emerge for both trivial and topologically nontrivial positions of the Wannier centers. We link these modes to the appearance of fractional Wannier centers. We also demonstrate that linear boundary states give rise to rich families of stable solitons bifurcating from them in the presence of focusing nonlinearity.

Conventional approaches--such as chemical doping, lattice strain, or external gating--offer robust stability but remain confined to the quasi-static regime, far from the intrinsic femto- to picosecond dynamics that govern many-body interactions. Here, using cryogenic transient reflectance spectroscopy, we realize dynamic bandgap engineering in the anisotropic topological insulator $\u03b1$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$ with unprecedented micro-electron-volt ($\u03bc$eV) precision. The exceptional sensitivity arises from the cooperative action of long-lived topological carriers, stabilized by restricted bulk-to-edge scattering phase space, together with symmetry-resolved coherent phonons that modulate inter-chain hopping. These channels jointly modify Coulomb screening and interband transitions, enabling both gradual and oscillatory control of the electronic structure. Supported by first-principles and tight-binding theory, we further demonstrate a dual-pump coherent control strategy for continuous, mode-selective tuning of electronic energies with $\u03bc$eV accuracy. This framework paves the way for ultrafast on-demand band-structure engineering, pointing toward new frontiers in quantum optoelectronics, precision measurement in molecular and biological systems, and attosecond control of matter.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d85\u5feb\u7535\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u9759\u529b\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6676\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u77ac\u6001\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u56db\u5143\u70f7\u5316\u937542\uff0c21 Bromide \u03b1-Bi4Br4\u7684\u8d85\u5fae\u4f0f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7535\u5e26\u9699\u8c03\u63a7\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u957f-lived\u62d3\u6251\u8f7d\u4f53\u548c\u76f8\u5e72\u58f0\u5b50\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u4e86\u5c42\u95f4\u8dc3\u8fc1\u548c\u77ed\u7a0b screening\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u6cf5\u534f\u540c\u8c03\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5fae\u4f0f\u7ea7\u7535\u5e26\u80fd\u7cbe\u51c6\u8c03\u63a7\u3002\u8be5\u6210\u679c\u4e3a\u8d85\u5feb\u7535\u8c03\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u529f\u80fd\u6750\u6599\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5316\u5b66\u63ba\u6742\u3001\u6676\u683c\u5e94\u53d8\u3001\u5916\u52a0\u7535\u573a\uff09\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6162\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d85\u5feb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u9700\u8981\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7a81\u7834\u6b64\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u5feb\u7535\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u77ac\u6001\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u548ctight-binding\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u6709\uff1a\u6676\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u6750\u6599\u5236\u5907\u3001\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u62d3\u6251\u8272\u6563 Carrier\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u534f\u8c03\u58f0\u5b50\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u80fd\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u5fae\u4f0f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7535\u5e26\u9699\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u9759\u529b\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u03b1-Bi4Br4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251emi\u4f53\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8d85\u9ad8\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u77ac\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u5feb\u7535\u8c03\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6280\u672f\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u6d4b\u63a7\u548c attosecond \u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

The analysis focuses on three independent components: the rate at which neutrino-antineutrino annihilation deposits energy in the surrounding region, the geometric contribution to the phase accumulated by neutrino mass eigenstates, and the modifications to flavor conversion produced by weak gravitational lensing. Working with a two-flavor system, both mass orderings are examined, and the calculation incorporates the interference between distinct trajectories reaching the detector. The numerical results show that the Lorentz-violating deformation substantially increases the efficiency of the annihilation channel, produces characteristic shifts in the oscillation phase not present in earlier bumblebee configurations, and reshapes the angular dependence of the lensing-induced flavor transition pattern.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ece\u81ea\u65cb\u5bf9\u79f0\u7834\u574f\u7684\u81ea\u65cb Inspired \u8def\u7531\u5668\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u4e0e\u53cd\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u91ca\u653e\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u632f\u8361\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4e24\u5473\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0b\u7684\u632f\u8361\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8def\u6613\u65af\u7834\u574f\u5bfc\u81f4\u5408\u5e76\u53cd\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u632f\u8361\u76f8\u4f4d\u53d1\u751f\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u632f\u8361\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u57fa\u672cxmax\u4e86\u89e3\u7684\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5927\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u6790\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5982\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50 cruel\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u632f\u8361\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u7b49\uff0c\u7cbe\u51c6\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u53d8\u5316\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u5473\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0b\u7684\u632f\u8361\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u8def\u5f84\u5230\u8fbe\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u632f\u8361\u76f8\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8def\u6613\u65af\u7834\u574f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u5408\u5e76\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u632f\u8361\u76f8\u4f4d\u53d1\u751f\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb Inspired \u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8def\u6613\u65af\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u4f20\u64ad\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u65e2\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u5408\u5e76\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u53c8\u5bf9\u632f\u8361\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We develop a graph-theoretic framework for quantifying this resource for large families of binary measurements, including Pauli observables on multi-qubit systems and $k$-body Majorana observables on $n$-mode fermionic systems. To each set of observables we associate an anti-commutativity graph, whose vertices represent observables and whose edges indicate pairs that anti-commute. In this representation, the incompatibility robustness--the minimal amount of classical noise required to render the set jointly measurable--becomes a graph invariant. We derive general bounds on this invariant in terms of the Lov\u00e1sz number, clique number, and fractional chromatic number, and show that the Lov\u00e1sz number yields the correct asymptotic scaling for $k$-body Majorana observables. For line graphs $L(G)$, which naturally arise in the characterisation of exactly solvable spin models, we obtain spectral bounds on the robustness expressed through the energy and skew-energy of the underlying graph $G$. These bounds become tight for highly symmetric graphs, leading to closed formulas for several graph families. Finally, we identify structural conditions under which the robustness is determined by a simple function of the graph's maximum degree and the number of vertices and edges, and show that such extremal cases occur only when combinatorial structures such as Hadamard, conference or weighing matrices exist.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cd\u4ea4\u6362\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u4e8c\u5143\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u4e8eLov\u00e1sz\u6570\u3001 clique\u6570\u548c\u5206\u6570\u8272\u6570\u7684\u754c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728k-\u8eab\u4f53 Majorana\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5bf9\u7ebf\u56feL(G)\u7684\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u5e95\u56feG\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u659c\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u8c31\u754c\u8868\u8fbe\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f53\u56fe\u5177\u6709\u67d0\u4e9b\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u662f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u53cd\u4ea4\u6362\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4ea4\u6362\u56fe\u5173\u8054\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56fe\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528Lov\u00e1sz\u6570\u3001 clique\u6570\u548c\u5206\u6570\u8272\u6570\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u754c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fk-\u8eab\u4f53 Majorana\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5bf9\u7ebf\u56feL(G)\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u5e95\u56feG\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u659c\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6784\u9020\u53cd\u4ea4\u6362\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5730\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u5f20\u56fe\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u56fe\u8bba\u91cf\u7684\u754c\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e9b\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Strain is a powerful tool for manipulating and controlling the geometrical and electronic structures of moir\u00e9 superlattices. This review provides a comprehensive introduction to the geometry of strained moir\u00e9 superlattices. First, starting from the linear elasticity theory, we briefly introduce the general formalism of small deformations in two-dimensional materials, and discuss the particular cases of uniaxial, shear and biaxial strain. Then, we apply the theory to twisted and strained moir\u00e9 materials, mainly focusing on the hexagonal homobilayers, hexagonal heterobilayers and monoclinic lattices. Special moir\u00e9 geometries, like the quasi-unidimensional patterns, square patterns and hexagonal, are theoretically predicted by manipulating the strain and twist. Finally, we review recently developed strain techniques and the special moir\u00e9 geometries realized via these approaches.

The first is based on a real gas, fluid-like temperature, $T_{RG}$, while the second corresponds to a relativistic species-like temperature, $T_{RS}$. We derive the fundamental thermodynamic relations for both and analyze their implications for the most viable inflationary potentials, consistent with Planck constraints. We also investigate non-minimally coupled scenarios, finding that $T_{RS}$ is the most self-consistent choice, as it decreases during inflation, satisfies standard thermodynamic laws, and exhibits frame-independent behavior in both the Jordan and Einstein frames. Remarkably, the $T_{RS}$ approach shows that the inflaton's dynamics is well-described by Van der Waals-like isotherms, linking inflationary evolution to thermodynamic phase transitions. We find that the onset of inflation is associated with a phase transition acting as the ``trigger'' of the inflationary epoch. Our analysis highlights inconsistencies in the hilltop potential and, more generally, in small-field potentials unless a non-minimal coupling is introduced. Conversely, the Starobinsky and $\u03b1$-attractor models emerge as the most suitable paradigms. We further show that \\emph{frame independence} is achieved only for coupling values $\u03b6\\leq 1/6$, supporting very small values. Finally, our study of natural inflation with non-minimal coupling reveals a strong dependence on the coupling parameter, where bounds associated with thermodynamic phase transitions coincide with observationally viable ranges, suggesting that thermodynamic considerations may provide an additional criterion to discriminate among inflationary scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u8fdb\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u52bf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6e29\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0$T_{RS}$\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e0a\u66f4\u4e3a\u81ea\u6d3d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e29\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u573a\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002$T_{RS}$\u5728\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We demonstrate an all-optical terahertz (THz) attoclock that reconstructs electron dynamics during photoionization by detecting THz radiation emitted from gases ionized by the fundamental and second harmonic two-color laser fields, without the need for photoelectron detection. The polarization direction of the emitted THz field reflects the direction of the photoelectron drift velocity and thus encodes the effective delay. By measuring the THz waves from argon atoms ionized by the two-color fields, and by precisely controlling their relative phase and ellipticity, we observe intensity-dependent rotations of the THz polarization direction. Both experiment and time-dependent Schrodinger equation simulations reveal that the effective delay extracted from the THz polarization direction decreases with increasing laser intensity, consistent with conventional photoelectron attoclock results. Our experiment establishes the feasibility of the THz attoclock as a contactless probe of tunneling dynamics, with promising applications to condensed matter systems where photoelectron detection is impractical.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper describes an all-optical THz attoclock for studying ultrafast electron dynamics without photoelectron detection.", "motivation": "The authors aimed to develop a new method to study ultrafast electron dynamics in gases using THz radiation, avoiding the need for photoelectron detection.", "method": "They used THz radiation emitted from ionized gases and the polarization direction of the THZ field to infer electron drift velocities induced by photoionization.", "result": "The THZ polarization direction rotated with laser intensity, and simulations showed a decrease in effective delay with higher intensity, aligning with traditional methods.", "conclusion": "This method offers a contactless alternative for studying tunneling dynamics in condensed matter systems."}}

In this Letter, we push the study beyond scalar fields by exploring vector fields on hyperbolic lattices.

In stark contrast to Euclidean crystals, where the Goldstone theorem ensures that acoustic phonon modes are gapless, hyperbolic lattices with coordination number $z > 2d$ exhibit a finite bulk phonon gap. We identify the origin of this breakdown: the Goldstone modes here belong to nonunitary representations of the translation group and therefore cannot form gapless excitation branches.

Motivated by this, we propose a new formulation of $f(R,T)$ gravity based on the Herglotz variational principle, which extends the usual {Hamilton} variational principle to dissipative systems by allowing the Lagrangian to depend explicitly on the action. The resulting gravitational field equations extend those of $f(R,T)$ gravity by including Herglotz contributions. In the Newtonian limit, these contributions modify the gravitational potential, allowing us to constrain the Herglotz vector through Mercury's perihelion precession and the relativistic light deflection. Remarkably, the Herglotz corrections lead to a scaling law consistent with observations from the Cassini spacecraft. Examining two representative cosmological models, the Herglotz vector effectively reduces to a single function that, under suitable conditions, can play the role of a cosmological constant, providing an alternative mechanism for the Universe's accelerated expansion.

As such, the goal of this framework is to leverage quantum processors to tackle optimization, supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, and generative modeling-among other tasks-more efficiently than classical models. Here we offer a high level overview of QML, focusing on settings where the quantum device is the primary learning or data generating unit. We outline the field's tensions between practicality and guarantees, access models and speedups, and classical baselines and claimed quantum advantages-flagging where evidence is strong, where it is conditional or still lacking, and where open questions remain. By shedding light on these nuances and debates, we aim to provide a friendly map of the QML landscape so that the reader can judge when-and under what assumptions-quantum approaches may offer real benefits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08QML\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u8d44\u6e90\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u6765\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86QML\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8ba8\u8bba\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u6216\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e3b\u5355\u5143\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5728\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u52a0\u901f\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u58f0\u79f0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u6216\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u6240\u5728\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5fae\u5999\u7684\u5f02\u5316\u4e0e\u4e89\u6267\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u8bfb\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8eQML\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u6982\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5224\u65ad\u4f55\u65f6\u2014\u2014\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4ec0\u4e48\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u2014\u2014\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u9645\u5229\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7efc\u8ff0\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684QML\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5168\u6587\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86QML\u9886\u57df\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u5174\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5f53\u524dQML\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5949\u732e\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Electro-optic modulators implemented after the laser offer fast frequency tunability but these components are bulky and prone to high insertion losses.

This action is constructed directly from the entanglement entropy of the CFT$_{2}$, and we show that the Einstein equations of AdS$_{3}$ gravity can be derived from it. In the near-coincidence limit, using Riemann normal coordinates, the action reduces to a string worldsheet action in a curved background that naturally includes the symmetric spacetime metric, an antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field, and a dilaton. The Kalb-Ramond field gives rise to a string charge density, from which we demonstrate that bit threads can be exactly reproduced. This correspondence provides a clear physical interpretation of bit threads. Exploiting this correspondence, we establish explicit relations between the emergent string worldsheet and the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface, providing new insights into entanglement entropy. In particular, entanglement entropy can be computed from open string charge, while Bekenstein-Hawking entropy arises from closed string charge through open-closed string duality. These results suggest a unified picture in which the Susskind-Uglum conjecture, open-closed string duality, and the ER=EPR proposal emerge as equivalent manifestations of the same underlying principle.

The mechanism relies on hidden fermionic symmetries of the worldline BRST formulation, rather than on standard BRST structure or physical supersymmetry. These symmetries localize the target-space trajectory. For the harmonic oscillator this yields an alternative localization derivation of the Jacobi-Poisson formula. Moreover, after the trajectory is localized, the remaining proper-time integral exhibits an emergent zero-dimensional supersymmetry generated by modular invariance, allowing the modulus T itself to be localized. For scalar QED the same structure provides a controlled computation of both the real and imaginary parts of the Euler-Heisenberg effective action.

Inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks, ensuring that every continuous function can be arbitrarily well approximated uniformly on a compact set of a Euclidean space, some recent works have established analogous results for QNNs, ranging from single-qubit to multi-qubit QNNs, and even hybrid classical-quantum models. In this paper, we study the approximation capabilities of QNNs for periodic functions with respect to the supremum norm. We use the Jackson inequality to approximate a given function by implementing its approximating trigonometric polynomial via a suitable QNN. In particular, we see that by restricting to the class of periodic functions, one can achieve a quadratic reduction of the number of parameters, producing better approximation results than in the literature. Moreover, the smoother the function, the fewer parameters are needed to construct a QNN to approximate the function.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5468\u671f\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u5df2\u6709\u6587\u732e\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Jackson\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5468\u671f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u4e09\u89d2\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "result": "\u5728H\u00f6lder\u7c7b\u548cBesov\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0cQNNs\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u903c\u8fd1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5468\u671f\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The formalism naturally separates geometric and dissipative contributions, identified by a Berry curvature and a metric in parameter space, respectively. Analytical results show that the geometric heat pumped per cycle is bounded by $k_B T N_q \\ln 2$ for $N_q$ non-interacting qubits, in direct analogy with the Landauer limit for entropy change. This bound can be surpassed when qubit interactions and asymmetric couplings to the baths are introduced. Numerical results for the interacting two-qubit system reveal a non-trivial role of the interaction between qubits and the coupling between the qubits and the baths in the behavior of the dissipated power.

In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks.

Variational quantum algorithms have been proposed for solving problems in these domains. However, the design of the quantum circuit ansatz remains a challenge. Of particular interest is developing a method to generate circuits for any given instance of a problem, not merely a circuit tailored to a specific instance of the problem. To this end, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to learning a problem-dependent quantum circuit mapping, which outputs a circuit for the ground state of a Hamiltonian from a given family of parameterized Hamiltonians. For quantum chemistry, our RL framework takes as input a molecule and a discrete set of bond distances, and it outputs a bond-distance-dependent quantum circuit for arbitrary bond distances along the potential energy curve. The inherently non-greedy approach of our RL method contrasts with existing greedy approaches to adaptive, problem-tailored circuit constructions. We demonstrate its effectiveness for the four-qubit and six-qubit lithium hydride molecules, as well as an eight-qubit H$_4$ chain.

Within this framework, we analyse the role of measurement incompatibility and establish its quantitative effect on attainable precision. We achieve this by deriving upper bounds based on the pretty good measurement -- a notion originally developed for hypothesis testing -- combined with the evaluation of the Nagaoka-Hayashi lower bound. In general, we prove that, as in the many-copy regime of local estimation theory, incompatibility can at most double the minimum loss relative to the idealised scenario in which individually optimal measurements are assumed jointly implementable. This result implies that, in many practical situations, the latter may provide a sufficient and computationally efficient benchmark without solving the full optimisation problem. Our results, which we illustrate through a range of applications, including discrete quantum phase imaging, phase and dephasing estimation, and qubit sensing, provide analytical and numerical tools for assessing ultimate precision limits and the role of measurement incompatibility in Bayesian multiparameter quantum metrology. We also provide an open-source package that implements all bounds discussed here, enabling practical evaluation and comparison across quantum metrological models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528pretty good\u6d4b\u91cf\u548cNagaoka-Hayashi\u4e0b\u754c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u6700\u591a\u4f1a\u52a0\u500d\u6700\u5c0f\u635f\u5931\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u5305\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u4f30\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u4e0d\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u5176\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u91cf\u5b50\u4f30\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u4f30\u6d4b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 pretty good \u6d4b\u91cf\u548c Nagaoka-Hayashi \u4e0b\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u51b5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u6700\u591a\u4f1a\u52a0\u500d\u6700\u5c0f\u635f\u5931\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5982\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u53bb\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5728\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u91cf\u5b50\u4f30\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}
