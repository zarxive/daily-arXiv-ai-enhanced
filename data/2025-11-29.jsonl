The hyperfine structures in two different atomic ground-state transitions at 398.4~nm and 398.2~nm were probed by in-source laser spectroscopy at the RISIKO mass separator in Mainz, using the PI-LIST high-resolution ion source. Experimental results were combined with hyperfine fields from various atomic ab-initio calculations, in particular using MultiConfigurational Dirac-Hartree-Fock theory, as implemented in GRASP18. In this manner, the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments were derived to be $μ= -0.75(5)~ μ_\\textrm{N}$ and $Q_\\textrm{S} = +5.84(13)$~eb, respectively.\n  The magnetic moment indicates occupation of the $ν$~7/2[613] Nilsson orbital, while the large quadrupole moment confirms strong, stable prolate deformation consistent with systematics in the heavy actinides. Comparisons with available expectation values from nuclear theory show good agreement, providing a stringent benchmark for the used theoretical models.\n  These results revise earlier data and establish $^{255}$Fm as a reference isotope for future high-resolution studies."}

By moving the two synchronous oppositely circularly polarized XUV pulses (that make the ionizing LP pulse) apart in time, we propose an attosecond double-slit streak camera scheme to see information loss in polarization-dependent two-slit phenomena. Such streaking interferogram is then composed of several Feynman's thought experiments in time domain, in which electrons are affected by the IR pulse as they exit the two attoslits upon XUV ionization processes to form Archimedean spiral patterns. As a proof-of-principle, when the IR femtofield and first XUV attopulse are synchronous, a loss of contrast through dephasing is seen in the simulated momentum and energy distributions of the photoelectron. It is shown that the contrast between bright and dark interference fringes diminishes predominantly along the IR-field polarization axis and is sensitive to the IR-field waveform. Our which-time information scheme provides further confirmation of the wave-particle duality."}

The mobility follows an extended-exponential dependence $μ(t) = μ_0 \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\big( - (t/τ)^β \\big) \\right]$ with characteristic electrostatic lengths $τ= 6$--$50~\\mathrm{μm}$. Comparison with boundary-scattering and depletion-based models shows that mobility degradation is dominated not by Fuchs--Sondheimer surface scattering but by electrostatic depletion that reduces the effective conducting channel thickness. Across all samples, the hierarchy $λ_D < τ\\lesssim W_0$ identifies long-range screening and near-surface electric fields as the primary mechanisms governing the mobility crossover. This connection provides a simple device-level design rule: maintaining $t \\gtrsim 3τ$ preserves most of the bulk mobility, while thinner devices enter a depletion-controlled regime with sharply reduced transport. The extracted parameters thus supply quantitative benchmarks for mobility engineering in ultrathin HPGe and a predictive framework for Ge-on-insulator structures, fully depleted channels, and future Ge-based quantum and electronic technologies."}

We show that these approaches are mutually reinforcing: the Alexandrov-Zeeman theorems establish the rigid conformal structure of spacetime, while the ``bona fide clock'' required by MPSV serves the necessary mathematical role of breaking the dilation symmetry. We provide a formal derivation proving that the normalization of a single clock worldline is sufficient to select a unique metric from the conformal class, thereby clarifying that the number of fundamental constants is exactly one."}

We demonstrate, via numerical simulations, that the network is remodeled by organized patterns of buckling, which lead to a renormalization of the Poisson ratio.

Unlike single-layer systems, these bilayers exhibit two distinct modes, $ω_{\\pm}$, which show characteristic dependences upon the momentum and hopping integrals along the $z$ direction. To apply them to cuprates, strong correlation effects should be considered, but a comprehensive analysis has not yet been investigated. In this work, we present a strong-coupling theory to analyze the charge dynamics of a bilayer system, utilizing the $t$-$J$-$V$ model, which includes the long-range Coulomb interaction, $V$, on a lattice. Although our theoretical framework is fundamentally different from the weak-coupling approach, we find that resulting plasmon excitations are similar to those of a weak-coupling theory. A key distinction is that our strong-coupling framework reveals a noticeable suppression of particle-hole excitations, which allows the plasmon modes to remain well-defined over a wider region of momentum. We suggest that the experimentally reported plasmon excitations in Y-based cuprates can be described by the $ω_{-}$ mode, although we call for more systematic experiments to verify this."}

Recent results on Haar random encoding suggest a breakdown of complementary recovery, in which no logical operators can be reconstructed from individual bipartite subsystems. Motivated by this, we propose an interpretation where a baby universe emerges as logical degrees of freedom that cannot be accessed from either boundary alone, assuming pseudorandom dynamics in holographic CFTs. We then analyze two conceptual puzzles: an apparent cloning of baby-universe microstates and its eventual fate at the singularity. Both puzzles are avoided because no single boundary observer can access the baby-universe degrees of freedom, be it classical or quantum, reflecting an emergent form of complementarity due to the structure of random encoding. In this interpretation, observers arise naturally: the same heavy operator that prepares the baby-universe geometry also serves as observer-like degrees of freedom that define an observer-dependent baby-universe microstate."}

This study introduces strategies to compute RQA measures directly from time series or phase space vectors, avoiding the need to construct RPs. The calculations can be further accelerated and optimised by applying a random sampling procedure, in which only a subset of line structures is evaluated. These modifications result in shorter run times, less memory use and access, and lower overall energy consumption during analysis while maintaining accuracy. This makes them especially appealing for large-scale data analysis and machine learning applications. The ideas are not limited to diagonal line measures, but can likewise be applied to vertical line-based measures and to recurrence network measures. By lowering computational costs, the proposed strategies contribute to energy saving and sustainable data analysis, and broaden the applicability of recurrence-based methods in modern research contexts."}

While single-crystal studies have demonstrated excellent timing resolution by leveraging prompt Cherenkov photons, practical detector modules based on pixelated arrays introduce a high prevalence of inter-crystal scattering (InterCS) events, complicating timing accuracy. In this study, we experimentally investigated the impact of InterCS on BGO Cherenkov timing using a dual-pixel detector coupled to a segmented SiPM readout. Events were classified into full-energy deposition (FED; primary crystal 511 keV absorption), InterCS, and penetration types via energy-weighted positioning and validated using GATE simulations, which also revealed that over 25% of the experimentally identified full-energy events involved intra-crystal scatter (IntraCS). For InterCS events, the optimal timestamp selection was achieved by choosing the earlier of the two timestamps, yielding a coincidence timing resolution of 221 ps FWHM (831 ps FWTM)-markedly worse than the 184 ps (603 ps FWTM) obtained for FED events. Furthermore, prompt photon yield was found to decrease measurably due to energy splitting: InterCS events averaged 4.73 detected photons in the first 1 ns, compared to 5.76 for FED events. These results emphasize the importance of incorporating time-aware, per-pixel timestamping strategies in pixelated BGO TOF-PET systems to maintain optimal timing performance in the presence of scatter."}

MLFFs fine-tuned on AIMD reference data retain near-DFT accuracy while enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations extending to tens of nanoseconds. These extended trajectories remove the strong finite-size bias present in AIMD and yield diffusion coefficients in excellent agreement with experiment. Furthermore, from these long MLFF trajectories, we obtain statistically converged lithium jump networks and construct MSMs that remain Markovian across more than two orders of magnitude in the lag times used for their construction. The resulting MSMs faithfully reproduce mean-square displacements and recover rare diffusion processes that do not occur on AIMD timescales. In addition to propagating lithium distributions, the MSM transition matrices provide mechanistic insight: their eigenvalues and eigenvectors encode characteristic relaxation timescales and dominant transport pathways.

Here, we target the gravitational waves events emitted by binary black hole (BBH) mergers, with their total mass larger than 30 solar masses. For denoising, we propose a deep learning model utilizing the Griffin-Lim algorithm, an existing numerical approach to restore the phase information from the related amplitude spectrogram. This design allows extra attention on the phase recovery by using a priorly denoised amplitude spectrogram. The denoising results fit well in both the amplitude and the phase alignments of the mock injected waveforms.

Here we derive an effective low-energy description of such a system near the Mott insulating regime, starting from the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian and projecting onto the high-spin manifold favored by Hund's first rule. The resulting Hund-projected Kanamori model captures the interplay between carrier motion and magnetic correlations in the presence of strong Hund's coupling. In the undoped limit, the model reduces to a spin-$N/2$ Heisenberg system with suppressed quantum fluctuations, approaching the classical limit for realistic five-band configurations. Upon doping, carrier motion couples strongly to the spin background and drives ferromagnetic correlations through a Hund-enhanced kinetic mechanism analogous to, but much stronger than, Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Owing to its reduced sign problem, the model can be addressed with advanced path-integral methods to determine quasiparticle structure and effective interactions between carriers-quantities that are challenging to obtain with other methods.

These yield two novel families of symmetric and antisymmetric locality sum rules. We test these sum rules explicitly in the free scalar field theory."}

On the other hand, interactions are rarely uniform in real systems. By introducing power law couplings that algebraically decay with the distance between the spins $r$ as $1/r^α$, we break this symmetry with a non-zero $α$, and probe the emergence of new dynamical behaviors, including thermalization. As we increase $α$, the system interpolates from an infinite range spin system at $α=0$ exhibiting permutation symmetry, to a short range integrable model as $α\\rightarrow \\infty$ where this permutation symmetry is absent. We focus on the change in the behavior of the system as $α$ is tuned, using dynamical quantities like total angular momentum operator $J^2$ and the von Neumann entropy $S_{N/2}$. Starting from the chaotic limit of the permutation symmetric Hamiltonian at $α=0$, we find that for small $α$, the steady state values of these quantities remain close to the permutation symmetric subspace values corresponding to $α=0$. At intermediate $α$ values, these show signatures of thermalization exhibiting values corresponding to that of random states in full Hilbert space. On the other hand, the large $α$ limit approaches the values corresponding to integrable kicked Ising model. In addition, we also study the dependence of thermalization on the driving period $τ$, with results indicating the onset of thermalization for smaller values of $α$ when $τ$ is large, thereby extending the intermediate range of $α$. We further confirm these results using effective dimension and spectral statistics."}

Within the mean-field approximation, we demonstrate the emergence of nonlinear self-trapping for strong interparticle interactions, and characterize the distinct excitation regimes in the absence of the inter-ring tunneling. The artificial magnetic flux typically introduces Peierls phase factors, which induces complex-valued hopping amplitudes and leads to directed net particle currents along the chains. By further incorporating the finite inter-ring coupling and biased intra-ring hopping, we reveal that the tuning of the drive frequency and Peierls phase allows the precise control over both the intensity and direction of particle currents, which facilitates the transition between chiral and antichiral dynamics. These findings offer insights into the coherent manipulation of matter-wave transports in closed-loop lattice configurations and the exploration of nonequilibrium synthetic quantum systems in related fields."}

We consider this issue by investigating attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy at the Br M4,5 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ edges (66 to 80 eV), tracking core-to-valence (3d to 4p) and core-to-Rydberg (3d to ns, np, n $\\geq$ 5) transitions from the molecular to atomic limit. The progress of dissociation can be ascertained by the buildup of the atomic absorption in time. Notably, the measured rise times of the 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ to 4p transitions depend on the probed core level final state, 38 $\\pm$ 1 and 20 $\\pm$ 5 fs for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ and $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ at 64.31 and 65.34 eV, respectively. Simulations by the nuclear time-dependent Schrödinger equation reproduce the rise-time difference of the 3d to 4p transitions, and the theory suggests several important factors. One is the transition dipole moments of each probe transition have different molecular and atomic values for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ versus $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ that depend on the bond length. The other is the merger of multiple molecular absorptions into the same atomic absorption, creating multiple timescales even for a single probe transition. Unfortunately, the core-to-Rydberg absorptions did not allow accurate atomic Br buildup times to be extracted due to spectral overlaps with ground state bleaching, otherwise an even more comprehensive picture of the role of the probe state transition would be possible. This work shows that the measured probe signals accurately contain the dissociative wavepacket dynamics but also reveal how the specific probe transition affects the apparent progress toward dissociation with bond length. Such potential probe-transition-dependent effects need to be considered when interpreting measured signals and their timescales."}

Here, the thermal transport in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems is investigated by solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The local thermal conductivity is proposed to describe the non-uniform spatial distribution of heat transport capability in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems. The maximum value exceeds the uniform heating case by up to 27%, which is attributed to the spatially varying fraction of unscattered phonons emitted from hotspots. Moreover, the effects and mechanisms of hotspot spacing on thermal transport are investigated, showing that reducing the hotspot spacing can enhance the heat flux by up to 40%. This work challenges the conventional view that thermal transport capability is spatially uniform throughout the system and provides fundamental insights for thermal management in high-power-density integrated circuits."}

Conventional approaches to generate and manipulate these excitations rely on external gauge fields and structured light modulation, or microcavity TE-TM polarization splitting. While the former can only access the polariton pseudospin indirectly, through separate coupling of the excitonic or photonic component, the latter suffers from a lack of deterministic control over the resulting topological defects. Here, we report the generation of topology-induced spin polaritons in a monolithic bound state in the continuum (BIC) perovskite metasurface with broken inversion symmetry. Upon condensation, spin-momentum locking enables the generation of a pair of half-vortex within the polariton fluid, which display mutual attraction due to the connecting polarization string linking their opposite spins. We find that an increase in polariton density, enhancing the characteristic blueshift of the emission spectrum, leads to a narrowing of the inter-vortex separation, revealing deterministic interactions pinned to the cavity topology. By harnessing structural control alone, our approach enables robust engineering of the intrinsic pseudospin texture of the polariton fluid, offering a versatile platform for manipulating vortex nucleation, interaction, and annihilation without employing external fields."}

Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral.

However, these bounds inevitably become loose in symmetry broken phases, where local constraints are insufficient to capture long-range order. In this work, we identify the origin of this looseness as order parameter defects which are difficult to remove using local operators. We introduce a $\\textit{defect bootstrap}$ framework that resolves this limitation by embedding the system into an auxiliary $\\textit{defect model}$ equipped with ancilla degrees of freedom. This construction effectively enables local operators to remove order parameter defects, yielding tighter bounds in phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This approach can be applied broadly to pairwise-interacting local lattice models with discrete or continuous internal symmetries that satisfy a property we call $\\textit{defect diamagnetism}$, which requires that the ground state energy does not decrease upon adding any finite number of symmetry defects. Applying the method to the transverse field Ising models in 1D and 2D, we obtain significantly improved bounds on energy densities and spin correlation functions throughout the symmetry broken phase in 1D and deep within the phase in 2D. Our results demonstrate that physically motivated constraint sets can dramatically enhance the power of bootstrap methods for quantum many-body systems."}

The system comprises two complementary mini-EV modules: low-cost trailers for on-demand feeder trips and high-performance leaders that guide coupled trailers in high-speed platoons along trunk lines. Trailers operate independently for detour-free feeder services, while stationary coupling at designated hubs enables platoons to achieve economies of scale (EoS).

We then show that, in contrast, such perturbative constructions cannot be realized within the effective field theory approach to higher-derivative corrections. Remarkably, this conclusion holds irrespective of the specific form of the correction terms. The key observation is that the enhanced symmetries in the near-horizon region severely constrain the effective energy-momentum tensor near the throat. This prevents the formation of the traversable throat structure. Our analysis therefore establishes no-go theorems: traversable wormholes cannot arise perturbatively from Reissner-Nordström or Myers-Perry black holes in an effective field theory approach.

Both deformations enlarge the Krylov space, but the mass deformation has a stronger effect. Krylov complexity exhibits initial quadratic growth, followed by linear growth across both deformations. We observe that both deformations increase the quadratic and linear growth rates of Krylov complexity at early times. At late times, the irrelevant deformation increases the saturation complexity as a fraction of the Krylov dimension, while the mass deformation decreases it. This reveals distinct signatures of how supersymmetry breaking impacts quantum complexity."}

By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under thermoelectric chiral drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties."}

To this end, we conducted a three-day workshop to construct an operational 0.27T MRI scanner. The workshop hosted 16 participants, including faculty, postdoctoral fellows, trainers, and students, who collaborated to build the scanner using open-source hardware and software components. Teams were designated to focus on various subsystems, including the magnet, passive shimming, radiofrequency (RF) coils, gradient coils, data acquisition, and reconstruction. Pre-workshop preparation involved simulation-based design processes and fabrication techniques, which incorporated configuring MaRCoS and PyPulseq libraries, CNC machining, and 3D printing. During the workshop, participants assembled an H-shaped magnet, which achieved a peak magnetic field strength of 0.269T. Passive shimming effectively reduced the field inhomogeneity from 3mT to 2mT. A 3 cm diameter RF solenoid was built and tuned to 11.4 MHz. The gradients exhibited less than 5% non-linearity in simulations and were fabricated by CNC machining copper plates. The assembled system was used to acquire a 2D spin echo of a water phantom. Following the workshop, the system was further optimized to scan relaxometry phantoms. A post-workshop survey was carried out, revealing over 87% satisfaction. The constructed scanner represents a valuable platform for educational initiatives, pulse sequence development, and preclinical research imaging efforts."}

In fact we generalize the well-known Berg theory, which describes diffusion-controlled reactions occurring within a spherically symmetric absorber-cavity system. The trapping probability and the reaction rate at which a small diffusing particle is captured by an axially symmetric one reactive patch absorber inside a spherical cavity were found semi-analytically and numerically by means of the dual series relations method. This approach leads to such incredibly fast convergence, that it may rightly be referred to as exact one. The results obtained can be used to test numerical programmes that describe diffusion-controlled reactions in real physical systems for reactants with arbitrary anisotropic reactivity, which are located inside of various cavities as well as in the unbounded domains. Moreover, we managed to find a close connection between the dual series relations method and the generalized method of separation of variables."}

The feedback optimization is performed offline on a calibrated emulator and the resulting Delta phi* is deployed as pre-calibrated phase compensation on hardware. This represents an \"offline closed-loop, online open-loop\" feasibility demonstration. Using an Aer-based emulator calibrated with ibm_fez device parameters, Aurora-DD achieves substantial reductions in mean-squared error of the measured expectation value <Z>, yielding 68-97% improvement across phase settings phi = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 over n=30 randomized trials. These large-n emulator results provide statistically stable evidence that the combined effect of XY8 and Delta phi* suppresses both dephasing and systematic phase bias. On real superconducting hardware (ibm_fez), we perform a small-sample (n=3) multi-phase validation campaign. Aurora-DD yields point estimates corresponding to approximately 99.2-99.6% reduction in absolute error relative to a no-DD baseline across all tested phase points. These hardware numbers are reported transparently as feasibility evidence under tight queue and credit constraints. In contrast, the auxiliary Aurora+ZNE branch exhibits instability: shallow two-point ZNE occasionally amplifies calibration inconsistencies and produces large error outliers. We therefore relegate ZNE analysis to the Appendix and position Aurora-DD (without ZNE) as the primary contribution. Overall, the combined results support pre-calibrated Aurora-DD as a practical, stable, and hardware-compatible phase-coherence compensator for NISQ devices in single-qubit settings."}

The effect is referred to as vibrational transportation, or as a surface acoustic wave motor. A traditional theory of vibrational transportation considers a particle as a material point moving on a rigid substrate. A more realistic representation is a contact model based on Cattaneo-Mindlin (also called Hertz-Mindlin) mechanics applicable to an axisymmetric deformable particle. A recent semi-analytical extension of the Cattaneo-Mindlin solution called the Method of Memory Diagrams allows one to compute the hysteretic friction force for an arbitrary loading history in terms of contact displacements, and, subsequently, to numerically solve the equations of motion. Depending on the materials' and excitation parameters, the particle can stay in permanent contact with the substrate or experience multiple jumps. In the former case, the particle can slide along the surface, during each wave period, advancing and receding with different efficiencies, which finally results in a drift. The drift can occur both in the wave propagation direction and against it. In the regime of multiple jumps, directed horizontal motion is also possible. It is based on synchronization between the wave period and rebounding events. A rebound occurs once per period and consistently at the same phase. At the beginning of the process, the particle moves with an acceleration that decreases and finally disappears. Exactly the same type of motion against the wave has been observed in our preliminary experiments. We demonstrate that a point mass behaves differently: in a regime of permanent contact, negative and positive sliding are equilibrated, which produces no drift, whereas multiple rebounds of a point mass are always chaotic, at least for fully conservative collisions."}

Such a black hole has a single (external) horizon located very near the Schwarzschild radius, $r_h=2M$, while its surface of unstable bound geodesics (photon sphere) is located at a moderately shortened radius than its Schwarzschild counterpart. Relying on a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk with a monochromatic emission described by suitable adaptations of Standard Unbound profiles previously employed in the literature, we generate images of this solution, which displays relevant modifications to the typical photon ring and central brightness depression features found in black hole images. In this sense, we fit the width of the two first photon rings in order to reconstruct the Lyapunov exponent of nearly-bound geodesics characterizing the theoretical ratio of successive rings. Such an exponent is tightly attached to observational features of photon rings such as their relative intensities in time-averaged images and the time-scale of hot-spots. Our results point out that non-singular black holes of this type are hard to distinguish from their Schwarzschild counterparts using this method alone, since the theoretical, numerical, disk-modeling, and observational uncertainties are too entangled with one another to allowing a neat distinction of such an exponent. It also points out to the need of incorporating dynamical settings such as hot-spots or quasi-normal modes from gravitational wave ringdowns as a way to circumvent such difficulties."}

Draft submitting for \"Optics and Lasers in Engineering.\"", "summary": "Wavefront reconstruction in lateral shearing interferometry typically assumes that the shear amount is an integer multiple of the sampling interval. When the shear is fractional, approximating it with the nearest integer value leads to noticeable reconstruction errors. To address this, we propose a weighted integer shear averaging method. The approach combines reconstructions from nearby integer shears with carefully chosen weights designed to cancel the dominant error terms. Analytical error analysis shows that two-shear averaging removes first-order errors, while three-shear averaging removes second-order errors. Numerical simulations with a test wavefront confirm that the method achieves significantly lower RMS error than conventional single-shear reconstruction. The technique is simple, computationally efficient, and can be readily extended to two-dimensional interferometry. This makes weighted integer shear averaging a practical and accurate tool for wavefront reconstruction when fractional shear is unavoidable."}

Building on our previous work, we perform analytic continuations across different sectors via the complexification to the spectral (energy) parameter $u$ and identify continuous and discontinuous transitions of the exact spectrum for generic potentials. When the transition is discontinuous, it is characterized by the Stokes phenomena, inducing different exact (median) quantization conditions, thereby distinct trans-series structures valid in different sectors. We analyze two illustrative examples, namely asymmetric triple-well (ATW) and tilted double-well (TDW), and verify the general qualitative analysis by deriving exact (median) quantization conditions in each sector. Moreover, by obtaining the trans-series solutions for each system, we identify bion/bounce configurations and show that the trans-series of ATW is organized in accordance with the cluster expansion of the bion gas and there should exist a previously neglected complex saddle in the TDW system. These identifications further strengthen the link between path integral and exact-WKB formalisms, while also demonstrating the predictive power of the latter. In parallel, for the P-NP relations of genus-1 systems, we derive transformation rules between any perturbative and non-perturbative pair of WKB-cycles. Our results show that the entire resurgence data of a genus-1 system transforms only by the change of classical parameters, i.e. frequencies and bion/bounce actions, and the perturbative energy series. This also reveals the underlying reasons of the previously found $S$-duality transformations."}

This theoretical prediction typically relies on an oversimplified model, where both the nanowire and the superconductor are idealized as one-dimensional systems. In reality, heterostructures have finite sizes that deviate from this idealization-and as a result, smoking-gun evidence confirming the existence of these zero modes remains elusive. Here, we investigate the finite-size effects of both the nanowire and the superconductor, and optimize their sizes to ensure that only one Majorana fermion exists at each end of the heterostructure. It is discovered that the optimal transverse sizes of the nanowire are less than 100nm in width and approximately 1nm in thickness. For the superconductor layer, its optimal thickness (a key aspect of its size) must exceed its coherence length. We also present the optimal sizes of the two types of materials used in the experiment in a quantitative manner. Notably, the identified optimal thickness of the superconductor (Al films, $\\sim$1000nm)--a critical size parameter--is two orders of magnitude larger than the thickness of Al films currently utilized in experimental devices (e.g., InSb-Al and InAs-Al heterostructures). Our findings could explain why Majorana fermions have not been observed in current experiments, and offer guidance for the size selection of heterostructures to implement Majorana fermions in future studies."}

The physical nature of the phenomenon in both cases is determined by the difference in the Doppler frequency shift at the entrance and exit of the wave through the sample.

The method is implemented by dressing a Wannier-interpolated Hamiltonian with the field through its position matrix elements, which allows the gate bias to modify orbital hybridization and band dispersion beyond perturbative treatments. Within the independent-particle approximation, the resulting second-order (shift) conductivity is evaluated for both centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric layered systems. Applied to MoS$_2$, the approach captures the emergence of a finite shift current in centrosymmetric bilayers and the tunability of intrinsic responses in polar structures. The shift conductivity rises linearly at small fields and saturates at higher intensities, reflecting the competition between the growing shift vector and the weakening interband coupling as resonant transitions move away from high-symmetry valleys. A Taylor expansion of the field-dressed conductivity connects this behavior to the third-order optical response, revealing a unified picture of field-induced nonlinearities.

We use the SD as an elementary component to realize coherent nonreciprocal qubit-qubit coupling. With a minimal two qubit system, we demonstrate a nonreciprocal half-iSWAP gate with tunable Bell-state generation, thereby showcasing the potential of intrinsic nonreciprocity as a tool in coherent control in quantum technologies. Our work enables high-fidelity signal routing and entanglement generation in all-to-all connected microwave quantum networks, where nonreciprocity is embedded at the device level."}

The differential scattering cross section is computed using the partial wave method, with the forward divergence handled via the series reduction technique. For the first time, we systematically examine the influence of the black hole charge, electromagnetic interactions, and field mass on the equatorial cross section. Our results reveal that regardless of whether the electromagnetic interaction is present or not, the frame-dragging effect shifts the glory away from the exact backward direction and can place interference minima there, contrasting with the on-axis scattering case. The average scattered flux intensity at the medium to large scattering angles exhibits a large enhancement as the Lorentz attraction or field mass increases, particularly in the slowly rotating regime, with the enhancement being frequency-dependent. When superradiance occurs, we observe that the cross section in the prograde scattering angles ($\\sim 135^{\\circ} < φ< 270^{\\circ}$) increases as the black hole spin increases, due to enhanced prograde partial wave contributions. Meanwhile, the superradiant scattering cross section increases in all (except the forward) directions when the Lorentz force becomes more repulsive. These findings highlight unique equatorial-plane signatures of charged, rotating spacetimes, distinguishing them from prior on-axis analyses."}

Performing finite-size scaling analyzes, we obtain the model's ground state phase diagram, which includes the semi-metal (SM), Kekulé Valence Bond Solid (KVBS), and anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) phases, as well as indications of a small KVBS/AFM coexistence region. We find that a weak to moderate Hubbard repulsion, tuned toward the SM-AFM critical value in the pure honeycomb Hubbard model, enhances KVBS correlations and can even stabilize the KVBS phase. Estimating the effective parameters for graphene places it in the SM region of the phase diagram, but near the SM-KVBS phase boundary. Notably, we predict that increasing either the on-site Hubbard repulsion or the e-ph coupling strength drives graphene toward the KVBS phase rather than the AFM phase, highlighting a synergistic effect that can be exploited to further control the remarkable properties of graphene and related materials."}

Dynamic and reconfigurable metalenses are key to next-generation flat-optics platforms, yet their practical realization remains limited by slow response, optical loss, and polarization sensitivity. The integration of chalcogenide phase-change materials with metasurface architectures offers a powerful platform for dynamic optical tunability, owing to materials such as Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST) that can reversibly switch between amorphous and crystalline states with distinct refractive indices. However, the strong optical absorption of crystalline GST in the visible to near-infrared range has hindered its widespread use in reconfigurable metalenses. In this study, we design an all-dielectric polarization-insensitive metasurface based on hybrid Si--GST nanostructures to realize a dynamically tunable bifocal metalens operating at 1.55 μm. The device achieves a variable focal length from 70 μm to 200 μm, with focusing efficiencies of 30% in the amorphous state and 20% in the crystalline state, as validated through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, we show that flat-top laser excitation enables uniform, reversible phase transitions within tens of nanoseconds -- amorphization in approximately 13~ns and crystallization in approximately 90~ns -- without mechanical motion or electrical bias. For next-generation metasurfaces intended for uses including beam steering, dynamic holography, optical routing, multi-depth imaging, and optical communication, this method shows great promise due to its control and stability."}

With the proposed mass-spin relation, we observe that that higher-spin interactions indeed become suppressed at large spins, consistent with low-energy physics.

Although current ab initio methods can accurately determine exciton energies and eigenstates, their symmetries have been much less explored. In this work, we employ standard group-theory methods to analyse the transformation properties of excitonic states, obtained by solving the BSE, under crystal symmetry operations. We develop an approach to assign irreducible-representation labels to excitonic states, providing a state-of-the-art framework for analysing their symmetries and selection rules (including, for example, the case of exciton-phonon coupling). Complementary to the symmetry classification, we introduce the concept of total crystal angular momentum for excitons in the presence of rotational symmetries, allowing the derivation of conservation laws. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these symmetry properties can be exploited to greatly enhance the computational efficiency of exciton calculations with the BSE. We apply our methodology to three prototypical systems to understand the role of symmetries in different contexts: (i) For LiF, we present the symmetry analysis of the entire excitonic dispersion and examine the selection rules for optical absorption. (ii) In the calculation of resonant Raman spectra of monolayer MoSe2, we demonstrate how the conservation of total crystal angular momentum governs exciton-phonon interactions, leading to the observed resonant enhancement. (iii) In bulk hBN, we analyze the role of symmetries for the coupling of finite-momentum excitons to finite-momentum phonons and their manifestation in the phonon-assisted luminescence spectra. This work establishes a general and robust framework for understanding the symmetry properties of excitons in crystals, providing a foundation for future studies."}

This has so far restricted the use of RCMPS to toy models with a single self-interacting field. We address this long standing problem by introducing a Riemannian optimization framework, that allows to minimize the energy density over the regular submanifold of multi-field RCMPS, and thus to retain purely variational results. We demonstrate its power on a model of two interacting scalar fields in $1+1$ dimensions. The method captures distinct symmetry-breaking phases, and the signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition along an $O(2)$-symmetric parameter line.

The crystal was sectioned longitudinally into 37 segments, enabling the first high-resolution and systematic mapping of dopant profiles along the length of a detector-grade HPGe boule. Hall-effect measurements were used to extract impurity concentrations for boron (B), aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), and phosphorus (P) in each segment.

For methods that characterize electromagnetic effects, these numerical methods are referred to as computational electromagnetics (CEM) methods. Although the CEM research field is mature, emerging applications can still stress the capabilities of the techniques in use today. The design of superconducting circuit quantum devices falls in this category due to the unconventional material properties and important features of the devices covering nanometer to centimeter scales. Such multiscale devices can stress the fundamental properties of CEM tools which can lead to an increase in simulation times, a loss in accuracy, or even cause no solution to be reliably found. While these challenges are being investigated by CEM researchers, knowledge about them is limited in the broader community of users of these CEM tools. This review is meant to serve as a practical introduction to the fundamental aspects of the major CEM techniques that a researcher may need to choose between to model a device, as well as provide insight into what steps they may take to alleviate some of their challenges. Our focus is on highlighting the main concepts without rigorously deriving all the details, which can be found in many textbooks and articles. After covering the fundamentals, we discuss more advanced topics related to the challenges of modeling multiscale devices with specific examples from superconducting circuit quantum devices. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions that will be valuable for improving the ability to successfully design increasingly more sophisticated superconducting circuit quantum devices. Although our focus and examples are taken from this area, researchers from other fields will still benefit from the details discussed here."}

It has been argued that the parameter regime with antiferromagnetic couplings on hexagons $J_h$ and ferromagnetic couplings on triangles $J_t$ and dimer $J_d$ bonds, is potentially host to a cornucopia of emergent phases with unconventional orders. Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids.

As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations.

This is achieved by relating higher-order Zeno sequences to higher-order Trotter formulas that achieve similar convergence behavior.

We first provide an elementary introduction to the continuum modelling of moiré bandstructures, and explain how interactions are incorporated to study correlated states. We then discuss how to implement mean-field simulations of ground state structure and collective excitations in this setting. With this background established, we rationalize the power of mean-field approximations in MA-TBG, by discussing the idealized \"chiral-flat\" strong-coupling limit, in which ground states at electron densities commensurate with the moiré superlattice are exactly captured by mean-field ansätze. We then illustrate the phenomenological shortcomings of this limit, leading us naturally into a discussion of the intermediate-coupling incommensurate Kekulé spiral (IKS) order and its origins in ever-present heterostrain. IKS and its placement within an expanded Hartree-Fock manifold form our first \"case study\". Our second case study involves time-dependence, and focuses on the collective modes of various broken-symmetry insulators in MA-TBG. As a third and final case study, we return to the strong-coupling picture, which can be stabilized by aligning MA-TBG to an hBN substrate. In this limit, we show how mean field theory can be adapted to the translationally non-invariant setting in order to quantitatively study the energetics of domain walls in orbital Chern insulating states. We close with a discussion of extensions and further applications.

This method leverages inherent information from the optical field, enabling precise beam alignment with a simple structure and minimal computational effort. In the 3D measurement experiment, the proposed method achieves a coefficient of determination of 0.99 for transverse offsets in the x- and y-directions, and 0.98 for air gap in the z-direction. The RMSE in x-direction, y-direction and z-direction is respectively 0.135 μm, 0.128 μm and 2.42 μm. The time for a single 3D displacement calculation is 4.037e-4 seconds. Furthermore, it facilitates single-step displacement regulation with a deviation tolerance within 0.15 μm and modal content regulation with an accuracy of 4.67%.

The tensionless (Carrollian) limit induces a universal gluing between the worldsheet oscillators, which we generalize to include the effects of a constant $B$-field. We derive the modified mixed boundary conditions, construct the corresponding gluing matrix and obtain the generalized induced vacuum as a squeezed boundary state. This vacuum continuously emerges from the closed string vacuum through a Bogoliubov transformation, providing a precise realization of the closed-to-open string transition. We further extend the analysis to toroidal compactifications, and show that the mechanism of worldsheet Bose-Einstein condensation persists unaltered. In the second part of the paper, we give a unified symplectic derivation of the open string noncommutative parameter. We show that the boundary symplectic form alone determines the noncommutative geometry, and that in the tensionless limit the $B$-field term becomes the unique surviving contribution. Its inverse produces a noncommutative parameter similar to the Seiberg-Witten result, but arising intrinsically from the Carrollian worldsheet dynamics. Our results establish a coherent picture in which the emergence of open strings, boundary noncommutativity, and generalized vacuum structure all arise naturally from the worldsheet geometry of null strings in a $B$-field background."}

The high $T_c$ enables tracking of the film thickness near Ne's triple temperature and below.

Existing techniques for deriving the tidal tensor rely on cumbersome, case-by-case methods. This paper introduces a unified analytical approach to deriving the tidal accelerations experienced by a test particle in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. This technique uses standard relativistic frame transformations and is built around the zero angular momentum observer frame.

We address this long standing problem by introducing a Riemannian optimization framework, that allows to minimize the energy density over the regular submanifold of multi-field RCMPS, and thus to retain purely variational results. We demonstrate its power on a model of two interacting scalar fields in $1+1$ dimensions. The method captures distinct symmetry-breaking phases, and the signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition along an $O(2)$-symmetric parameter line.

We provide explicit, recursive expressions for the trajectory coefficients and the resulting electric and magnetic waveforms. The resulting soft expansion exhibits manifest covariance under the electric-magnetic duality. The electric and magnetic waveforms transform as an $SO(2)$ doublet under electric-magnetic duality. This provides a non-trivial consistency check on our formulation. For the specific case of two-body scattering, we obtain resummed expressions for the waveforms in both the time and frequency domains."}

We first provide an elementary introduction to the continuum modelling of moiré bandstructures, and explain how interactions are incorporated to study correlated states. We then discuss how to implement mean-field simulations of ground state structure and collective excitations in this setting. With this background established, we rationalize the power of mean-field approximations in MA-TBG, by discussing the idealized \"chiral-flat\" strong-coupling limit, in which ground states at electron densities commensurate with the moiré superlattice are exactly captured by mean-field ansätze. We then illustrate the phenomenological shortcomings of this limit, leading us naturally into a discussion of the intermediate-coupling incommensurate Kekulé spiral (IKS) order and its origins in ever-present heterostrain. IKS and its placement within an expanded Hartree-Fock manifold form our first \"case study\". Our second case study involves time-dependence, and focuses on the collective modes of various broken-symmetry insulators in MA-TBG. As a third and final case study, we return to the strong-coupling picture, which can be stabilized by aligning MA-TBG to an hBN substrate. In this limit, we show how mean field theory can be adapted to the translationally non-invariant setting in order to quantitatively study the energetics of domain walls in orbital Chern insulating states. We close with a discussion of extensions and further applications. Used either as a standalone reference or alongside the accompanying open-source code, this review should enable readers with a basic knowledge of band theory and many-body physics to systematically build and analyze detailed models of generic moiré systems."}

The key result is a fully explicit analytic expression for both the renormalized Newton constant and the corresponding correction to the entropy. Using the Euclidean action, the replica trick, and heat-kernel methods, we obtain a closed-form expression that depends directly on the horizon area, the scalar mass, the interaction strength, and the curvature coupling. The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value. Our result makes it possible to study in detail how the correction varies with model parameters: light fields and strong interactions increase the effect, curvature suppresses it, and conformally coupled fields show no leading-order contribution. Overall, this work provides a clear analytic demonstration of how quantum field interactions modify black hole entropy through the renormalization of Newton's constant."}

Both deformations enlarge the Krylov space, but the mass deformation has a stronger effect. Krylov complexity exhibits initial quadratic growth, followed by linear growth across both deformations. We observe that both deformations increase the quadratic and linear growth rates of Krylov complexity at early times. At late times, the irrelevant deformation increases the saturation complexity as a fraction of the Krylov dimension, while the mass deformation decreases it. This reveals distinct signatures of how supersymmetry breaking impacts quantum complexity."}

This vector-tensor theory enjoys stable homogeneous and isotropic solutions characterized by an effective dark energy fluid, with behavior that ranges from freezing quintessential to thawing phantom-like, serving as a motivated framework to scrutinize the cosmological tensions that affect the standard $Λ$CDM model. While the model we consider is sufficiently generic to encompass a large class of field theories, it distinguishes itself from scalar dark energy models (quintessential ones, kinetic ones and non-minimally coupled ones) by the presence of what would be classed as a vector degree of freedom which can be for instance inherited from more generic theories of gravity. We improve on previous work in several directions: we consider a general one-parameter class of background models; identify a so-called 'special' model and analyze observational constraints taking also into account perturbations and making use of wide up-to-date catalogs of datasets including recently released ones. We find that the one-parameter Proca-Nuevo model is preferred over $Λ$CDM at $1.5σ$ when fitting CMB and BAO data, and at $2.4σ$ when further adding low-redshift data. The Hubble tension is alleviated, dropping from $5.8σ$ to $2.3σ$ (resp. $1.5σ$) between CMB with (and resp. without) BAO data and local measurements. On the other hand, we find that the vector field generically introduces a significant enhancement of the effective Newton constant, so that matching the observed matter power spectrum requires a mild amount of tuning to suppress the impact of perturbations. Since, at the background level, Proca-Nuevo is degenerate with other classes of theories, our results are also relevant to a wider range of set-ups including and beyond vector-tensor models."}

Interestingly, as a direct consequence of non-alignment of the electromagnetic field and contrary to the Plebański--Demiański class (where the field is aligned), such a symmetry no longer generates the full \"tower of symmetries\". Despite this, it enables one to separate variables in massless Hamilton--Jacobi, conformal wave, and massless Dirac equations, as well as allows one to tackle massless vector and tensor perturbations. These results provide a useful mathematical tool for discussing numerous (astrophysical) applications to be described by these metrics.

As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields.

In particular, we provide explicit predictions of measurable deviations using table top experiments. We also show how the same effect reduces the effective force of gravity at high energy densities in cosmology, leading to a period of early inflation without the need for anything beyond radiation. We also discuss the quantum origin of the universe with a 5D black hole acting as a catalyst for the nucleation of the dark bubble and how it accounts for the present matter content in the universe.

The momentum-energy representation $φ(k,E)$ is treated merely as a Fourier re-expression of the same state-kinematically equivalent but dynamically inert.

It produces a dual-manifold geometry in which each domain is locally complete yet globally open, with divergent limits in one mapping onto extended regions in the other. Remarkably, the dual-manifold symmetry alone reproduces both the uniform dark-energy background and the exponential boundary mapping near black-hole horizons that underlies Hawking radiation. This framework thus opens a quantum-theoretic route to cosmological phenomena that are ordinarily treated within general relativity."}

Kernel-based procedures for hypothetical testing have been proposed to efficiently disentangle high-dimensional complex structures in data to obtain accurate results in a model-free way by embedding the data into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). While the choice of kernels plays a crucial role for their performance, little is understood about how to choose kernel especially for small datasets. Here we aim to construct a hypothetical test which is effective even for small datasets, based on the theoretical foundation of kernel-based tests using maximum mean discrepancy, which is called MMD-FUSE. To address this, we enhance the MMD-FUSE framework by incorporating quantum kernels and propose a novel hybrid testing strategy that fuses classical and quantum kernels. This approach creates a powerful and adaptive test by combining the domain-specific inductive biases of classical kernels with the unique expressive power of quantum kernels. We evaluate our method on various synthetic and real-world clinical datasets, and our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, MMD-FUSE with quantum kernels consistently improves test power over classical counterparts, especially for small and high-dimensional data. 2) The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates remarkable robustness, adapting to different data characteristics and achieving high test power across diverse scenarios. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired and hybrid kernel strategies to build more effective statistical tests, offering a versatile tool for data analysis where sample sizes are limited."}

Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as ET, CE, and NEMO are expected to observe high-frequency gravitational wave signals, that is, the post-merger stage of the coalescence of binary neutron stars; then from these signals one can estimate the maximum mass that a spinless neutron star (MTOV) can have. In this paper, we investigate the problem of the determination of the MTOV precision from the post-merger detected by next-generation observatories. The results show that CE achieves the best mass precision with approximately 8% $M_{\\odot}$ for the maximum merger rate (250 Gpc-3yr-1). Therefore, based on the results obtained in this study, it will still be necessary to improve the sensitivity at high frequencies of future ground-based gravitational wave observatories if one wants to obtain greater precision in the MTOV estimation.

We then analyze geodesic motion in this background. For massless particles, we focus on circular photon orbits, while for massive particles, we consider both radial infall and circular motion. We find that the radii of the photon sphere and of the innermost stable circular orbit increase with the cloud of strings parameter $g_s$ and decrease with the length scale $l_s$, and that circular orbits cease to exist in certain regions of the parameter space. For radial motion, we compute the radial acceleration and the corresponding tidal forces. In this case, we show that an inversion between stretching and compression may occur, although this regime is typically hidden inside the event horizon. Finally, we study tidal forces for observers in circular motion, showing that the cloud of strings modifies the Keplerian frequency and the tidal force profile even at large distances, and that in this case there is no sign change of the tidal components."}

This progress creates urgency for the development of compilation workflows that directly target the forthcoming generation of devices with thousands of physical qubits, for which algorithm execution becomes practical. We develop a pipeline for compiling logical algorithms to physical circuits implementing lattice surgery on the surface code, and use this pipeline to identify the requirements for achieving algorithmic break-even -- where quantum error correction improves the performance of a quantum algorithm -- for two prominent quantum algorithms: the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Our pipeline integrates several open-source software tools, and leverages recent advances in error-aware unitary gate synthesis, high-fidelity magic state production, and the calculation of correlation surfaces in the surface code. We perform classical simulations of physical Clifford proxy circuits produced by our pipeline, and find that both 5-qubit QAOA and QPE can reach algorithmic break-even with 2517 physical qubits (surface code distance $d=11$) at physical error rates of $p=10^{-3}$, or 1737 physical qubits ($d=9$) at $p=5\\times 10^{-4}$. Our work thereby identifies conditions for achieving algorithmic break-even with near-term quantum hardware and paves the way towards an end-to-end compiler for early-fault-tolerant surface code architectures."}

We consider this issue by investigating attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy at the Br M4,5 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ edges (66 to 80 eV), tracking core-to-valence (3d to 4p) and core-to-Rydberg (3d to ns, np, n $\\geq$ 5) transitions from the molecular to atomic limit. The progress of dissociation can be ascertained by the buildup of the atomic absorption in time. Notably, the measured rise times of the 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ to 4p transitions depend on the probed core level final state, 38 $\\pm$ 1 and 20 $\\pm$ 5 fs for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ and $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ at 64.31 and 65.34 eV, respectively. Simulations by the nuclear time-dependent Schrödinger equation reproduce the rise-time difference of the 3d to 4p transitions, and the theory suggests several important factors. One is the transition dipole moments of each probe transition have different molecular and atomic values for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ versus $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ that depend on the bond length. The other is the merger of multiple molecular absorptions into the same atomic absorption, creating multiple timescales even for a single probe transition. Unfortunately, the core-to-Rydberg absorptions did not allow accurate atomic Br buildup times to be extracted due to spectral overlaps with ground state bleaching, otherwise an even more comprehensive picture of the role of the probe state transition would be possible. This work shows that the measured probe signals accurately contain the dissociative wavepacket dynamics but also reveal how the specific probe transition affects the apparent progress toward dissociation with bond length. Such potential probe-transition-dependent effects need to be considered when interpreting measured signals and their timescales."}

A major challenge, however, lies in their inherently substantial sampling cost, primarily due to the individual measurement of each term in the Hamiltonian. While various techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue, the sampling overhead remains a significant bottleneck, especially for practical large-scale electronic structure problems. In this work, we introduce an alternative method, dubbed mirror subspace diagonalization (MSD), which approaches the theoretical lower bound of the sampling cost for quantum Krylov algorithms. MSD leverages a finite-difference formula to express the Hamiltonian operator as a linear combination of time-evolution unitaries with symmetrically shifted timesteps, enabling efficient estimation of the Hamiltonian matrix within the Krylov subspace. In this scheme, the finite difference and statistical errors are simultaneously minimized by optimizing the timestep parameter and shifting the energy spectrum. Consequently, MSD attains the lower bound of the sampling cost of the quantum Krylov algorithms up to a logarithmic factor. Furthermore, we employ classical post-processing to infer Hamiltonian moments, which are used to mitigate the ground state energy error based on the Lanczos scheme. Through theoretical analysis of the sampling cost, we demonstrate that MSD is particularly effective when the spectral norm of the Hamiltonian is significantly smaller than its 1-norm. Such a situation arises, for example, in high-accuracy simulations of molecules using large basis sets that incorporate strong electronic correlations. Numerical results for various molecular models reveal that MSD can achieve sampling cost reductions ranging from approximately 10 to 10,000 times compared to the conventional quantum Krylov algorithm."}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "We propose a scheme to generate multi-paths entanglement in an optomechanical system by exploiting polarized electromagnetic fields and dark mode control. Our system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, which are driven by a common electromagnetic field. An inclusion of a polarizer induces linear polarizations of the electromgnetic field corresponding to the vertical (transverse electric ($\\rm{TE}$) and horizontal (transverse magnetic [($\\rm{TM}$]) modes, which drive the mechanical resonators. Without the mechanical coupling $J_m=0$, the polarization angle ($φ$) controls dark mode in the system. The breaking of this dark mode leads to multi-paths engineering of bipartite optomechanical entanglements. By switching on the phonon hopping rate ($J_m\\neq0$), both the polarization angle and the modulation phase of the mechanical coupling allow a further control of the dark mode. The simultaneous Dark Mode Breaking (\\rm{DMB}) conditions under these two parameters leads to multi-paths bipartite and tripartite entanglements. For a fine tuning of the polarization angle ($φ=π/4$) this scheme enables a generation of twin entangled states, where the bipartite/tripartite generated entangled states are degenerated and might be of great interest for quantum information processing, quantum communication and diverse quantum computational tasks. The generated entanglements are more resilient against thermal fluctuations in the \\rm{DMB} regime, i.e., up to two order of magnitude robust than in the Unbreaking regime.

Remarkably, the dual-manifold symmetry alone reproduces both the uniform dark-energy background and the exponential boundary mapping near black-hole horizons that underlies Hawking radiation. This framework thus opens a quantum-theoretic route to cosmological phenomena that are ordinarily treated within general relativity."}

This vector-tensor theory enjoys stable homogeneous and isotropic solutions characterized by an effective dark energy fluid, with behavior that ranges from freezing quintessential to thawing phantom-like, serving as a motivated framework to scrutinize the cosmological tensions that affect the standard $Λ$CDM model. While the model we consider is sufficiently generic to encompass a large class of field theories, it distinguishes itself from scalar dark energy models (quintessential ones, kinetic ones and non-minimally coupled ones) by the presence of what would be classed as a vector degree of freedom which can be for instance inherited from more generic theories of gravity. We improve on previous work in several directions: we consider a general one-parameter class of background models; identify a so-called 'special' model and analyze observational constraints taking also into account perturbations and making use of wide up-to-date catalogs of datasets including recently released ones. We find that the one-parameter Proca-Nuevo model is preferred over $Λ$CDM at $1.5σ$ when fitting CMB and BAO data, and at $2.4σ$ when further adding low-redshift data. The Hubble tension is alleviated, dropping from $5.8σ$ to $2.3σ$ (resp. $1.5σ$) between CMB with (and resp. without) BAO data and local measurements. On the other hand, we find that the vector field generically introduces a significant enhancement of the effective Newton constant, so that matching the observed matter power spectrum requires a mild amount of tuning to suppress the impact of perturbations. Since, at the background level, Proca-Nuevo is degenerate with other classes of theories, our results are also relevant to a wider range of set-ups including and beyond vector-tensor models."}

The key observation is that the enhanced symmetries in the near-horizon region severely constrain the effective energy-momentum tensor near the throat.

The background Kalb--Ramond field induces Lorentz symmetry violation through a dimensionless parameter $\\ell$, while the string cloud is characterized by a parameter $α$, both entering the lapse function and deforming the geometry. Interpreting the ADM mass as enthalpy, we derive the main thermodynamic quantities, Hawking temperature, entropy, thermodynamic volume, Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and specific heat, and analyze how $(\\ell,α)$ jointly affect stability and phase structure. We obtain a Van der Waals--type equation of state, compute the critical point $(P_c,T_c,v_c)$, and show that, although the critical scales depend nontrivially on $\\ell$ and $α$, the universal ratio $P_c v_c/T_c = 3/8$ is preserved. Using the thermodynamic topology approach, we determine that the total topological charge of the black hole solution remains $W=1$, placing it in the same topological class as the Reissner--Nordström--AdS black hole. Finally, by studying the Joule--Thomson expansion, we derive the inversion curve and find that the minimal inversion temperature satisfies $T_i^{\\rm min}/T_c = 1/2$, as in the Reissner--Nordström--AdS case, indicating that Lorentz violation and the string cloud deform the thermodynamic scales without changing the underlying universality class."}

This provides a precise local characterization of how entangled a given state is. At the same time, this local description naturally invites a set of complementary, more global questions about the structure of the space of pure states: How abundant are the states with a given amount of entanglement within the full state space? Do the manifolds of constant entanglement exhibit distinct geometric regimes? These questions shift the focus from assigning an entanglement value to a single state to understanding the global organization and geometry of entanglement across the entire manifold of pure states.\n  In this work, we develop a geometric framework in which these questions become natural. We regard the projective Hilbert space of pure states, endowed with the Fubini-Study metric, as a Riemannian manifold and promote bipartite entanglement to a macroscopic functional on this manifold. Its level sets stratify the space of pure states into hypersurfaces of constant entanglement, and we define a geometric entanglement entropy as the log-volume of these hypersurfaces, weighted by the Fubini-Study gradient of entanglement. This quantity plays the role of a microcanonical entropy in entanglement space: it measures the degeneracy of a given entanglement value in the natural quantum geometry.\n  The framework is illustrated first in the simplest case of a single spin-1/2 and then for bipartite entanglement of spin systems, including a two-qubit example where explicit calculations can be carried out, along with a sketch of the extension to spin chains."}

The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value.

It is generally accepted that only those quantum operations whose physical implementation arises from a fully relativistically covariant interaction, between the quantum field and a suitable probe, should be regarded as admissible. While this idea has been realised at the level of abstract algebraic QFT, or via particular measurement models, there is still no general set of operational criteria characterising which measurements are physically implementable. In this work we adopt the local S-matrix formalism, and make use of a hierarchy of factorisation conditions that exclude both superluminal signalling and retrocausality, thereby providing such a criterion. Realising the local S-matrices through explicit interactions between smeared field operators and a pointer degree of freedom, we further derive local causality conditions for the induced Kraus operators, which guarantee the absence of signalling in \"impossible measurement\" scenarios. Finally, we show that the accuracy with which local field observables can be measured is fundamentally limited by the retarded propagator of the field, which also plays an essential role in a factorisation identity we prove for the field Kraus operators."}

Building on the classical framework (Aumann, 1976), we define the modality of \"common certainty\" through a hierarchy of certainty operators acting on each agent's Hilbert space. In the commuting case -- when all measurements and event projectors commute -- common certainty leads to equality of the agents' conditional probabilities, recovering a QM analog of the classical theorem. By contrast, when non-commuting operators are allowed, the certainty recursion can stabilize with different probabilities. This yields common certainty of disagreement (CCD) as a distinctive QM phenomenon. Agreement is restored once measurement outcomes are recorded in a classical register. The classical Agreement Theorem can therefore be seen as emergent from the quantum world via recording. We establish an impossibility result stating that QM forbids a scenario where one agent is certain that a property of interest occurs, and is also certain that the other agent is certain that the property does not occur. In this sense, QM admits non-classical disagreement, but disagreement is still bounded in a disciplined way.

By introducing power law couplings that algebraically decay with the distance between the spins $r$ as $1/r^α$, we break this symmetry with a non-zero $α$, and probe the emergence of new dynamical behaviors, including thermalization. As we increase $α$, the system interpolates from an infinite range spin system at $α=0$ exhibiting permutation symmetry, to a short range integrable model as $α\\rightarrow \\infty$ where this permutation symmetry is absent. We focus on the change in the behavior of the system as $α$ is tuned, using dynamical quantities like total angular momentum operator $J^2$ and the von Neumann entropy $S_{N/2}$. Starting from the chaotic limit of the permutation symmetric Hamiltonian at $α=0$, we find that for small $α$, the steady state values of these quantities remain close to the permutation symmetric subspace values corresponding to $α=0$. At intermediate $α$ values, these show signatures of thermalization exhibiting values corresponding to that of random states in full Hilbert space. On the other hand, the large $α$ limit approaches the values corresponding to integrable kicked Ising model. In addition, we also study the dependence of thermalization on the driving period $τ$, with results indicating the onset of thermalization for smaller values of $α$ when $τ$ is large, thereby extending the intermediate range of $α$.

We first derive analytical expressions for the motional frequencies and classical trajectories of both nanoparticle and ions. We then derive a quantum master equation for the ion-nanoparticle system and quantify the sympathetic cooling of the nanoparticle motion enabled by its Coulomb coupling to a continuously Doppler-cooled ion. We predict that motional cooling down to sub-kelvin temperatures is achievable in state-of-the-art experiments even in the absence of motional feedback and in the presence of micromotion. We then extend our analysis to an ensemble of $N$ ions, predicting a linear increase of the cooling rate as a function of $N$ and motional cooling of the nanoparticle down to tenths of millikelvin in current experimental platforms. Our work establishes the theoretical toolbox needed to explore the ion-assisted preparation of non-Gaussian motional states of levitated nanoparticles."}

We model the dynamics with time-local master equations and analyze the particle motion at different time scales for different forms of the master equations. By systematically comparing several types of master equations, we uncover how the particle motion evolves under the interplay of quantum effects and active-like dynamics.

In this work, we investigate the stability of the superradiant phase in the presence of a weak spin relaxation. We find that even a weak spin relaxation can render the superradiant phase to a superradiant metastable phase, in which symmetry-breaking states are stable only for a finite time. This arises because each spin-jump induced by relaxation applies as a strong perturbation to the system, potentially driving the system from a symmetry-breaking state to the symmetry-preserving saddle point with finite probability, before it eventually relaxes back to a symmetry-breaking state. Such dynamical processes lead to a finite lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states and restore the symmetry in the steady state. To substantiate these results, we combine mean-field and cumulant expansion analyses with exact numerical simulations. The lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states are analyzed in finite-size systems, and the conclusions are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit via finite-size scaling. Our findings establish the metastable nature of the symmetry-breaking states in the dissipative quantum Rabi model and reveal the complexity of the dissipative phase transition beyond their equilibrium counterpart. The mechanisms uncovered here can be generalized to a broad class of open quantum systems, highlighting fundamental distinctions between equilibrium phase transitions and steady-state phase transitions."}

The central innovation is a conserved coherence current operator constructed from the Noether mass current via operator-level coarse-graining. This current vanishes for classical matter distributions but is nonzero for spatial superpositions and entangled states, yielding a gauge interaction that is dormant in classical regimes but activated by quantum coherence. The framework predicts three distinctive signatures: (i) interferometric phase shifts scaling linearly with fringe visibility, (ii) decoherence rates with characteristic m^2 scaling and spatial dependence distinct from collapse models, and (iii) entanglement-selective forces between distant massive qubits. The theory maintains full gauge invariance, causality, and positive time evolution. We show that state-of-the-art atom interferometers and levitated nanoparticles can place first constraints on this interaction class, complementary to classical fifth-force searches. This approach provides a novel theoretical framework for probing coherence-selective fundamental interactions and their potential role in the quantum-classical transition. To make this more concrete, we also spell out a simple benchmark latent-field model and work out, in detail, how a representative large-momentum-transfer atom interferometer constrains the corresponding coupling strength."}

Prominent examples of such \"impossible measurements\", in the sense of Sorkin, include certain unitary kicks and projective measurements. It is generally accepted that only those quantum operations whose physical implementation arises from a fully relativistically covariant interaction, between the quantum field and a suitable probe, should be regarded as admissible. While this idea has been realised at the level of abstract algebraic QFT, or via particular measurement models, there is still no general set of operational criteria characterising which measurements are physically implementable. In this work we adopt the local S-matrix formalism, and make use of a hierarchy of factorisation conditions that exclude both superluminal signalling and retrocausality, thereby providing such a criterion. Realising the local S-matrices through explicit interactions between smeared field operators and a pointer degree of freedom, we further derive local causality conditions for the induced Kraus operators, which guarantee the absence of signalling in \"impossible measurement\" scenarios. Finally, we show that the accuracy with which local field observables can be measured is fundamentally limited by the retarded propagator of the field, which also plays an essential role in a factorisation identity we prove for the field Kraus operators."}

While tensor network methods like DMRG provide efficient solutions for one-dimensional systems, higher-dimensional problems remain difficult. Here we present a variational double bracket flow (vDBF) algorithm that leverages Sparse Pauli Dynamics, a technique originally developed for classical simulation of quantum circuits, to efficiently approximate ground state energies. By combining greedy operator selection with coefficient truncation and energy-variance extrapolation, the method achieves less than 1% error relative to DMRG benchmarks for both Heisenberg and Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. For a 10x10 Heisenberg lattice (100 qubits), vDBF obtains accurate results in approximately 10 minutes on a single CPU thread, compared to over 50 hours on 64 threads for DMRG. For an 8x8 Hubbard model (128 qubits), the speedup is even more pronounced.

We analyze FPGA-tailored versions of three decoder classes for quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes: message passing, ordered statistics, and clustering. For message passing, we analyze the recently introduced Relay decoder and its FPGA implementation; for ordered statistics decoding (OSD), we introduce a filtered variant that concentrates computation on high-likelihood fault locations; and for clustering, we design an FPGA-adapted generalized union-find decoder. We design a systolic algorithm for Gaussian elimination on rank-deficient systems that runs in linear parallel time, enabling fast validity checks and local corrections in clustering and eliminating costly full-rank inversion in filtered-OSD. Despite these improvements, both remain far slower and less accurate than Relay, suggesting message passing is the most viable route to real-time qLDPC decoding."}

Recent results on Haar random encoding suggest a breakdown of complementary recovery, in which no logical operators can be reconstructed from individual bipartite subsystems. Motivated by this, we propose an interpretation where a baby universe emerges as logical degrees of freedom that cannot be accessed from either boundary alone, assuming pseudorandom dynamics in holographic CFTs. We then analyze two conceptual puzzles: an apparent cloning of baby-universe microstates and its eventual fate at the singularity. Both puzzles are avoided because no single boundary observer can access the baby-universe degrees of freedom, be it classical or quantum, reflecting an emergent form of complementarity due to the structure of random encoding. In this interpretation, observers arise naturally: the same heavy operator that prepares the baby-universe geometry also serves as observer-like degrees of freedom that define an observer-dependent baby-universe microstate."}

Building on our previous work, we perform analytic continuations across different sectors via the complexification to the spectral (energy) parameter $u$ and identify continuous and discontinuous transitions of the exact spectrum for generic potentials. When the transition is discontinuous, it is characterized by the Stokes phenomena, inducing different exact (median) quantization conditions, thereby distinct trans-series structures valid in different sectors. We analyze two illustrative examples, namely asymmetric triple-well (ATW) and tilted double-well (TDW), and verify the general qualitative analysis by deriving exact (median) quantization conditions in each sector. Moreover, by obtaining the trans-series solutions for each system, we identify bion/bounce configurations and show that the trans-series of ATW is organized in accordance with the cluster expansion of the bion gas and there should exist a previously neglected complex saddle in the TDW system. These identifications further strengthen the link between path integral and exact-WKB formalisms, while also demonstrating the predictive power of the latter. In parallel, for the P-NP relations of genus-1 systems, we derive transformation rules between any perturbative and non-perturbative pair of WKB-cycles. Our results show that the entire resurgence data of a genus-1 system transforms only by the change of classical parameters, i.e. frequencies and bion/bounce actions, and the perturbative energy series. This also reveals the underlying reasons of the previously found $S$-duality transformations."}

However, these bounds inevitably become loose in symmetry broken phases, where local constraints are insufficient to capture long-range order. In this work, we identify the origin of this looseness as order parameter defects which are difficult to remove using local operators. We introduce a $\\textit{defect bootstrap}$ framework that resolves this limitation by embedding the system into an auxiliary $\\textit{defect model}$ equipped with ancilla degrees of freedom. This construction effectively enables local operators to remove order parameter defects, yielding tighter bounds in phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This approach can be applied broadly to pairwise-interacting local lattice models with discrete or continuous internal symmetries that satisfy a property we call $\\textit{defect diamagnetism}$, which requires that the ground state energy does not decrease upon adding any finite number of symmetry defects. Applying the method to the transverse field Ising models in 1D and 2D, we obtain significantly improved bounds on energy densities and spin correlation functions throughout the symmetry broken phase in 1D and deep within the phase in 2D.

Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids.
