The human brain, however, does not increase its energy\nconsumption with its function, and most of its energy consumption is not\ninvolved in specific brain function: how can the human brain perform its wide\nrepertoire of functional computations without drastically changing its energy\nconsumption? Here, we present a mechanism to perform functional computation by\nsubtle modification of the interaction network among the brain regions. We\nfirst show that, by analyzing the data of spontaneous and task-induced\nwhole-cerebral-cortex activity, the probability fluxes, which are the\nmicroscopic irreversible measure of state transitions, exhibit unique patterns\ndepending on the task being performed, indicating that the human brain function\nis a distinct sequence of the brain state transitions.

The\ndevelopment of large-scale superconducting circuits provides an experimental\nplatform for these theoretical models. We report an experimental study of a\nmulti-mode dissipative first-order phase transition in a 1D Bose-Hubbard chain\nconsisting of 21 superconducting resonators. This phase transition manifests\nitself as a simultaneous frequency jump in all resonator modes as the frequency\nor power of a pump tone is swept. By measuring the system's emission spectrum\nthrough the transition, we characterize the dim-to-bright phase transition and\nconstruct the full phase diagram.

The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of\nfractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a\nspin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport\nobservation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$.\n  We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a pair of\nancilla qubits on each site. Its mean field theory yields hole pockets of area\n$p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region\nof the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of\na background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of\nthe thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs. One\nroute to confinement upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor\nvia a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal\nBogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices\nsurrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a\ncharge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement\nwith experimental data.\n  Increasing doping from the FL* phase drives a transition to a conventional\nFermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal\nregime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge'\nliquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an\nextension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.\n  At low

Unlike their odd\ncounterpart, the even isotopes of alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms possess\nsimpler structures and longer-lived transitions, which would relax the field\ncontrol requirements and enhance the frequency stability of the output light.\nHowever, due to the absence of hyper-fine interaction in even isotopes, the\ntransition from the state $^{3}\\mathrm{P}_{0}$ to $^{1}$S$_{0}$ is strictly\nforbidden, leading to a vanishing coupling strength between the cavity mode and\nthe atoms (the state $^{3}\\mathrm{P}_{0}$ as a dark state). In this work, we\nsuggest a superradiant laser scheme by dressing this dark state with a small\nbright component by virtue of a static magnetic field. In contrast to other\nproposals utilizing natural atomic transitions, our dressed-state protocol can\nwork from the crossover regime (coherence in both atoms and photons) to the\nsuperradiant lasing regime (coherence solely in atoms). Specially, by operating\ndeep into the superradiant lasing regime, our scheme witnesses a dramatic\nline-narrowing feature (mHz level) while maintaining its power. Furthermore,\ncompared to the crossover regime, the laser frequency in the superradiant\nlasing regime is more robust against the fluctuations of the cavity length and\nmagnetic field strength. Our proposal demonstrates the potential for extracting\nultranarrow light from even isotopes of the alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms and\nmay find its role in frequency stabilization and related precision measurement\nscenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5076\u6570\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9759\u78c1\u573a\u5c06\u6697\u6001\u4e0ebright\u6001\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u539f\u5b50\u548c\u5149\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u4ea4\u53c9 regime\u5230\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u6fc0\u53d1 regime\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u6fc0\u53d1 regime\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fareqaaaaiisex-level\u7ebf\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u6297\u8154\u957f\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u949f\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u949f\u65b9\u6848\u5c24\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9759\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u5c06\u6697\u6001\u4e0ebright\u6001\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u4ea4\u53c9 regime\u548c\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u6fc0\u53d1 regime\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04 regime\u4e0b\uff0c\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u51fareqaaaaiisex-level\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u6297\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5076\u6570\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u539f\u5b50\u949f\u548c\u7cbe\u5bc6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a reproducible and detailed fabrication\nprocess for low-loss AlN waveguides on sapphire, achieving a record loss of\n2~dB/cm at 852~nm. Our results are enabled by systematic process optimization\nincluding high-resolution electron beam lithography with shape-based proximity\neffect correction, atomic layer deposition (ALD) of \\ce{Al2O3} for waveguide\nsurface passivation, and post-fabrication rapid thermal annealing (RTA). We\nprovide a study of the contributions of each technique to propagation loss\nreduction and support our findings with quantitative loss measurements and\ncomparison with an exhaustive literature review.

These results establish the Lieb lattice as a controllable\nsetting for spin-selective transport and magneticfield engineering in synthetic\nquantum platforms such as ultracold atoms, photonic lattices, and\nsuperconducting circuits, offering guiding principles for quantum simulation\nand the corresponding experiments, which opens the avenue for controlled\nengineering of spin-resolved localization and flat-band physics in synthetic\nquantum matter.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86 Lieb \u683c\u5b50\u4e2d\u78c1\u611f\u5e94\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6001\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8f68\u9053\u76ae\u57c3\u5c14\u65af\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u5206\u5206\u88c2\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u78c1\u573a\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u81ea\u65cbresolved\u6001\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8868\u660e Lieb \u683c\u5b50\u5728\u5408\u6210\u91cf\u5b50\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89c2\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u578b\u53cc\u7ef4\u683c\u70b9\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u548c localization \u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5a92\u4ecb\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f Lieb \u683c\u5b50\u8fd9\u79cd\u5929\u7136\u5e73\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u6790\u6765\u63a2\u7a76\u78c1\u573a\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6001\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u81ea\u65cbSplitting\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8f68\u9053\u76ae\u57c3\u5c14\u65af\u76f8\u4f4d\u6548\u5e94\u548cZeeman\u81ea\u65cb\u5206\u88c2\u3002", "result": "\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u8bf1\u5bfc\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6001\u7684\u91cd\u6392\u548c\u81ea\u65cbresolved\u80fd\u7ea7\u5206\u88c2\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6001\u91cd\u65b0\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5e73\u5e26\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u91cf\u5b50\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u8c03\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "Lieb \u683c\u5b50\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u3001\u8d85\u5bfc\u7535\u8def\u7b49\u5408\u6210\u91cf\u5b50\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u65cb\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5e73\u5e26\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u65b0\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

In this work, we generalize this mapping to two and\nhigher dimensions by constructing a unitary equivalence between the\nparity-gauged fermionic system and a spin system defined on arbitrary\npolyhedral decompositions of space.

However, finding appropriate additives may be challenging,\nsince we lack knowledge on their interactions with the plastics and with\nmoisture, and the interplay between them. In this work, we study a commercial\nadditive as well as two new potential additives for their antistatic and slip\nproperties in polyethylene by means of atomistic molecular dynamics\nsimulations. We reveal the most favorable interactions between polyethylene,\neach of these molecules and water, along with providing a microscopic picture\nof their interfacial structure. All additives interact with water mainly by\ntheir polar heads, with water acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor or donor\ndepending on the additive. As expected, water does not enter the polyethylene\nmatrix; it accumulates at its surface instead, without any preferencial\norientation. The additives studied exhibit remarkably different structures when\nthey are mixed with the polymer: two of them enter the polymer matrix to\nvarious degrees, either by intercalating their chains with the polyethylene\nones or by forming miscellar-like structures, while the third one stays at the\nsurface. When water is incorporated into the system, the structure of some of\nthe additive/polyethylene systems changes. The magnitude and nature of these\nchanges depend on the relative concentrations of all species. If the additives\nare in low concentrations, water stays at the surface of the material, in a\ndrop-like shape. The additives penetrate and organize the polymer more or less\ndepending on whether water is present or not.

This allows us to introduce a\ntwo-frequency effective polarizability that fully incorporates the properties\nof the localized surface plasmon and its amplifying replica, as well as their\ninteraction. In addition, we analyze the emergence of the parametric\namplification condition for the modulated nanoparticle, showing that\namplification can be obtained in a broad range of parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Quantum nonlinear\nspectroscopy (QNS) can access exponentially more types of correlations than its\nclassical counterpart, since the responses to ``classical forces'' correspond\nto contour-time-ordered correlations (CTOCs) that involve only commutators,\nwhile in QNS ``quantum forces'' from a quantum sensor induce responses\ncorresponding to CTOCs that involve both commutators and anti-commutators.\nSymmetries are important for constraining and analyzing nonlinear spectroscopy.\nQuantum and classical nonlinear spectroscopy have similar spatial symmetry\nproperties. QNS, however, is expected to have its characteristic non-spatial\nsymmetry properties since commutators and anti-commutators of physical\nquantities can behave differently under non-spatial transformations (such as\nexchange of operators). Here, we investigate how higher-order correlations\nextracted by QNS are constrained by non-spatial symmetries, including\nparticle-hole (C), time-reversal (T), and their combination, i.e., chiral (S)\nsymmetry. We find that the generalized C-symmetry imposes special selection\nrules on QNS, and the generalized T- and S-symmetry relate CTOCs to\nout-of-time-order correlations (OTOCs).

The data from the\nEvent Horizon Telescope Collaboration are used to constrain the parameter\nranges of the two black holes.

The shadow radius of the black hole is independent of the\nspherical accretion models. For an optically and geometrically thin accretion\ndisk, the integrated intensity is mainly contributed by direct emission, and\nthe contributions of photon rings and lensed rings are very small. In addition,\nthe photon rings and lensed rings of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole are\nnarrower, while those of Ghosh-Kumar black hole are wider.

This study uncovers the previously\nunexplored role of on-chip multimode squeezing in quadratic frequency combs\nwhile facilitating collective noise suppression across multiple modes, thus\nholding substantial potential for advancing quantum precision measurement and\nquantum information processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u9502\u94cc\u9178\u5fae\u73af\u632f\u8361\u5668\u9ad8\u4e8c\u9636\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u7535\u5149\u8c03\u5236\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u71b5\u6807\u51c6\u5f15\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u9891\u7387\u68b3\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u591a\u91cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u9891\u7387\u68b3\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u76f8\u5e72\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u8282\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u884c\u5bf9\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c Precise \u7684 \u63a7\u5236 \u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u9502\u94cc\u9178\u5fae\u73af\u632f\u8361\u5668\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u9891\u7387\u68b3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u4e09\u9636\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u7535\u5149\u8c03\u5236\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) \u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08MI\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u884c\u5bf9\uff08 temporal walk-off\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u6b21\u9891\u7387\u68b3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u76f8\u5e72\u538b\u7f29\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u9502\u94cc\u9178\u5fae\u73af\u632f\u8361\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u884c\u5bf9\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9636\u591a\u6a21\u76f8\u5e72\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u5bbd\u8c31\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u6570\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u9891\u7387\u68b3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9502\u94cc\u9178\u5fae\u73af\u632f\u8361\u5668\u5728\u4e8c\u6b21\u9891\u7387\u68b3\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u76f8\u5e72\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u52a8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While a notable\ncoupling can be achieved by out of plane couplers such as grating couplers,\ntheir basic planar geometry typically tends to be sensitive to the polarization\nof light. This is partly due to the fact that the design spaces of such grating\nstructures typically fabricated with techniques such as electron beam\nlithography are only two dimensional with a simple extrusion into the vertical\ndimension. This makes it challenging to optimize for both polarizations\nsimultaneously, as performance typically degrades when trying to achieve high\nefficiency in both. As a result, conventional approaches either suffer from\nincreased losses or require additional filtering components to account for\ndifferent polarizations. In this work, we present a fully three dimensional,\npolarization insensitive grating coupler which has a highly efficient simulated\ncoupling efficiency of over 80% in both polarizations. This performance matches\nthat of state of the art couplers that are performant for one polarization\nonly. This comes at the cost of a moderately larger size due to the lower\nrefractive index materials typically available in 3D nanoprinting. Our design\nmethod uses density based topology optimization with a multi objective approach\nthat combines electromagnetic simulations with a fictitious heat conduction\nmodel acting as a soft constraint to promote structural integrity. This ensures\nthat the designed structures are feasible for fabrication.

In scenarios where rapid protocols are desired --\nwhether due to practical constraints or deliberate design choices -- a\nfundamental trade-off between power and efficiency emerges as a key concern.\nHere, we investigate the problem of finite-time optimal work extraction from\nclosed quantum systems, subject to a constraint on the magnitude of the control\nHamiltonian. We first establish the trade-off relation between power and work\nunder a general setup, stating that these fundamental performance metrics\ncannot be maximized simultaneously. Next, we introduce a framework of\nLie-algebraic control, which involves a wide range of control problems\nincluding many-body control of the Heisenberg model and the SU(n)-Hubbard\nmodel. Within this framework, the optimal work extraction protocol becomes\nremarkably simple: it suffices to use a time-independent Hamiltonian, which is\ndetermined by a nonlinear self-consistent equation. We obtain an analytical\nsolution for su(2) control, and a numerical solution for more complex cases\nlike su(n) control using the steepest gradient descent method.

Using dielectric metasurfaces with a monoclinic\nlattice and broken in-plane mirror symmetry, we demonstrate that tuning the\nlattice angle allows for robust control of these resonances.

To make this statement general, there must be a proper\ndefinition of $\\tau-$function that gives rise to a set of bilinear identities.\nIn the classical definition of $\\tau-$function for integrable Toda or KP\nhierarchies, there is a restriction on matrix elements to be based on\ngroup-like elements with the comultiplication $\\Delta(g)=g \\otimes g$. This\nrestriction can not be straightforwardly transferred to the q-deformed case,\nbecause there are no group-like elements in q-deformed universal enveloping\nalgebra (UEA), except for its Cartan subalgebra. The new approach to the\n$\\tau-$function is to remove the restriction on g to be obligatory the\ngroup-like element.

By varying the coupling parameter $\\alpha_1$, the\ncorresponding black hole solutions exhibit diverse horizon structures,\nincluding naked singularities and black holes with one to four horizons. We\nfind that for sufficiently small $\\alpha_1$, the metric function $f(r)$ becomes\nnon-monotonic outside the event horizon in spacetimes with one or two horizons,\nwhile in all other cases, $f(r)$ remains strictly monotonic. In the\nnon-monotonic regime, the radial effective potential develops a double-barrier\nstructure, allowing the emergence of multiple marginally bound orbits and\nmultiple branches of periodic orbits associated with the same rational number\n$l$. Although differing in radial structure, these orbit branches are\ntopologically equivalent. Remarkably, when the outer potential barrier exceeds\nunity, bound orbits with energy $E>1$ become possible, in addition to the\nstandard $E<1$ branches. When the peak reaches $E=1$, up to three distinct\nbound orbit branches may coexist. We also identify a novel eccentricity\nbehavior, the innermost branch becomes increasingly circular with increasing\nenergy or angular momentum, while outer branches exhibit greater eccentricity\nand a larger apastron-periastron separation. These features, absent in previous\nstudies, are unique signatures of non-monotonic metric functions. In contrast,\nmonotonic cases yield a single-well potential, a unique marginally bound orbit,\nand a single periodic orbit branch per $q$, consistent with earlier findings.\nOur results highlight the critical role of the metric function's shape in\ndetermining the orbital structure around dyonic black holes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Suppressing measurement noise and\nachieving high sensitivity require accurate alignment of multiple onboard\ninterferometers after laser link acquisition. However, due to huge armlengths\nand varying point-ahead angles, the fine alignment of the transmitted beams can\nbe particularly challenging, which needs to take into account both received\nlaser power and far-field wavefront errors. To tackle this issue for TianQin\nwhich has small point-ahead angle variations, we propose an efficient alignment\nstrategy that relies on finding the maximum-intensity direction of the\ntransmitted beam as the alignment reference. The direction can be estimated\nthrough a quatrefoil scan of the local transmitted beam and the corresponding\nintensity measurement from the remote satellite. Under TianQin's fixed-value\ncompensation of the point-ahead angles, simulation results reveal that the\nproposed strategy is capable of aligning the transmitted beams within 20 nrad\nfrom the mean value of the point-ahead angles, while the tilt-to-length\ncoupling associated with far-field wavefront error can meet the requirement\ngiven a transmitted beam aberration of $\\lambda/40$ RMS.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

A subclass of the GB code called bivariate bicycle\ncodes (BB codes) has garnered significant interest due to their compatibility\nwith two-layer connectivity architectures on superconducting quantum\nprocessors. However, one key limitation of BB codes is their high qubit\nconnectivity degree requirements (degree 6), which exacerbates the noise\nsusceptibility of the system. Building on the recent progress in implementing\nmultiple two-qubit gates on a single chip, this work introduces Louvre -- a\nrouting-based framework designed to reduce qubit connectivity requirements in\nGB codes. Specifically, Louvre-7 achieves degree reduction while preserving the\ndepth of the syndrome extraction circuit, whereas Louvre-8 further minimizes\nthe connectivity by slightly increasing the circuit depth. When applied to BB\ncodes, these two schemes could reduce the average degree to 4.5 and 4,\nrespectively. Crucially, Louvre eliminates some of the long-range, error-prone\nconnections, which is a distinct advantage over prior approaches. Numerical\nsimulations demonstrate that Louvre-7 has an indistinguishable logical error\nrate as the standard syndrome extraction circuits of GB codes, while Louvre-8\nonly incurs a slight error rate penalty. Furthermore, by reordering some of the\ngates in the circuit, we can reduce the coupler length without degrading the\nperformance.

This background is the accumulated\nsignal from unresolved sources throughout cosmic history and encodes\ninformation about the merger history of compact binaries throughout the\nUniverse, as well as exotic physics and potentially primordial processes from\nthe early cosmos. Our cross-correlation analysis reveals no statistically\nsignificant background signal, enabling us to constrain several theoretical\nscenarios. For compact binary coalescences which approximately follow a 2/3\npower-law spectrum, we constrain the fractional energy density to $\\Omega_{\\rm\nGW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.0\\times 10^{-9}$ (95% cred.), a factor of 1.7 improvement\nover previous results. Scale-invariant backgrounds are constrained to\n$\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.8\\times 10^{-9}$, representing a 2.1x\nsensitivity gain. We also place new limits on gravity theories predicting\nnon-standard polarization modes and confirm that terrestrial magnetic noise\nsources remain below detection threshold. Combining these spectral limits with\npopulation models for GWTC-4, the latest gravitational-wave event catalog, we\nfind our constraints remain above predicted merger backgrounds but are\napproaching detectability. The joint analysis combining the background limits\nshown here with the GWTC-4 catalog enables improved inference of the binary\nblack hole merger rate evolution across cosmic time. Employing GWTC-4 inference\nresults and standard modeling choices, we estimate that the total background\narising from compact binary coalescences is $\\Omega_{\\rm CBC}(25{\\rm\nHz})={0.9^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{-9}}$ at 90% confidence, where the largest\ncontribution is due to binary black holes only, $\\Omega_{\\rm BBH}(25{\\rm\nHz})=0.8^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{-9}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper's findings: Most compact binary coalescence backgrounds have negligible energy density at 25Hz, with constraints around 2e-9 for 2/3-spectrum and 2.8e-9 for scale-invariant. also limits on various gravity theories and GWTC-4 favorability were set", "motivation": "Understanding the isotropic gravitational wave background is crucial for studying cosmic history, compact binary mergers, and early universe physics", "method": "Used advanced LIGO and Virgo data from O1-O4a; cross-correlation analysis for background signals; considered compact binaries, scale-invariant models, and non-standard polarization modes", "result": "No significant background found, constraining energy density and other physics", "conclusion": "The isotropic gravitational wave background is weak, supporting certain theories while guiding future research directions"}}

Since their inception, there\nhave been several numerical and analytic studies of the BDNK equations which\nhave revealed their promise in modeling relativistic flows when viscous,\nfirst-order corrections to ideal hydrodynamics are important. In this paper, we\npresent numerical solutions to the BDNK equations for a $4$D conformal fluid in\nMinkowski spacetime constrained to the surface of a geometric sphere. We\nnumerically solve the underlying equations of motion by use of finite\ndifference methods applied in cubed-sphere coordinates -- a multi-block grid\nstructure which regularly and continuously covers the surface of a sphere. We\npresent three test cases of our code: linearized fluid perturbations of\nequilibrium states, a smooth, stationary initial Gaussian pulse of energy\ndensity, and Kelvin-Helmholtz-unstable initial data. In the Gaussian test case\nwith sufficiently large entropy-normalized shear viscosity, the flow, though\ninitialized in equilibrium, dynamically diverges away from equilibrium and the\nregime of validity of first-order hydrodynamics as very steep gradients form in\nthe solution, causing convergence to be lost in the numerical simulation. This\nbehavior persists at all grid resolutions we have considered, and also occurs\nat much higher resolutions in simulations of planar-symmetric ($1+1$)D\nconformal flows. These solutions provide numerical evidence that singularities\nin solutions to the BDNK equations can form in finite time from smooth initial\ndata. The numerical methods we employ on the two-sphere can be readily extended\nto include variations in the radial direction, allowing for full ($3+1$)D\nsimulations of the BDNK equations in astrophysical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

But developing such a view is challenging because quantum advantage\nanalyses depend not only on algorithm properties, but also on a host of\ntechnical characteristics (error correction, gate speeds, etc.). Because\nvarious analyses make different assumptions about these technical\ncharacteristics, it can be challenging to make comparisons across them. In this\npaper, we introduce an open-access web-tool designed to make such comparisons\neasy. Built on the framework introduced by Choi, Moses, and Thompson (2023), it\ncalculates when quantum systems will outperform classical computers for a given\nalgorithmic problem. These estimates can be easily updated based on various\nassumptions for error correction, overhead, and connectivity. Different\nhardware roadmaps can also be used and algorithm running times can be\ncustomized to particular applications. It can currently be accessed at\nhttps://futuretech.mit.edu/quantum-economic-advantage-calculator.\n  This integrated prediction tool also allows us to explore which technical\nfactors are most important for quantum ``economic\" advantage (outperforming on\na cost-equivalent basis). Overall, we find that for some algorithms (e.g.\nShor's) the timing of advantage is quite robust, whereas for others (e.g.\nGrover's) it is contingent, with numerous technical characteristics\nsubstantially impacting these dates.
