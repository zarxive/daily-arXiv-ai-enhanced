Recasting parallel transport in a null Frenet--Serret frame yields a single scalar evolution law for the electric-vector position angle. On the observer's screen, the Kerr-minus-Schwarzschild pattern on the direct critical curve is nonzero, strictly odd under spin reversal after a half-turn azimuth relabelling, and tightly confined to a thin annulus. Using backward-shot, Carter-separated geodesics with midpoint RK2 transport, we achieve second-order convergence and degree-scale amplitudes that grow monotonically with spin and inclination (RMS $\\simeq 0.5$--$2^\\circ$ for $a/M\\gtrsim 0.8$, $i\\gtrsim 60^\\circ$). Three independent constructions -- Frenet--Serret line integral, explicit Levi--Civita transport of the polarization vector, and the phase of the Walker--Penrose constant -- agree ray by ray. We then define a parity-odd ring estimator that is intrinsically achromatic after standard wavelength-squared regression, symmetry-protected against common even-parity systematics, and compressed into low azimuthal modes. This yields a minimal two-parameter template (spin and inclination) for mm/sub-mm polarimetry of horizon-scale rings in sources such as M87$^\\ast$ and Sgr~A$^\\ast$.

The MoS$_2$ is illuminated by a femtosecond laser, while a tunable near-infrared (NIR) continuous-wave laser probes the microresonator resonance. The NIR light polarization can be adjusted to either transverse electric (TE, parallel to the 2D material) or transverse magnetic (TM, perpendicular), a configuration that is impossible to achieve with conventional normal-incidence pump-probe techniques. By capturing the transmitted signal on a fast oscilloscope, we detect transient optical shifts with unprecedented sensitivity, observing phenomena over time scales ranging from picoseconds to microseconds. Our results reveal both a rapid, carrier-induced nonlinear optical shift in the resonance, and a slower thermo-optic transient. The ability to simultaneously measure these fast and slow dynamics offers new insight into the complex optoelectronic behavior of 2D materials when integrated with microresonators. This method provides a significant advance over traditional pump-probe approaches, enabling the detection of exceedingly small transient signals and opening new avenues for exploring the optical properties of atomically thin materials.

Recently, the first room-temperature spintronic Poisson bolometer based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) was proposed and demonstrated as a promising infrared detector. Unlike conventional bolometers, the spintronic Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, where the response is governed by resistance fluctuations arising from thermally activated magnetization transitions. Spontaneous transitions between two metastable magnetic states occur even in the absence of incident light, and the transition probability increases under illumination. In this work, we experimentally study the statistical properties of the optical response of the spintronic Poisson bolometer under illumination. We demonstrate that transitions in spintronic Poisson bolometers, both in the absence and presence of light, exhibit Poissonian behavior, with transition rates and interarrival times modulated by incident radiation.

These systems are technically robust and reflect the cumulative integration of solutions built and adapted across decades. One of the regular, unfortunate casualties of provisional accelerator control system updates is their human-system interfaces (HSIs) which often lag behind modern usability and design standards. An additional challenge is that although there is a multitude of established human factors (HF), and user experience (UX) principles for everyday digital applications, there are very few (if any) established principles for complex and safety-critical applications for an accelerator. This paper argues for the importance of established HF and UX principles (herein referred to as human-centered design principles) into the development of accelerator HSIs, emphasizing the need for clarity, consistency, responsiveness, and cognitive accessibility. Drawing from HF/UX best practices and human-centered design, this paper discusses how these approaches can enhance operator performance, reduce human error, and improve accelerator personnel collaboration. Case studies from Accelerator Control Operations Research Network (ACORN) at Fermilab are explored to demonstrate how interfaces built with human-centered design principles can scale with system complexity while remaining intuitive and efficient for diverse user roles including operators, machine experts, and engineers.

Based on the multirotary joints solar power satellite MR SPS concept proposed in 2014, this article presents an updated modular MR SPS concept, together with the challenges and design considerations. The primary objective is to address the challenges associated with long distance dc electric power transmission and exceptionally high precision microwave power transmission. The MMR SPS employs multiple modules, each further including a solar subpanel and an antenna subpanel. The solar subpanel and antenna subpanel in each module are connected with each other via conductive rotary joints with a much shorter distance compared with that in the MR SPS concept. As a result, lower voltage in electric power transmission is allowed, which significantly reduces the complexity of the system and increases its reliability. Retroreflective beamforming is employed to ensure the accurate steering of the microwave power beam to the ground receiving aperture. For the first time, this article analyzes and validates the performance of using retroreflective beamforming to compensate for antenna position deviations through a numerical calculation model that includes near field effects.

Beyond the inherently large relativistic effects associated with a high proton number $Z$, an increased molecular charge can further enhance the electronic sensitivity to symmetry-violating nuclear effects, including nuclear Schiff moments. Experimental investigations of multiply charged actinide molecules are challenging because the high charges severely destabilize chemical bonds, leading to spontaneous Coulomb explosion. We demonstrate a method to systematically generate and detect molecular ions at the edge of chemical stability. By applying high-fluence laser ablation to a depleted uranium metal foil, we produce atomic uranium ions U$^{z+}$ and uranium monoxide cations UO$^{z+}$ with $z = 1$--4. Among them, we observe UO$^{3+}$ and UO$^{4+}$, which exhibit comparatively simple electronic structures and are therefore promising for precision spectroscopy.

For such systems to be effective, two objectives must be met: (i) accurate point forecasts of the time series must be produced, and (ii) the long-term statistical behaviour of the underlying data-generating process must be replicated. The latter objective, often referred to as learning the climate, is closely related to the task of producing accurate distribution forecasts. Empirical evidence shows that distribution forecasts are far more stable than point forecasts, which are sensitive to initial conditions. In this work, we rigorously study this phenomenon for state-space systems. The main result shows that, if the underlying data-generating process is structurally stable and possesses a mixing or an attracting measure, then a sufficiently regular initial probability distribution remains close to the true future distribution at arbitrarily long time horizons when forecasted by a $C^1-$close state-space proxy.

This $\u03b7$-coordinate encodes the color and flavor data of the dual theories. As a consequence, a massive probe following a holographic geodesic necessarily moves simultaneously in the radial AdS direction and along the 'quiver direction'. This produces new contributions to the proper momentum and hence to the rate of Krylov complexity growth, which is absent in bottom-up AdS models. We show that the $\u03b7$-motion is generically damped, with a time-scale governed by the UV cutoff of the geodesic problem, and modifies the early-time evolution of complexity in a quiver-dependent way. At late times, the $\u03b7$-dynamics freezes and the growth becomes universal, matching pure Poincare AdS predictions. Studying Abelian and non-Abelian T-dual backgrounds of AdS$_3\\times S^3\\times T^4$, quivers with localized flavor groups, and quivers with smeared flavor groups, we quantify how quiver parameters shape the operator-spreading dynamics.

The two kinds of terms have different-symmetry contributions to the entangled squeezed states. The squeezing parameter is estimated in a weak-quantum-gravity framework. Some phenomenology with respect to current and future interferometric detection devices is discussed. Importantly, current data from LIGO/Virgo Experiments can impose upper-bound constraints on the value of the squeezing parameter and, thus, on the lifetime of the axionic clouds. In addition to the above rather direct-detection possibility of squeezed gravitons, there is also the possibility of indirect detection of quantum gravitons in Cosmology, given that chiral quantum gravitational-wave (GW) perturbations in the primordial Universe may imply condensation of gCS terms.

We further identify impedance matching as a crucial factor to achieve high sensitivity in the reflectometry by tuning the tip-sample capacitance as a function of approach distance. As a demonstration of this capability, we measure a 50x50 nm$^2$ area of island features that have been condensed onto the surface of a gold single crystal.

Recently, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), a counterintuitive relaxation phenomenon, has attracted considerable attention and has been extensively studied in systems with global symmetries. Here, we study the QME in gauge theories with massive local gauge symmetries. In the lattice Schwinger model, we demonstrate that the gauge structure of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem is entirely determined by the initial state and remain unchanged during the time evolution. We then investigate whether gauge symmetry can be dynamically restored following a symmetric quench. Analytical and numerical results show that when the Maxwell term is zero, gauge symmetry restoration fails due to the emergence of a peculiar conservation law. However, for any finite Maxwell term, subsystem gauge symmetry is restored in the thermodynamic limit. Based on these results, we systematically construct a families of initial states exhibiting the QME. We further explore the QME in the quantum link model-a truncated lattice Schwinger model, which has been realized in experiments. Moreover, we propose an experimentally accessible order parameter that correctly captures the QME. Our work demonstrates the generality of the quantum Mpemba effect even in the local gauge symmetries, and are directly relevant to ongoing quantum simulation experiments of gauge theories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u591a\u4f53\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u9a6c\u666e(Mpemba)\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f29\u51cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7531\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53ef\u5747\u7531\u65e0\u89c4\u8303\u8d28\u91cf\u9879\u7834\u574f\u5e76\u9010\u6e10\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5404\u79cd\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u9a6c\u666e\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf stairs\u9a6c\u666e\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a6c\u666e\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u8da3\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u516c\u5f00\u9898\u76ee\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u9a6c\u666e\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u8017\u65f6\u6570\u6708\u9605\u8bfb\u5e76\u89e3\u6790\u591a\u7bc7\u76f8\u5173\u5b66\u672f\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u601d\u7ef4\u5bfc\u56fe\u68b3\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u6b21\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u62b5\u6d88\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u673a\u5236\u88ab\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63ed\u793a\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u9a6c\u666e\u6548\u5e94\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u9a6c\u666e\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u62d3\u5c55\u3002"}}

The localized active space self-consistent field method (LASSCF) uses a product of fragment active spaces as a variational space, with the Schr\u00f6dinger equation solved exactly in each fragment and the fragment active-space orbitals defined in a self-consistent manner. LASSCF is accurate for systems with strong intra-fragment and weak inter-fragment correlation, and its computational cost is combinatorial with respect to the size of the individual fragment active spaces, rather than their product. However, exactly solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in each fragment remains a substantial bottleneck. Here, we address the possibility of solving the fragment active space Schr\u00f6dinger equation with approximate methods, particularly sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD). SQD is a technique that uses a quantum computer to sample configurations from a chemically motivated quantum circuit and a classical computer to mitigate errors and solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in a subspace of the configuration space. We apply the proposed method, LASSQD, to the [Fe(H$_2$O)$_4$]$_2$bpym$^{4+}$ compound and the [Fe$^{\\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\\mathrm{II}}$($\u03bc$$_3$-O)-(HCOO)$_6$] complex for calculating the intermediate-spin ground state energies. We observe that LASSQD can tackle fragment sizes intractable by LASSCF, achieves within 1kcal/mol agreement to LASSCF, and delivers results that are competitive with alternative classical methods to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and thus can be used as a starting point for a perturbative treatment (LASSQD-PDFT) to recover correlation external to the active space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LASSQD\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3aLASSQD\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6c42\u89e3\u7247\u6bb5\u7684Schr\u00f6dinger\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u62bd\u6837\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5904\u7406\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLASSQD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7247\u6bb5\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u7528LASSCF\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The exploration has been successfully guided by the paradigm of ideal flat Chern bands, which mimic Landau levels in both band topology and local quantum geometry. Yet, given the near-infinite possibilities for Bloch bands in lattices, it remains a major open question whether FQAH states can emerge in scenarios fundamentally different from this paradigm. Here we turn to a class of gapless flat bands, featuring divergent quantum geometry at singular band touching, non-integer Berry flux threading the Brillouin zone (BZ), and ill-defined band topology. Our exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations unambiguously demonstrate FQAH phase that is virtually independent of the interaction strength, persisting from the weak-interaction to the strong-interaction limit. We find the stability of the FQAH states does not uniquely correlate with the singularity strength or the BZ-averaged quantum geometric fluctuations. Instead, the many-body topological order can adapt to the singular and fluctuating quantum geometric landscape by spontaneously developing an inhomogeneous carrier distribution, while its quenching accompanies the drop in the occupation-weighted Berry flux.

In particular, it has been observed that the birational classes of these geometries are not exhausted by toric hypersurfaces arising from fine, regular, star triangulations (FRSTs). We begin by introducing a classification problem: enumeration of birational classes of toric varieties, which is equivalent to enumeration of certain triangulations/fans. We consider this problem from the complementary perspectives of triangulation theory and toric geometry, reviewing both theories in detail; this culminates in an explanation of how to generate all fine regular triangulations of a vector configuration (i.e., fine regular simplicial fans). We then apply this theory to the Kreuzer--Skarke (KS) database, where we encounter both FRSTs and vex triangulations. We study the non-weak-Fano toric varieties arising from vex triangulations, along with their CY hypersurfaces. In particular, we show that all fine regular triangulations of a fixed 4D reflexive polytope give rise to smooth birational CY hypersurfaces, extending Batyrev's result from FRSTs to vex triangulations. We exhaustively enumerate all $24,023,940$ fine regular triangulations in the KS database with $h^{1,1}\\leq 7$, of which over $70\\%$ are vex triangulations, and provide an upper bound of $10^{979}$ for fine regular triangulations in the entire KS database.

Beyond the common statement that Rayleigh scattering is the primary mechanism behind the multiple colored appearances of the sky, it appears that the relationship between material parameters and the colors that appear in different observation conditions has not been thoroughly explored so far. The present study aims to offer a general overview of the structural colors accessible by Rayleigh scattering as a function of the material parameters, alongside a scalable and environment-friendly process to realize solid composite materials with targeted structural colors in reflection and transmission. Monte Carlo light transport simulations are performed to compute the structural color palette of disordered colloids -- dielectric particles in a nonscattering matrix -- in different observation modes. In particular, we provide a range of physical parameters in which the materials exhibit the same blue color in diffuse reflection and transmission. We also show that, as may be counterintuitive at first, the addition of black absorbents to the matrix of a white (opaque) material can lead to the emergence of a blue coloration in diffuse reflection, thanks to the interplay between multiple light scattering and light absorption. These predictions are validated by optical experiments on colloidal suspensions of Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (ZrO$_2$:Y$_2$O$_3$) nanoparticles in aqueous solutions.

Supported by analytical arguments based on spectral sum rules and by our previous results for the Holstein model, we argue that, for weak to moderate coupling strengths and not-too-low temperatures, the CE within the IPA framework yields accurate results.

In this study, we examine the dissociation of H$_2$ on a large octahedral Ag nanoshell under varying field intensity, frequency, and duration, and we explore the possibility of identifying optimal modeling conditions accessible with current TDDFT simulations. We show that using this large nanoshell that consists in the outer layer of the Ag$_{231}$ cluster, it is still possible to disentangle the role of the plasmon from strong-field effects at applied field intensities as high as $(2-8) \\times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. In particular, although strong-field effects are always present at these intensities, we find that the excited plasmon dominates the dissociation process at the lowest applied intensity of $2 \\times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, at the highest intensity, at which strong-field effects become dominant, the plasmon contributes to accelerating the dissociation of the molecule.

The switching is governed by two main sources of current transients: i) spin currents pumped by the reference layer, and ii) spin-polarized currents due to non-equilibrium hot electrons excited by the laser pulse. In particular, an initial superdiffusive forward flow of electrons, polarized by the free layer, is generated. This drives parallel to antiparallel switching of the free layer through accumulation of minority spins at the reference layer. A diffusive backward flow of electrons, repolarized by the reference layer, follows the initial superdiffusive flow as the charge distribution re-equilibrates. Due to the pulse width-dependent asymmetric amplitudes of the forward and backward transients, the latter can drive antiparallel to parallel switching, and create multi-domain structures at higher laser fluences and longer pulses. The results obtained here are in agreement with experimental observations, providing a framework for self-consistent modelling of all-optical switching in metallic heterostructures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u94c1\u78c1\u81ea\u65cb\u65cb\u8f6c\u53d8\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u5149\u5f00\u5173\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u539f\u5b50\u6001\u81ea\u65cb\u6f02\u79fb\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u6cf5\u9001\u548c\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u8f93\u8fd0\u3002\u5f00\u5173\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u77ac\u6001\u7535\u6d41\u5f15\u8d77\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u53c2\u8003\u5c42\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7535\u6d41\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u6fc0\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u70ed\u7535\u5b50\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u7535\u6d41\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u6cbf\u7535\u5b50\u8fd0\u8f93\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u81ea\u65cb\u524d\u5411\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u4e86\u81ea\u7531\u5c42\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u548c\u53cd\u5e73\u884c\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53c2\u8003\u5c42\u79ef\u7d2f minority\u81ea\u65cb\u3002\u968f\u540e\u53c8\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56de\u65cb\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u8109\u51b2\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u78c1\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u5149\u5f00\u5173\u5728\u91d1\u5c5e\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6d3d\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u5149\u5f00\u5173\u5728\u81ea\u65cb\u65cb\u8f6c\u53d8\u5668\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u78c1\u6027\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u78c1\u8bb0\u5f55\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5668\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u65cb\u6f02\u79fb\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u6cf5\u9001\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u8f93\u8fd0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8109\u51b2\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5bf9\u524d\u5411\u548c\u56de\u65cb\u7535\u6d41\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u591a\u78c1\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5207\u6362\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5168\u5149\u5f00\u5173\u5728\u81ea\u65cb\u65cb\u8f6c\u53d8\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6d3d\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

In the context of multistate Landau-Zener models -- $N$-state quantum systems with linearly time-dependent Hamiltonians -- the theory of integrability provides a framework for identifying new solvable cases. In particular, it was proved that the integrability of a specific class known as the multitime Landau-Zener (MTLZ) models guarantees their exact solvability. A key finding was that an $N$-state MTLZ model can be represented by data defined on an $N$-vertex graph. While known host graphs for MTLZ models include hypercubes, fans, and their Cartesian products, no other families have been discovered, leading to the conjecture that these are the only possibilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic graph-theoretical search for integrable models within the MTLZ class. By first identifying minimal structures that a graph must contain to host an MTLZ model, we formulate an efficient algorithm to systematically search for candidate graphs for MTLZ models. Implementing this algorithm using computational software, we enumerate all candidate graphs with up to $N = 13$ vertices and perform an in-depth analysis of those with $N \\le 11$.

Strong lensing will produce multiple identical copies of the GW signal arriving at different times. Jana et al.~\\cite{Jana_2023} recently proposed a method to constrain cosmological parameters using strongly lensed GW events detected by next-generation (XG) detectors. The idea is that the number of strongly lensed GW events and the distribution of their lensing time delays encode imprints of the cosmological parameters. From the observed number of lensed GW events (tens of thousands) and their time delay distribution, this method can provide a new probe of cosmology, obtaining information at intermediate redshifts. In this work, we explore the possibility of doing lensing cosmography using upcoming observations of the upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. This requires incorporating the detector network selection effects in the analysis, which was neglected earlier. We expect dozens of lensed GW events to be detected by upgraded LVK detectors, potentially enabling modest constraints on cosmological parameters. Even with relatively modest numbers of lensed detections, we demonstrate the potential of lensing cosmography. For XG detectors, our revised forecasts are consistent with with the earlier forecasts that neglected the selection effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "Gravitational waves from binary black holes may be lensed, and this can help constrain cosmological parameters.

This research suggests that with better detectors, such as the upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network, we could start using lensed GW events to set cosmological constraints.

Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states.

Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry.

This is shown to hold in the opposite manner to which it is routinely assumed, because in fact the fidelity a state has to an ideal GKP state is only upper bounded by the stabilizer expectation values.

Existing predictive models typically infer scalar kinetic parameters at a full SOC or a few discrete SOC levels, preventing them from capturing the continuous SOC dependence that governs exothermic behavior during abuse conditions. To address this, we apply the Kolmogorov-Arnold Chemical Reaction Neural Network (KA-CRNN) framework to learn continuous and realistic SOC-dependent exothermic cathode-electrolyte interactions. We apply a physics-encoded KA-CRNN to learn SOC-dependent kinetic parameters for cathode-electrolyte decomposition directly from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. A mechanistically informed reaction pathway is embedded into the network architecture, enabling the activation energies, pre-exponential factors, enthalpies, and related parameters to be represented as continuous and fully interpretable functions of the SOC. The framework is demonstrated for NCA, NM, and NMA cathodes, yielding models that reproduce DSC heat-release features across all SOCs and provide interpretable insight into SOC-dependent oxygen-release and phase-transformation mechanisms.

Such continuous waves, which have not been detected yet, will be very useful to study gravitational physics and to probe the extreme physics of neutron stars. While typically such waves from a pulsar are estimated considering an overall stellar ellipticity, there can be multiple irregularities or mountains in the stellar crust that the gravity of the star cannot smooth.

There, being able to apply operations probabilistically (stochastic LOCC) does not increase the Schmidt number.

Gen. Phys. 27, 37 (1943)] and by Hodgkin-Katz [J. of Physio 108, 37 (1949)] derived the foundational framework for interpreting electro-physiological measurements in what is commonly termed the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) theory for the membrane potential. Both seminal papers postulate a constant/uniform electric field within the ion channel. Using a uniform electric field allows for a simple, straightforward calculation of the ionic fluxes and the transmembrane potential, which yields the famous GHK potential. The use of this framework is so widely accepted that one can find a plethora of works that no longer cite the original works and GHK has perhaps become the universal and indisputable descriptor of the underlying physics and biology. In recent works [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 228401 (2025) and Phys. Rev. E 111, 064408 (2025)], we revisited GHK and its assumption of a uniform field. Non-approximated numerical simulations showed that the electric field is not always uniform. To understand this discrepancy, it is important to understand that the governing equations can be solved using two different approaches: the GHK approach of assuming a constant electric field or postulating that the system is electroneutral. Each approach yields drastically different non-commutative results. The purpose of this report is to provide a non-mathematical summary of the results and to inform the broader community that GHK is not as universal as previously thought. We will discuss these two newer works, with some emphasis on how they can potentially revolutionize the interpretation of electro-physiological measurements. Importantly, we show that this new framework, which utilizes the mathematical tools developed by the electrodialysis community, also serves as a bridge linking the electrophysiology community and the electrodialysis community.", "AI": {"tldr": "GHK\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\u7535\u573a\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u4f46\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7535\u573a\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u77db\u76fe\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u6311\u6218\u4e86GHK\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u666e\u904d\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "GHK\u7406\u8bba\u81ea1943\u5e74Goldman\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u89e3\u91ca\u7535\u751f\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5047\u8bbe\u7535\u573a\u5747\u5300\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7535\u573a\u672a\u5fc5\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u77db\u76fe\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6b63\u662f\u8fd9\u77db\u76fe\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6211\u4eec\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6GHK\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5047\u8bbe\u7535\u573a\u5747\u5300\uff08\u5982Goldman\u7b49\uff09\uff1b\u5047\u8bbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u4f53\u7535\u4e2d\u6027\u3002\u5206\u522b\u6c42\u89e3\u5f97\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7535\u573a\u672a\u5fc5\u5747\u5300\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7535\u573a\u5e76\u975e\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u51fa\u77db\u76fe\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86GHK\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GHK\u7406\u8bba\u867d\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u7535\u751f\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u590d\u6742\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Current methods of fabricating devices in polariton microcavities largely involve patterning the devices via e-beam lithography before the cavity is completed, which offers less flexibility in device creation and reduces the maximum possible refractive index contrast. Moreover, the momentum and spatial distributions of the condensate are highly dependent on the host platform, and it has been difficult to preserve the desired behavior when modifying a given cavity. Here we introduce a method that addresses both of these challenges with the creation of polaritonic circuits of arbitrary forms etched via Focused Ion Beam into an organic microcavity based on Rhodamine 3B Perchlorate within a Small Molecule Ionic Isolation Lattices complex. We demonstrate room temperature condensation and propagation of polaritons in rectangular and trapezoidal waveguides by analyzing spatial and angle-resolved photoluminescence. We also discuss the blue-shifting and non-zero momentum of the condensate and show that it is strongly confined up to several higher energy levels. As an example, we report the spatial profiles of condensation in custom devices, such as a ring waveguide, a Y-splitter, and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

Quantum magic resources (or nonstabilizerness) capture deviation from classically simulable stabilizer states, while coherence and fermionic non-Gaussianity measure departure from the computational basis and from fermionic Gaussian states, respectively.

For resource-generating gates, evolution from low-resource states exhibits a universal rise-peak-fall behavior, with the peak time scaling logarithmically with subsystem size and the resource eventually decaying as the subsystem approaches a maximally mixed state. Circuits whose gates do not create the resource but entangle neighboring qubits, give rise to a ballistic spreading of quantum resource initially confined to a region of the initial state. Our results give a unified picture of spatiotemporal resource dynamics in local circuits and a baseline for more structured quantum many-body systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8d44\u6e90\u6307\u6807\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u5f88\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673abrickwall\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u62df\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8003\u5bdf\u8d44\u6e90\u751f\u6210\u548c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u7535\u8def\u4e0b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8d44\u6e90\u751f\u6210\u7535\u8def\u5728\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u4e0a\u5347-\u5cf0\u503c-\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95f4\u8ddd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u7535\u8def\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5176\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Despite extensive study, the frictional forces and energetics governing its torque generation remain poorly understood. Here, we combine single-molecule rotation measurements with stochastic thermodynamics to quantitatively estimate its effective torque, viscous drag and activation energy barriers. We present three complementary methods based on solutions to the Smoluchowski equation for overdamped diffusion in a tilted periodic potential, which use as input the steady-state angular velocity and rotational diffusion data from individual \\textit{E. coli} motors spanning different dynamical regimes. Crucially, these three methods require neither active external torque control, nor prior knowledge of the system's viscous drag or the motor's torque output. The first method assumes as input a model-dependent sinusoidal potential (single Fourier mode), albeit with unknown periodicity, yielding closed-form results in the low- and high-tilt limits, whereas the last two methods use a full Fourier-based reconstruction to output the now model-independent potential landscape. These approaches yield consistent estimates of the potential periodicity ($\\approx$ 26-fold symmetry), energy barrier height ($\\approx 2\\!-\\!4 k_{\\rm B}T$), and internal friction coefficient ($\\approx 0.1$ pN nm s rad$^{-2}$). Our results reveal that the BFM's torque-velocity relationship deviates significantly from the linear approximation near the critical tilt, where angular diffusion is maximized. More broadly, our framework provides a coherent strategy for reconstructing nanoscale energy landscapes from single-molecule data and is generalizable to other stepping molecular motors operating in cyclic conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ec6\u83cc\u8f6c\u5b50\u7684\u6469\u64e6\u529b\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u5206\u5b50\u65cb\u8f6c\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u968f\u673a\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u4f30\u7b97\u8f6c\u52a8\u529b\u77e9\u3001\u7c98\u6027\u963b\u5c3c\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u80fd\u969c\u788d\u3002\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8eSmoluchowski\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u6da8\u843d\u53d7\u963b\u5468\u671f\u52bf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u529b\u77e9\u63a7\u5236\u6216\u5148\u9a8c\u963b\u5c3c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8f6c\u5b50\u52bf\u5468\u671f\u7ea6\u4e3a26\u500d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u969c\u788d\u7ea62-4kBT\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\u7ea60.1pN nm s rad^-2\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8f6c\u5b50\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u77e9\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bb\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u91cd\u6784\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u80fd\u91cf\u5730\u5f62\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u73af\u884c\u8fd0\u4f5c\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u9a6c\u8fbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec6\u83cc\u8f6c\u5b50\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u77e9\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8fd0\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u5206\u5b50\u65cb\u8f6c\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u968f\u673a\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4f30\u7b97\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSmoluchowski\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u6da8\u843d\u53d7\u963b\u7684\u5468\u671f\u52bf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5355\u4e2aE. coli\u8f6c\u5b50\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u6269\u6563\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u529b\u77e9\u63a7\u5236\u6216\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5b50\u52bf\u5468\u671f\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u969c\u788d\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8f6c\u5b50\u52bf\u5468\u671f\u7ea6\u4e3a26\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u969c\u788d\u7ea62-4kBT\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\u7ea60.1pN nm s rad^-2\u3002\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u77e9\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bb\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7ec6\u83cc\u8f6c\u5b50\u7684\u6469\u64e6\u529b\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u73af\u884c\u8fd0\u4f5c\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u9a6c\u8fbe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The mass curve $M(|\u03c6_c|)$ along these sequences develops multiple extrema, yet stability changes only at the first maximum; configurations beyond it become highly compact and collapse under numerically induced perturbations, with near-critical models displaying a short-lived double-dive behaviour. Head-on collisions of equal-mass stars yield three distinct outcomes - boson star remnants, black hole formation at contact, and collapse of each star to a black hole prior to contact. The associated gravitational-wave energies reflect the competition between increasing compactness and decreasing tidal deformability, and at large self-interaction strengths the collapse-before-contact branch exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic structure.

While scanning imaging methods may be feasible, for linear X-ray processes coherent diffractive imaging has emerged as a key approach, enabling lensless reconstruction of nanoscale structure and dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this work, we propose a coherent diffractive approach to imaging using X-ray nonlinear processes, introducing an analysis method to isolate the nonlinear component from the overall diffraction pattern by leveraging the property of mutual incoherence between different wavelengths. For examples such as sum-frequency generation in ferroelectrics, this method reveals both domain structure and orientation through the retrieved amplitude and phase of the nonlinear signal. We discuss the feasibility of the proposed method in the presence of experimental noise, most relevantly shot noise.

We find a rich phase diagram: in one spatial dimension, charge is always easy to learn, while dipole moment can be either easy or hard. In two dimensions, we find three phases: for frequent measurements, both charge and dipole moment are easy to learn; as the measurement rate is decreased, first dipole moment and then charge become hard.

Although conventional numerical solvers can reproduce this behavior with high fidelity, their computational cost limits real-time prediction, rapid parameter exploration, experimental feedback, and especially inverse retrieval of input fields from measured outputs. In this work, we introduce an operator learning framework that learns both the forward and inverse propagation operators within a single unified architecture. By combining spectral filters for spatio-temporal representations with Fourier-embedded conditioning on physical parameters, the model functions as a fast surrogate capable of accurately predicting complex field evolution on previously unseen cases. To our knowledge, this represents one of the first demonstrations of a bidirectional operator-learning framework applied to ultrashort-pulse multimode fiber propagation. The resulting architecture enables orders-of-magnitude speedup over numerical solvers, paving the way for real-time beam diagnostics, data-driven design of complex input fields, and closed-loop spatio-temporal control.

Here, we take the view that entanglement between anyons can give rise to an emergent geometry resembling Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. We analyze the entanglement structure of fractionalized anyons using mutual information and interpret the results within this emergent geometric framework. As a concrete example, we consider pairs of $e/2$-charged semions that arise from instanton configurations in a disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbon. These fractional charges, located on opposite zigzag edges, show long-range quantum entanglement despite being spatially separated. We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry. In this setup, the entanglement structure defines minimal surfaces in the bulk, providing a geometric view of the edge correlations. This gives a holographic picture of fractionalized degrees of freedom in quasi-one-dimensional systems and shows how quantum entanglement can generate emergent geometry even without conformal symmetry.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For pure states, the only WPS are Gaussian states, but the situation is considerably more subtle for mixed states. Here, we approach the problem using convex geometry, reducing the question to the characterization of the extreme points of the set of WPS. We give a constructive method to generate a large class of such extreme WPS, which combines the following steps: (i) we characterize the phase-invariant extreme points of the superset of Wigner-positive quasi-states (WPQS); (ii) we introduce a new quantum map, named Vertigo map, which maps extreme WPQS to extreme WPS while preserving phase invariance; (iii) we identify families of extremality-preserving maps and use them to obtain extreme WPS while relaxing phase invariance. Our construction generates all extreme WPS of low dimension, starting from a specific kind of WPS known as beam-splitter states. Our results build upon new mathematical properties of the set of WPS derived in a companion paper and unveil the remarkable structure of mixed states with non-negative Wigner functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We perform an explicit one-loop computation in the theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions, using for the case study the divergent part of the action on a background with non-trivial shift vector; the background spatial metric is taken to be flat and the background lapse function is set to 1. No truncations are assumed at the level of perturbations, for which we develop a diagrammatic technique and a version of the heat-kernel method. We isolate dangerous linear-in-frequency divergences in the two-point function of the shift, which can lead to spatial non-localities, and explicitly verify their cancellation. This leaves a fully local expression for the divergent part of the quadratic effective action, from which we extract the beta functions for the Newton constant and the essential coupling $\u03bb$ in the kinetic term of the metric.

To address the curse of dimensionality, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed as a baseline dimensionality reduction technique. The optimal number of principal components was determined to be two, retaining more than 99% of the total variance. This selection was supported by the analysis of the covariance matrix, eigenvalue distribution, and the scree plot. Projecting the data onto the first two principal components enabled improved visualization and interpretability compared to the original high-dimensional feature space. The reduced representation also revealed a clearer separation of target values, effectively decreasing data complexity.

For nearest-neighbor hopping on a square lattice, we find that the electronic spectrum is significantly renormalized, with bandwidth and quasi-particle residue strongly decreasing with increasing electron density. On the other hand, damping and particle-hole asymmetry increase, while a polaronic continuum forms in the hole sector, below the single-particle band. Fermi liquid phenomenology applies only at low densities, where the system remains paramagnetic.

We show that this does not have to be the case: under restricted operational access, classical correlations can appear nonseparable when expressed in the formalism of quantum mechanics. If an observer is limited to a constrained set of measurements and transformations, certain classical phase-space distributions can mimic entanglement-like behaviours. Imposing positivity of the associated Hilbert space operator as a physicality requirement removes some of these representational artifacts, revealing a regime in which nonseparability is genuine but still reproducible by classical models. Only when the operational restrictions on the observer are lifted further--allowing operational tests of measurement incompatibility or other nonclassical signatures--does one obtain entanglement that can no longer be captured by any classical description. This operational hierarchy distinguishes classical artifacts, classically reproducible nonseparability, and genuine entanglement.", "AI": {"tldr": " Classical correlations can mimic quantum entanglement under certain restrictions, but genuine entanglement requires overcoming these limitations.", "motivation": " The paper explores the boundary between classical and quantum correlations, particularly in the context of restricted operational access.", "method": " The authors analyze classical phase-space distributions under limited measurement and transformation sets, imposing positivity constraints on the corresponding Hilbert space operators.", "result": " They demonstrate that under operational restrictions, classical correlations can exhibit nonseparable behavior replicable by classical models, but genuine entanglement requires removing such restrictions.", "conclusion": " This work provides an operational framework for distinguishing between classical artifacts, classically reproducible nonseparability, and genuine entanglement."}}

In this formulation, complexity is defined as the length of the minimal geodesic in a suitably constructed geometric space associated with the Lie group of relevant operators.

In this work, we circumvent these limitations by employing a finite-dimensional matrix representation of the generators, which enables an exact computation of the geodesic distance and hence a precise determination of the complexity.

After the initial Einstein@Home search, we perform a multi-stage follow-up of the most promising $\\approx$ 45 million signal candidates. In the last stages, we use independent data to further investigate the remaining candidates from the previous stages. We set the most stringent constraints to date on the gravitational-wave amplitude, equatorial ellipticity, r-mode saturation amplitude, and -- for the first time -- the neutron-star crustal anisotropy. For spin periods lower than 2 ms we constrain the ellipticity to be smaller than $4\\times 10^{-7}$ for all targets. We exclude the crustal anisotropy to be smaller than $5\\times 10^{-3}$ for spin periods between 1.3-100 ms. Only one candidate -- from the low frequency G347.3 search -- survives all follow-ups.

Here, we use nonlinear 2D-THz spectroscopy to scrutinize the dynamics through nonlinearities of the EIT-like phenomenon in a metamaterial platform that comprises of two coupled resonators. From the temporal profiles of the nonlinear pump-probe and photon-echo signals, we found that the bright mode relaxation time is almost twice the time for the coherent exchange of energy between the two coupled resonators. The multi-peak nature of photon-echo signal and the corresponding temporal signatures further provides a direct visualization of the interference between the dressed states that drives the transparency window in our THz metamaterial.

However, certain stages of the quantum computing pipeline can, in fact, benefit from this noise. In this work, we exploit the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis to show that noise generically accelerates a fundamental task in quantum computing -- the preparation of Gibbs states. We demonstrate this behavior using classical and quantum simulations with Haar-random and phase-flip noise, respectively, on a spin-1/2 chain with a local Hamiltonian. Our non-integrable model sees ~3.5x faster thermalization in the presence of noise, while our integrable model, which would not otherwise thermalize, reaches a thermal state due to noise. Since certifying a local Gibbs state is relatively easy on a quantum computer, our approach provides a new practical solution to a key problem in quantum computing.

It enables us to manipulate single modes in nonlinear interactions with precision at the quantum level without involved setups. This setting is useful in the field of analogue gravity (AG), where gravitational phenomena are investigated in accessible analogue lab setups. These lecture notes provide an account of this AG framework and applications. Although light in nonlinear dielectrics is discussed in textbooks, the involved modelling often includes many assumptions that are directed at optical communications, some of which are rarely detailed. Here, we provide a self-contained and sufficiently detailed description of the propagation of light in fibers, with a minimal set of assumptions, which is relevant in the context of AG. Starting with the structure of a step-index fiber, we derive linear-optics propagating modes and show that the transverse electric field of the fundamental mode is well approximated as linearly polarized and of a Gaussian profile. We then incorporate a cubic nonlinearity and derive a general wave envelope propagation equation. With further simplifying assumptions, we arrive at the famous nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which governs fundamental effects in nonlinear fibers, such as solitons. As a first application in AG, we show how intense light in the medium creates an effective background spacetime for probe light akin to the propagation of a scalar field in a black hole spacetime. We introduce optical horizons and particle production in this effective spacetime, giving rise to the optical Hawking effect. Furthermore, we discuss two related light emission mechanisms.

However, efficient deployment of photonics-enhanced ML requires hybrid workflows that integrate optical processing with conventional CPU/GPU based neural network architectures. Here, we propose such a workflow that combines photonic positional embeddings (PEs) with advanced graph ML models. We introduce a photonics-based method that augments graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with PEs derived from light propagation on synthetic frequency lattices whose couplings match the input graph. We simulate propagation and readout to obtain internode intensity correlation matrices, which are used as PEs in GCNs to provide global structural information. Evaluated on Long Range Graph Benchmark molecular datasets, the method outperforms baseline GCNs with Laplacian based PEs, achieving $6.3\\%$ lower mean absolute error for regression and $2.3\\%$ higher average precision for classification tasks using a two-layer GCN as a baseline. When implemented in high repetition rate photonic hardware, correlation measurements can enable fast feature generation by bypassing digital simulation of PEs.

From a symmetry perspective, the MO includes an axial-dipole component analogous to that of the spin, making it essential to clarify how MO currents differ from spin currents. We here investigate the correspondence between MO conductivities and electronic multipoles, which provide a unified and powerful framework for symmetry analysis. We derive the multipole representation of the rank-five MO conductivity tensor and classify its symmetry-allowed components for all crystallographic point groups, in direct comparison with spin conductivity. We show that time-reversal-even electric-type multipoles give rise to the dissipationless MO current, whereas time-reversal-odd magnetic-type multipoles generate dissipative MO current under an applied electric field. Complementing this macroscopic analysis, the linear-response calculations for a microscopic tight-binding model demonstrate how MO conductivities are activated by symmetry lowering, exemplified by the symmetry reduction from Oh to Th.

Building on classical Fisher-information analyses of resonant transmission sensors, we model parameter encoding as a phase-and-loss quantum channel embedded in one arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We derive the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for coherent and Gaussian probe states under linear loss and show that, even at the quantum limit, optimal estimation precision is governed by the generator of parameter-dependent phase shifts rather than by the cavity quality factor. Consequently, the operating point that maximizes the QFI does not generally coincide with the maximum-Q resonance. Quantum resources enhance sensitivity but do not redefine the optimal geometry.

By bridging classical electrodynamics description for quasi-normal modes (retardation effects included) with a quantum emitter perspective, this framework provides an analytically tractable description of the damping of the dissipative confined plasmonic systems. In addition to its significance for emission control, the model emphasizes the bosonic characteristics of plasmonic quasi-particles, which are coherent many-electron excitations of the states of quasi-normal modes. Unlike conventional cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED), where the emitter and cavity exist as separate systems, a plasmonic quasi-particle functions as a quantum emitter embedded within a self-created resonant near-field nano-cavity of confined radial fields, sharing the spectral characteristics of the surface transverse-magnetic (TM) modes, which include nonradiative damping effects resulting from, e.g., ohmic losses in a metal. This work extends Fermi's Golden Rule to include the coupling between the emission process and the self-generated cavity impact. The derived self-consistent formulation offers analytical expressions for the total damping rates, which demonstrate a size-dependent suppression displayed in higher multipolarity modes attributed to the impact of the self-quenching effect resulting from the coaction of radiative and non-radiative channels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u81ea\u6d3d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u7403\u5f62\u91d1\u5c5e\u5c0f\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\u8868\u9762\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u6d88\u6563\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u7535\u78c1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u8f90\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u51c6\u6001\u7684\u73bb\u8272\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u662f\u591a\u7535\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6709\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u3002\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u8154\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u51c6\u6001\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u5df1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u8fd1\u573a\u7eb3\u7c73\u8154\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86\u8d39\u7c73\u9ec4\u91d1\u6cd5\u5219\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8003\u8651\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u8154\u5f71\u54cd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5927\u5c0f\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u591a\u6781\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u975e\u8f90\u5c04\u6e20\u9053\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u81ea\u51cf\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u8868\u9762\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u5728\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5149\u81f4\u53d1\u5149\u3001\u6fc0\u5149\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5149\u81f4\u6548\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7eb3\u7c73\u5149\u5b50ics\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5bf9\u51c6\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff08\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u6ede\u6548\u5e94\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u53d1\u6563\u5668\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u89e3\u6790\u63cf\u8ff0\u6d88\u6563\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u9762\u7535\u78c1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u6d3d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u975e\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u64ad\u6e20\u9053\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7eb3\u5165\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86\u8d39\u7c73\u9ec4\u91d1\u6cd5\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5927\u5c0f\u76f8\u5173\u591a\u6781\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u6790\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u8868\u9762\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u51c6\u6001\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

While calcium imaging has been firmly established as a workhorse technique for monitoring neuronal activity, its limited temporal resolution and indirect measurement restrict its ability to capture rapid inhibitory and excitatory events and subthreshold voltage oscillations. In contrast, voltage imaging directly measures membrane potential fluctuations, providing a comprehensive and precise representation of neuronal circuit dynamics. Recent advancements in voltage-sensitive dyes and, particularly, genetically encoded voltage indicators have significantly enhanced the feasibility of voltage imaging, prompting the development of advanced fluorescence microscopy methods optimized for high-speed acquisition. However, achieving millisecond-scale temporal resolution remains challenging due to inherent trade-offs among imaging speed, spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio. Conventional raster-scanning approaches, including confocal microscopy, are fundamentally limited by their slow frame rates, precluding the capture of rapid neuronal events from multiple neurons simultaneously. Alternative techniques such as random-access scanning, spatiotemporal multiplexing, and computational optical imaging have successfully addressed these constraints, enabling kilohertz-level imaging of neuronal activity in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional contexts.

Their reduced dimensionality enables unique quantum phenomena, including optically addressable spin defects, tunable single-photon emitters, low-dimensional magnetism, gate-controlled superconductivity, and correlated states in Moir\u00e9 superlattices. This Roadmap provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress and future directions in exploiting 2D materials for quantum sensing, computation, communication, and simulation. We survey advances spanning spin defects and quantum sensing, quantum emitters and nonlinear photonics, computational theory and data-driven discovery of quantum defects, spintronic and magnonic devices, cavity-engineered quantum materials, superconducting and hybrid quantum circuits, quantum dots, Moir\u00e9 quantum simulators, and quantum communication platforms. Across these themes, we identify common challenges in defect control, coherence preservation, interfacial engineering, and scalable integration, alongside emerging opportunities driven by machine$-$learning$-$assisted design and integrated experiment$-$theory feedback loops.

For solving the inverse problem of designing new metasurfaces that transform EM fields in a desirable manner, it is often necessary to explore large design spaces through full-wave simulations that can be computationally demanding. In this work, we demonstrate that neural operators, which are artificial neural network architectures designed to learn operators between function spaces, can effectively approximate the differential operators underlying Maxwell's equations, enabling their use as fast and accurate 3D surrogate models that can predict 3D EM fields transformed by metasurfaces. To calibrate neural operators, we generate synthetic training data consisting of 3D metasurface geometries together with their associated 3D EM fields obtained by numerically solving Maxwell's equations. Using the generated synthetic data, we train physics-informed neural operators to minimize physical inconsistencies of predicted EM fields by incorporating residuals that capture deviations from Maxwell's equations. We observe that a training dataset consisting of fewer than 5000 examples already suffices to achieve reasonable results. In particular, our experiments show that the resulting 3D surrogate model achieves high predictive performance across a wide range of metasurface geometries, including types of structures not encountered during training. Notably, it predicts diffraction efficiencies with relative errors of 3.9 % and provides a 67-fold speedup compared to conventional 3D simulations. Overall, once trained, our 3D surrogate model can rapidly predict EM fields for previously unseen metasurface geometries, which can facilitate efficient gradient-based design of nanostructured materials for EM wave control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91c7\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u76843D\u91d1\u5c5e\u8868\u9762\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u7535\u78c1\u6ce2\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5de5\u5177..<br/>\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u7b80\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u62103D\u91d1\u5c5e\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5165\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5c11\u4e8e5000\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce2\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534767\u500d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u78c1\u6ce2\u5bfc\u51fa\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4ec5\u4e3a3.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u76843D\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u5728\u91d1\u5c5e\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The above off-shell nilpotent symmetry transformations are nothing but the BRST, co-BRST, anti-BRST and anti-co-BRST, under which, the Lagrangian densities transform to the total spacetime derivatives. The proof of the uniqueness of the above bosonic symmetry transformation operator crucially depends on the validity of all the four Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions that exist on our theory. We highlight the importance of these CF-type restrictions, at various levels of our theoretical discussions, in the context of the unique bosonic transformation.

Then building on this relation, we define residual battery capacity for general quantum states and establish coherent/incoherent components of subsystem battery capacity. Furthermore, we introduce the protocol to guide the selection of appropriate incoherent unitary operations for enhancing subsystem battery capacity in specific scenarios, along with a sufficient condition for achieving subsystem capacity gain through unitary operation. Numerical examples validate the feasibility of the incoherent operation protocol. Additionally, for the three-qubit system, we also established a set of theories and results parallel to those for two-qubit case.

In a simple example setup, we explicitly construct the 2d theory and perform an initial classical analysis.

Comparing with more typical integrable systems, we explain how 2d holomorphic integrability sits between the standard notions of integrability in one and two dimensions. These 2d theories are designed as toy models for integrable theories in three and four dimensions, many of which can be understood as partially or totally holomorphic. We comment on the implications for higher-dimensional integrability and aspects of quantization in the concluding remarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

A procedure is defined to extract these asymptotic data in the presence of sources. This provides for each class of propagating field on de Sitter the relationship between two independent sets of data defined on the sphere in the asymptotic future with the corresponding data defined in the asymptotic past. We also provide several theorems on the decomposition of vector and tensors on de Sitter such as one proving that a large class of tensors obeying an inhomogeneous wave equation can be expressed locally in terms of a symmetric transverse traceless tensor.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the square of bipartite entanglement measures $G_q$-concurrence, which is the generalization of concurrence, follows a set of hierarchical monogamy relations for any $N$-qubit quantum state. On the basis of these monogamy inequalities, we render two kinds of hierarchical indicators that exhibit evident advantages in the capacity of witnessing entanglement. Moreover, we show an analytical relation between $G_q$-concurrence and concurrence in $2\\otimes d$ systems. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that the monogamy property of squared $G_q$-concurrence is superior to that of squared concurrence in $2\\otimes d_2\\otimes d_3\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes d_N$ systems. In addition, several concrete examples are provided to illustrate that for multilevel systems, the squared $G_q$-concurrence satisfies the monogamy relation, even if the squared concurrence does not. These results better reveal the intriguing characteristic of multilevel entanglement and provide critical insights into the entanglement distribution within multipartite quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Considering the insertion of a local scalar operator of charge $L$ on a cusped Wilson loop, we investigate the general solution of the dual string configuration for any value of cusp angles, paying particular attention to the different ranges of the physical parameters and obtaining a unified description that simultaneously captures the near BPS, the antiparallel lines and the large-$L$ regimes. We observe, in the limit of small separation between the lines, a non-analytic change in the behavior of the cusp anomaly at a critical value of $L$: one crosses from a region dominated by the familiar Coulomb-like singularity to a ``deconfined\" situation describing the leading L\u00fcscher corrections at large $L$ of the generalized cusp anomalous dimension. We derive the equations for small fluctuations around the classical string solution, generalizing previous analysis of the uncharged case, and we study the behavior of the spectrum near the transition region.

It has been shown that it is possible to employ alkali atoms to implement single device multipartite entanglement by using nonlinear processes with spatial modes. This work presents the first microscopic description of such multi-mode generation with two-pump four wave mixing (4WM) in dense atomic media. We implement an extension of a double $\u039b$ model for a single pump 4WM in order to describe the multi-mode generation with a two-pump configuration. We propose a Floquet expansion to solve the multimode gain amplification and noise properties. The model describes the angle and the two-photon dependency of the multimode generation and the quantum correlations among the modes. We investigate the entanglement properties of the system, describing the main properties of previous experimental observations. Such a microscopic description can be used to predict the gain distribution of modes and the quantum correlation within a typical range of experimental parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6805\u6a21\u578b\u548cFloquet\u5c55\u5f00\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6001\u8f6c\u5316", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u039b\u578b\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6001\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u6027\u5206\u6790", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6307\u5bfc"}}

The characteristic parameters of the quadratic curvature coupling and the non-minimal matter coupling imply the contributions from higher-order curvature terms and the coupling between matter and geometry, respectively. We explicitly demonstrate that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor can be modified, and that in the vanishing limit of the non-minimal matter coupling, the formalism of general relativity is recovered. By deriving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations from the gravitational field equations and applying the MIT bag model equation of state, we obtain the corresponding mass-radius relationships for strange stars. Furthermore, we show that the maximum mass limit of strange stars can exceed the general relativistic counterpart. Specifically, we find that a maximum mass up to 3.11 solar mass is achievable, suggesting that the lighter companion of GW190814 could plausibly be a strange star.", "AI": {"tldr": "Strange stars can have a maximum mass up to 3.11 solar masses in quadratic curvature gravity with non-minimal matter coupling.", "motivation": "Investigating the maximum mass of strange stars under alternative gravitational theories to better understand their physical properties and potential astrophysical implications.", "method": "Derived modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, employed the MIT bag model equation of state within the framework of quadratic curvature gravity with non-minimal matter coupling.", "result": "Maximum mass of strange stars exceeds the general relativistic limit, reaching up to 3.11 solar masses.", "conclusion": "The findings open new possibilities for understanding counterparts of gravitational wave events, such as GW190814, potentially allowing for compact objects that are more massive than previously considered limits in general relativity."}}

This thesis investigates scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation through the development of bosonic quantum codes, quantum LDPC codes, and decoding protocols that connect continuous-variable and discrete-variable error correction. We investigate superconducting microwave implementations of continuous-variable quantum computing, including the deterministic generation of cubic phase states, and introduce the dissipatively stabilized squeezed cat qubit, a noise-biased bosonic encoding with enhanced error suppression and faster gates. The performance of rotation-symmetric and GKP codes is analyzed under realistic noise and measurement models, revealing key trade-offs in measurement-based schemes. To integrate bosonic codes into larger architectures, we develop decoding methods that exploit analog syndrome information, enabling quasi-single-shot decoding in concatenated systems. On the discrete-variable side, we introduce localized statistics decoding, a highly parallelizable decoder for quantum LDPC codes, and propose quantum radial codes, a new family of single-shot LDPC codes with low overhead and strong circuit-level performance. Finally, we present fault complexes, a homological framework for analyzing faults in dynamic quantum error correction protocols. Extending the role of homology in static CSS codes, fault complexes provide a general language for the design and analysis of fault-tolerant schemes.", "AI": {"tldr":

Corresponding author: Qing Ai (aiqing@bnu.edu.cn)", "summary": "With intensive studies of quantum thermodynamics, the quantum batteries (QBs) have been proposed to store and transfer energy via quantum effects. Despite many theoretical models, decoherence remains a severe challenge and practical platforms are still rare. Here we propose the QB based on the degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO), using the signal field as the energy-storage unit. We carefully separate the ergotropy into coherent and incoherent components and find that the coherent part decays roughly half as slowly as the incoherent part. More importantly, the coherent ergotropy and the average charging power reach their respective maxima at essentially the same moment, i.e., $\u03b3_s t \\approx 10$. This coincidence defines the optimal instant to switch off the pump. Finally, coupling the QB to a two-level system (TLS) as the load, we demonstrate an efficient discharge process of the QB. Our work establishes a realistic and immediately-implementable QB architecture on a mature optical platform.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u9891\u8c10\u632f\u8154\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\uff08QBs\uff09\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u4f20\u8f93\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5207\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5165\uff0c QB \u6210\u4e3a\u50a8\u8fd0\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\u5236\u7ea6\u5176\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cpaper\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u9891\u8c10\u632f\u8154\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u9891\u8c10\u632f\u8154\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u573a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u80fd\u91cf\u50a8\u5b58\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7ec6\u81f4\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u76f8\u5e72\u4e0e\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u5207\u6362\u65f6\u673a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u90e8\u5206\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06 QB \u4e0e\u4e24\u80fd\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08TLS\uff09 coupling\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5145\u653e\u7535\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u5e72\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u7f13\u548c\uff0c\u5145\u653e\u7535\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5 QB \u67b6\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5207\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u7684 QB \u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u719f\u7684\u53cc\u9891\u8c10\u632f\u8154\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u4f20\u8f93\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Here, we demonstrate an on-chip multimode resonator in which strong parametric modulation induces a large and tunable normal-mode splitting that enables microwave storage. When the spectral bandwidth of a short microwave pulse covers the two dressed-state absorption peaks, part of the pulse is absorbed and undergoes coherent energy exchange between the modes, producing a clear time-domain beating signal.

While various methods have been proposed to solve this problem, each has their drawbacks in terms of inefficiency or sensitivity to control errors. Here, we modify Grover's algorithm to eliminate the oscillatory dynamics, such that the search proceeds as an exponential decay into the solution states.

However, as CV-QKD systems progress toward digital implementations, device nonidealities drive the optical field from a single-mode to a continuous-mode region, thereby underscoring the mismatch between theoretical models and practical systems. Here, we introduce temporal modes to construct an entanglement-based scheme that more accurately captures device nonidealities and develop a corresponding secret key rate calculation method applicable to continuous-mode scenarios. We demonstrate that optimizing the pulse-shaping format can significantly improve performance under detector-bandwidth-limited conditions.

Theoretical resource estimates suggest that 2048-bit RSA keys could be broken using Shor's algorithm with fewer than a million noisy qubits. Although such machines do not yet exist, the availability of smaller, cloud-accessible quantum processors and open-source implementations of Shor's algorithm raises the question of what key sizes can realistically be factored with today's platforms. In this work, we experimentally investigate Shor's algorithm on several cloud-based quantum computers using publicly available implementations. Our results reveal a substantial gap between the capabilities of current quantum hardware and the requirements for factoring cryptographically relevant integers. In particular, we observe that circuit constructions still need to be highly specific for each modulus, and that machine fidelities are unstable, with high and fluctuating error rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "The detection and characterization of quantum coherence is of fundamental importance both in the foundations of quantum theory as well as for the rapidly developing field of quantum technologies, where coherence has been linked to quantum advantage. Typical approaches for detecting coherence employ {\\it coherence witnesses} -- observable quantities whose expectation value can be used to certify the presence of coherence. By design, coherence witnesses are only able to detect coherence for some, but not all, possible states of a quantum system. In this work we construct protocols capable of detecting the presence of coherence in an {\\it unknown} pure quantum state $|\u03c8\\rangle$. Having access to $m$ copies of an unknown pure state $|\u03c8\\rangle$ we show that the sample complexity of any experimental procedure for detecting coherence with constant probability of success $\\ge 2/3$ is $\u0398(c(|\u03c8\\rangle)^{-1})$, where $c(|\u03c8\\rangle)$ is the geometric measure of coherence of $|\u03c8\\rangle$. However, assuming access to the unitary $U_\u03c8$ which prepares the unknown state $|\u03c8\\rangle$, and its inverse $U_\u03c8^\\dagger$, we devise a coherence detecting protocol that employs amplitude-amplification {\\it a la} Grover, and uses a quadratically smaller number $O(c(|\u03c8\\rangle)^{-1/2})$ of samples. Furthermore, by augmenting amplitude amplification with phase estimation we obtain an experimental estimation of upper bounds on the geometric measure of coherence within additive error $\\varepsilon$ with a sample complexity that scales as $O(1/\\varepsilon)$ as compared to the $O(1/\\varepsilon^2)$ sample complexity of Monte Carlo estimation methods.

We do so by providing explicit expressions for stochastic Hamiltonians that produce state dynamics identical to those that happen during continuous quantum measurements. When such dynamical processes are integrated over sufficiently long time intervals, they yield the same results and statistics as during wavefunction collapse. That is, wavefunction collapse can be interpreted as coarse-grained (stochastic) Hamiltonian dynamics. Alternatively, wavefunction collapse can be interpreted as double-bracket gradient flows determined by derivatives of (stochastic) potentials defined in terms of observables with direct physical interpretations. The gradient flows minimize the variance of the monitored observable. Our derivations hold for general monitoring described by non-Hermitian jump processes.

Specifically, we reinterpret the Margolus-Levitin and Mandelstam-Tamm bounds as estimators of the energy expectation value and variance, respectively, and relate them to the shortest time for the processor to orthogonalize a quantum state. This shortest gate time, expected to lie on the nanosecond scale, is inferred from job execution times measured in seconds by employing gate-time amplification. We apply the method to IBM's superconducting quantum processor and estimate the energy scales associated with single-, two-, and three-qubit gates. The order of estimated energy is consistent with typical drive energies in superconducting qubit systems, suggesting that current gate operations approach the quantum speed limit.

While effective, it scales unfavorably with problem size. In this work, we present QuantGraph, a two-stage quantum-enhanced framework that casts local and global graph-optimization problems as quantum searches over discrete trajectory spaces. The solver is designed to operate efficiently by first finding a sequence of locally optimal transitions in the graph (local stage), without considering full trajectories. The accumulated cost of these transitions acts as a threshold that prunes the search space (up to 60% reduction for certain examples). The subsequent global stage, based on this threshold, refines the solution. Both stages utilize variants of the Grover-adaptive-search algorithm. To achieve scalability and robustness, we draw on principles from control theory and embed QuantGraph's global stage within a receding-horizon model-predictive-control scheme. This classical layer stabilizes and guides the quantum search, improving precision and reducing computational burden.

However, experimental demonstrations of their envisaged capabilities remain scarce, posing the difficulty of achieving precise control over coherences between qudit states in long pulse sequences. Here, we implement in 173Yb(trensal) qudit the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), a core component of numerous quantum algorithms, storing quantum information in the phases of coherences. QFT provides an ideal benchmark for coherence manipulation and an unprecedented challenge for molecular spin qudits. We address this challenge by embedding a full-refocusing protocol for spin qudits in our algorithm, mitigating inhomogeneous broadening and enabling a high-fidelity recovery of the state. Complete state tomography demostrates the performance of the algorithm, while simulations provide insight into the physical mechanisms behind inhomogeneous broadening.

Among them, generalized coherent states (GCS), which naturally arise from the evolution of a coherent state with a nonlinear medium, exhibit useful quantum features such as Wigner negativity and metrological advantages [Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013165 (2023)]. Because these states remain coherent to all orders, their nonclassical character cannot be revealed through standard intensity-intensity correlation measurements. Here, we demonstrate that the intensity-field correlation function alone provides a simple and experimentally accessible witness of nonclassicality. For GCSs, any deviation of this normalized correlation from unity signals nonclassical behavior. We derive analytical results for Kerr-generated states and extend the analysis to statistical mixtures of GCSs.

Assuming only the validity of quantum theory, we prove that for every entangled state $\u03c1_{AB}$ there exist local broadcasting maps and local measurements such that the resulting four--partite correlations cannot be reproduced by any broadcast network whose source is separable across the $A|B$ cut. Thus, all entangled states are broadcast nonlocal in quantum theory. In addition, we show that all (also mixed) multipartite states can be broadcast-self-tested, according to a natural operational definition.", "AI": {"tldr": "Entanglement and Bell nonlocality are inequivalent; however, all entangled states become broadcast nonlocal.", "motivation": "Understanding the behavior of entangled states in distributed systems and the relationship between entanglement and Bell nonlocality.", "method": "Proof-based analysis using quantum theory and operational definitions of nonlocality.", "result": "All entangled states are broadcast nonlocal, implying a fundamental connection between quantum entanglement and nonlocal distributed effects.", "conclusion": "This work bridges the concepts of entanglement and Bell nonlocality in the context of quantum communication networks, opening new avenues for quantum information processing and protocol design."}}

To bring clarity to this search, we introduce a framework that connects the structure of parametrized quantum circuits to the mathematical nature of the functions they can actually learn. Within this framework, we show how fundamental properties, like circuit depth and non-Clifford gate count, directly determine whether a model's output leads to efficient classical simulation or surrogation. We argue that this analysis uncovers common pathways to dequantization that underlie many existing simulation methods. More importantly, it reveals critical distinctions between models that are fully simulatable, those whose function space is classically tractable, and those that remain robustly quantum. This perspective provides a conceptual map of this landscape, clarifying how different models relate to classical simulability and pointing to where opportunities for quantum advantage may lie.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum states, called $A_\u03b1$-graph states, which are constructed from either unweighted or weighted graphs by taking the normalised convex combination of the degree matrix $D$ and the adjacency matrix $A_G$ of a graph $G$. The constructed states are different from the standard graph states arising from stabiliser formalism. Our approach is also different from the approach used by Braunstein et al. This class of states depend on a tunable mixing parameter $\u03b1\\in (0,1]$. We first establish the conditions under which the associated operator $\u03c1_\u03b1^{A_G}$ is positive semidefinite and hence represents a valid quantum state. We then derive a positive partial transposition (PPT) condition for $A_\u03b1$-graph states in terms of graph parameters. This PPT condition involves only the Frobenius norm of the adjacency matrix of the graph, the degrees of the vertices and the total number of vertices. For simple graphs, we obtain the range of the parameter $\u03b1$ for which the $A_\u03b1$-graph states represent a class of entangled states. We then develop a graph-theoretic formulation of a moments-based entanglement detection criterion, focusing on the recently proposed $p_3$-PPT criterion, which relies on the second and third moments of the partial transposition. Since the estimation of these moments is experimentally accessible via randomised measurements, swap operations, and machine-learning-based protocols, our approach provides a physically relevant framework for detecting entanglement in structured quantum states derived from graphs. This work bridges graph theory and moments-based entanglement detection, offering a new perspective on the role of combinatorial structures in quantum correlations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate the logical error probability (LEP) in a decoding window. We explore ways to use this to mitigate the LEP in entire circuits. For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to trillions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood inference. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In addition to giving a surprisingly concise proof of the original random purification theorem, our result implies the existence of fermionic and bosonic Gaussian purification channels. As applications, we obtain the first tomography protocol for fermionic Gaussian states that scales optimally with the number of modes and the error, as well as an improved property test for this class of states.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
