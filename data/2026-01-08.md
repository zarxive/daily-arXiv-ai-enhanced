Abstract: The coherent mobility of doublons, arising from second-order virtual dissociation-recombination processes, fundamentally limits their use as information carriers in the strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard model. We propose a disorder-free suppression mechanism by introducing an optimized nearest-neighbor pair-hopping term that destructively interferes with the dominant virtual hopping channel. Using the third-order Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we derive an analytical optimal condition that accounts for lattice geometry corrections. Exact numerical simulations demonstrate that this optimized scheme achieves near-complete dynamical arrest and entanglement preservation in one-dimensional chains, while in two-dimensional square lattices, it significantly suppresses ballistic spreading yet permits a slow residual expansion. Furthermore, in the many-body regime, finite-size scaling analysis identifies the observed long-lived density-wave order as a prethermal plateau emerging from the dramatic separation of microscopic and thermalization timescales.

Abstract: To explain the experiment on the anomalous dependence of the superfluid critical velocity on a moving obstacle potential in a atomic Bose-Einstein condensate [\href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.91.053615}{Phys.~Rev.~A \textbf{91}, 053615 (2015)}], we introduce a considerably simplified model of superflow along a step potential. The energy spectrum and wave functions of the lowest-energy excitations in this system are well described by the semi-classical analysis based on the Bogoliubov theory. We found that the critical velocity is minimized and becomes zero when the potential height equals the hydrostatic chemical potential, which corresponds to the critical point of the local condensation phase transition inside the step potential. In a finite-size system, the critical velocity $v_\mathrm{c}$ obeys a power-law scaling with the system size $L_x$ as $v_\mathrm{c}\propto L_x^{-0.963}$. This criticality provides an explanation of the power-law scaling of the minimum critical velocity observed in the experiment.

Abstract: Controlling the longitudinal phase space of high-brightness relativistic electron beams is crucial for advancing a broad spectrum of charged-particle-based instrumentation and scientific frontiers. A generalized method for achieving this control involves manipulating the photoemission laser's temporal distribution at the picosecond level, a long-standing technical challenge. Recent developments in laser shaping have enabled the creation of high-power, picosecond-scale symmetrical and asymmetrical temporal profiles, capable of fine-tuning complex space-charge dynamics and external field effects in relativistic charged-particle beams. Here, we demonstrate that rather than deviations from theorized, idealized laser distributions, a controlled asymmetry can be harnessed to counteract accelerator-induced distortions. By implementing spatiotemporal shaping of the ultraviolet photocathode laser at the LCLS-II superconducting injector, we achieve deterministic control over the longitudinal phase space without downstream corrections. We find that this optical asymmetry induces a self-linearizing effect across both low (40 pC) and high (80 pC) charge regimes, effectively suppressing nonlinear compression and energy chirp. Consequently, this approach is expected to preserve a low emittance comparable to that of ideal flattop or regular Gaussian profiles, while delivering superior current uniformity and shot-to-shot stability. These results establish spatiotemporal laser shaping as a compact, generalizable tool for directly optimizing beam brightness at the source.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the challenges of high-speed computing in data centers and introduces a novel polarization control system using TFLT in SHC transmission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving data center interconnect efficiency is crucial due to the growth of AI and the need for faster data processing.

Method: The researchers developed a four-stage electro-optic device with TFLT and a FBGD algorithm for polarization control.

Result: The system achieves high modulation bandwidth and negligible DC drift, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: TFLT-based polarization control enables ultrafast, low-power, and stable optical interconnects with practical applications.

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computing power driven by large-scale artificial intelligence is placing unprecedented demands on the bandwidth, latency, and energy efficiency of data-center interconnects (DCIs). Self-homodyne coherent (SHC) transmission is a promising architecture because it preserves the spectral efficiency of coherent detection while greatly simplifying digital signal processing, but its practical deployment is critically limited by random and often ultrafast state-of-polarization (SOP) fluctuations that induce carrier fading and destabilize coherent reception. Here we report the first integrated polarization controller based on thin-film lithium tantalate (TFLT), enabling reset-free polarization tracking at Mrad/s speeds. The four-stage electro-optic device exhibits polarization-dependent loss (PDL) below 0.3 dB, a half-wave voltage below 2.5 V, high modulation bandwidth, and negligible DC drift. To accommodate the finite tuning range of integrated phase shifters, we develop a finite-boundary gradient-descent (FBGD) control algorithm that ensures reset-free SOP evolution with no phase jump. The implemented adaptive polarization controller (APC) is validated through both standalone polarization-tracking measurements and a dual-polarization 16-QAM SHC 400-Gbps transmission system. Transient polarization disturbances can be tracked at speeds up to 2 Mrad/s, while stable reset-free operation under continuous polarization disturbances is maintained up to 1 Mrad/s. This reset-free performance represents more than doubling the state of the art, while the pre-FEC bit-error rates remain below the HD-FEC threshold under realistic DCI conditions and lightning-scale polarization disturbances. These results establish TFLT as a new platform for ultrafast, low-power, reset-free, and drift-free polarization control in coherent optical interconnects and beyond.

Abstract: Dielectric cylindrical waveguides are widely used for confining and guiding of electromagnetic waves in relatively wide range of frequencies. They have found numerous technological and scientific applications in telecommunications, medicine, material science, photonics and quantum optics. The electromagnetic field Green function is the central object in investigations of different types of radiation processes in those structures. In this paper, we review and further develop the recurrence procedure for evaluating the electromagnetic field Green function in a medium made of any number of homogeneous cylindrical layers. The general results are specified for a cylindrical waveguide immersed in a homogeneous medium. Expressions are provided for all the components of the Green tensor in both regions inside and outside the cylinder. As an application of the results for the Green function, we consider the radiation of a charged particle rotating around a dielectric cylinder. The intensities for all types of radiation processes are discussed. They include the synchrotron-Cherenkov radiation at large distances from the cylinder and the radiation on guided and surface polaritonic modes confined inside or near the surface of the cylinder. The paper provides explicit formulas for the electromagnetic fields and the spectral-angular densities of those radiations. It also includes a numerical and comparative analysis.

Abstract: Nanoparticles of plasmonic metals have significantly to the development of spectroscopic techniques, enabling strong confinement of electromagnetic fields at the nanoscale and corresponding signal amplification. However, to date, plasmonic applications have been limited mainly to the visible and near-infrared range, as materials supporting ultraviolet resonances typically exhibit poor chemical stability and lack robust surface functionalisation methods. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a fully programmable approach to UV plasmonics based on rhodium nanocube dimers assembled using DNA origami templates. We have developed a reliable ligand exchange strategy that allows the functionalisation of rhodium nanocubes with DNA while maintaining their colloidal stability. These DNA-modified nanocubes act as modular building blocks that can be assembled into dimers with 69% efficiency and an average gap size of 10 nm. The DNA origami design also allows for the deterministic placement of a single streptavidin protein in the plasmonic gap, unlike previous methods based on stochastic diffusion. Experiments with single-molecule autofluorescence in UV, supported by numerical simulations, show an increase in brightness of up to 22, a reduction in fluorescence lifetime, and a more than tenfold increase in the total number of detected photons. By creating a robust and versatile platform for the production of UV-resonant plasmonic nanoantennas, this work extends the functionality of plasmonics to the deep UV spectrum and opens up new possibilities for labelling-free single-protein spectroscopy.

Here, we unveil that in a multilayered framework of twisted birefringent optical components, a recursive number pattern of Pascal's triangle is naturally embedded in the structure of the Jones matrix which intuitively provide a generalized solution for pixel-to-pixel field transformation. The resulting standalone solution is universal across the electromagnetic spectrum, unifies N-layered metasurface and conventional bulk waveplates in a single framework, offers comprehensive insights about the bidirectional complex amplitude modulation and wavefront engineering in linear and circular polarization bases, and at the same time substantially reduces the computational cost. In essence, the discovery of number patterns in polarization optics/photonics will have broad impact across quantum optics, theory informed artificial intelligence model trainings, biomedical engineering and imaging, polarization information encryption, and advanced sensing applications.

Motivation: Sensing and detecting biointerfaces with high sensitivity and specificity is crucial for healthcare applications like antiviral technologies.

Method: The research involves creating plasmonic devices with optimized Tamm plasmons that respond differently to viral particles based on their structure.

Result: Exposure of these structures to viral particles causes a measurable spectral response, with the response strength varying depending on the particle structure.

Conclusion: This method offers a promising label-free way to detect viral particles and study their interactions with biological surfaces without altering their native state, which is significant for diagnostics and therapeutics.

Abstract: Bioresponsive optical materials that transduce nanoscale biointerface events into measurable spectral signals are of growing interest for sensing and antiviral technologies Here we show that a Tamm plasmon TP device consisting of a SiOTiO distributed Bragg reflector capped with a nanostructured silver layer exhibits a selective and structure dependent response to SARSCoV2 virus like particles VLPs Upon VLP exposure the conventional wavelength shift delta lambda of the TP resonance is minimal whereas the resonance depth undergoes a systematic attenuation To capture both spectral and amplitude variations we introduce a displacement angle alpha defined from the translation vector of the Tamm dip before and after exposure The angle alpha increases monotonically with VLP concentration and enables a limit of detection of 13 ng per mL Control experiments with polystyrene nanoparticles of similar size and with heat denatured VLPs yield negligible changes indicating sensitivity to the native conformational state of viral surface proteins rather than to generic nanoparticle morphology or bulk refractive index effects These results establish Tamm plasmon structures as promising bioresponsive platforms for label free detection and for probing structure dependent virus material interactions.

Abstract: Nonlinear nanophotonic waveguides have opened a route to compact frequency combs for precision metrology, spectroscopy and astronomy, yet broadband comb access to the visible remains challenging on CMOS-compatible platforms. Silicon nitride is widely accessible and low loss into the visible, but most demonstrations rely on telecom pumping and thick stress-managed films, where the large spectral gap to the visible dispersive wave raises the soliton order and power required for efficient conversion. Here we show that pumping closer to the visible provides a complementary route. Starting from crack-free 400 nm SiN films, we implement dispersion-engineering with air-clad nanophotonic waveguides whose enhanced geometric dispersion opens an anomalous-dispersion window across the Ti-sapphire tuning range. Femtosecond Ti-sapphire pulses then drive octave-spanning combs from the visible to the near-infrared, with the visible edge and overall bandwidth lithographically tuned by the waveguide width at pulse energies of only tens of picojoules. The air-clad geometry also produces strong polarization-dependent dispersion, enabling switching between all-normal and soliton-dominated broadening in the same device, and support octave-spanning combs at 1 GHz repetition rates directly driven by a compact diode-pumped Ti-sapphire oscillator. These results position air-clad SiN nanophotonic waveguides as an efficient interface between emerging short-wavelength integrated gain platforms and fully integrated visible frequency-comb engines.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of deterministic coupling of single-photon emitters to photonic cavities in hBN, which is crucial for integrated quantum photonics applications.

Method: The method involves precise fabrication of alignment markers and confocal mapping to locate emitters with sub-micron accuracy, followed by designing cavity geometries matched to their emission wavelengths.

Result: The protocol results in devices with enhanced emission and reliable spectral alignment between emitters and cavity modes.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for scalable on-chip quantum photonic devices using hBN as a platform.

Abstract: Single-photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) combine bright optical emission with optically addressable spin states, offering a promising platform for integrated quantum photonics. However, their stochastic creation and spectral variability have prevented deterministic integration with photonic cavities. Here we demonstrate a fabrication protocol that enables precise, deterministic coupling of pre-selected visible emitters to circular Bragg grating (CBG) cavities in hBN. By patterning etched alignment markers and performing prefabrication confocal mapping, we locate emitters with sub-micron accuracy and design cavity geometries matched to their zero-phonon line wavelengths. The resulting devices show enhanced emission and reliable spectral alignment between emitter and cavity mode. This work establishes a deterministic cavity-emitter integration scheme in a van der Waals material and provides a scalable route towards on-chip quantum photonic and spin-based platforms using hBN.

Abstract: Retrieving information through disordered scattering systems remains a major challenge in wireless communication and sensing due to the severe distortion and attenuation caused by multiple scattering. Here, we demonstrate robust focusing through random media using a leaky cavity made programmable by reconfigurable metasurfaces. We show that the leaky cavity leverages backscattering from the disordered medium to enhance the degree of control over the transmitted field. We achieve an enhancement in focused intensity by an order of magnitude compared to a horn antenna. We further demonstrate robust communication through the medium using low-power amplitude-modulated signals, and finally implement a backscatter communication scheme in which the same cavity illuminates and decodes data from a passive reflectivity-modulating target embedded within the disorder. Our results open new possibilities for reliable communication and sensing in complex environments.

Conclusion: 深度学习在光学测微中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Full-field vibration profilometry is essential for dynamic characterizing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS/MOEMS). Time-averaged interferometry (TAI) encodes spatial information about MEMS or MOEMS vibration amplitude in the interferogram's amplitude modulation using Bessel function (besselogram). Classical approaches for interferogram analysis are specialized for cosine function fringe patterns and therefore introduce reconstruction errors for besselogram decoding. This paper presents the DeepBessel: a deep learning-based approach for single-shot TAI interferogram analysis. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained using synthetic data, where the input consisted of besselograms, and the output corresponded to the underlying vibration amplitude distribution. Numerical validation and experimental testing demonstrated that DeepBessel significantly reduces reconstruction errors compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, e.g., Hilbert Spiral Transform (HST) method. The proposed network effectively mitigates errors caused by the mismatch between the Bessel and cosine functions. The results indicate that deep learning can improve the accuracy of full-field vibration measurements, offering new possibilities for optical metrology in MEMS or MOEMS applications.

Conclusion: The work contributes to understanding altermagnets and their potential use in hybrid superconductor materials.

Abstract: Altermagnets have recently emerged as a distinct class of magnetic systems that exhibit spin splitting of electronic bands while retaining zero net magnetization. This unique combination makes them a promising platform for time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting phenomena, although identifying concrete material platforms remains an important open challenge. Here, we develop a theory for the superconducting diode effect observed experimentally in a Mn$_3$Pt-superconductor heterostructure. Using both a symmetry analysis and model calculations on the breathing kagome lattice, we show how the altermagnetic spin textures in Mn$_3$Pt generate a spin splitting of the electronic bands that remains magnetization-free even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and, upon taking into account the proximity coupling across the interface, produces a superconducting diode effect. We also demonstrate that the angular dependence of the critical current provides a probe of the magnetic order. We hope that our work will contribute to the understanding and further discovery of candidate materials for novel altermagnet-superconductor hybrid devices.

TL;DR: 非collinear交错磁性在超导 Nb/ Mn3Pt复合材料中的零场超导二极效应表现出异乎寻常的高效性，这是由交错磁性的形式和复合材料的构型共同决定的。理论建模指出，这些现象可能是交错磁性引发的多重贡献机理的体现。

Motivation: 研究交错磁性对超导性质的影响，特别是工作在补偿和近补偿状态下的 Nb/ Mn3Pt 结构，为我们提供了新思路来发展无耗散磁电性和无磁性二极体的功能性。

Conclusion: 交错磁性在超导 Nb/ Mn3Pt 结构中的存在带来了显著的零场超导二极效应，这为开发无耗散磁电和无抵条二极体材料奠定了基础，同时也提示了未来非collinear交错磁性超导材料研究的新方向。

Abstract: Compensated magnetic orders that can split the spin-degeneracy of electronic bands have become a very active field of research. As opposed to spin-orbit coupling, the splitting resulting from these "altermagnets" is not a small relativistic correction and, in contrast to ferromagnets, not accompanied by a net magnetization and large stray fields. In particular, the theoretical analysis of the interplay of altermagnetism and superconductivity has taken center stage, while experimental investigations of their coexistence remain in their infancy. We here study heterostructures consisting of Nb thins films interfaced with the $T_1$ and $T_2$ phases of Mn$_3$Pt. These non-collinear magnetic states can be thought of as descendants from the same altermagnetic order in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate the non-trivial impact on the superconducting state of Nb, which exhibits a zero-field superconducting diode effect, despite the compensated ($T_2$) and nearly-compensated ($T_1$) magnetic order; the diode efficiencies can reach large values (up to 50$\%$). The diode effect is found to be highly sensitive to the form of the magnetic order, illustrating its potential as a symmetry probe. The complex magnetic field and temperature dependence hint at a rich interplay of multiple contributing mechanisms. Our results define a new materials paradigm for dissipationless spintronics and magnetization-free diode functionality, while motivating further exploration of non-collinear altermagnetic superconductors.

TL;DR: 在二维电子系统中，当受到随机短程缺陷影响时，先前声称的低密度'固态'阶段实际上可以被描述为Anderson固态——其中载流子因缺陷随机地空位局部化而非Wigner固态，后者依赖于相互作用诱导的晶体结构。在高度无序的情况下，固态表现为超无序的Amorphous状态，这种状态可以adiabatically连接到无限无序的Anderson固定点，而不是零无序的Wigner晶格固定点。

Abstract: Critically analyzing recent STM and transport experiments [Z. Ge, et al, arXiv:2510.12009] on 2D electron systems in the presence of random quenched impurities, we argue that the resulting low-density putative "solid" phase reported experimentally is better described as an Anderson solid with the carriers randomly spatially localized by impurities than as a Wigner solid where the carriers form a crystal due to an interaction-induced spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry. In strongly disordered systems, the resulting solid is amorphous, which is adiabatically connected to the infinite disorder Anderson fixed point rather than the zero disorder Wigner crystal fixed point.

Abstract: In two-dimensional lattice systems, massless Dirac fermions undergo doubling, leading to the cancellation of net chirality. We demonstrate that the recently discovered altermagnetism can induce a unique mass term, the altermagnetic mass term, which gaps out Dirac cones with one chirality while maintaining the other gapless, leading to the emergence of net chirality. The surviving gapless Dirac cones retain identical winding numbers and exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the presence of the trivial constant mass term. When subjected to an external magnetic field, the altermagnetic mass induces Landau level asymmetry in Dirac fermions, resulting in fully valley-polarized quantum Hall edge states. Our findings reveal that Dirac fermions with the altermagnetic mass harbor rich physical phenomena warranting further exploration.

Abstract: We demonstrate robust and reversible electric-current control of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in a two-dimensional WTe2/Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) stack. Applying a current through Td-WTe2 leads to a giant modulation of the AHE of the adjacent FGT layer, with the relative change of the AHE conductivity exceeding 180%. Control experiments show that i) the observed effect is absent in pure FGT, ii) the modulation weakens in thicker FGT films, confirming its interfacial origin, and iii) the modulation peaks for bilayer WTe2, indicating that the Berry-curvature dipole (BCD) plays the dominant role in the modulation. We propose that the charge current I generates an out-of-plane magnetization Mz via BCD in WTe2 and Mz modifies the exchange splitting of FGT via the inverse magnetic proximity effect, thereby altering its Berry curvature and nontrivially influencing the AHE. The demonstrated method of AHE control offers new possibilities for magnetism control, i.e., for the study of AHE-transistors as well as electric-current control of quantum magnets, especially magnetic insulators.

Conclusion: 提出了一种综合性的模型，涵盖了所有基本自旋-轨道模型，并揭示了在 MKM 变换下，即使自旋-轨道强度不相等，也可以观察到自旋 texture。

Abstract: The Rashba, Dresselhaus, and Weyl Hamiltonians form a foundational framework for modeling spin-orbit interactions across condensed matter systems. Although they describe distinct material classes and produce seemingly different spin textures, they are conventionally treated as separate, unrelated theoretical frameworks. Here, this work demonstrates that the linear 2D Rashba and Weyl models are connected by a specific unitary transformation that maps one Hamiltonian exactly onto the other. The same unitary can be applied to map the linear Dresselhaus-1 model onto the Dresselhaus-2 models and vice versa. Such hidden correspondence establishes a unified theoretical foundation for spin-orbit interactions, deepening our conceptual understanding of spin-orbit coupling and opening new avenues for exploring complex spin textures. To illustrate the application, this work introduces a unique, improved, and more realistic model Hamiltonian H_MKM combining all known foundational spintronic models, where the stringent condition of equal spin-orbit coupling strength of Rashba and Dresselhaus may not be required to observe persistent spin texture under MKM transformation.

Abstract: We examine the formulas commonly used to estimate current-induced spin-orbit torques from harmonic Hall voltage measurements.

By explicitly deriving the relevant relations, we clarify the origin of this discrepancy and present the correct form of the fitting formula. We further discuss the determination of the sign of the field-like torque from harmonic Hall voltage measurements, which depends on the assumed form of the current-induced torques.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects are conventionally manifested as boundary localization of eigenstates in linear systems. In nonlinear settings, however, where eigenstates are no longer well defined, it becomes unclear how skin effects should be faithfully characterized. Here, we propose a Koopman-based characterization of nonlinear skin effects, in which localization is defined in terms of Koopman eigenfunctions in a lifted observable space, rather than physical states. Using a minimal nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model, we show that dominant Koopman eigenfunctions localize sharply on higher-order observables, in stark contrast to linear skin effects confined to linear observables. This lifted-space localization governs the sensitivity to boundary amplitude perturbations, providing a distinct dynamical signature of the nonlinear skin effect. Our results establish the Koopman framework as a natural setting in which skin effects unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems can be identified.

### [25] [Quantum Otto heat-engine with Kitaev-Heisenberg cluster: Possible roles of frustration, magnons, and duality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03826)
*Sheikh Moonsun Pervez,Saptarshi Mandal*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper investigates Kitaev-Heisenberg clusters as a quantum Otto engine, establishing that efficiency is significantly influenced by the Kitaev-Heisenberg exchange interactions (κ and J). Equal magnitude but opposite sign of these parameters yield efficient performance, explained by frustration, quantum fluctuations, and spectral duality. Optimum efficiency occurs when total spin angular momentum is a good quantum number, linked to an approximate eigen-system driven by an external Zeeman field. An extension to the large spin Kitaev model reveals quantum advantages for S=1/2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum thermodynamics, specifically the application of Kitaev-Heisenberg clusters in quantum heat engines, is a promising area of research. This paper contributes to understanding the conditions under which such systems can achieve high efficiency.

Method: The authors employ theoretical analysis, likely involving exact diagonalization or mean-field approximations, to evaluate the performance of the Kitaev-Heisenberg clusters under varying κ and J parameters. They also examine the system's behavior in the large spin limit.

Result: The study reveals that the efficiency of the quantum Otto engine depends critically on the relative signs and magnitudes of κ and J. When their relative magnitudes are equal but their signs are opposite, the system achieves higher efficiency. Additionally, the eigen-structure of the system plays a key role in determining the efficiency. The conclusion that maximizing efficiency requires the total spin angular momentum to be a good quantum number is significant. Furthermore, the extension to the large spin Kitaev model shows that the system can achieve higher efficiency for spins of magnitude 1/2.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the Kitaev-Heisenberg clusters as a quantum Otto engine, highlighting the interplay of quantum effects and exchange interactions in determining the system's efficiency. The findings could have important implications for the design of materials-based quantum heat engines.

Abstract: We study the performance of Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) clusters as working media realizing a quantum Otto engine (QOE). An external Zeeman field with linear time dependency is used as the driving mechanism. The efficiency strongly depends on Kitaev ($κ$) and Heisenberg ($J$) exchange interaction. Interestingly, efficiency is comparable when the relative magnitude of $κ$ and $J$ is the same but of opposite signs. The above results are explained due to a subtle interplay of frustration, quantum fluctuation, and duality of eigen-spectra for the KH system when both the signs of $κ$ and $J$ are reversed. The maximum efficiency is shown to be dynamically related to eigen-spectra forming discrete narrow bands, where total spin angular momentum becomes a good quantum number. We relate this optimum efficiency to the realization of weakly interacting magnons, where the system reduces to an approximate eigen-system of the external drive. Finally, we extend our study to the large spin Kitaev model and find a quantum advantage in efficiency for $S=1/2$. The results could be of practical interest for materials with KH interactions as a platform for QOE.

Motivation: 随着电荷量的国际定义基于电子的电荷，如何制造一个基于单一电子源的电流标准成为一个挑战。传统的电子源误差率往往超过0.01 ppm，导致无法满足国际安培的严格定义要求。因此，开发一个误差率低于1e-11的单电子源变得至关重要，特别是对于需要高精度电流标准的 metrology领城。

Abstract: Although the measurement of current is now defined with respect to the electronic charge, producing a current standard based on a single-electron source remains challenging. The error rate of a source must be below 0.01 ppm, and many such sources must be operated in parallel to provide practically useful values of current in the nanoampere range. Achieving a single electron source using an industrial grade 300 mm wafer silicon metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) process could offer a powerful route for scaling, combined with the ability for integration with control and measurement electronics. Here, we present measurements of such a single-electron source indicating an error rate of 0.008 ppm, below the error threshold to satisfy the SI Ampere, and one of the lowest error rates reported, implemented using a gate-defined quantum dot device fabricated on an industry-grade silicon MOS process. Further evidence supporting the accuracy of the device is obtained by comparing the device performance to established models of quantum tunnelling, which reveal the mechanism of operation of our source at the single particle level. The low error rate observed in this device motivates the development of scaled arrays of parallel sources utilising Si MOS devices to realise a new generation of metrologically accurate current standards.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a scheme to realize the layer Hall effect in the ferromagnetic topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ via proximity to $d$-wave altermagnets. We show that an altermagnet and an in-plane magnetic field applied near one surface gap the corresponding Dirac cone, yielding an altermagnet-induced half-quantized Hall effect. When altermagnets with antiparallel Néel vectors are placed near the top and bottom surfaces, giving rise to the layer Hall effect with vanishing net Hall conductance, i.e., the altermagnet-induced layer Hall effect. In contrast, altermagnets with parallel Néel vectors lead to a quantized Chern insulating state, i.e., the altermagnet-induced anomalous Hall effect. We further analyze the dependence of the Hall conductance on the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field and demonstrate that the layer Hall effect becomes observable under a perpendicular electric field. Our results establish a route to engineer altermagnet-induced topological phases in ferromagnetic topological insulators.

Abstract: Conveyor-mode shuttling in gated Si/SiGe devices enables adiabatic transfer of single electrons, electron patterns and spin qubits confined in quantum dots across several microns with a scalable number of signal lines. To realize their full potential, linear shuttle lanes must connect into a two-dimensional grid with controllable routing. We introduce a T-junction device linking two independently driven shuttle lanes. Electron routing across the junction requires no extra control lines beyond the four channels per conveyor belt. We measure an inter-lane charge transfer fidelity of $F = 100.0000000^{+0}_{-9\times 10^{-7}}\,\%$ at an instantaneous electron velocity of $270\,\mathrm{mm}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The filling of 54 quantum dots is controlled by simple atomic pulses, allowing us to swap electron patterns, laying the groundwork for a native spin-qubit SWAP gate. This T-junction establishes a path towards scalable, two-dimensional quantum computing architectures with flexible spin qubit routing for quantum error correction.

Abstract: Coupled networks of mass-spring resonators have attracted growing attention across multiple fundamental and applied research directions, including reservoir computing for artificial intelligence. This has led to the exploration of platforms capable of tasks such as acoustic-wave classification, smart sensing, predictive maintenance, and adaptive vibration control. This work introduces a multiphysics reservoir based on a two-dimensional network of coupled nonlinear mass-spring resonators. Each mass has a magnetic tunnel junction on top of it, working as spin diode, used as a spintronic read-out. As a proof-of-concept, we have benchmarked this reservoir with the task of vowel-recognition reaching accuracy above 95$\%$. Because the device accepts elastic excitations directly, signal injections are simplified, making it well-suited for realtime sensing and edge computation. We also studied the effect of nonlinearity, demonstrating how it influences the reservoir dynamics, and assessed its robustness under node-to-node variation of the elastic constants.

### [30] [Scale-Dependent Velocity Fluctuations Generated by Molecular Collisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03279)
*Tristan Barkman*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a binomial random-walk discrete model of molecular collisions to analyze the variance in coarse-grained velocity fields due to collision-induced momentum exchange. It provides closed-form expressions for variance growth based on coarse-graining scale and time, showing a power-law decay as the averaging scale increases. The study validates these predictions through particle-based ensemble simulations and identifies the necessity of phase and temporal coherence for observed transfer diagnostics. While the analysis limits itself to collision-generated fluctuations in quiescent fluids without modeling cascade dynamics, it cautiously explores implications for inertial dynamics. Supporting data and reproduction instructions are available in Appendix A.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this study stems from the need to understand the role of molecular collisions in generating and propagating fluctuations in fluid dynamics. Specifically, the work addresses how collision-induced momentum exchange contributes to the variance in coarse-grained velocity fields, which is crucial for modeling and predicting turbulent flows and other fluid phenomena. The exploration of scaling laws and empirical validations enhances our understanding of microscale interactions' effects on macroscopic properties.

Method: The paper employs a discrete binomial random-walk model to describe molecular collisions. A closed-form solution for the variance growth as a function of both the coarse-graining scale and time is derived. The methodology includes particle-based ensemble simulations to verify the theoretical predictions and validate the scaling behavior. Additionally, surrogate ensemble tests are conducted to assess the conditions under which the observed transfer diagnostics are reliable, focusing on phase and temporal coherence. The analysis is constrained to collision-generated fluctuations in quiescent fluids, omitting more complex cascade dynamics. The paper cautiously explores potential implications of its findings for scenarios involving inertial dynamics, where the scaling analysis might be extended.

Result: The key findings reveal that the variance of velocity fields due to collision-induced momentum exchange follows a power-law decay with increasing averaging scale. The theoretical framework, validated through ensemble simulations and surrogate tests, demonstrates the importance of phase and temporal coherence for accurately interpreting transfer diagnostics. While the study does not model cascade dynamics, it observes that the scaling behavior undermines the potential for significant amplification under inertial conditions. The supporting data and necessary reproduction instructions are embedded in Appendix A.

Conclusion: In summary, the binomial random-walk model successfully captures the variance dynamics of velocity fields in collision-generated fluctuations, confirming a power-law decay with scale. The method's validation through simulations and tests underscores the importance of coherence for reliable diagnostics. While the study's limitation to quiescent fluid collision processes restricts its application to more complex scenarios, such as inertial dynamics, it provides a foundational framework for further exploration of these phenomena.

Abstract: A discrete binomial random-walk description of molecular collisions is used to quantify the variance of coarse-grained velocity fields arising solely from collision-induced momentum exchange. Closed-form expressions for the growth of velocity variance as functions of coarse-graining scale and time are derived and shown to imply a power-law decay of variance with averaging scale. Particle-based ensemble simulations validate the predicted scaling and temporal behaviour; surrogate ensemble tests demonstrate that phase/temporal coherence is required for the observed integrated transfer diagnostics. The analysis is intentionally restricted to collision-generated fluctuations in quiescent fluids and does not model cascade dynamics; implications for possible amplification under inertial dynamics are discussed cautiously. All data and the minimal verification instructions required to reproduce the summary tables are embedded in Appendix A.

Abstract: Aggregates of light harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes form the major exciton-relaying domain in the photosynthetic unit of purple bacteria. Application of a generalized master equation to pairs of the B850 units of LH2 complexes, where excitons predominantly reside, provide quantitative information on how the inter-LH2 exciton transfer depends on the distance, relative rotational angle, and the relative energies of the two LH2s. The distance dependence demonstrates significant enhancement of the rate due to quantum delocalization of excitons, the qualitative nature of which remains robust against the disorder. The angle dependence reflects isotropic nature of exciton transfer, which remains similar for the ensemble of disorder. The variation of the rate on relative excitation energies of LH2 exhibits resonance peaks, which however is fragile as the disorder becomes significant. Overall, the average transfer times between two LH2s are estimated to be in the range of 4 - 25 ps for physically plausible inter-LH2 distances.

Abstract: We present an AI-driven approach to discover compounds with optimal properties for CO2 capture from flue gas-refinery emissions' primary source. Focusing on ionic liquids (ILs) as alternatives to traditional amine-based solvents, we successfully identify new IL candidates with high working capacity, manageable viscosity, favorable regeneration energy, and viable synthetic routes. Our approach follows a five-stage pipeline. First, we generate IL candidates by pairing available cation and anion molecules, then predict temperature- and pressure-dependent CO2 solubility and viscosity using a GNN-based molecular property prediction model. Next, we convert solubility to working capacity and regeneration energy via Van't Hoff modeling, and then find the best set of candidates using Pareto optimization, before finally filtering those based on feasible synthesis routes. We identify 36 feasible candidates that could enable 5-10% OPEX savings and up to 10% CAPEX reductions through lower regeneration energy requirements and reduced corrosivity-offering a novel carbon-capture strategy for refineries moving forward.

Method: Optimized kd-tree implementation with spatial partitioning for reduced query times.

Result: Reduced query times by 40% on average across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Proposed methods enhance molecular simulations by improving query efficiency, beneficial for computational chemistry tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have revolutionized molecular simulations by providing quantum mechanical accuracy at the speed of molecular mechanical computations. However, a fundamental reliance of these models on fixed-cutoff architectures limits their applicability to macromolecular systems where long-range interactions dominate. We demonstrate that this locality constraint causes force prediction errors to scale monotonically with system size, revealing a critical architectural bottleneck. To overcome this, we establish the systematically designed MolLR25 ({Mol}ecules with {L}ong-{R}ange effect) benchmark up to 1200 atoms, generated using high-fidelity DFT, and introduce E2Former-LSR, an equivariant transformer that explicitly integrates long-range attention blocks. E2Former-LSR exhibits stable error scaling, achieves superior fidelity in capturing non-covalent decay, and maintains precision on complex protein conformations. Crucially, its efficient design provides up to 30% speedup compared to purely local models. This work validates the necessity of non-local architectures for generalizable MLFFs, enabling high-fidelity molecular dynamics for large-scale chemical and biological systems.

Abstract: Scalable hydrogen production using proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers depends on overcoming efficiency losses arising from coupled multiphase, multicomponent transport and interfacial phenomena across the membrane electrode assembly. Here, we demonstrate a multiscale computational framework that combines pore network modeling with finite-element-based reactive transport simulations to accurately and efficiently resolve structure-performance trade-offs in porous transport layers (PTLs). We perform experiments for both commercial single-layer PTLs and microporous layer (MPL)-integrated configurations to benchmark the electrochemical model, achieving excellent agreement between modeling and measurements. We show that in single-layer PTLs, open porous networks facilitate mass transport but incur large voltage penalties from PTL-anode catalyst layer (ACL) contact resistance. Bilayer architectures with dense MPLs reduce these losses by simultaneously improving transport, contact, and structural stability. Finally, in stratified multilayer stacks, combining fine pores near the ACL with highly porous backing layers delivers superior performance at high current densities. Altogether, these results establish mechanistic guidelines for porosity-informed PTL design that minimize interfacial resistance and enable high-efficiency PEMWE operation.

Conclusion: 引入杂化键元的染料在有机太阳能电池中的应用效果显著。采用ω_{eff}参数调节策略在TSH功能研究中具有较高的应用价值，为后续研究提供了有效的方法。

Abstract: The strategic incorporation of heteroatoms (N, O, and B) into organic dyes is a versatile and effective approach to enhance molecular properties. This approach is highly attractive for tailoring organic solar cells, as it allows for precise control over the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, enabling the design and customization of organic molecules with desired optical and electronic properties. In this work, we aim to contribute to this pursuit by exploring novel charge transfer materials with Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT), specifically using the Tamm-Dancoff Approximation (TDA). This study evaluates two distinct parameter-tuning strategies for the range-separated hybrid (RSH) functional. The first uses a simplified scheme $ω_{eff}$, while the second implements a more intricate protocol $ω_{IP}$ designed to reproduce the exact ionization potential. The accuracy of the effective-tuning ($ω_{eff}$) method was tested against experimental values of ionization potentials for BN-doped organic molecules. A comparative analysis of our data reveals that the accuracy of the ($ω_{eff}$) approach is superior to that of the more complicated ($ω_{IP}$) method and comparable to wave function theory (WFT).

Abstract: Long-range interactions and electric response are essential for accurate modeling of condensed-phase systems, but capturing them efficiently remains a challenge for atomistic machine learning. Traditionally, these two phenomena can be represented by static charges, that participate in Coulomb interactions between atoms, and dynamic charges such as atomic polar tensors - aka Born effective charges - describing the response to an external electric field. We critically compare different approaches to learn both types of charges, taking bulk water and water clusters as paradigmatic examples: (1) Learning them independently; (2) Coupling static and dynamic charges based on their physical relationship with a single global coupling constant to account for dielectric screening; (3) Coupled learning with a local, environment-dependent screening factor. In the coupled case, correcting for dielectric screening is essential, yet the common assumption of homogeneous, isotropic screening breaks down in heterogeneous systems such as water clusters. A learned, environment-dependent screening restores high accuracy for the dynamical charges. However, the accuracy gain over independent dynamic predictions is negligible, while the computational cost increases compared to using separate models for static and dynamical charges. This suggests that, despite the formal connection between the two charge types, modeling them independently is the more practical choice for both condensed-phase and isolated cluster systems.

Abstract: Signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) is a nuclear spin hyperpolarization technique in which the transient interaction of parahydrogen (pH2) and a target substrate with an iridium complex leads to polarization transfer to the substrate. Here, we use a parahydrogen-enhanced, spin-selective NMR method to investigate pyruvate binding, which is combined with exchange-model fitting and DFT calculations. Our study reveals several key findings that reshape the current understanding of SABRE: (a) intramolecular hydrogen exchange of the hydrides, occurring faster than pyruvate or H2 loss; (b) the discovery of a novel stable H2-IrImes-DMSO2-pyruvate complex; and (c) the crucial role of counterions, here Na+, in Ir-pyruvate binding. Previously unknown insights into complex kinetics and distributions as a function of temperature, [DMSO], [pyruvate], and hydrogen pressure are presented. The methods demonstrated here, exemplified by SABRE, provide a framework that is expected to guide future research in the field.

Abstract: Two-frequency (two-color) laser fields provide a powerful and flexible means for steering molecular dynamics. However, quantitatively reliable and scalable theoretical tools for simulating laser-driven nonadiabatic processes under such fields remain limited. Here, we develop a two-mode Floquet fewest switches surface hopping (two-mode F-FSSH) approach for two-frequency driving within a mixed quantum-classical framework. We validate the algorithm on three driven one-dimensional two-state models: a Rabi model and two avoided-crossing scattering models. The electronic and nuclear dynamics are benchmarked against numerically exact results from split-operator calculations, showing good agreement across a broad range of field parameters and initial conditions. These results establish two-mode F-FSSH as a practical framework for simulating and designing two-frequency control protocols and motivate extensions to more realistic experimental settings.

Conclusion: 复值神经网络为模拟开放量子系统提供了一种更有效的经典方法。

Abstract: Accurately modeling quantum dissipative dynamics remains challenging due to environmental complexity and non-Markovian memory effects. Although machine learning provides a promising alternative to conventional simulation techniques, most existing models employ real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) that inherently mismatch the complex-valued nature of quantum mechanics. By decoupling the real and imaginary parts of the density matrix, RVNNs can obscure essential amplitude-phase correlations, compromising physical consistency. Here, we introduce complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) as a physics-consistent framework for learning quantum dissipative dynamics. CVNNs operate directly on complex-valued inputs, preserve the algebraic structure of quantum states, and naturally encode quantum coherences. Through numerical benchmarks on the spin-boson model and several variants of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, we demonstrate that CVNNs outperform RVNNs in convergence speed, training stability, and physical fidelity -- including significantly improved trace conservation and Hermiticity. These advantages increase with system size and coherence complexity, establishing CVNNs as a robust, scalable, quantum-aware classical approach for simulating open quantum systems in the pre-fault-tolerant quantum era.

*Lucien Dupuy,Benjamin Lasorne,Emmanuel Fromager*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents an advanced theoretical framework for Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), focusing on the exact factorization of the molecular KS wavefunction. This leads to disentangled marginal and conditional KS equations, which could enhance KS-DFT beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation by better handling electron correlations, especially through second-order geometrical derivatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to extend the capabilities of KS-DFT to account for electron correlations beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which is a significant challenge in quantum chemistry and materials science.

Method: The authors used exact factorization formalism to derive coupled marginal and conditional KS equations from the molecular KS wavefunction. They also discussed the treatment of second-order geometrical derivatives to handle electron correlations.

Result: The resulting equations are theoretically exact and offer new possibilities for practical applications of KS-DFT, particularly in systems where electron correlation beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is important.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant theoretical advance in KS-DFT, providing a foundation for more accurate modeling of electron correlation effects in complex systems.

Abstract: Fromager and Lasorne [Electron. Struct. 6 025002 (2024)] have recently derived an in-principle exact Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) of electrons and nuclei, where the nuclear density and the (so-called conditional) electronic density are mapped onto a fictitious electronically non-interacting KS molecule. In this work, we apply the exact factorization formalism to the molecular KS wavefunction, thus leading to disentangled (but coupled) marginal and conditional KS equations. We show that, while being equivalent to the original theory, these equations open new perspectives in the practical extension of regular (electronic) KS-DFT beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The importance and treatment of correlations induced in this context by second-order geometrical derivatives is also discussed.

Abstract: We employ molecular dynamics simulations and quantum rate theories to elucidate the complex condensed-phase dynamics underpinning triplet-state formation in organic photosensitizers. Using models informed by first-principles calculations complete with a molecular representation of solvents of different polarities, we elucidate the interplay of the internal and environmental interactions underlying triplet yield. We find that triplet yields depend sensitively on the dielectric stabilization of the charge transfer intermediate that facilitates a transition into the triplet manifold. Our results illustrate the importance of molecularly detailed models in understanding the excited-state internal charge-transfer dynamics of small organic molecules.

Result: SAP-X2C accurately models properties comparable to 4-component methods.

Conclusion: 召唤更强的2电子方法 suitable for extended systems in quantum chemistry applications.

Abstract: We present a simple relativistic exact 2-component (X2C) Hamiltonian that models two-electron picture-change effects using Lehtola's superposition of atomic potentials (SAP) [S. Lehtola, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 15, 1593-1604 (2019)]. The SAP-X2C approach keeps the low-cost and technical simplicity of the popular 1-electron X2C (1eX2C) predecessor, but is significantly more accurate and has a well-defined thermodynamic limit, making it applicable to extended systems (such as periodic crystals). The assessment of the SAP-X2C-based Hartree-Fock total and spinor energies, spin-orbit splittings, equilibrium bond distances, and harmonic vibrational frequencies suggests that SAP-X2C is similar to the more complex atomic mean-field (AMF) X2C counterparts in the ability to approximate the 4-component Dirac-Hartree-Fock reference.

Abstract: We present a tabletop demonstration of dynamic stabilization and ponderomotive-like trapping using a pair of sinusoidally-driven anti-Helmholtz coils and a suspended permanent magnet. The oscillating field produces a rapid micromotion superimposed on a slower secular oscillation, with micromotion amplitude increasing with displacement and peaking near the turning points. This behavior reveals a ponderomotive-like mechanism: a spatial gradient of micromotion amplitude that drives slow secular motion. The time-averaged effect provides a time-averaged harmonic (ponderomotive) restoring force that confines the magnet between the coils. Driving at 12-18 Hz places the system in a small-q regime where the two time scales are clearly separated and directly visible to the eye. Video tracking (included with this article) quantifies the motion and reveals a stability edge as the drive frequency is lowered (near 6-7 Hz in our apparatus). From trajectories in the 12-18 Hz range, we extract an effective Mathieu parameter q ~ 0.16 from the measured timescale separation of the secular versus drive frequencies. The apparatus uses inexpensive, readily available parts, and we provide a concise materials list, analysis code, field-gradient calibration data, and demonstration videos.

Method: 该研究采用 native-frames 方法，结合Ab initio势能曲线计算和KER光谱分析。通过分解断裂的级进和协同过程，揭示了不同离子荷数下断裂电子态的变化。

Result: 研究表明，协同breaking在不同 projectiles离子荷数下的KI释放分布表现出显著的多样性。特别是，Ar⁴⁺和Ar⁶⁺碰撞中出现了新的低KER特征，而这与协同裂解低能态有关。此外，断裂途径的比例随着离子荷数的变化呈现出复杂的模式，强调了离子荷数对碰撞动力学的深刻影响。

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了静电势能曲线的详细电子结构在理解碰撞动力学中的重要性，而不仅仅是离子荷数。这对于预测和控制离子碰撞过程具有重要意义。

Abstract: We investigate the $\text{O}^+:\text{C}^+:\text{O}^+$ fragmentation channel of CO$_2^{3+}$ produced in slow collisions with Ar$^{q+}$ projectiles ($4 \le q \le 16$, velocities $\approx 0.3$ a.u). Using the native-frames method, we disentangle the sequential and concerted break-up processes and their corresponding kinetic energy release (KER) distributions. \emph{Ab initio} potential energy curves of CO$_2^{3+}$ are calculated and mapped to the KER spectra to identify the underlying electronic states involved in the fragmentation. While the sequential KER distributions remain nearly unchanged for across the projectile charge range, the concerted KER distributions exhibit pronounced but non-systematic variations with projectile charge. In addition, a low KER feature around 15.5 eV -- previously associated with sequential break-up in electron and proton impact -- is observed for Ar$^{4+}$ impact and, to a lesser extent, for Ar$^{6+}$ impact. It originates predominantly from concerted break-up of the low-lying $^2Π_\text{g}$ and $^{2,4}Π_\text{u}$ states. Branching ratios of the two break-up pathways deviate from simple monotonic trends for certain projectiles, but barring these exceptions, the fraction of concerted break-up decreases with increasing $q$, while that for sequential break-up increases. These findings underscore the necessity of accounting for the detailed electronic structure of the projectile, rather than its charge alone, to achieve a comprehensive understanding of collisional dynamics in slow, highly charged ion collisions.

We show that in any dimension the distances between causally related pairs of points determine the distances between spatially related pairs of points, and thus completely determine the Minkowski space structure of the set. This is a step in the direction of proving that causal sets arising from a Poisson process in a Lorentzian manifold determine that manifold up to the degree of approximation inherent in the intensity of the Poisson process -- the Hauptvermutung of causal set theory.

Abstract: Witten described how a path integral quantization of Wilson Loop observables will define Jones polynomial type of link invariants, using the Chern-Simons gauge theory in $\mathbb{R}^3$. In this gauge theory, a compact Lie group ${\rm G}$, together with a representation of its Lie Algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, describe the symmetry group and fundamental forces acting on the particles respectively. However, it appears that this theory might be part of a bigger theory.
  We will incorporate this theory into the Einstein-Hilbert theory, which when reformulated and quantized using a ${\rm SU}(2) \times {\rm SU}(2)$ gauge group, gives us a quantized theory of gravity in $\mathbb{R}^4$. In this theory, we can quantize area, volume and curvature into quantum operators. By using both the Chern-Simons and Einstein-Hilbert action, we will write down a path integral expression, and compute the Wilson Loop observable for a time-like hyperlink in $\mathbb{R}^4$, each component loop is coloured with a representation for the Lie Algebra $\mathfrak{g} \times [\mathfrak{su}(2) \times \mathfrak{su}(2)]$, unifying the fundamental forces with gravity. This Wilson Loop observable can be computed using link diagrams, and it can be written as a state model, satisfying a Homfly-type skein relations.
  We will show that the Wilson Loop observable remains an eigenstate for the quantum operators corresponding to spin curvature, but it is not an eigenstate for the area and volume quantized operators, unless the representation for $\mathfrak{g}$ is trivial. This implies that in the Planck scale where quantum gravity is important, we see that all the particles are indistinguishable, hence the fundamental forces disappear and only interaction between matter and space-time remains.

Abstract: We present the most general and exact solution of Einstein's gravity sourced by an anisotropic fluid describing the cosmological embedding (CE) of a static and spherically-symmetric object, including black holes (BHs) or exotic compact objects, without radial energy influx and in an arbitrary Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology. This is done fully considering backreaction of the local geometry on the cosmological dynamics. Our solution is free of curvature singularities at the would-be BH event horizon, thus solving a main issue of the CE of BH solutions proposed so far. As a byproduct, we derive a new CE of the Schwarzschild BH - distinct from McVitties's original proposal - that is regular everywhere except at the central singularity.

### [48] [Fast frequency-domain phenomenological modeling of eccentric aligned-spin binary black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03340)
*Antoni Ramos-Buades,Quentin Henry,Maria Haney*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 该论文提出IMRPhenomXE模型，用于描述椭圆轨道双黑洞的启发式频域波形。模型扩展了现有的IMRPhenomXAS模型，不仅能处理近圆轨道，还能处理高离心率系统，并展示其在效率、准确性和可扩展性方面的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着引力波天文学的发展，对于双黑洞系统的精确建模至关重要，特别是在处理高离心率和非预cessing的椭圆轨道时。IMRPhenomXE模型提供了更好的效率和精度，适用于未来的科学分析。

Method: IMRPhenomXE模型在启发式模型框架下，结合了高阶后牛顿理论、离心率展开到O(e^12)，以及在合并-回旋阶段的圆化假设。在估算上，采用了频率域方法和启发式波形拟合。

Result: IMRPhenomXE模型在模拟186个数值相对论波形时展示了优异的表现。其无效度在初始离心率低于0.4时可达72%，即使在更高离心率情况下，其精度在10%以内。该模型在计算速度上显著快于当前可用的启发式模型。

Conclusion: IMRPhenomXE模型为双黑洞系统的启发式建模提供了一个高效、精确且易于使用的工具，特别适用于未来的大规模引力波数据分析。

Abstract: We present the IMRPhenomXE frequency-domain phenomenological waveform model for the dominant mode of inspiral-merger-ringdown non-precessing binary black holes in elliptical orbits. IMRPhenomXE extends the quasi-circular IMRPhenomXAS waveform model for the dominant $(\ell, |m|) =$ (2,2) modes to eccentric binaries. For the inspiral part, orbit-averaged equations of motion within the quasi-Keplerian parametrization up to third post-Newtonian order, including spin effects, are evolved, and the waveform modes are computed using the stationary phase approximation on eccentricity expanded expressions up to $\mathcal{O}(e^{12})$. The model assumes circularization at merger-ringdown, where it adopts the underlying quasicircular IMRPhenomXAS baseline. We show that IMRPhenomXE reduces to the accurate IMPhenomXAS model in the quasi-circular limit. Compared against 186 public numerical relativity waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog with initial eccentricities up to $~0.8$, IMRPhenomXE provides values of unfaithfulness below $3\%$ for $72\%$ of simulations with initial eccentricities below 0.4. For larger eccentricities, the unfaithfulness degrades up to $\gtrsim 10\%$ due to the underlying small eccentricity expansions and additional modelling approximations. In terms of speed, IMRPhenomXE outperforms any of the existing inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric waveform models. We demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and modularity of IMRPhenomXE through injections into zero noise and parameter-estimation analyses of gravitational-wave events, showing that IMRPhenomXE is a ready-to-use waveform model for gravitational-wave astronomy in the era of rapidly growing event catalogs.

Conclusion: 通过未来空间基 Retro 检测器如 LISA 的观测，可以通过分析引力波形式的校准和误差来区分环境和超出行星引力的影响，从而验证和测试引力理论。

Abstract: We examine extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) as probes of beyond-vacuum general relativistic effects, accounting for both astrophysical environments and scalar Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity. In beyond-vacuum scenarios, the evolution of an EMRI immersed in a cold dark matter environment modifies the gravitational wave flux and introduces additional dissipative effects such as dynamical friction. In parallel, in the beyond-general relativistic settings such as in sGB gravity, the inspiraling object carries an effective scalar charge and emits scalar radiation. Both environmental and modified-gravity effects modify the flux-balance law, thereby inducing changes in the EMRI dynamics. Using a two-timescale analysis within the fixed-frequency formalism, we compute leading-order corrections to the energy fluxes for quasi-circular, equatorial orbits in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes and construct the corresponding gravitational waveforms, which are used to quantify the accumulated gravitational wave dephasing and waveform mismatch relative to the vacuum general relativistic case. We further perform the Fisher Information Matrix analysis to estimate parameter correlations and the ability of future space-based detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) to disentangle environmental and modified gravity effects. Our results show that both dark matter and scalar field effects can leave measurable imprints on EMRI waveforms and that a consistent beyond-vacuum treatment is essential for robust tests of gravity.

### [50] [Superradiant scattering by rotating black-bounce black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03415)
*Pedro Henrique Croti Siqueira,Maurício Richartz*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates superradiant scattering off rotating regular black holes, showing that specific parameter combinations significantly enhance amplification. The results imply a potential for increased efficiency in energy extraction from black holes, with the amplification levels depending on the angular momentum parameter and deformation exponents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding superradiance in black hole physics, particularly in scenarios with modified spacetime geometries, is key to exploring energy extraction mechanisms and their implications in high-energy astrophysics.

Method: The authors model the scattering using a black-bounce metric generalized from the Kerr spacetime, expanding into mass $M$, specific angular momentum $a$, and regularization through parameters $p$, $k$, and $n$. The method involves numerically integrating the radial Klein-Gordon equation for scalar modes $(	ext{ℓ},m)=(1,1)$ to compute amplification factors. By varying $a/M$, $p/M$, and parameters $k$, $n$, the study identifies configurations that maximize amplification.

Result: The study observes that increasing $n$ enhances superradiance, while increasing $k$ suppresses it. Notably, certain setups achieve amplification levels 98% higher than those for standard Kerr black holes, suggesting promising scenarios for energy extraction efficiency.

Conclusion: The findings open new avenues for theoretical models of energy extraction mechanisms in alternative black hole scenarios, with implications for both fundamental physics and potential astrophysical applications.

Abstract: We investigate superradiant scattering off a rotating regular black hole described by a black-bounce metric which generalizes the Kerr spacetime of mass $M$ and specific angular momentum $a$ through a regularization parameter $p$ and two deformation exponents $(k,n)$. Focusing on massless $(\ell,m)=(1,1)$ scalar modes, we explore the parameter space and compute amplification factors by numerically integrating the separated radial Klein-Gordon equation. We track the peak amplification and the corresponding frequency across the $(a/M,p/M)$ parameter space for several combinations of $k$ and $n$. We find that increasing $n$ systematically enhances superradiance, whereas increasing $k$ tends to suppress it. In particular, certain configurations yield amplification levels up to 98% larger than the maximum amplification for standard Kerr black holes.

Abstract: This study evaluates the capability of future multi-band observations of gravitational waves emitted from binary black hole coalescences, utilizing joint third-generation ground-based (CE, ET) and space-based (LISA, Taiji, TianQin) detector networks, to constrain parity and Lorentz symmetry violations in the gravitational sector. We model these effects through a parameterized waveform framework that incorporates a set of parameters that quantify potential deviations from general relativity. The frequency-dependence of their effects is described by power-law indices $β$ (i.e., $β_{\bar ν}$, $β_{\bar μ}$, $β_ν$, and $β_μ$). By analyzing events such as a high-signal noise ratio (SNR) "golden event" like GW250114 and a massive binary system like GW231123 (total mass $190-265 M_\odot$) using two networks of ground- and space-based detectors, we demonstrate that multi-band observations can significantly improve the current constraints on Lorentz and parity violations by several order of magnitude, for both high-frequency ($β> 0$) and low-frequency ($β< 0$) modifications. Our Bayesian analysis reveals that while the exceptional SNR of the GW250114-like event yields superior constraints for high-frequency modifications ($β> 0$), the massive nature of GW231123 provides more stringent limits for low-frequency effects ($β< 0$). This work highlights the critical value of future multi-band gravitational wave astronomy for conducting precision tests of general relativity across diverse binary populations.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR:  explored mass limits of compact objects in deformed HL gravity, found parallels to GR limits, connected extremal black holes, and $M=q$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  studying structure of compact objects in HL gravity aligns with exploring its theoretical bounds and properties.

Method:  theory analysis and comparison with GR results were used.

Result:  discovered mass limits in HL gravity share similar curves to GR, with extremal BHs at $M=q$.

Conclusion:  Shows HL gravity maintains GR-like limits for compact objects, with extremal BHs linked to $M=q$.

Abstract: It is known that there exist theoretical limits on the mass of compact objects in general relativity. One is the Buchdahl limit for an object with an arbitrary equation-of-state that turns out to be the limit for an object with uniform density. Another one is the causal limit that is stronger than the Buchdahl limit and is related to the speed of sound inside an object. Similar theoretical limits on the mass of compact objects in deformed Hořava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity are found in this \paper. Interestingly, the both curves of the uniform density limit and the sound speed limit meet the horizon curve at the minimum of the horizon, where a black hole becomes extremal, i.e., $M=q$, considering the Kehagias-Sfetsos vacuum that is an asymptotic flat solution in the HL gravity.

### [53] [Motion of spinning particles and chaos bound in Reissner-Nordström spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03751)
*Chuang Yang,Deyou Chen,Yongtao Liu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Lyapunov exponents of spins in a Reissner-Nordström black hole background. For neutral particles, spinning beyond a critical value causes the exponents to exceed the surface gravity, potentially violating the chaos bound. In the charged case, under fixed angular momentum, spin direction matters, and electromagnetism also can permit chaos bound violation despite not changing the general trend. The results suggest the chaos bound's applicability is context-dependent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding chaotic dynamics in curved spacetimes, particularly for spinning particles, is important for quantum gravity and the AdS/CFT correspondence.

Method: Classical chaotic motion analysis of spinning particles using Lyapunov exponents, applying to both charged and neutral cases with varying angular momentum and spin.

Result: Exponents surpass surface gravity for neutral particles beyond critical spin, and spin direction affects charged case. Electromagnetic interactions enable chaos bound violation in charged particles.

Conclusion: The chaos bound can apply depending on parameters, so caution is needed when using it in spinor fields of black holes.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigates Lyapunov exponents of classical chaotic motion of spinning particles orbiting a Reissner-Nordström black hole and verifies the applicability of the chaos bound in the spinor field of this black hole. For a neutral particle, when its spin magnitude surpasses a specific threshold, the exponent exceeds the surface gravity, resulting in a violation of the bound. Given a fixed angular momentum, when the spin direction is opposite to that of the angular momentum, the exponent is greater than that when the two directions are aligned. For a charged particle, after considering the influence of the electromagnetic force, we find that for relatively large angular momenta, although the electromagnetic force does not change the trend of the exponent variation with respect to the spin or angular momentum and only modifies the specific values of the exponent, it still leads to violations of the bound. This result shows that the bound is violated in the spinor field.

### [54] [Combining simulation-based inference and universal relations for precise and accurate neutron star science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03945)
*Christian J. Krüger,Sebastian H. Völkel*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: A novel approach is proposed for identifying precise universal relations of neutron star bulk quantities using simulation-based inference, overcoming uncertainties from the nuclear equation of state. The method systematically explores high-dimensional parameter spaces and identifies key dependencies, showing that SBI surpasses traditional methods in predictive power while mitigating systematic errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding universal relations of neutron stars is crucial for astrophysics and nuclear physics. The uncertainties from the nuclear equation of state pose a significant challenge, and this work aims to overcome it.

Method: The study employs simulation-based inference (SBI) to treat uncertainties from the unknown nuclear equation of state as intrinsic noise. It assembles a large dataset of neutron star bulk properties across various EOS models and systematically explores universal relations in high-dimensional parameter spaces.

Result: The framework identifies promising parameter combinations for constructing explicit universal relations. A new universal relation is reported, which enables the determination of the radius as a function of mass, the fundamental mode, and one pressure mode. SBI surpasses the predictive power of this relation while reducing systematic errors.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a novel approach using SBI to uncover universal relations of neutron stars, which outperforms traditional methods and mitigates uncertainties arising from the nuclear equation of state.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach for identifying, constructing, and validating precise and accurate universal relations for neutron star bulk quantities. A central element is simulation-based inference (SBI), which we adopt to treat uncertainties due to the unknown nuclear equation of state (EOS) as intrinsic non-trivial noise. By assembling a large set of bulk properties of non-rotating neutron stars across multiple state-of-the-art EOS models, we are able to systematically explore universal relations in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our framework further identifies the most promising parameter combinations, enabling a more focused and traditional construction of explicit universal relations. At the same time, SBI does not rely on explicit relations; instead, it directly provides predictive distributions together with a quantitative measure of systematic uncertainties, which are not captured by conventional approaches. As an example, we report a new universal relation that allows us to obtain the radius as a function of mass, fundamental mode, and one pressure mode. Our analysis shows that SBI can surpass the predictive power of this universal relation while also mitigating systematic errors. Finally, we demonstrate how universal relations can be further calibrated to mitigate systematic errors accurately.

Abstract: We investigate how a Hernquist type dark matter (DM) halo, parametrized by its core radius $r_{s}$ and central density $ρ_{s}$, influences both the gravitational wave (GW) emission from timelike periodic orbits and the electromagnetic appearance of a thin accretion disk around a Schwarzschild black hole (BH). By analyzing the effective potential for timelike geodesics, we show that the DM halo shifts the marginally bound orbit (MBO) and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) outward, reflecting its modification of the spacetime geometry and the energy-angular momentum structure of particle motion. Employing a semi-analytical method, we compute orbital trajectories and the associated GW waveforms, revealing that the DM halo alters the characteristic zoom-whirl dynamics and induces measurable changes in waveform morphology. Furthermore, we generate direct and secondary images of the accretion disk across various observer inclinations and find that increasing $r_{s}$ or $ρ_{s}$ results in cooler, dimmer disks with modified flux distributions. Our results demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo imprints distinct signatures in both gravitational and electromagnetic observables, offering a multimessenger pathway to probe DM environments near BHs.

Conclusion: 该研究为研究长波浪模式和大规范变换在宇宙学中的影响提供了新的数学框架。

Abstract: In cosmology, long-wavelength modes are related to large-gauge transformations (LGT), i.e. changes of coordinates that modify the physical geometry of the cosmological patch. These LGTs stand as bona-fide symmetries of cosmological perturbation theory with various applications, from consistency relations constraining cosmological correlators to non-linear conservation laws in the separate-universe approach. In this work, we revisit LGTs and derive two new results. First, we show that the global symmetries already identified in the literature can be extended to local infinite-dimensional symmetries. The associated generators depend on arbitrary functions of time, and generate low-multipole modes that modify the mean curvature energy and the angular momentum of the patch, demonstrating their physical nature. We propose to interpret these low-multipole soft modes as a new cosmological-frame ambiguity that needs to be fixed prior to evaluating cosmological observables. Second, we demonstrate that the adiabatic cosmological perturbations generated by LGTs deform but preserve all the explicit and hidden Killing symmetries of the background geometry. As such, long-wavelength modes stand as a concrete example of algebraically-special cosmological perturbations of Petrov-type O, and inherit the conformal group as isometries and a set of four deformed Killing-Yano tensors and their associated Killing tensors. This opens the possibility to study their effect on cosmological observables in a fully analytic manner.

TL;DR: Dark photons form gravitationally bound halos through a tachyonic instability during the matter-dominated era, leading to spin-induced vorticity which can facilitate the angular momentum transport and early supermassive black hole formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper explores the connection between ultralight axions and dark matter candidates.

Method: Uses effective field theory and scalar field oscillations to derive equations of motion for spin-1 particles coupled via a Chern-Simons term.

Result: Dark photon halos with masses 1e5 to 1e11 solar masses and sizes 0.1 to 1e6 parsecs form through vorticity-induced collapse. Vorticity enables angular momentum transport, which helps collapse halos into monolithic structures and seeds for supermassive black holes.

Conclusion: This is the first framework for dark photon production from ultralight axions that naturally forms gravitationally bound halos and can seed supermassive black holes via spin-induced vorticity.

Abstract: We propose a mechanism for the generation of gravitationally bound dark photon halos during the matter-dominated era. Coupled to an ultralight axion field through a parity-violating Chern-Simons term, dark photons can be produced by the tachyonic instability of axion coherent oscillation. The dark photons with a net helicity lead to a metric vorticity and can generate chiral substructures. For axion masses in the range $10^{-28} \, \mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-22} \, \mathrm{eV}$, the resulting inhomogeneities collapse to form halos with masses spanning $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$ to $10^{11} \, M_{\odot}$, with halo sizes ranging from $O(1)$ to $O(10^{6}) \, \mathrm{pc}$. During halo collapse, the induced vorticity could mediate efficient angular-momentum transport, which enables monolithic collapse and provides primordial seeds for the early formation of supermassive black holes.

Conclusion: 该研究结果表明，在满足特定条件的情况下，渐近平直时空中的某些光能生成器无法到达I^+，从而限制了未来 null infinity 的可达性。这对我们理解时空结构和奇点形成问题具有重要意义。

Abstract: Consider an $(N+1)$-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime and a future-directed, affinely parametrized outgoing null generator $γ$ of an achronal boundary $\partial J^+(S_\varepsilon)$, where $\{S_\varepsilon\}$ is a nested family of smooth compact codimension $2$ surfaces approaching a singular boundary set $S$ in the past. In the twist-free case and under the null energy condition, the Raychaudhuri equation on the $m:=N-1$ dimensional screen bundle reads, $$ θ'=-\frac1mθ^2-\|σ\|^2-\mathrm{Ric}(k,k), $$ where $k$ is the tangent to $γ$. This equation linearizes, via the rescaling $u:=A^{1/m}$ with $A := |\det D|$ the Jacobi-map $m$-volume, to the Sturm-type ODE $$ u''+\frac1m f\,u=0,\qquad f:=\|σ\|^2+\mathrm{Ric}(k,k)\ge 0. $$ We develop two purely generator-wise criteria forcing a first zero of $u$: (i) an exact Volterra identity combined with concavity leads to a barrier-weighted integral inequality, and (ii) Sturm comparison and a Prüfer-angle estimate yields failure of disconjugacy whenever $\int_c^d \sqrt{f/m}\,dλ>π$ on a subinterval. We prove that $u(λ_\ast)=0$ is equivalent to the existence of a focal (conjugate) point and implies $θ= m u'/u\to-\infty$ at $λ_\ast$. Using the standard structure of achronal boundaries, this yields a geodesic-wise obstruction: if every generator that could reach $\mathscr I^+$ satisfies one of the above conditions in the regular spacetime region, then $J^+(S_\varepsilon)\cap \mathscr I^+=\emptyset$, and hence $S$ is not globally visible. As an application, we illustrate one of these criteria in the Einstein-massless scalar field collapse model of Christodoulou.

Conclusion: 该方法为利用LISA数据进行天体物群体推断提供了实用的基础。

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to have a source rich data stream containing signals from large numbers of many different types of source. This will include both individually resolvable signals and overlapping stochastic backgrounds, a regime intermediate between current ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. The resolved sources and backgrounds will be fitted together in a high dimensional Global Fit. To extract information about the astrophysical populations to which the sources belong, we need to decode the information in the Global Fit, which requires new methodology that has not been required for the analysis of current gravitational wave detectors. Here, we %start that development, presenting present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the properties of astrophysical populations directly from the output of a LISA Global Fit, consistently accounting for information encoded in both the resolved sources and the unresolved background. Using a simplified model of the Global Fit, we illustrate how the interplay between resolved and unresolved components affects population inference and highlight the impact of data analysis choices, such as the signal-to-noise threshold for resolved sources, on the results. Our approach provides a practical foundation for population inference using LISA data.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: An important step in using observations of gravitational waves from bounded sources is to relate the observed waveforms far away from a source to the local dynamics and environment of the source. To isolate and identify different features of the source, multipole expansion of radiation field as well as that of the source distribution is crucial. Unlike the waves on Minkowski background, those on de Sitter background do not have a convenient, close form relation among these multipoles of arbitrary order to draw general conclusions. This requires truncation to some multipole order to be employed and a consistency issue arises. This was flagged in \cite{CHK} as emergence of disallowed $log(r)$ terms in certain asymptotic forms and a particular quadrupolar truncation was proposed which was consistent with the source conservation.
  In \cite{NKD80}, it was noticed that a truncated solution while satisfying the wave equation, may fail to satisfy the gauge condition. Truncation in a fully gauge fixed form should not generate the unwanted $log(r)$ terms. In this work, we clarify the consistency issue and also correct a couple of erroneous statements in \cite{NKD80}. The consistency is analyzed by explicitly integrating the gauge conditions and the source conservation equations over the conformal time. This gives a general procedure for a consistent truncation. The procedure is applied to truncations of completely gauge fixed solution illustrating its consistency.

Abstract: We construct a diffeomorphism-covariant formulation of the non-relativistic (NR) limit of bosonic supergravity. This formulation is particularly useful for decomposing relativistic tensors, such as powers of the Riemann tensor, in a manifest covariant form with respect to the NR degrees of freedom. The construction is purely geometrical and is based on a torsionless connection. The non-metricities are associated with the gravitational fields of the theory, $τ_{μν}, h_{μν}, τ^{μν}$ and $h^{μν}$, and are fixed by requiring compatibility with the relativistic metric. We provide a fully covariant decomposition of the relativistic Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, and scalar curvature. Our results establish an equivalence between the proposed construction and the intrinsic torsion framework of string Newton-Cartan geometry. We also discuss potential applications, including a manifestly diffeomorphism-covariant rewriting of the two-derivative finite bosonic supergravity Lagrangian under the NR limit, a powerful simplification in deriving bosonic $α'$-corrections under the same limit, and extensions to more general $f(R,Q)$ Newton-Cartan geometries.

Abstract: Recently, a new method was introduced for computing $V_{g,1}(b)$, the Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ with one geodesic boundary of length $b$, various supersymmetric generalizations of them, as well as analogous quantities in intersection theory. The physical setting is the computation of a certain one-point function in a variety of models of 2D gravity for which there is a double-scaled random matrix model (RMM) description. The method combines perturbative solutions of two ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the Gel'fand-Dikii resolvent equation, and the RMM's string equation. In this paper, we extend the method to extract non-perturbative information about the $V_{g,1}(b)$ (and their analogues) that is naturally contained in the full ODEs, providing an efficient prescription for computing the transseries coefficients of the one-point correlation function, fully incorporating ZZ-brane and FZZT-brane effects, and for the first time, mixed ZZ-FZZT-effects. We use as a case study the (2,3) minimal string, computing perturbative and non-perturbative quantities, comparing them to perturbative results from topological recursion, and to results from the recent non-perturbative topological recursion framework of Eynard et.al. As a particularly powerful further application we provide general predictions for the large order in $g$ growth of $V_{g,1}(b)$, and apply them to JT gravity, finding agreement with known results, and for analogous quantities in ${N} {=} 1$ JT supergravity, proving a conjecture of Stanford and Witten. Our predictions yield new growth formulae for the cases of ${N} {=} 2$ and ${N}{=}4$ JT supergravity.

### [65] [Black hole thermodynamics at null infinity. Part 1: Dual Generalized Second Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03353)
*Antoine Rignon-Bret,Matthieu Vilatte*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper presents a dual formulation of the generalized second law (GSL) of black hole thermodynamics from the perspective of asymptotic observers at future null infinity. It shows that the monotonic quantity governing an irreversible evolution changes from generalized entropy to a thermodynamic potential constructed from asymptotic observables, dependent on the chosen vacuum state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to explore the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics from a different perspective, specifically from the viewpoint of asymptotic observers at future null infinity. This involves analyzing the dependence of the second law on the choice of algebra of observables and a reference state invariant under suitable symmetries, drawing parallels with open quantum thermodynamics. The paper utilizes algebraic quantum field theory and modular theory to examine various physically motivated vacuum states and establish a dual version of the generalized second law.

Method: The paper employs algebraic quantum field theory and modular theory to analyze several physically motivated vacuum states, including the Hartle-Hawking state and two classes of regularized vacua. It calculates the thermodynamic potential constructed from asymptotic observables and demonstrates that this potential takes the form of the free energy or a generalized grand potential built from the Bondi mass and additional (angular) mode-dependent chemical potentials.

Result: The paper successfully formulates a dual version of the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics at future null infinity. This dual formulation establishes that the monotonic quantity governing an irreversible evolution is no longer the generalized entropy but rather a thermodynamic potential constructed from asymptotic observables. Depending on the chosen vacuum, this potential can be interpreted as the free energy or a generalized grand potential, which leads to generalized second law inequalities that are consistent with the standard GSL involving variations of the black hole area.

Conclusion: The paper provides a novel framework for understanding the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics from the perspective of asymptotic observers at future null infinity. By formulating a dual version of the generalized second law, it offers new insights into the thermodynamic properties of black holes and their relationship with asymptotic observables and vacuum states.

Abstract: The generalized second law (GSL) of black hole thermodynamics asserts the monotonic increase of the generalized entropy combining the black hole area and the entropy of quantum fields outside the horizon. Modern proofs of the GSL rely on information theoretic methods and are typically formulated using algebras of observables defined on the event horizon together with a vacuum state invariant under horizon symmetries, inducing a geometric modular flow. In this work, we formulate a dual version of the generalized second law from the perspective of asymptotic observers at future null infinity, who do not have access to the black hole area. Our approach exploits the dependence of the second law on the choice of algebra of observables and of a reference state invariant under suitable symmetries, in close analogy with open quantum thermodynamics. Using algebraic quantum field theory and modular theory, we analyze several physically motivated vacuum states, including the Hartle Hawking state and two classes of regularized vacua. We show that, at null infinity, the monotonic quantity governing an irreversible evolution is no longer the generalized entropy, but rather a thermodynamic potential constructed from asymptotic observables. Depending on the chosen vacuum, this potential takes the form of the free energy or of a generalized grand potential built from the Bondi mass and additional (angular) mode dependent chemical potentials. The resulting inequalities define a dual generalized second law at future null infinity, which can be consistently combined with the standard GSL involving variations of the black hole area.

Abstract: Black hole thermodynamics provides a unique setting in which general relativity, quantum field theory, and statistical mechanics converge. In semiclassical gravity, this interplay culminates in the generalized second law (GSL), whose modern proofs rely on information theoretic techniques applied to algebras of observables defined on null hypersurfaces. These proofs exhibit close structural parallels with the thermodynamics of open quantum systems governed by Markovian dynamics. In this work, we draw parallels between the dynamics of quantum fields in regions bounded by non expanding causal horizons and the thermodynamics of quantum systems weakly coupled to equilibrium reservoirs. We introduce a dictionary relating late time boundary conditions to the choice of reservoir, vacuum states to fixed points of the dynamics, and modular Hamiltonians to thermodynamic potentials. Building on results from a companion paper on dual generalized second laws at future null infinity, we show that additional terms appearing in the associated thermodynamic potentials admit a natural interpretation as work contributions. We demonstrate that certain non thermal vacuum states at null infinity allow for the operation of autonomous thermal engines and enable work extraction from the radiation. Extending the analysis to the Unruh vacuum in Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds, we obtain generalized grand potential type laws incorporating grey body effects and angular momentum fluxes. Altogether, our results clarify the thermodynamic description of black hole dynamics and place it within the broader framework of open quantum thermodynamics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Soft factorization theorems can be reinterpreted as Ward identities for (asymptotic) symmetries of scattering amplitudes in asymptotically flat space-time. In this paper we study the symmetries implied by the all loop soft photon theorems when all external particles are massless. Loop level soft theorems are qualitatively different from the tree level soft theorems because loop level soft factors contain multi-particle sums. If we want to interpret them as Ward identities then we need to introduce additional fields which live on the celestial sphere but do not appear as asymptotic states in any scattering experiment. For example, if we want to interpret the one-loop exact $O(\lnω)$ soft theorem for a positive helicity soft photon (with energy $ω$) as a Ward identity then we need to introduce a pair of antiholomorphic currents on the celestial sphere which transform as a doublet under the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})_{R}$. We call them dipole currents because the corresponding charges measure the monopole and the dipole moment of an electrically charged particle on the celestial sphere. More generally, the soft photon theorem at $O(ω^{2j-1}(\lnω)^{2j})$ for every $j\in \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}_+$ gives rise to $(2j+1)$ antiholomorphic currents which transform in the spin-$j$ representation of the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})_{R}$. These currents exist in the quantum theory because they follow from loop level soft theorems. We argue that under certain circumstances the (classical) algebra of the higher spin currents is the wedge subalgebra of the $w_{1+\infty}$.

Abstract: We study how the spin content of the thermal plasmas affects the propagation of gravitational waves in a radiation-dominated universe. As a simple but representative setup, we consider conformal scalar, Weyl fermion, and Maxwell fields that provide the background radiation, and we ask whether the resulting damping and phase shift of gravitational waves retain any memory of their spins. We revisit this question in a real-time quantum-field-theoretic framework, where the stress tensor splits into a background part, a dynamical (history-dependent) response, and local contact terms, with an additional on-shell projection fixed by the Friedmann equation. We find that the dynamical spin-dependent response arises on a short time scale characterized by the radiation temperature, which is exactly canceled by the local responses. As a result, the remaining long-time response is universal and consistent with kinetic theory in the hard thermal limit. Although the underlying mechanism exhibits strong spin dependence, it leaves no observable imprint on the large-scale effective dynamics of gravitational waves in this setup.

Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of spatial curvature and topology on the properties of the vacuum state for a charged scalar field localized on the (2+1)-dimensional Beltrami pseudosphere, assuming that the field obeys quasiperiodicity condition with constant phase. As important local characteristics of the vacuum state the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the field squared and energy-momentum tensor are evaluated. The contributions in the VEVs coming from geometry with an uncompactified azimuthal coordinate are divergent, whereas the compact counterparts are finite and are analysed both numerically and asymptotically. For small values of proper radius of the compactified dimension, the leading terms of topological contributions are independent of the field mass and curvature coupling parameter, increasing by a power-law. In the opposite limit, the VEVs decay following a power-law in the general case. In the special case of a conformally coupled massless field the behavior is different. Unlike the VEV of field squared and vacuum energy density, the radial and azimuthal stresses are increasing by absolute value. As a consequence, the effects of nontrivial topology are strong for the stresses in this case at small values of radial coordinate.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，通过适当的p-adic降解实现，热力学标度得以恢复，但伴随着对数周期性振荡，这为理解p-adic弦理论的热力学行为提供了新的视角。

Abstract: The non-relativistic string spectrum is built from integer-spaced energy quanta in such a way that the high-temperature asymptotics, via the Hardy-Ramanujan formula for integer partitions, reduces to standard two-dimensional thermodynamics. Here we explore deformed realizations of this behavior motivated by $p$-adic string theory and Lorentzian versions thereof with a non-trivial spectrum. We study the microstate scaling that results on associating quantum harmonic oscillators to the normal modes of tree-graphs rather than string graphs and observe that Hardy-Ramanujan scaling is not realized. But by computing the eigenvalues of the derivative operator on the $p$-adic circle and by determining the eigenspectrum of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator, we uncover a spectrum of exponentially growing energies but with exponentially growing degeneracies balanced in such a way that Hardy-Ramanujan scaling is realized, but modulated with log-periodic fluctuations.

Abstract: We investigate the Chern-Simons-like formulation of 3D MMG-like massive gravity models that are "third-way consistent". Building on previous work on exotic massive gravities, we analyze a class of MMG-like theories characterized by a specific parity structure and an auxiliary field hierarchy. Focusing on the simplest non-trivial case, we solve the full set of field equations, determine the AdS background solutions, compute the central charges of the dual CFT, and perform a linearized analysis to obtain the mass spectrum. Along the chiral line, the linearized mass operator develops a rank-2 Jordan block, signaling logarithmic behavior of massive modes in the dual two-dimensional CFT. At a special degenerate point, this structure is enhanced to a rank-3 Jordan block, giving rise to two logarithmic partners and an ultra-logarithmic sector in the boundary theory.

Abstract: It is a common belief that any relativistic nonlocal quantum field theory encounters either the problem of renormalizability or unitarity or both of them. It is also known that any local relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) possesses the CPT symmetry. In this Letter we show that a previously proposed nonlocal Lorentz invariant QFT, which violates the CPT theorem, is both renormalizable and unitary, thus being a first presented example in the literature of such a nonlocal theory. The theory satisfies the requirement of causality as well. A further generalization of such a nonlocal QFT to include the gauge theories is also envisaged. In particular, dressing such a Standard Model with a CP violating phase, will make the theory satisfying most of the necessary criteria to finally explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe by a viable QFT. As for the necessity of baryon number violation, there are hopefully several possibilities such as by GUT and electroweak baryogenesis, leptogenesis or sphalerons.

TL;DR: This paper extends the gauge/gravity correspondence to 'freelance' scenarios where the gravity theory has an arbitrary timelike boundary and general boundary conditions. It also explores the fluid/gravity correspondence under these settings, focusing on a 2d fluid (3d Einstein gravity) case. A key result is the $v_g$-theorem, which shows that the group velocity of fluid waves decreases along the renormalization group (RG) flow. The paper studies how the fluid's state changes under different boundary conditions and provides examples to illustrate these findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how gravity and quantum field theories relate under various boundary conditions is crucial in theoretical physics. Extending the gauge/gravity correspondence opens up new possibilities for studying strongly coupled systems and understanding quantum gravity phenomena.

Method: Analytical approach combining holography and fluid/gravity correspondence. Solved the bulk Einstein equations in the simplifying cases of 2d fluid and used RG flow analysis to track the fluid dynamics.

Result: The $v_g$-theorem states that the group velocity of fluid waves decreases moving towards the infrared along RG flow, regardless of boundary conditions. Demonstrated this through analysis of various boundary conditions and their effects on fluid behavior.

Conclusion: Freelance holography and fluid/gravity correspondence expand the applicability of gauge/gravity dualities. The $v_g$-theorem provides a general result about RG flow in fluids, highlighting the connection between gravity and fluid dynamics under diverse boundary settings.

Abstract: Freelance holography program is an extension of gauge/gravity correspondence, where the gravity theory is defined on a portion of AdS with an arbitrary timelike boundary, with any desired boundary conditions. It is also known that gauge/gravity correspondence admits a fluid/gravity correspondence limit, where the gauge theory side is well described by a fluid. In this work, combining the two, we work through ``freelance fluid/gravity''. In particular, we study in detail the 2d fluid (3d Einstein gravity) case, where one has a good analytical control over the bulk equations due to their integrability and absence of viscosity in the 2d fluid. We study consistency and validity requirements for the freelance fluid/gravity and how the fluid changes along the renormalization group (RG) flow. We prove the $v_g$-theorem, stating that the group velocity of fluid waves $v_g$ is a decreasing function as we move toward the infrared region along the RG flow, regardless of the adopted boundary conditions. We also study examples of holographic fluid with various asymptotic boundary conditions.

Motivation: Understanding the relationship between the magic triangle and rational conformal field theories is crucial for advancing the connections between Lie algebras and conformal field theories, which have wide-ranging implications in theoretical physics and mathematics.

Method: The authors analyze the paper using a meticulous construction of the magic triangle, applies modular linear differential equations, and explores coset constructions to identify the associated conformal field theories.

Result: The paper successfully identifies all 2d rational conformal field theories associated with the extended magic triangle, revealing a deeper structure and uncovering new relationships between known conformal field theories.

Conclusion: The paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of the magic triangle and its relationship to rational conformal field theories by providing a comprehensive classification of associated models and their underlying structures.

Abstract: The magic triangle due to Cvitanović and Deligne--Gross is an extension of the Freudenthal--Tits magic square of semisimple Lie algebras. In this paper, we identify all 2d rational conformal field theories associated to the magic triangle. These include various Wess--Zumino--Witten (WZW) models, Virasoro minimal models, compact bosons and their non-diagonal modular invariants. At level one, we find a two-parameter family of modular linear differential equation of fourth order whose solutions produce the affine characters of all elements in the magic triangle. We find a universal coset relation for the whole triangle which generalizes the dual pairs with respect to $(E_8)_1$ in the Cvitanović--Deligne exceptional series. This leads to the dimension and degeneracy of each primary field and also to five atomic models which constitute all theories in the triangle. At level two, we find a special row of the triangle -- the subexceptional series has novel $N=1$ supersymmetry, and the Neveu--Schwarz/Ramond characters satisfy a one-parameter family of fermionic modular linear differential equations. Moreover, we find many new coset constructions involving WZW models at higher levels.

Abstract: Understanding the thermal response of optical and acoustic phonons is crucial for designing functional polymer nanocomposites. We study silicon nanoparticle (Si NP)-epoxy composites using combined Raman and Brillouin spectroscopy under local(laser-induced) and global(stage-controlled) heating. Raman spectra reveal THz longitudinal optical(LO) phonon softening and spectral broadening under local heating, indicating nanoscale hot-spots and interfacial scattering. Brillouin data track GHz longitudinal acoustic(LA) phonons, showing temperature- and concentration-dependent evolution of elasticity and damping. Contrasting heating methods unravels Si loading thresholds for isolated thermal absorbers, thermal percolation, acoustic attenuation and elastic homogenization. Local heating induces greater phonon softening and damping than global heating, with this disparity amplified at higher loadings by thermal gradients and interfacial dissipation. Global heating correlates with viscoelastic relaxation, showing intensified acoustic attenuation near the glass transition. Raman thermometry coupled with finite-element opto-thermal modeling allows evaluation of thermal conductivity of the composites characterized by increase from 0.09 to 0.46 W/(mK) for 0.07 up to 2 wt% of Si NPs, respectively, outperforming SiC nanowires at 2 wt% [D. Shen et al, Sci. Rep. 7, 2606 (2017)] despite bulk conductivity of Si being more than 3 times smaller than that of SiC. However, effective heat conductivity of our nanocomposites remain far below bulk Si, confirming that interfacial thermal resistance, not filler conductivity, governs heat transport.

We project simulated near-term sensitivities approaching 100 fT/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$, close to the Johnson-Nyquist limit. Our results establish frequency multiplexing as a new operational paradigm, offering a robust and scalable quantum resource for metrology under ambient conditions.

### [79] [Tailoring Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions via Double-Mode Squeezing Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03494)
*Kaiyuan Cao,Haodong Wang,Xiang-Ping Jiang,Shu chen,Jian Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We propose a protocol to tailor DQPTs via double-mode squeezing in the XY chain, showing that squeezing can influence phase transitions and introduces universal non-analytic dynamics when PHS is preserved. The method involves using a squeezing operator to break or preserve PHS, and the result is a tunable or universal DQPTs depending on the parameter r. The conclusion highlights the importance of this protocol and the direct link between entanglement saturation and universal non-analytic dynamics in far-from-equilibrium systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a new protocol for controlling DQPTs through initial-state squeezing, which can be used to tailor far-from-equilibrium phase transitions. The motivation is to provide a versatile tool for researchers studying non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems.

Method: The method involves applying a double-mode squeezing operator to the initial state of the XY chain. The effect of squeezing on DQPTs depends on whether it breaks particle-hole symmetry (PHS) and the strength of squeezing (r=π/4 is identified as a universal point). The method combines analytical and numerical techniques to study the tuning of DQPTs and to identify universal features.

Result: The key results are that squeezing can induce or suppress DQPTs depending on PHS and r, and when PHS is preserved and r=π/4, DQPTs become universal. Universal features include collapse of Fisher zeros, saturation of intermode entanglement, and collapse of the dynamical phase into a geometric phase. This is supported by analytical derivations and support from numerical simulations for different parameters.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that initial-state squeezing is a powerful method for controlling DQPTs and introduces a universal regime of dynamics when PHS is preserved and r=π/4. This provides a new pathway for studying non-equilibrium criticality and deepens the understanding of the interplay between quantum correlations and phase transitions.

Abstract: We propose a protocol to tailor dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) by double-mode squeezing onto the initial state in the XY chain. The effect of squeezing depends critically on the system's symmetry and parameters. When the squeezing operator breaks particle-hole symmetry (PHS), DQPTs become highly tunable, allowing one to either induce transitions within a single phase or suppress them. Remarkably, when PHS is preserved and the squeezing strength reaches $r=π/4$, a universal class of DQPTs emerges, independent of the quench path. This universality is characterized by two key features: (i) the collapse of all Fisher zeros onto the real-time axis, and (ii) the saturation of intermode entanglement to its maximum in each $(k,-k)$ modes. Moreover, the critical momenta governing the DQPTs coincide exactly with the modes attaining the maximal entanglement. At this universal point, the dynamical phase vanishes, leading to a purely geometric evolution marked by $π$-jumps in the Pancharatnam geometric phase. Our work establishes initial-state squeezing as a versatile tool for tailoring far-from-equilibrium criticality and reveals a direct link between entanglement saturation and universal nonanalytic dynamics.

Abstract: We propose the Many-body Quantum Score (MBQS), a practical and scalable application-level benchmark protocol designed to evaluate the capabilities of quantum processing units (QPUs)--both gate-based and analog--for simulating many-body quantum dynamics.

Abstract: Scaling superconducting quantum computers to the fault-tolerant regime calls for a commensurate scaling of the classical control and readout stack. Today's systems largely rely on room-temperature, rack-based instrumentation connected to dilution-refrigerator cryostats through many coaxial cables. Looking ahead, superconducting fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs) will likely adopt a heterogeneous quantum-classical architecture that places selected electronics at cryogenic stages -- for example, cryo-CMOS at 4~K and superconducting digital logic at 4~K and/or mK stages -- to curb wiring and thermal-load overheads. This review distills key requirements, surveys representative room-temperature and cryogenic approaches, and provides a transparent first-order accounting framework for cryoelectronics. Using an RSA-2048-scale benchmark as a concrete reference point, we illustrate how scaling targets motivate constraints on multiplexing and stage-wise cryogenic power, and discuss implications for functional partitioning across room-temperature electronics, cryo-CMOS, and superconducting logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to challenge the monistic view of quantum mechanics and provide a dual perspective by exploring measurement theory and the measurement problem.

Method: The paper is organized in a way that each chapter addresses a different aspect of quantum theory, such as ontological, analytical, epistemological, causal, and information dimensions. This multi-perspective structure is used to address the measurement problem.

Result: The dual-aspect reading resolves the measurement problem by showing how the structure of quantum theory overcomes historical monistic or universalist approaches while staying within the Copenhagen spirit.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the shift from monism to duality in understanding quantum mechanics and acknowledges the importance of considering multiple perspectives to address quantum phenomena and the measurement problem within any scientific theory.

Abstract: Duality, not monism, constitutes the hermeneutic lens that characterizes the original Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Therefore, evoking the principles of correspondence and complementarity, in this work we re assert a dual-aspect reading of quantum theory, structured through a multi-perspective schema encompassing its ontological, analytical, epistemological, causal, and information dimensions. We then show how this schema dissolves the so-called measurement problem, along with the associated knowledge-information and macro-micro dichotomies, issues historically raised within later monistic or universalist philosophical settings that ultimately depart from the traditional Copenhagen spirit.

Conclusion: 该研究为实现更长的容错位串提供了有效的解决方案，节省了 qubits 和计算资源。

Abstract: Cat states are an important resource for fault-tolerant quantum computing, where they serve as building blocks for a variety of fault-tolerant primitives. Consequently, the ability to prepare high-quality cat states at large fault distances is essential. While optimizations for low fault distances or small numbers of qubits exist, higher fault distances can be achieved via generalized constructions with potentially suboptimal circuit sizes. In this work, we propose a cat state preparation scheme based on preparing two cat states with low-depth circuits, followed by a transversal CNOT and measurement of one of the states. This scheme prepares $w$-qubit cat states fault-tolerantly up to fault distances of $9$ using $\lceil\log_2 w\rceil+1$ depth and at most $3w-2$ CNOTs and $2w$ qubits. We discuss that the combinatorially challenging aspect of this construction is the precise wiring of the transversal CNOT and propose three methods for finding these: two based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory solving and one heuristic search based on a local repair strategy. Numerical evaluations show that our circuits achieve a high fault-distance while requiring fewer resources as generalized constructions.

Abstract: We present an exact, time-dependent solution for a two-dimensional Pauli oscillator deformed by Dunkl operators in the presence of an Aharonov--Bohm (AB) flux. By replacing conventional momenta with Dunkl momenta and allowing arbitrary time dependence in both, mass and frequency, we derive a deformed Pauli Hamiltonian that encodes reflection symmetries and topological gauge phases. Employing the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method, we derive exact expressions for the eigenvalues and spinor eigenfunctions of the system. Crucially, the AB flux imposes symmetry constraints on the Dunkl parameters of the form $ν_1 = \mp ν_2 $, linking the reflection symmetry ($ε= \pm 1 $) to the quantization of angular momentum. These constraints modify the energy spectrum and wavefunctions of the angular operator and the invariant operator. Our framework reveals novel spectral characteristics arising from the interplay between topology and Dunkl symmetry, with potential implications for quantum simulation in engineered systems such as cold atoms and quantum dots.

### [85] [Surface Optimization of Aluminum Resonators for Robust Quantum Device Fabrication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04082)
*Simon J. K. Lang,Ignaz Eisele,Alwin Maiwald,Emir Music,Luis Schwarzenbach,Carla Morán-Guizán,Johannes Weber,Daniela Zahn,Thomas Mayer,Rui N. Pereira,Christoph Kutter*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper focuses on optimizing aluminum-based superconducting qubit resonators for low loss despite long post-processing delays. Various surface modification techniques, including oxygen plasma, fluorine plasma, and HF-based etching, are explored. The study finds that while fluorine plasma passivation is effective for Al, it increases loss. A two-step processing using HF and phosphoric acid selectively removes oxide layers for optimal qubit performance is recommended. The conclusion is that selective etching and fluorine passivation can jointly reduce loss and maintain high quality factors, making the approach feasible for industry-scale production. The method leverages plasma and mechanical etching for tailored surface control. The result demonstrates the feasibility of achieving low loss in aluminum-based qubits, highlighting the potential of tailored surface modifications for industrial fabrication. The motivation is driven by the need for robust qubit fabrication techniques in large-scale production, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown are common. The key finding is that selective surface etching can rigorously control dielectric loss in aluminum qubits over extended periods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is driven by the need for reliable production techniques for superconducting qubits, which are crucial for quantum computing. In industrial-scale fabrication, delays between sample preparation and cooldown are inevitable and can affect the performance of aluminum-based qubits. It is essential to develop methods that maintain low loss during these delays to ensure high-quality qubits.

Method: The study employs a combination of experimental and computational methods. Various surface modification techniques are tested, primarily involving different plasma processes and chemical etching methods. The techniques include (1) remote oxygen plasma treatment, (2) fluorine plasma passivation, and (3) selective HF and phosphoric acid etching. Dielectric loss and quality factor (Q) measurements are conducted to evaluate the performance of the qubits after each treatment process.

Result: The experiments reveal that aluminum-based superconducting qubits can achieve very low loss despite the long post-processing delays typical in industrial-scale fabrication. The fluorine plasma passivation method, while effective for passivating aluminum surfaces, increases loss and is therefore unsuitable for industrial application. On the other hand, a two-step processing approach using HF vapor and phosphoric acid shows promising results. In a single photon regime, the qubit demonstrates a dielectric loss of δ_LP = 5.2 ×10⁻⁷ with a quality factor Q_i ≈1.9 M. This result indicates that tailored surface modification techniques can significantly enhance the quality of aluminum-based qubits in industrial production.

Conclusion: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the surface modification techniques for aluminum-based superconducting qubits, aiming to maintain optimal performance despite long post-processing delays. The findings suggest that while fluorine plasma passivation is not suitable for aluminum qubits due to the increased loss, a two-step processing approach combining HF and phosphoric acid etching can effectively reduce dielectric loss and maintain high quality factors. The results are significant for the development of reliable and scalable quantum computing technologies, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by long production delays in industrial manufacturing.

Abstract: Aluminum remains the central material for superconducting qubits, and considerable effort has been devoted to optimizing its deposition and patterning for quantum devices. However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $δ_\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\mathrm{i} \approx 1.9\,\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication.

Conclusion: 巨原子平台为探索非马尔可夫ian开放量子动力学及其在量子信息与热力学中的应用提供了新工具和新视角。

Abstract: Superconducting qubits coupled to meandering transmission lines or surface acoustic waves may realize giant artificial atoms, whose spatially separated coupling points give rise to long-lived non-Markovian dynamics. Previous studies were limited to the zero-temperature, weak-coupling regime, where the rotating-wave approximation applies and only single-phonon processes contribute. Here we go beyond these limits using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). We show that HEOM accurately captures the exact dynamics at zero temperature and weak coupling, whereas perturbative Redfield theory fails due to long bath memory times. The non-Markovian effects persist at finite temperatures. In the strong-coupling regime, they are further enhanced, and we observe bound-state formation at zero temperature with only two coupling points. These results establish giant atoms as a powerful platform for exploring non-Markovian open quantum dynamics and their applications in quantum information and thermodynamics.

Abstract: We examine multiphoton interference with a symmetric $SU(N)$ beam splitter $S_N$, an extension of features of the $SU(2)$ 50/50 beam splitter extended Hong-Ou-Mandel (eHOM) effect, whereby one obtains a zero amplitude (probability) for the output coincidence state (defined by equal number of photons $n/N$ in each output port), when a total number $n$ of photons impinges on the $N$-port device. These are transitions of the form $|n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_N\rangle\overset{S_N}{\to}|n/N\rangle^{\otimes N}$, where $n=\sum_{i=1}^N n_i$, which generalize the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect $|1,1\rangle \overset{S_2}{\to}|1,1\rangle $, the eHOM effect $|n_1,n_2\rangle \overset{S_2}{\to}|\tfrac{n_1+n_2}{2},\tfrac{n_1+n_2}{2}\rangle $, and the generalized HOM effect (gHOM) $|1\rangle^{\otimes N}\overset{S_N}{\to}|1\rangle^{\otimes N}$, which have previously been studied in the literature. The emphasis of this work is on illuminating how the overall destructive interference occurs in separate groups of destructive interferences of sub-amplitudes of the total zero amplitude. We develop symmetry properties for the generalized eHOM effect (geHOM) $|n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_N\rangle\overset{S_N}{\to}|n/N\rangle^{\otimes N}$ involving a zero amplitude governed by Perm($Λ$)=0, for an appropriately constructed matrix $Λ(S_N)$ built from the matrix elements of $S_N$. We develop an analytical constraint equation for Perm$(Λ)$ for arbitrary $N$ that allows us to determine when it is zero. We generalize the SU(2) beam splitter feature of central nodal line (CNL), which has a zero diagonal along the output probability distribution when one of the input states is of odd parity (containing only odd number of photons), to the general case of $N = 2 * N'$ where $N'\in odd$.

TL;DR: Implementing a non-degenerate parametric amplifier allows for both amplification and squeezing of microwave signals and spin ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors explore a parametric amplifier that can simultaneously amplify and generate squeezing in quantum systems, which has potential applications in quantum sensing and metrology.

Method: The system consists of a microwave cavity and a spin ensemble (e.g., nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond). The spin ensemble is modulated at the sum of the cavity and spin frequencies, providing a classical pump, while the two systems are sufficiently detuned. This setup enables two-mode and single-mode squeezing.

Result: The amplifier achieves 18 dB signal amplification in 1.7 μs with a 0.5 MHz bandwidth at room temperature. At cryogenic temperatures (10 mK), it generates approximately 5 dB of squeezing with the same parameters.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a practical method for generating squeezing and amplifying signals in hybrid systems, bridging quantum and classical systems for potential applications in quantum technology.

Abstract: We introduce an implementation of a non-degenerate parametric amplifier in which the signal and idler modes, respectively, a microwave mode and an ensemble of spins (e.g., nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond), are operated in their linear regime. This paramp, which amplifies signals in both parts at room and cryogenic temperatures, can be used to generate both the two-mode and single-mode squeezing of either system. It requires merely modulating the frequency of the spin ensemble at the sum of the cavity and spin frequencies (providing the classical pump) with the two systems sufficiently detuned. This effect is remarkable given that modulating a spin ensemble by itself produces neither amplification nor squeezing, unlike modulating an oscillator, and that an off-resonant perturbative analysis would suggest that modulating the spin ensemble merely parametrically drives the cavity mode. With typical cavity parameters including a cavity quality factor~$Q=10^4$, and a 1 GHz modulation amplitude, the microwave signal can be amplified by approximately $18~\mbox{dB}$ in $1.7~\mbox{$μ$s}$, with a resonant bandwidth of about $0.5~\mbox{MHz}$. At $10~\mbox{mK}$ with the same modulation amplitude and a cavity and spin $Q=5\times 10^4$ it generates approximately $5~\mbox{dB}$ of squeezing. We also examine the experimental requirements for implementation.

Abstract: Many symmetry protected or symmetry enriched phases of quantum matter have the property that every ground state in a given such phase endows measurement based quantum computation with the same computational power. Such phases are called computational phases of quantum matter. Here, we experimentally verify four theoretical predictions for them on an IBM superconducting quantum device. We comprehensively investigate how symmetric imperfections of the resource states translate into logical decoherence, and how this decoherence is mitigated. In particular, the central experiment probes the scaling law from which the uniformity of computational power follows. We also analyze the correlated regime, where local measurements give rise to logical operations collectively. We test the prediction that densest packing of a measurement-based algorithms remains the most efficient, in spite of the correlations. Our experiments corroborate the operational stability of measurement based quantum computation in quantum phases of matter with symmetry.

Abstract: Imaginary gauge transformation (IGT) provides a clear understanding of the non-Hermitian skin effect by transforming the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra into Hermitian ones. In this paper, we extend this approach to the complex spectrum regime in a general nonreciprocal lattice model. We unveil the validity of IGT hinges on a class of pseudo-Hermitian symmetry. The generalized Brillouin zone of Hamiltonians respect such pseudo-Hermiticity is demonstrated to be a circle, which enables easy access to the continuum bands, localization length of skin modes, and relevant topological numbers. Furthermore, we investigate the applicability of IGT and the underlying pseudo-Hermiticity beyond nearest-neighbor hopping, offering a graphical interpretation. Our theoretical framework is applied to establish bulk-boundary correspondence in the nonreciprocal trimer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and to analyze the localization behaviors of skin modes in the two-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a way to revitalize Weyl's concept of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory by introducing a method involving complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter, leading to a modified current density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to utilize Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance within pilot-wave theory, which could have implications for understanding quantum theory and scale-invariant systems.

Method: The authors use pilot-wave theory, modify the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter, and derive a modified current density that accounts for local scale invariance.

Result: The result is a pilot-wave realization of local scale invariance, leading to a modified current density formula, which is applied to the Schrödinger, Pauli, Dirac equations, and quantum field theory for interacting fields.

Conclusion: The approach successfully integrates local scale invariance into pilot-wave theory, suggesting potential applications in quantum theory and scale-invariant systems.

Abstract: We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (deBroglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance of the quantum state in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|ψ|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|ψ|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schrödinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating dissipative diffusion dynamics generated by positive semidefinite operators of the form $A=L^\dagger L$, a structure that arises naturally in standard discretizations of elliptic operators. Our main tool is the Kannai transform, which represents the diffusion semigroup $e^{-TA}$ as a Gaussian-weighted superposition of unitary wave propagators. This representation leads to a linear-combination-of-unitaries implementation with a Gaussian tail and yields query complexity $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\|A\| T \log(1/\varepsilon)})$, up to standard dependence on state-preparation and output norms, improving the scaling in $\|A\|, T$ and $\varepsilon$ compared with generic Hamiltonian-simulation-based methods. We instantiate the method for the heat equation and biharmonic diffusion under non-periodic physical boundary conditions, and we further use it as a subroutine for constant-coefficient linear parabolic surrogates arising in entropy-penalization schemes for viscous Hamilton--Jacobi equations. In the long-time regime, the same framework yields a structured quantum linear solver for $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ with $A=L^\dagger L$, achieving $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(κ^{3/2}\log^2(1/\varepsilon))$ queries and improving the condition-number dependence over standard quantum linear-system algorithms in this factorized setting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improvement of parameter estimation precision through topological quantum sensing is motivated by the potential in both fundamental research and practical applications, particularly in reducing noise effects.

Abstract: Topological quantum sensing leverages unique topological features to suppress noise and improve the precision of parameter estimation, emerging as a promising tool in both fundamental research and practical application. In this Letter, we propose a sensing protocol that exploits the dynamics of topological quantum walks incorporating localized defects. Unlike conventional schemes that rely on topological protection to suppress disorder and defects, our protocol harnesses the evolution time as a resource to enable precise estimation of the defect parameter. By utilizing topologically nontrivial properties of the quantum walks, the sensing precision can approach the Heisenberg limit. We further demonstrate the performance and robustness of the protocol through Bayesian estimation. Our results show that this approach maintains high precision over a broad range of parameters and exhibits strong robustness against disorder, offering a practical pathway for topologically enhanced quantum metrology.

TL;DR: The paper compares three quantum imaging setups for phase estimation, finding that while the Yurke setup can theoretically achieve Heisenberg scaling, it's sensitive to losses and realistic constraints. The Mandel setup, with differential intensity detection, provides the best robust phase sensitivity, even surpassing losses while maintaining sub-shot-noise limits. Losses impact the Yurke setup negatively, but the Mandel setup remains the most reliable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper builds on prior work in quantum imaging and aims to optimize reliable phase estimation schemes under realistic conditions.

Method: The researchers compared three interferometer configurations—Yurke-type SU(1,1), Mandel-type induced-coherence, and a hybrid scheme. They used intensity-based measurements for phase estimation and tested each setup under varying loss conditions.

Result: The Mandel setup outperformed the Yurke setup due to its differential intensity detection, providing more stable phase sensitivity, even in the presence of loss.

Conclusion: The Mandel setup with differential intensity detection is the optimal choice for reliable and robust phase estimation in quantum imaging despite limitations in potential super-resolution capability.

Abstract: Over the past decade, several schemes for imaging and sensing based on nonlinear interferometers have been proposed and demonstrated experimentally. These interferometers exhibit two main advantages. First, they enable probing a sample at a chosen wavelength while detecting light at a different wavelength with high efficiency (bicolor quantum imaging and sensing with undetected light). Second, they can show quantum-enhanced sensitivities below the shot-noise limit, potentially reaching Heisenberg-limited precision in parameter estimation. Here, we compare three quantum-imaging configurations using only easily accessible intensity-based measurements for phase estimation: a Yurke-type SU(1,1) interferometer, a Mandel-type induced-coherence interferometer, and a hybrid scheme that continuously interpolates between them. While an ideal Yurke interferometer can exhibit Heisenberg scaling, this advantage is known to be fragile under realistic detection constraints and in the presence of loss. We demonstrate that differential intensity detection in the Mandel interferometer provides the highest and most robust phase sensitivity among the considered schemes, reaching but not surpassing the shot-noise limit, even in the presence of loss. Intensity measurements in a Yurke-type configuration can achieve genuine sub-shot-noise sensitivity under balanced losses and moderate gain; however, their performance degrades in realistic high-gain regimes. Consequently, in this regime, the Mandel configuration with differential detection outperforms the Yurke-type setup and constitutes the most robust approach for phase estimation.

Conclusion: 这是一种新的设计量子偏置调整码的方法，可能在未来的量子计算和通信中发挥重要作用。

Abstract: Bias-tailored codes such as the XZZX surface code and the domain wall color code achieve high dephasing-biased thresholds because, in the infinite-bias limit, their $Z$ syndromes decouple into one-dimensional repetition-like chains; the $X^3Z^3$ Floquet code shows an analogous strip-wise structure for detector events in spacetime. We capture this common mechanism by defining strip-symmetric biased codes, a class of static stabilizer and dynamical (Floquet) codes for which, under pure dephasing and perfect measurements, each elementary $Z$ fault is confined to a strip and the Z-detector--fault incidence matrix is block diagonal. For such codes the Z-detector hypergraph decomposes into independent strip components and maximum-likelihood $Z$ decoding factorizes across strips, yielding complexity savings for matching-based decoders. We characterize strip symmetry via per-strip stabilizer products, viewed as a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ 1-form symmetry, place XZZX, the domain wall color code, and $X^3Z^3$ in this framework, and introduce synthetic strip-symmetric detector models and domain-wise Clifford constructions that serve as design tools for new bias-tailored Floquet codes.

Motivation: understanding the wave function through the harmonic oscillator

Result: eigenfunctions $ψ_n$ represent classical oscillators with energy $E_n$, embedded in phase space with conical subspaces

Conclusion: schrödinger equation solutions require superpositions considering incomplete data and invariance under groups $z_n$

Abstract: We consider the nature of the wave function using the example of a harmonic oscillator. We show that the eigenfunctions $ψ_n{=}z^n$ of the quantum Hamiltonian in the complex Bargmann-Fock-Segal representation with $z\in\mathbb C$ are the coordinates of a classical oscillator with energy $E_n=\hbarωn$, $n=0,1,2,...\,$. They are defined on conical spaces ${\mathbb C}/{\mathbb Z}_n$ with cone angles $2π/n$, which are embedded as subspaces in the phase space $\mathbb C$ of the classical oscillator. Here ${\mathbb Z}_n$ is the finite cyclic group of rotations of the space $\mathbb C$ by an angle $2π/n$. The superposition $ψ=\sum_n c_nψ_n$ of the eigenfunctions $ψ_n$ arises only with incomplete knowledge of the initial data for solving the Schrödinger equation, when the conditions of invariance with respect to the discrete groups ${\mathbb Z}_n$ are not imposed and the general solution takes into account all possible initial data parametrized by the numbers $n\in\mathbb N$.

Abstract: We investigate double-interval entanglement measures, specifically reflected entropy, mutual information, and logarithmic negativity, in quasiparticle excited states for classical, bosonic, and fermionic systems. We develop an algorithm that efficiently calculates these measures from density matrices expressed in a non-orthonormal basis, enabling straightforward numerical implementation. We find a universal additivity property that emerges at large momentum differences, where the entanglement measures for states with distinct quasiparticle sets equal the sum of their individual contributions. The classical limit arises as a special case of this additivity, with both bosonic and fermionic results converging to classical behavior when all momentum differences are large.

Result: 所有正实数阶Rényi和Tsallis熵相关的问题在BQP中是困难的。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了量子熵计算复杂性的理解，提供了新的技术工具用于未来研究。

Abstract: We investigate the computational hardness of estimating the quantum $α$-Rényi entropy ${\rm S}^{\tt R}_α(ρ) = \frac{\ln {\rm Tr}(ρ^α)}{1-α}$ and the quantum $q$-Tsallis entropy ${\rm S}^{\tt T}_q(ρ) = \frac{1-{\rm Tr}(ρ^q)}{q-1}$, both converging to the von Neumann entropy as the order approaches $1$. The promise problems Quantum $α$-Rényi Entropy Approximation (RényiQEA$_α$) and Quantum $q$-Tsallis Entropy Approximation (TsallisQEA$_q$) ask whether $ {\rm S}^ {\tt R}_α(ρ)$ or ${\rm S}^{\tt T}_q(ρ)$, respectively, is at least $τ_{\tt Y}$ or at most $τ_{\tt N}$, where $τ_{\tt Y} - τ_{\tt N}$ is typically a positive constant. Previous hardness results cover only the von Neumann entropy (order $1$) and some cases of the quantum $q$-Tsallis entropy, while existing approaches do not readily extend to other orders.
  We establish that for all positive real orders, the rank-$2$ variants Rank2RényiQEA$_α$ and Rank2TsallisQEA$_q$ are ${\sf BQP}$-hard. Combined with prior (rank-dependent) quantum query algorithms in Wang, Guan, Liu, Zhang, and Ying (TIT 2024), Wang, Zhang, and Li (TIT 2024), and Liu and Wang (SODA 2025), our results imply:
  - For all real orders $α> 0$ and $0 < q \leq 1$, LowRankRényiQEA$_α$ and LowRankTsallisQEA$_q$ are ${\sf BQP}$-complete, where both are restricted versions of RényiQEA$_α$ and TsallisQEA$_q$ with $ρ$ of polynomial rank.
  - For all real order $q>1$, TsallisQEA$_q$ is ${\sf BQP}$-complete.
  Our hardness results stem from reductions based on new inequalities relating the $α$-Rényi or $q$-Tsallis binary entropies of different orders, where the reductions differ substantially from previous approaches, and the inequalities are also of independent interest.

Abstract: Loophole-free quantum nonlocality often demands experiments with high complexity (defined by all parties' settings and outcomes) and multiple efficient detectors. Here, we identify the fundamental efficiency and complexity thresholds for quantum steering using two-qubit entangled states. Remarkably, it requires only one photon detector on the untrusted side, with efficiency $ε> 1/X$, where $X \geq 2$ is the number of settings on that side. This threshold applies to all pure entangled states, in contrast to analogous Bell-nonlocality tests, which require almost unentangled states to be loss-tolerant. We confirm these predictions in a minimal-complexity ($X = 2$ for the untrusted party and a single three-outcome measurement for the trusted party), detection-loophole-free photonic experiment with $ε= (51.6 \pm 0.4)\% $.

Abstract: We compare three proof techniques for composable finite-size security of quantum key distribution under collective attacks, with emphasis on how the resulting secret-key rates behave at practically relevant block lengths. As a benchmark, we consider the BB84 protocol and evaluate finite-size key-rate estimates obtained from entropic uncertainty relations (EUR), from the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP), and from a direct finite-block analysis based on the conditional min-entropy, which we refer to as the finite-size min-entropy (FME) approach. For BB84 we show that the EUR-based bound provides the most favorable performance across the considered parameter range, while the AEP bound is asymptotically tight but can become overly pessimistic at moderate and small block sizes, where it may fail to certify a positive key. The FME approach remains effective in this small-block regime, yielding nonzero rates in situations where the AEP estimate vanishes, although it is not asymptotically optimal for BB84. These results motivate the use of FME-type analyses for continuous-variable protocols in settings where tight EUR-based bounds are unavailable, notably for coherent-state schemes where current finite-size analyses typically rely on AEP-style corrections.

TL;DR: Iterative MPS-based Grover's simulation is efficient for large-scale NISQ quantum circuits, offering significant speedups and reduced sampling complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient simulation of large-scale Grover's algorithm is crucial for validating quantum hardware and developing quantum algorithms in the NISQ era.

Method: An iterative Grover's circuit simulation framework based on matrix product states (MPS) was developed using CUDA-Q. It was compared with the classical statevector backend and common non-iterative Grover's circuits in both MPS and statevector backends.

Result: The iterative circuit on the MPS backend achieved 15x speedup over the non-iterative circuit and 3-4x speedup over the statevector backend. Additionally, low-shot stability was observed with qubit numbers beyond 13.

Conclusion: MPS-based iterative design enhances the efficiency and scalability of simulating Grover's algorithm, providing a viable solution for large-scale quantum circuit simulation and reducing measurement costs through enhanced stability.

Abstract: Grover's algorithm is a cornerstone of quantum search algorithm, offering quadratic speedup for unstructured problems. However, limited qubit counts and noise in today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices hinder large-scale hardware validation, making efficient classical simulation essential for algorithm development and hardware assessment. We present an iterative Grover simulation framework based on matrix product states (MPS) to efficiently simulate large-scale Grover's algorithm. Within the NVIDIA CUDA-Q environment, we compare iterative and common (non-iterative) Grover's circuits across statevector and MPS backends. On the MPS backend at 29 qubits, the iterative Grover's circuit runs about 15x faster than the common (non-iterative) Grover's circuit, and about 3-4x faster than the statevector backend. In sampling experiments, Grover's circuits demonstrate strong low-shot stability: as the qubit number increases beyond 13, a single-shot measurement still closely mirrors the results from 4,096 shots, indicating reliable estimates with minimal sampling and significant potential to cut measurement costs. Overall, an iterative MPS design delivers speed and scalability for Grover's circuit simulation, enabling practical large-scale implementations.

TL;DR: MPM-QIR is a variational quantum circuit framework for classical image compression that achieves higher PSNR and SSIM metrics at lower Parameter Compression Ratios (PCR) compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind MPM-QIR is to create an efficient classical image compression method that reduces the number of parameters required while maintaining or improving the quality of reconstructed images.

Method: The MPM-QIR framework uses a bidirectional convolutional architecture within a variational quantum circuit to implicitly map pixel intensities and learn positional information without explicit coordinate qubits. This approach ties compression efficiency directly to circuit complexity and enables shallow-depth entanglement capture of global image correlations.

Result: MPM-QIR achieves PSNR values of 30 dB or higher with lower PCR compared to benchmarks such as MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10. Specifically, it attains PSNR 31.80 dB / SSIM 0.81 at PCR 0.69 for MNIST, PSNR 31.30 dB / SSIM 0.91 at PCR 0.83 for Fashion-MNIST, and PSNR 31.56 dB / SSIM 0.97 at PCR 0.84 for CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: MPM-QIR represents a significant advancement in quantum-inspired classical image compression, offering a direct and effective generative model with applications in two-stage compression pipelines and extensions beyond 2D imagery.

Abstract: We present MPM-QIR, a variational-quantum-circuit (VQC) framework for classical image compression and representation whose core objective is to achieve equal or better reconstruction quality at a lower Parameter Compression Ratio (PCR). The method aligns a generative VQC's measurement-probability distribution with normalized pixel intensities and learns positional information implicitly via an ordered mapping to the flattened pixel array, thus eliminating explicit coordinate qubits and tying compression efficiency directly to circuit (ansatz) complexity. A bidirectional convolutional architecture induces long-range entanglement at shallow depth, capturing global image correlations with fewer parameters. Under a unified protocol, the approach attains PSNR $\geq$ 30 dB with lower PCR across benchmarks: MNIST 31.80 dB / SSIM 0.81 at PCR 0.69, Fashion-MNIST 31.30 dB / 0.91 at PCR 0.83, and CIFAR-10 31.56 dB / 0.97 at PCR 0.84. Overall, this compression-first design improves parameter efficiency, validates VQCs as direct and effective generative models for classical image compression, and is amenable to two-stage pipelines with classical codecs and to extensions beyond 2D imagery.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Assumption-free reconstruction of quantum states from measurements is essential for benchmarking and certifying quantum devices, but it remains difficult due to the extensive measurement statistics and experimental resources it demands. An approach to alleviating these demands is provided by adaptive measurement strategies, which can yield up to a quadratic improvement in reconstruction accuracy for pure states by dynamically optimizing measurement settings during data acquisition. A key open question is whether these asymptotic advantages remain in realistic experiments, where readout is inevitably noisy. In this work, we analyze the impact of readout noise on adaptive quantum state tomography with readout-error mitigation, focusing on the challenging regime of reconstructing pure states using mixed-state estimators. Using analytical arguments based on Fisher information optimization and extensive numerical simulations using Bayesian inference, we show that any nonzero readout noise eliminates the asymptotic quadratic scaling advantage of adaptive strategies. We numerically investigate the behavior for finite measurement statistics for single- and two-qubit systems with exact readout-error mitigation and find a gradual transition from ideal to sub-optimal scaling. We furthermore investigate realistic scenarios where detector tomography is performed with a limited number of state copies for calibration, showing that insufficient detector characterization leads to estimator bias and limited reconstruction accuracy. Although our result imposes an upper bound on the reconstruction accuracy that can be achieved with adaptive strategies, we nevertheless observe numerically a constant-factor gain in reconstruction accuracy, which becomes larger as the readout noise decreases. This indicates potential practical benefits in using adaptive measurement strategies in well-calibrated experiments.

Abstract: Gain-switching laser diodes is a well-established technique for generating optical pulses with random phases, where the quantum randomness arises naturally from spontaneous emission. However, the maximum switching rate is limited by phase diffusion: at high repetition rates, residual photons in the cavity seed subsequent pulses, leading to phase correlations, which degrade randomness. We present a method to overcome this limitation by employing an external source of spontaneous emission in conjunction with the laser. Our results show that this approach effectively removes interpulse phase correlations and restores phase randomization at repetition rates as high as 10 GHz. This technique opens new opportunities for high-rate quantum key distribution and quantum random number generation.

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of extracting infinite volume scattering phase shift on quantum computers in a simple one-dimensional quantum mechanical model, using the formalism established in Ref.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc} that relates the integrated correlation functions (ICF) for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral. The system is first discretized in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions, and the formalism in real time is verified by employing a contact interaction potential with exact solutions. Quantum circuits are then designed and constructed to implement the formalism on current quantum computing architectures. To overcome the fast oscillatory behavior of the integrated correlation functions in real-time simulation, different methods of post-data analysis are proposed and discussed. Test results on IBM hardware show that good agreement can be achieved with two qubits, but complete failure ensues with three qubits due to two-qubit gate operation errors and thermal relaxation errors.

Abstract: We prove that learning an unknown quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ to diamond distance $\varepsilon$ requires $ Ω\!\left( \frac{d_A d_B r}{\varepsilon \log(d_B r / \varepsilon)} \right)$ queries. This improves the best previous $Ω(d_A d_B r)$ bound by introducing explicit $\varepsilon$-dependence, with a scaling in $\varepsilon$ that is near-optimal when $d_A=rd_B$ but not tight in general. The proof constructs an ensemble of channels that are well-separated in diamond norm yet admit Stinespring isometries that are close in operator norm.

Abstract: Over the last decade, frequency-domain in-situ high-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in diamond anvil cells (DACs) has been employed as a structural and electronic probe of condensed matter systems at pressures well into the megabar range. However, extensive spin interactions and sample heterogeneities under pressure often lead to significant spectral overlap, inhibiting independent observation of chemically similar spin sub-species in the same sample. In this work, we introduce a time-domain relaxometry framework specifically suited for DAC experiments, named muT2-NMR. Experimental flexibility and operational robustness are benchmarked on three hydrogen-rich molecular solids at pressures up to 72 GPa. We demonstrate that muT2-NMR can resolve individual molecular subunits in relaxation space, paving the way for novel high-pressure, high-resolution NMR applications in molecular solids.

Conclusion: This roadmap is expected to help guide future research and funding towards a better understanding of biomolecular condensates.

Abstract: Biomolecular condensates govern essential cellular processes yet elude description by traditional equilibrium models. This roadmap, distilled from structured discussions at a workshop and reflecting the consensus of its participants, clarifies key concepts for researchers, funding bodies, and journals. After unifying terminology that often separates disciplines, we outline the core physics of condensate formation, review their biological roles, and identify outstanding challenges in nonequilibrium theory, multiscale simulation, and quantitative in-cell measurements. We close with a forward-looking outlook to guide coordinated efforts toward predictive, experimentally anchored understanding and control of biomolecular condensates.

TL;DR: Uranium digermanide (UGe₂) is identified as the first ferromagnetic superconductor, and its electronic structure under stoichiometric deviations remains largely consistent, serving as a reliable foundation for future research into its applications in interfaces and heterostructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of the electronic properties of UGe₂ is motivated by its potential as a ferromagnetic superconductor, a rare material with both magnetic and superconducting properties, which opens up new possibilities in materials science and could have implications for high-temperature superconductivity research.

Method: The research employed advanced techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet (UPS) photoelectron spectroscopy on UGe₂ thin films with controlled stoichiometric deviations. Density functional theory combined with the exact diagonalization (DFT+U(ED)) method was used to model the electronic structure, providing detailed insights into the valence band characteristics and the contribution of U-5f orbitals.

Result: The experimental data from XPS and UPS showed that the electronic structure of UGe₂ remains consistent across stoichiometric deviations, with a metallic valence band and contributions from U-5f orbitals. The spectral features did not undergo qualitative changes, indicating stability of the electronic framework under moderate deviations.

Conclusion: These findings confirm that UGe₂ is a robust candidate for studying the electronic properties of uranium-based systems under varying compositions, highlighting its utility in exploring interface and heterostructure phenomena.

Abstract: Uranium digermanide UGe$_2$, the first ferromagnetic superconductor, represents a key composition in the U-Ge system dominated by U-5$f$ states. To examine the impact of controlled stoichiometric deviations on the electronic structure, UGe$_{2\pm x}$ thin films ($0 \le x \le 1$) were prepared by triode sputtering and studied on pristine surfaces by X-ray (XPS) and Ultraviolet (UPS) photoelectron spectroscopy. XPS and UPS reveal a robust metallic valence band with a dominant U-5$f$ contribution at the Fermi level and a broad incoherent feature at higher binding energies, without qualitative changes in spectral line shape across the composition range. The experimental spectrum of UGe$_2$ thin films is well reproduced by DFT+U(ED) valence-band calculations combining density functional theory with exact diagonalization of the multiconfigurational U-5$f$ shell. These results demonstrate that the overall U-Ge electronic framework of UGe$_2$ thin films remains resilient to moderate stoichiometric deviations, providing a reliable electronic baseline for future studies of interface- and heterostructure-driven phenomena in uranium-based systems.

Conclusion: 通过调节铈浓度x，可以系统地研究Kondo效应与超导性的关系，揭示了材料相变的相图。

Abstract: We report a study of the La$_{1-x}$Ce$_x$FeSiH solid solution ($0 \leq x \leq 1$), a family of intermetallic hydrides of ZrCuSiAs-type structure, with space group $P4/nmm$. For low cerium concentrations $x \leq 0.20$, we observe the presence of superconductivity, which originates from the correlated $3d$ electrons of iron. The superconducting regime is progressively suppressed by the cerium substitution. For moderate cerium concentration $0.07 \leq x \leq 0.50$, we observe evidence of the single-ion Kondo effect and no magnetic phase transition down to 2 K. For $0.07 \leq x \leq 0.20$, the single-ion Kondo effect coexists with a superconducting ground state at low temperatures. From $x > 0.50$, we observe signatures of Kondo coherence and a heavy Fermi liquid regime at low temperature. Finally, at high cerium concentration $x \geq 0.85$, we observe signatures of magnetic ordering at low temperatures. We discuss our results by introducing temperature scales related to superconductivity, the Kondo effect, and magnetic order, which permits building a rich phase diagram temperature versus cerium content $x$. This shows that using the cerium concentration $x$ as a unique control parameter, we can explore the Kondo entanglement between correlated $3d$ and $4f$ electrons, which suggests an unusual change between the superconducting state related to the $3d$ electrons and the Kondo coherent state involving both $3d$ and $4f$ electrons.

TL;DR: 机器学习（ML）势场方法在价层近原子里获得了与计算成本大幅降低的准量子力学精度。最近扩展了ML势场方法到具有耦合电子和结构或磁性度自由度的内斯曼 Models。现有方法依赖于对称性的预设自 markers，通常对系统具体，限制了泛化和不同格子哈密顿量的适用性。我们引入了一个基于等变神经网络（ENN）的对称保留框架，该框架提供了一种通用和数据驱动的方法，从局部变量配置映射到每个格点的力。与分子系统中使用的ENN架构不同（其中欧几里得对称性占主导地位），我们的方法直接将晶格模型中的离散点群和内部对称性注入到神经网络表示的势场中。通过将ENN方法应用于 Holstein 模型的平方格点，构建了可以捕捉对称性打破相位行为的ML势场体系。这表明，晶格等变架构能够连接微层电子过程到复杂的动理学行为。

Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) force fields enable large-scale simulations with near-first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost. Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems.
