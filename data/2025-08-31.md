Abstract: We compute the second-harmonic response of two-dimensional topological Dirac
semimetals subjected to an external in-plane magnetic field. The quantum
kinetic equation for the Wigner distribution function is derived and then
solved to evaluate the second-order electric-field contributions to the current
density. Both the Berry curvature dipole and the field-induced terms in the
current are analyzed across a broad range of model parameters. We propose that
our theory can be tested experimentally by measuring the dependence of the
anomalous Hall resistivity on the in-plane magnetic field in the surface states
of the topological insulator SnTe, in WTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, as well
as in the Kondo lattice material Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$ at very low temperatures.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Narrow lines in photoluminescence (PL) spectra of excitons are characteristic
of low-dimensional semiconductors. These lines correspond to the emission of
exciton states in local minima of a potential energy landscape formed by
fluctuations of the local exciton environment in the heterostructure. The
spatial extension of such states was in the nanometer range. In this work, we
present studies of narrow lines in PL spectra of spatially indirect excitons
(IXs) in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure. The narrow lines
vanish with increasing IX density. The disappearance of narrow lines correlates
with the onset of IX transport, indicating that the narrow lines correspond to
localized exciton states. The narrow lines extend over distances reaching
several micrometers and over areas reaching ca. ten percent of the sample area.
This macroscopic spatial extension of the exciton states, corresponding to the
narrow lines, indicates a deviation of the exciton energy landscape from random
potential and shows that the excitons are confined in moir\'e potential with a
weak disorder.

### [3] [When Dephasing Fails: Thermodynamic Consequences of Decoherence Models in Quantum Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20343)
*Eren Erdogan,Justin P. Bergfield*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The voltage-temperature probe (VTP) model is better than the voltage probe (VP) for modeling decoherence in quantum transport under asymmetric conditions or thermal bias. VTP respects thermodynamic constraints and models decoherence in both charge and heat channels, while VP often fails to do so accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding decoherence's role in quantum transport is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. Comparing VP and VTP models helps clarify their functional differences under various conditions.

Method: The study involves analyzing the models' behavior under asymmetric coupling and thermal bias using a benzene-based molecular junction as a realistic example.

Result: The VTP model outperforms VP under asymmetric conditions by respecting thermodynamic constraints and effectively modeling decoherence in both charge and heat channels. VP often fails to accurately model heat transport, even when coupled strongly.

Conclusion: The VP and VTP models can be interchangeably used only under highly symmetric conditions. VTP should be preferred for thermodynamically consistent modeling of decoherence in quantum transport under asymmetric coupling or thermal bias.

Abstract: Understanding how decoherence influences heat and information flow is
essential for realizing the promise of quantum technologies. Two widely used
models for incorporating decoherence in quantum transport are the voltage probe
(VP), which imposes local charge current conservation, and the
voltage-temperature probe (VTP), which also conserves heat current. Although
these models are often treated as functionally equivalent, we demonstrate that
this equivalence actually exists only under highly symmetric conditions, which
may be challenging to achieve experimentally Under asymmetric coupling or
thermal bias, the VTP respects thermodynamic constraints and enforces
decoherence in both charge and heat channels, while the VP instead acts as a
source or sink of heat. Strikingly, the VP can fail to model decoherence in the
heat transport entirely, even with large probe coupling strengths. Using a
benzene-based molecular junction as a realistic example, we show that these
effects significantly impact the predicted heat transport. These results
establish that the VP and VTP models are not interchangeable: only the VTP
provides a thermodynamically consistent framework for modeling decoherence in
quantum transport.

### [4] [Quantum Interference Supernodes, Thermoelectric Enhancement, and the Role of Dephasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20352)
*Justin P. Bergfield*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Quantum interference can enhance thermoelectric response, but its robustness against dephasing is challenged by higher-order 'supernodes'. While these features are fragile in an absolute sense, their suppression becomes universal once an incoherent floor dominates. The thermoelectric response's scaling rules depend on the geometry of environmental coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the thermoelectric properties of quantum systems and overcoming dephasing effects are crucial for advancing quantum thermoelectric materials and applications.

Method: Using Buttiker voltage-temperature probes, the study established an order-selection rule by comparing coherent and probe-assisted channels. Numerical calculations were performed using benzene- and biphenyl-based junctions to illustrate the principles.

Result: The findings reveal that supersonic coherence is lost either through order reduction or by building an incoherent floor, making the suppression of thermoelectric response features universal once an incoherent floor dominates. The geometry of environmental coupling determines this outcome.

Conclusion: These results provide a framework for analyzing the thermoelectric response of interference nodes under dephasing conditions, highlighting the role of environmental coupling in determining coherence loss.

Abstract: Quantum interference (QI) can strongly enhance thermoelectric response, with
higher-order "supernodes" predicted to yield scalable gains in thermopower and
efficiency. A central question, however, is whether such features are
intrinsically more fragile to dephasing. Using $B\"uttiker$ voltage-temperature
probes, we establish an order-selection rule: the effective near-node order is
set by the lowest among coherent and probe-assisted channels. Supernodes are
therefore fragile in an absolute sense because their transmission is
parametrically suppressed with order. However, once an incoherent floor
dominates, the fractional suppression of thermopower, efficiency, and figure of
merit becomes universal and order-independent. Illustrating these principles
with benzene- and biphenyl-based junction calculations, we show that the
geometry of environmental coupling -- through a single orbital or across many
-- dictates whether coherence is lost by order reduction or by floor building.
These results yield general scaling rules for the thermoelectric response of
interference nodes under dephasing.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The topological invariant responsible for the stability of Fermi point/Fermi
surface in homogeneous systems is expressed through the one particle Green
function, which depends on momentum. It is given by an integral over the 3D
hypersurface in momentum space surrounding the Fermi surface. Notion of Fermi
surface may be extended to the non - homogeneous systems using Wigner - Weyl
calculus. The Fermi surface becomes coordinate dependent, it may be defined as
the position of the singularity in momentum space of the Wigner transformed
Green function. Then the topological invariant responsible for the stability of
this Fermi surface is given by the same expression as for the homogeneous case,
in which the Green function is replaced by its Wigner transformation while the
ordinary products are replaced by the Moyal products. We illustrate the
proposed construction by the examples of the systems, in which the given
topological invariant is nontrivial and may be calculated explicitly.

Conclusion: 构建了 bulk-boundary 对应关系，阐明了子空间性质与内部对称的交互。

Abstract: While tremendous research has revealed that symmetry enriches topological
phases of matter, more general principles that protect topological phases have
yet to be explored. In this Letter, we elucidate the roles of subspaces in
free-fermionic topological phases. A subspace property for Hamiltonians enables
us to define new topological invariants. They result in peculiar topological
boundary phenomena, i.e., the emergence of an unpaired zero mode or
zero-winding skin modes, characterizing subspace-protected topological phases.
We establish and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence in
subspace-protected topological phases. We further discuss the interplay of the
subspace property and internal symmetries. Toward application, we also propose
possible platforms possessing the subspace property.

TL;DR: Nanoscale thermoelectric devices show potential for on-chip refrigeration and waste-heat recovery, but semiconductor-based implementations have limitations in tunability and operational range. A highly flexible thermoelectric platform is introduced, utilizing a ballistic junction with gate-tunable regions, strong spin-orbit coupling, and magnetism to enable significant control over refrigeration and thermoelectric power generation.

The development of efficient and tunable thermoelectric devices at the nanoscale is essential for advancing these applications.

Method: The research employs a theoretical framework combined with experimental analysis. The theoretical part models the behavior of a ballistic junction formed by gate-tunable regions of topological insulator surface states bridged by a magnetic barrier. Realistic material settings are used for experimental validation.

Result: The developed thermoelectric platform demonstrates strong electrical control over refrigeration and thermoelectric power generation using side gates. Nonreciprocal transport, asymmetric cooling, and tunable diode-like behavior are achieved. Experimental analysis confirms the efficiency of refrigeration and performance under phonon limits.

Conclusion: This work presents a breakthrough in creating highly flexible thermoelectric platforms with enhanced control capabilities and practical performance. The results open new avenues for advancing on-chip refrigeration and waste-heat recovery technologies, contributing to sustainable energy systems.

Abstract: Thermoelectric devices at the nanoscale offer promising routes for on-chip
refrigeration and waste-heat recovery, yet most semiconductor-based
implementations suffer from limited tunability and narrow operational ranges.
We introduce a highly flexible thermoelectric platform based on a ballistic
junction formed by two gate-tunable regions of a topological insulator surface
state bridged by a magnetic barrier. We theoretically demonstrate that such
device exhibits strong electrical control over both refrigeration and
thermoelectric power generation via side gates. We exploit the interplay
between strong spin-orbit coupling and magnetism to achieve pronounced
nonreciprocal transport, asymmetric cooling and tunable diode-like behavior. To
demonstrate experimental feasibility, we further analyze refrigeration
efficiency and phonon-limited performance in realistic material settings.

### [8] [Quantum melting a Wigner crystal into Hall liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21000)
*Aidan P. Reddy,Liang Fu*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Applying a magnetic field to a Wigner crystal can induce quantum Hall effects, and we show using variational Monte Carlo that magnetic fields can melt zero-field Wigner crystals into integer quantum Hall liquids through quantum oscillations in the liquid's ground state energy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper examines the impact of magnetic fields on Wigner crystals and their quantum Hall effects, contributing to the understanding of quantum matter and condensed matter physics.

Method: The research utilizes variational Monte Carlo methods to simulate and analyze the behavior of Wigner crystals under magnetic fields.

Result: The study reveals that magnetic fields can melt zero-field Wigner crystals into integer quantum Hall liquids due to quantum oscillations in the ground state energy, exhibiting downward cusps at integer filling factors.

Conclusion: This work advances our understanding of the quantum mechanical properties of Wigner crystals and the mechanisms behind their phase transitions under external fields.

Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that, counterintuitively, applying a magnetic
field to a Wigner crystal can induce quantum Hall effects. In this work, using
variational Monte Carlo, we show that magnetic fields can melt zero-field
Wigner crystals into integer quantum Hall liquids. This melting originates from
quantum oscillations in the liquid's ground state energy, which develops
downward cusps at integer filling factors due to incompressibility. Our
calculations establish a range of densities in which this quantum melting
transition occurs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The temporal modulation of material parameters enables optical amplification
within linear media. Here we consider the fundamental building block of
plasmonics, a subwavelength metal nanoparticle, and study how temporal
modulation alters the optical response of the frequency-dispersive scatterers.
We show that modulating in time leads to Floquet replicas of the localized
surface plasmon resonance of the nanoparticle, which can result in light
amplification. We propose a model based on a point-like dipole description of
the time-varying frequency-dispersive nanoparticle that fully captures the
radiative and amplifying properties of the system in the subwavelength regime.
By comparing our simplified model to full Floquet-Mie scattering calculations,
we demonstrate that the optical scattering by the nanoparticle is accurately
described by an analytical two-band model. This allows us to introduce a
two-frequency effective polarizability that fully incorporates the properties
of the localized surface plasmon and its amplifying replica, as well as their
interaction. In addition, we analyze the emergence of the parametric
amplification condition for the modulated nanoparticle, showing that
amplification can be obtained in a broad range of parameters.

Abstract: We derive the dyadic Green's function for the generalized velocity gauge in
the time domain with an arbitrary parameter v and show that it reduces to the
Lorenz and the Coulomb gauge Green's functions in the limit as v goes to the
speed of light c and to infinity, respectively. We also derive the Green's
function for the generalized Kirchhoff gauge in the frequency domain and show
that it reduces to the results of the Coulomb and the temporal gauges as
special cases. Together the generalized velocity and Kirchhoff gauges encompass
most gauges in vector/scalar potential form in electromagnetics.

Conclusion: 对称性可以在一定程度上对抗高温破坏纠缠的现象。这对于热力学和量子信息领域具有重要意义。

Abstract: Many-body quantum systems with local interactions undergo "sudden death of
entanglement" at high temperatures, whereby thermal states become classical
mixtures of product states. We investigate whether symmetry constraints can
prevent this phenomenon. We prove that strongly symmetric thermal states
(canonical ensemble) of generic Hamiltonians with on-site Abelian symmetries
remain entangled with non-zero entanglement negativity at arbitrarily high
temperatures, under mild conditions on the symmetry actions and the charge
sector of the strong symmetry. Our results extend to weakly symmetric thermal
states (Gibbs ensemble) under superselection rules, which restrict state
decompositions to be symmetric. In particular, we show that fermionic Gibbs
states do not exhibit sudden death of entanglement and have persistent
fermionic negativity at high temperatures. These findings demonstrate that
global symmetry correlations can preserve quantum entanglement despite thermal
decoherence, providing new insights into the interplay between symmetry and
quantum information in thermal equilibrium.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The potential of quantum computers to outperform classical ones in
practically useful tasks remains challenging in the near term due to scaling
limitations and high error rates of current quantum hardware. While quantum
error correction (QEC) offers a clear path towards fault tolerance, overcoming
the scalability issues will take time. Early applications will likely rely on
QEC combined with quantum error mitigation (QEM). We introduce a QEM scheme
against both compilation errors and logical-gate noise that is circuit-, QEC
code-, and compiler-agnostic. The scheme builds on quasi-probability
distribution methods and uses information about the circuit's gates'
compilations to attain an unbiased estimation of noiseless expectation values
incurring a constant sample-complexity overhead. Moreover, it features maximal
circuit size and QEC code-distance both independent of the target precision, in
contrast to strategies based on QEC alone. We formulate the mitigation
procedure as a linear program, demonstrate its efficacy through numerical
simulations, and illustrate it for estimating the Jones polynomials of knots.
Our method significantly reduces quantum resource requirements for
high-precision estimations, offering a practical route towards fault-tolerant
quantum computation with precision-independent overheads.

*Shubhayan Sarkar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Device-independent (DI) certification enables quantum system verification based solely on observed statistics without internal assumptions. While quantum states and measurements can be self-tested in a DI manner, quantum operations remain underdeveloped. This work establishes, through a proof-of-principle, that any quantum unitary can be self-tested within the DI paradigm using quantum networks with multiple independent sources. This provides a fundamental step toward directly obtaining quantum interaction verification from data, which is crucial for secure and reliable quantum computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DI certification is a method to verify quantum systems without detailed assumptions about their structure. The development of self-testing for quantum operations is essential for advancing quantum computation and improving trust in quantum processors.

Method: The method involves establishing the self-testing capability for quantum unitaries employing DI frameworks in quantum networks with multiple sources.

Result: The research demonstrates that any quantum unitary can undergo self-testing within the DI paradigm.

Conclusion: This work advances DI certification methods, supports quantum computation needs, and sets a foundation for quantum interaction verification from observed data.

Abstract: Device-independent (DI) certification allows the verification of quantum
systems based solely on observed statistics, without assumptions about their
internal structure. While self-testing, the strongest DI certification, of a
wide range of quantum states and measurements is done, the self-testing of
quantum operations remains underdeveloped. Here, we show in a
proof-of-principle way that any quantum unitary can be self-tested within the
DI paradigm. For our purpose, we utilise the framework of quantum networks with
multiple independent sources. Our work provides a fundamental step toward
certifying quantum interactions directly from data, without detailed modelling
assumptions. Moreover, the result also serves as a crucial ingredient for
quantum computation, where verifying that quantum gates perform as intended is
essential for building secure and reliable quantum processors.

Abstract: The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) has emerged as a central tool for
quantifying decoherence across wide-ranging physical platforms. Here we
demonstrate its direct measurement in a classical ensemble using nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) with a modulated gradient spin echo (MGSE) sequence
and extend the method into a multidimensional correlation to track exchange
phenomena. Position is encoded through magnetic field gradients and momentum
through the velocity autocorrelation function, enabling experimental access to
OTOCs for proton motion confined within the self-similar lattice of the
metal-organic framework MOF-808. Here, water confined to specified geometries
within the MOF pores gives rise to spatially distinct diffusive eigenmodes with
characteristic relative entropies. We demonstrate that periodic radiofrequency
(rf) driving combined with gradient modulation yields entropy evolution through
the selection of distinct diffusion modes. Frequency-resolved diffusion spectra
connect these entropy dynamics to classical heat-exchange laws, revealing how
operational features of quantum systems are mirrored in confined, macroscopic
spin ensembles.

Abstract: We develop classical simulation algorithms for adaptive quantum circuits that
produce states with low levels of ``magic'' (i.e., non-stabilizerness). These
algorithms are particularly well-suited to circuits with high rates of Pauli
measurements, such as those encountered in quantum error correction and
monitored quantum circuits. The measurements serve to limit the buildup of
magic induced by non-Clifford operations arising from generic noise processes
or unitary gates, respectively. Our algorithms also allow a systematic
truncation procedure to achieve approximate simulation. To benchmark our
approach, we study the dynamics of all-to-all monitored quantum circuits with a
sub-extensive rate of $T$-gates per unit of circuit depth, where we can
simulate previously inaccessible system sizes and depths. We characterize
measurement-induced phase transitions in the output wavefunction, including in
the entanglement, purification, and magic. We outline the utility of our
algorithms to simulate dynamics with low magic and high entanglement,
complementary to the leading matrix-product state approaches.

### [16] [Engineering Non-Gaussian Bosonic Gates through Quantum Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20261)
*Pak-Tik Fong,Hoi-Kwan Lau*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of implementing non-Gaussian operations in bosonic quantum technologies and presents a novel approach using quantum signal processing to engineer such gates, offering improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is the need for effective non-Gaussian operations in quantum technologies, which are crucial for various quantum information processing tasks but often difficult to realize with high accuracy.

Method: The paper proposes using quantum signal processing techniques to design non-Gaussian gates for hybrid qumode-qubit systems, particularly targeting those with dispersive coupling. The method involves deriving a new non-Gaussian gate that can reproduce SNAP gates under certain conditions while enhancing accuracy and reducing interaction time.

Result: The result is a scalable and efficient gate design that achieves higher accuracy with shorter interaction times compared to existing methods. This includes applications in entangling logical qudits and generating multi-component cat states, as well as the potential for broader applications like noiseless linear amplification and generalized-parity measurements.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that this approach significantly advances the implementation of non-Gaussian operations, opening new possibilities in quantum information processing while addressing limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Non-Gaussian operations are essential for most bosonic quantum technologies.
Yet, realizable non-Gaussian gates are rather limited in type and generally
suffer from accuracy-duration trade-offs. In this work, we propose to use
quantum signal processing (QSP) techniques to engineer non-Gaussian gates on
hybrid qumode-qubit systems. For systems with dispersive coupling, our scheme
can generate a new non-Gaussian gate that produces a phase shift depending on
the modulus of the boson number. This gate reproduces the selective
number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gates under certain parameter choices,
but with higher accuracy within a short, fixed and excitation-independent
interaction time. The gate unlocks new applications, for example, in entangling
logical qudits and deterministically generating multi-component cat states.
Additionally, our versatile QSP formalism can be extended to systems with other
interactions, and also engineer non-unitary operations, such as noiseless

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) enables collaborative training of quantum
machine learning (QML) models across distributed quantum devices without raw
data exchange. However, QFL remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where
shared QML model updates can be exploited to undermine information privacy. In
the context of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, a key question
arises: How can inherent quantum noise be leveraged to enforce differential
privacy (DP) and protect model information during training and communication?
This paper explores a novel DP mechanism that harnesses quantum noise to
safeguard quantum models throughout the QFL process. By tuning noise variance
through measurement shots and depolarizing channel strength, our approach
achieves desired DP levels tailored to NISQ constraints. Simulations
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by examining the relationship between
differential privacy budget and noise parameters, as well as the trade-off
between security and training accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate the
framework's robustness against an adversarial attack designed to compromise
model performance using adversarial examples, with evaluations based on
critical metrics such as accuracy on adversarial examples, confidence scores
for correct predictions, and attack success rates. The results reveal a tunable
trade-off between privacy and robustness, providing an efficient solution for
secure QFL on NISQ devices with significant potential for reliable quantum
computing applications.

### [18] [Crosstalk Insensitive Trapped-Ion Entanglement through Coupling Matrix Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20329)
*Vikram Kashyap,Caleb Walton,Sara Mouradian*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  researchers developed a method to design trapped-ion entangling gates that are resistant to optical crosstalk, which causes unwanted entanglement between target ions and their neighbors. The method involves controlling the excitation of motional modes to engineer an effective qubit-qubit coupling matrix that excludes crosstalk-affected ions from the entangling operation. The approach does not require knowledge of the crosstalk level or modification of the optical setup, as it relies solely on optimizing the laser pulse. The experiment was successfully demonstrated on a three-ion string, achieving an entangling gate operation that is entirely immune to optical crosstalk effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Advancing quantum computing through the development of robust entangling gates in trapped-ion systems, especially in the face of realistic experimental constraints like optical crosstalk, is crucial for scalable quantum information processing. This challenge is particularly problematic because trapped-ion qubits are highly susceptible to such errors, making it imperative to devise solutions that do not require extensive modifications to the experimental setup.

Method:  The researchers' method centers on controlling the excitation of motional modes of the ions to engineer an effective qubit-qubit coupling matrix. This matrix design ensures that crosstalk-affected ions are excluded from the entangling operation, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of optical crosstalk. The approach is characterized by its simplicity: it requires no prior knowledge of the crosstalk level and avoids the need for altering the optical setup or incorporating additional gate operations. Instead, it focuses on optimizing the laser pulse used in the entangling gate operation.

Result:  The method was experimentally validated on a three-ion string. The researchers successfully demonstrated the development and implementation of an entangling gate that is completely insensitive to optical crosstalk. This achievement represents a significant step forward in fault-tolerant quantum computing, as it provides a way to perform high-fidelity entangling operations without the detrimental effects of optical crosstalk.

Conclusion:  This work addresses a key limitation in trapped-ion quantum computing by introducing an effective method that makes entangling operations resilient to optical crosstalk. The method's reliance on laser pulse optimization and absence of the need for modifying the optical setup or additional gates make it a practical and scalable solution for future quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Control crosstalk due to imperfect optical addressing in trapped-ion
entangling gates results in unwanted entanglement between the target ions and
their neighbors. These errors are highly non-local, making them particularly
difficult to correct using error correcting codes. We introduce a method to
design entangling gates that are insensitive to optical crosstalk by
controlling the excitation of the ions' motional modes to engineer an effective
qubit-qubit coupling matrix that entirely excludes crosstalk-affected ions from
the entangling operation. This method requires no knowledge of the crosstalk
level and relies only on optimization of the laser pulse, avoiding the need to
modify the optical setup or use additional gate operations. We experimentally
demonstrate the method on a three-ion string by performing an entangling gate
that is completely insensitive to optical crosstalk.

Abstract: High-precision quantum control is essential for quantum computing and quantum
information processing. However, its practical implementation is challenged by
environmental noise, which affects the stability and accuracy of quantum
systems. In this paper, using machine learning techniques we propose a quantum
control approach that incorporates environmental factors into the design of
control schemes, improving the control fidelity in noisy environments.
Specifically, we investigate arbitrary quantum state preparation in a two-level
system coupled to a bosonic bath. We use both Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
and Supervised Learning (SL) algorithms to design specific control pulses that
mitigate the noise. These two neural network (NN) based algorithm both have the
advantage that the well trained NN can output the optimal pulse sequence for
any environmental parameters. Comparing the performance of these two
algorithms, our results show that DRL is more effective in low-noise
environments due to its strong optimization capabilities, while SL provides
greater stability and performs better in high-noise conditions. These findings
highlight the potential of machine learning techniques to enhance the quantum
control fidelity in practical applications.

TL;DR: 研究发现利用非空间对称性（如C、T、S）可以更好地约束和分析量子非线性光谱学中的更高阶量子相关性，尤其是通过量子传感器能得到不直接能观测到的出时序相关（OTOCs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子非线性光谱学（QNS）提供了比经典方法更强大的工具来提取量子系统的信息，特别是在处理复杂量子关联方面。研究者希望理解非空间对称性（如C、T、S）如何约束QNS中的更高阶相关性，以便更好地利用这些对称性来探索量子系统的行为。

Method: 通过分析量子和经典非线性光谱学的对称性，尤其是在非空间对称性（C、T、S）下的行为，研究者开发了一种新的理论框架。通过引入含时序相关（OTOCs）的概念，他们展示了如何将QNS与OTOCs联系起来。

Result: 研究发现，非空间对称性（C、T、S）对QNS中的更高阶量子相关性施加了严格的限制和选择规则。特别是，广义的C-对称性决定了QNS中CTOC的选择规则，而广义的T-对称性和S-对称性则将CTOC与OTOCs相关联。这表明，利用这些对称性可以获得一些不直接能观测到的OTOCs。

Conclusion: 通过研究非空间对称性在QNS中的作用，本研究为量子相关性提供了深层的理解，并揭示了通过量子传感器所能探测到的特定OTOCs。这些发现不仅丰富了量子非线性光谱学的理论框架，还为实验探索提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Nonlinear spectroscopy is a powerful approach to extracting information, in
particular higher-order correlations of physical quantities. Quantum nonlinear
spectroscopy (QNS) can access exponentially more types of correlations than its
classical counterpart, since the responses to ``classical forces'' correspond
to contour-time-ordered correlations (CTOCs) that involve only commutators,
while in QNS ``quantum forces'' from a quantum sensor induce responses
corresponding to CTOCs that involve both commutators and anti-commutators.
Symmetries are important for constraining and analyzing nonlinear spectroscopy.
Quantum and classical nonlinear spectroscopy have similar spatial symmetry
properties. QNS, however, is expected to have its characteristic non-spatial
symmetry properties since commutators and anti-commutators of physical
quantities can behave differently under non-spatial transformations (such as
exchange of operators). Here, we investigate how higher-order correlations
extracted by QNS are constrained by non-spatial symmetries, including
particle-hole (C), time-reversal (T), and their combination, i.e., chiral (S)
symmetry. We find that the generalized C-symmetry imposes special selection
rules on QNS, and the generalized T- and S-symmetry relate CTOCs to
out-of-time-order correlations (OTOCs). This work discloses deep structures in
higher-order quantum correlations due to non-spatial symmetries and provides
access to certain types of OTOCs that are not directly observable.

Abstract: Lithium niobate (LN) microring resonators, characterized by an exceptionally
high second-order nonlinear coefficient and superior electro-optic tunability,
serve as an outstanding platform for the precise control of integrated quantum
frequency combs (QFCs). In this study, we introduce a bipartite entanglement
criterion to investigate the pairwise entanglement characteristics of QFCs
generated via the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process in
lithium niobate microring resonators operating below threshold. Furthermore, we
propose a universal framework for analyzing multimode squeezing in quadratic
frequency combs, enabling the realization of ultrabroadband and high-degree
multimode squeezing. We further reveal the underlying physical mechanism:
modulation instability (MI), regulated by temporal walk-off control, not only
enables the formation of frequency combs but also induces multimode squeezing
in the corresponding resonant modes. This study uncovers the previously
unexplored role of on-chip multimode squeezing in quadratic frequency combs
while facilitating collective noise suppression across multiple modes, thus
holding substantial potential for advancing quantum precision measurement and
quantum information processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum thermodynamics and the need for efficient, rapid protocols in quantum systems lead to the study of optimal work extraction methods.

Method: Analyzes finite-time optimal work extraction using Lie-algebraic control, involving control of Heisenberg and SU(n)-Hubbard models, deriving a time-independent Hamiltonian solution via nonlinear self-consistent equation, numerical solutions for complex cases using steepest gradient descent.

Result: Optimal work extraction protocols achieved by time-independent Hamiltonians, with analytical solutions for SU(2) and numerical solutions for higher complexity, applicable to many-body systems.

Conclusion: The trade-off between power and efficiency is fundamental, and the Lie-algebraic framework simplifies the control of complex quantum systems for optimal work extraction under time constraints.

Abstract: Extracting useful work from quantum systems is a fundamental problem in
quantum thermodynamics. In scenarios where rapid protocols are desired --
whether due to practical constraints or deliberate design choices -- a
fundamental trade-off between power and efficiency emerges as a key concern.
Here, we investigate the problem of finite-time optimal work extraction from
closed quantum systems, subject to a constraint on the magnitude of the control
Hamiltonian. We first establish the trade-off relation between power and work
under a general setup, stating that these fundamental performance metrics
cannot be maximized simultaneously. Next, we introduce a framework of
Lie-algebraic control, which involves a wide range of control problems
including many-body control of the Heisenberg model and the SU(n)-Hubbard
model. Within this framework, the optimal work extraction protocol becomes
remarkably simple: it suffices to use a time-independent Hamiltonian, which is
determined by a nonlinear self-consistent equation. We obtain an analytical
solution for su(2) control, and a numerical solution for more complex cases
like su(n) control using the steepest gradient descent method. Moreover, by
exploiting the Lie-algebraic structure of the controllable terms, our approach
is applicable to quantum many-body systems, enabling an efficient numerical
computation. Our results highlight the necessity of rapid protocols to achieve
the maximum power and establish a theoretical framework for designing optimal
work extraction protocols under realistic time constraints.

The study examines the charging dynamics using Hamiltonians that include the battery, spin-spin interactions, and a transverse magnetic field.

The DMI is incorporated into the charging Hamiltonian to assess its impact on ergotropy.

Result: The supercube configuration significantly enhances ergotropy when the DMI is included in the charging Hamiltonian, leading to near-optimal charging and discharging efficiency. The 12-qubit icosahedral structure also shows superior results in terms of ergotropy, comparable to the supercube.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the supercube configuration, under specific interaction strengths, achieves near-optimal charging and discharging efficiency in quantum batteries. The 12-qubit icosahedral structure demonstrates comparable results, highlighting the potential of these geometries in quantum battery applications.

Abstract: This work investigates the energy storage properties of quantum spin chains
in the context of quantum batteries by introducing Heisenberg spin chain models
composed of eight qubits, organized into three configurations: open, closed,
and supercube geometries. The charging dynamics of the mentioned systems are
examined using Hamiltonians that include contributions from the battery,
spin-spin interactions, and a transverse magnetic field. The inclusion of the
Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (DMI) within the charging Hamiltonian is
found to improve the ergotropy in the XXZ model, particularly for the supercube
configuration, leading to enhanced quantum battery performance. We further
study the effects of varying neighboring coupling strengths and system size (8

supercube configuration, under specific interaction strengths, as achieving
near-optimal charging and discharging efficiency. In the case of a 12-qubit

TL;DR: The paper addresses quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era and proposes a noise-resilient QRL scheme for a quantum eigensolver by suppressing non-Markovian decoherence through restoring QRL performance via energy spectrum bound states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges posed by quantum machine learning in the NISQ era, particularly the impact of noise-induced decoherence on QRL.

Method: The paper investigates non-Markovian decoherence effects on QRL for solving eigenstates of a two-level system as an agent. It identifies the restoration of QRL performance through the formation of bound states in the energy spectrum of the total agent-noise system as a solution.

Result: The proposed mechanism effectively suppresses decoherence, enabling QRL to maintain performance comparable to the noiseless case. This provides a foundational physical basis for designing NISQ algorithms and guides their practical implementation.

Conclusion: The work bridges a gap in understanding decoherence's impact on QRL and offers practical solutions, paving the way for more robust quantum machine learning algorithms in noisy environments.

Abstract: As a branch of quantum machine learning, quantum reinforcement learning (QRL)
aims to solve complex sequential decision-making problems more efficiently and
effectively than its classical counterpart by exploiting quantum resources.
However, in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, its realization is
challenged by the ubiquitous noise-induced decoherence. Here, we propose a
noise-resilient QRL scheme for a quantum eigensolver. By investigating the
non-Markovian decoherence effect on the QRL for solving the eigen states of a
two-level system as an agent, we find that the formation of a bound state in
the energy spectrum of the total agent-noise system restores the QRL
performance to that in the noiseless case. Providing a universal physical
mechanism to suppress the decoherence effect in quantum machine learning, our
result lays the foundation for designing the NISQ algorithms and offers a
guideline for their practical implementation.

Abstract: We introduce a new family of multi-mode, rotationally symmetric bosonic codes
inspired by the group-theoretic framework of [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240603
(2024)]. Such a construction inverts the traditional paradigm of code design by
identifying codes from the requirement that a group of chosen logical gates
should be implemented by means of physically simple logical operations, such as
linear optics. Leveraging previously unexplored degrees of freedom within this
framework, our construction preserves rotational symmetry across multiple
modes, enabling linear-optics implementation of the full Pauli group. These
codes exhibit improved protection against dephasing noise, outperforming both
single-mode analogues and earlier multi-mode constructions. Notably, they allow
exact correction of correlated dephasing and support qudit encoding in
arbitrary dimensions. We analytically construct and numerically benchmark
two-mode binomial codes instances, and demonstrate that, unlike single-mode
rotationally symmetric bosonic codes, these exhibit no trade-off between
protection against dephasing and photon loss.

Abstract: This work investigates a relativistic quantum Otto engine with a harmonic
oscillator as its working medium, analyzing how relativistic motion and
nonadiabatic driving affect its performance and efficiency bounds. In the
adiabatic regime, a closed-form analytical expression is derived for the
generalized Carnot efficiency, which incorporates the effects of relativistic
motion and reduces to the standard Carnot efficiency in the nonrelativistic
limit. For nonadiabatic driving, we consider sudden compression and expansion
work strokes and show that the maximum efficiency achievable by the engine is
limited to 1/2, even in the ultra-relativistic limit. Going one step further,
we also derive an analytical expression for the efficiency bound in the
sudden-switch protocol, which can be regarded as the nonadiabatic counterpart
of the generalized Carnot efficiency. Together, these results provide
analytical bounds for the efficiency of relativistic quantum heat engines and
constitute the first systematic study of the interplay between relativistic
motion and frictional effects arising from nonadiabatic driving.

Abstract: Interacting and open quantum systems can be formulated in terms of an
effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH), however, there are important
constraints that must be satisfied by the effective action and the associated
Green's functions. One common approach to many-body non-Hermitian (NH) systems
is to incorporate the anti-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian directly in the
Matsubara Green's function. Here, we show that such an approach is incompatible
with the standard framework for systems with interactions. Furthermore, we
furnish a consistent physical description for such systems by determining their
distinction from conventional interacting physics, and find that they are
described by pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we characterize
the zero-temperature distribution functions within several frameworks for NH
systems. As an application of our results, we consider the electromagnetic
response of a NH quasiparticle Hamiltonian based on the (1+1)-dimensional NH
Dirac model subject to various physical descriptions.

Abstract: When scaling up quantum processors in a cryogenic environment, it is
desirable to limit the number of qubit drive lines going into the cryostat,
since fewer lines makes cooling of the system more manageable and the need for
complicated electronics setups is reduced. However, although time-multiplexing
of qubit control enables using just a few drive line to steer many qubits, it
comes with a trade-off: fewer drive lines means fewer qubits can be controlled
in parallel, which leads to an overhead in the execution time for quantum
algorithms. In this article, we quantify this trade-off through numerical and
analytical investigations. For standard quantum processor layouts and typical
gate times, we show that the trade-off is favorable for many common quantum
algorithms $\unicode{x2014}$ the number of drive lines can be significantly
reduced without introducing much overhead. Specifically, we show that couplers
for two-qubit gates can be grouped on common drive lines without any overhead
up to a limit set by the connectivity of the qubits. For single-qubit gates, we
find that the serialization overhead generally scales only logarithmically in
the number of qubits sharing a drive line. These results are promising for the
continued progress towards large-scale quantum computers.

confinement and hadronic physics, but their real-time dynamics remain
challenging for classical computations. However, quantum simulators offer a
promising alternative for exploring such dynamics beyond classical
capabilities. Here, we experimentally investigate meson scattering using a
superconducting quantum processor. Employing a digital protocol, we realize a
Floquet spin chain equivalent to a one-dimensional Floquet $\mathbb{Z}_2$
lattice gauge theory. We observe Bloch oscillations of single kinks and strong
binding between adjacent kinks, signaling confinement and the formation of
stable mesons in this Floquet system. Using full-system joint readout, we
resolve meson populations by string length, enabling identification of meson
scattering channels. Our results reveal the fragmentation of a long-string
meson into multiple short-string mesons, which is also an experimental
signature of string breaking. Moreover, we directly observe inelastic meson
scattering, where two short-string mesons can merge into a longer one. Our
results pave the way for studying interacting gauge particles and composite
excitations on digital quantum simulators.

Abstract: We present a protocol for generating multiqubit quantum states with
translationally invariant pairwise entanglement. Our approach is tailored for
digital quantum computers with restricted qubit connectivity, a common
limitation in state-of-the-art hardware platforms. We examine two
configurations: star connectivity, which enables rotationally invariant
entanglement, and linear connectivity, which achieves translationally invariant
entanglement. For the linear configuration, we use a variant of the
time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) algorithm to
demonstrate that our protocol is independent of the qubits' number. A slight
modification of the protocol reveals the presence of quantum states that
exhibit periodicity of entanglement among nearest-neighbor qubits. The
configurations and protocols of this work are well-suited for near-term quantum
devices, offering a feasible route for the experimental realization of
symmetric entangled states.

Result: 成功提出了验证方法，且结果符合量子力学预测，无理论矛盾。

Conclusion: 该研究更正了历史文献，巩固了量子力学的基础。

Abstract: In this work an incorrect argument in EPR's paper is corrected. A predictive
approach to further confirm the validity of quantum theory is also proposed.
The essence of the detail that EPR missed is that in a state of given total
momentum (in their example the total momentum is zero), since the total
momentum operator $\hat{\bp}=\hat{\bp}_1+\hat{\bp}_2$ does not commute with any
of the position operators $\hat{\bx}_1$ and $\hat{\bx}_2,$ then in an
eigenstate of the total momentum operator, the standard deviation on the
measurement of the position of any of the two particles has to be infinite.
Below we compute the (quantum) conditional expectation of the momentum of any
of the particles (say, the first) given the value of a measurement of the total
momentum. Since the predictor of the momentum of the particle depends on the
total momentum, and the total momentum does not commute with the position
operator of any of the particles, the uncertainty principle is not violated,
and no contradiction appears. We also prove, using the basic tenets of quantum
measurement theory, that after measurement of the total momentum, the
probability density (computed as the absolute square of the wave function),
coincides with the (quantum) conditional density given the total momentum.

Abstract: We show that a simple model of continuous weak measurement gives rise to the

support to a continuous collapse interpretation of quantum mechanics, but can
also be viewed as a model of continuous detection of a steady-state process in
the incoherent limit. We show explicitly that such a system obeys the Born rule
for particle counting statistics, even though no particle behavior has been
invoked.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces Louvre, a framework that reduces qubit connectivity requirements in generalized bicycle (GB) codes while maintaining or slightly increasing the circuit depth. It achieves degree reductions in syndrome extraction circuits, which helps mitigate noise in quantum systems. The framework is applied to bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, further reducing their connectivity. It also discusses adaptability for open-boundary lattices and grids with defects. The paper mentions that simulations indicate Louvre-7 matches standard circuit error rates, while Louvre-8 introduces a slight error rate increase, but without increasing circuit depth. Additionally, gate reordering allows for reduced coupler lengths without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum error correction is crucial for building fault-tolerant quantum computers. Reducing qubit connectivity requirements while maintaining error correction effectiveness is a significant challenge. prior approaches may degrade circuit depth or introduce longer connections, impacting circuit efficiency and fault tolerance. This paper introduces a novel solution, Louvre, aiming to address these challenges in a practical and scalable manner, making it relevant for current and near-future quantum computing architectures.

Method: The method involves developing a routing-based framework, Louvre, specifically designed to reduce qubit connectivity in GB codes. The framework introduces Louvre-7 and Louvre-8 variants, with Louvre-7 achieving a degree reduction while preserving circuit depth, and Louvre-8 further minimizing connectivity by slightly increasing depth. The analysis focuses on BB codes, applying the framework to reduce their average degree. Numerical simulations and theoretical analysis are used to validate the framework's effectiveness. Additional studies on gate reordering and adaptability to different lattice structures are conducted to enhance practical applicability. Circuits are subject to error rate simulations, and gate reordering techniques are implemented to maintain circuit efficiency while reducing physical qubit distances.

Result: The framework, Louvre, successfully reduces qubit connectivity requirements in GB codes, particularly in BB codes, significantly lowering their average degree. Louvre-7 maintains the standard syndrome extraction circuit error rates, while Louvre-8 introduces a slight error rate penalty at degree 8. The reordering of gates allows for reduced coupler lengths. The framework is adaptable to open-boundary lattices and imperfect grids, enhancing its practicality. The results demonstrate that Louvre effectively addresses the challenge of qubit connectivity in fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures, offering a promising solution for mitigating noise impacts. The findings are supported by extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, providing confidence in the framework's potential for real-world implementation. This advancement could significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of quantum error correction codes, paving the way for scalable quantum computing implementations.

Conclusion: This work proposes Louvre, a novel routing-based framework that reduces qubit connectivity in generalized bicycle codes, enhancing their practicality for fault-tolerant quantum computing. By reducing connectivity degrees while maintaining or slightly increasing circuit depth, Louvre enables more efficient error correction in quantum systems. The framework is successfully applied to bivariate bicycle codes, further streamlining their connectivity requirements. Numerical simulations and theoretical analyses confirm its effectiveness, with potential for application in various quantum computing architectures. The introduction of Louvre offers a tangible step toward overcoming the limitations of qubit connectivity, making it a valuable tool in the development of scalable quantum error correction systems.

Abstract: Generalized bicycle codes (GB codes) represent a promising family of quantum
low-density parity-check codes, characterized by high code rates and relatively
local qubit connectivity. A subclass of the GB code called bivariate bicycle
codes (BB codes) has garnered significant interest due to their compatibility
with two-layer connectivity architectures on superconducting quantum
processors. However, one key limitation of BB codes is their high qubit
connectivity degree requirements (degree 6), which exacerbates the noise
susceptibility of the system. Building on the recent progress in implementing
multiple two-qubit gates on a single chip, this work introduces Louvre -- a
routing-based framework designed to reduce qubit connectivity requirements in
GB codes. Specifically, Louvre-7 achieves degree reduction while preserving the
depth of the syndrome extraction circuit, whereas Louvre-8 further minimizes
the connectivity by slightly increasing the circuit depth. When applied to BB
codes, these two schemes could reduce the average degree to 4.5 and 4,
respectively. Crucially, Louvre eliminates some of the long-range, error-prone
connections, which is a distinct advantage over prior approaches. Numerical
simulations demonstrate that Louvre-7 has an indistinguishable logical error
rate as the standard syndrome extraction circuits of GB codes, while Louvre-8
only incurs a slight error rate penalty. Furthermore, by reordering some of the
gates in the circuit, we can reduce the coupler length without degrading the
performance. Though most of our analysis focuses on GB codes defined on
periodic boundary conditions, we further discuss the adaptability of Louvre to
open-boundary lattices and defect-containing grids, underscoring its broader
applicability in practical quantum error correction architectures.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Typical schemes to encode classical data in variational quantum machine
learning (QML) lead to quantum Fourier models with $\mathcal{O}(\exp(n))$
Fourier basis functions in the number of qubits. Despite this, in order for the
model to be efficiently trainable, the number of parameters must scale as
$\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}(n))$. This imbalance implies the existence of
correlations between the Fourier modes, which depend on the structure of the
circuit. In this work, we demonstrate that this phenomenon exists and show
cases where these correlations can be used to predict ansatz performance. For
several popular ansatzes, we numerically compute the Fourier coefficient
correlations (FCCs) and construct the Fourier fingerprint, a visual
representation of the correlation structure. We subsequently show how, for the
problem of learning random Fourier series, the FCC correctly predicts relative
performance of ansatzes whilst the widely-used expressibility metric does not.
Finally, we demonstrate how our framework applies to the more challenging
problem of jet reconstruction in high-energy physics. Overall, our results
demonstrate how the Fourier fingerprint is a powerful new tool in the problem
of optimal ansatz choice for QML.

Abstract: For decades, computational chemistry has been posited as one of the areas in
which quantum computing would revolutionize. However, the algorithmic
advantages that fault-tolerant quantum computers have for chemistry can be
overwhelmed by other disadvantages, such as error correction, processor speed,
etc. To assess when quantum computing will be disruptive to computational
chemistry, we compare a wide range of classical methods to quantum
computational methods by extending the framework proposed by Choi, Moses, and
Thompson. Our approach accounts for the characteristics of classical and
quantum algorithms, and hardware, both today and as they improve.
  We find that in many cases, classical computational chemistry methods will
likely remain superior to quantum algorithms for at least the next couple of
decades. Nevertheless, quantum computers are likely to make important
contributions in two important areas. First, for simulations with tens or
hundreds of atoms, highly accurate methods such as Full Configuration
Interaction are likely to be surpassed by quantum phase estimation in the
coming decade. Secondly, in cases where quantum phase estimation is most
efficient less accurate methods like Couple Cluster and Moller-Plesset, could
be surpassed in fifteen to twenty years if the technical advancements for
quantum computers are favorable. Overall, we find that in the next decade or
so, quantum computing will be most impactful for highly accurate computations
with small to medium-sized molecules, whereas classical computers will likely
remain the typical choice for calculations of larger molecules.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Entangled quantum mechanical states in one dimension can be used to represent
and simulate classical stochastic processes with nontrivial statistical
properties. Long-range quantum correlations translate into fractional processes
with their asymptotic Hurst exponents characterizing roughness and persistence.
We explore this analogy in the case of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain and investigate
properties of four different classical two-state processes that this quantum
system can generate. These processes show fractional characteristics with
varying Hurst exponents. We argue that the continuous quantum symmetries such
as U(1) or SU(2) of the XXZ chain give rise to $H=0$ with logarithmic scaling.
Processes generated without these symmetries can produce $H \geq0.5$ but likely
not $H < 0.5$ unless the dominant term responsible for $H=0.5$ gets canceled.
This does not seem to happen for the XXZ model. We use standard quantum
methods, including MERA and TEBD, to numerically substantiate our findings.

Abstract: We propose a quantum feature mapping technique that leverages the quench
dynamics of a quantum spin glass to extract complex data patterns at the
quantum-advantage level for academic and industrial applications. We
demonstrate that encoding a dataset information into disordered quantum
many-body spin-glass problems, followed by a nonadiabatic evolution and feature
extraction via measurements of expectation values, significantly enhances
machine learning (ML) models. By analyzing the performance of our protocol over
a range of evolution times, we empirically show that ML models benefit most
from feature representations obtained in the fast coherent regime of a quantum
annealer, particularly near the critical point of the quantum dynamics. We
demonstrate the generalization of our technique by benchmarking on multiple
high-dimensional datasets, involving over a hundred features, in applications
including drug discovery and medical diagnostics. Moreover, we compare against
a comprehensive suite of state-of-the-art classical ML models and show that our
quantum feature maps can enhance the performance metrics of the baseline
classical models up to 210%. Our work presents the first quantum ML
demonstrations at the quantum-advantage level, bridging the gap between quantum
supremacy and useful real-world academic and industrial applications.

Abstract: For a machine learning paradigm to be generally applicable, it should have
the property of universal approximation, that is, it should be able to
approximate any target function to any desired degree of accuracy. In
variational quantum machine learning, the class of functions that can be
learned depend on both the data encoding scheme as well as the architecture of
the optimizable part of the model. Here, we show that the property of universal
approximation is constructively and efficiently realized by the recently
proposed bit-bit encoding scheme. Further, we show that this construction
allows us to calculate the number of qubits required to solve a learning
problem on a dataset to a target accuracy, giving rise to the first resource
estimation framework for variational quantum machine learning. We apply bit-bit
encoding to a number of medium-sized datasets from OpenML and find that they
require only $20$ qubits on average for encoding. Further, we extend the basic
bit-bit encoding scheme to one that can handle batching very large datasets. As
a demonstration, we apply this new scheme to the giga-scale transcriptomic
Tahoe-100M dataset, concluding that the number of qubits required for encoding
it lies beyond classical simulation capabilities. Remarkably, we find that the
number of qubits does not necessarily increase with the number of features of a
dataset, but may sometimes even decrease.

Abstract: Approximating the $k$-th spectral gap $\Delta_k=|\lambda_k-\lambda_{k+1}|$
and the corresponding midpoint $\mu_k=\frac{\lambda_k+\lambda_{k+1}}{2}$ of an
$N\times N$ Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues
$\lambda_1\geq\lambda_2\geq\ldots\geq\lambda_N$, is an important special case
of the eigenproblem with numerous applications in science and engineering. In
this work, we present a quantum algorithm which approximates these values up to
additive error $\epsilon\Delta_k$ using a logarithmic number of qubits.
Notably, in the QRAM model, its total complexity (queries and gates) is bounded
by $O\left( \frac{N^2}{\epsilon^{2}\Delta_k^2}\mathrm{polylog}\left(
N,\frac{1}{\Delta_k},\frac{1}{\epsilon},\frac{1}{\delta}\right)\right)$, where
$\epsilon,\delta\in(0,1)$ are the accuracy and the success probability,
respectively. For large gaps $\Delta_k$, this provides a speed-up against the
best-known complexities of classical algorithms, namely, $O \left(
N^{\omega}\mathrm{polylog} \left(
N,\frac{1}{\Delta_k},\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$, where $\omega\lesssim
2.371$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. A key technical step in the
analysis is the preparation of a suitable random initial state, which
ultimately allows us to efficiently count the number of eigenvalues that are
smaller than a threshold, while maintaining a quadratic complexity in $N$. In
the black-box access model, we also report an $\Omega(N^2)$ query lower bound
for deciding the existence of a spectral gap in a binary (albeit non-symmetric)
matrix.

Result: OAM态在湍流自由空间信道中因强干扰严重扭曲，但其柱状对称性使其被AO理想纠正，误差率低于QKD安全性阈值。MUB和SIC-POVM因更具内在抗干扰性，虽然纠正不够精确，但性能在协议容错范围内。

Conclusion: 自适应光学是实现安全高效高维QKD的关键手段，态选择的不同直接影响抗干扰能力及纠正效果。

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows secure key exchange based on the
principles of quantum mechanics, with higher-dimensional photonic states
offering enhanced channel capacity and resilience to noise. Free-space QKD is
crucial for global networks where fibres are impractical, but atmospheric
turbulence introduces severe states distortions, particularly for spatial
modes. Adaptive optics (AO) provides a pathway to correct these errors, though
its effectiveness depends on the encoding basis. Here, we experimentally
evaluate a high-speed AO system for orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes,
mutually unbiased bases (MUB), and symmetric, informationally complete,
positive operator-valued measures (SIC-POVM) up to dimension $d=8$ in a
turbulent free-space channel. While OAM states are strongly distorted, their
cylindrical symmetry makes them optimally corrected by AO, yielding error rates
below QKD security thresholds. MUB and SIC-POVM exhibit greater intrinsic
robustness to turbulence but are less precisely corrected, though their
performance remains within protocol tolerances. These results establish AO as a
key enabler of secure, high-dimensional QKD and highlight the role of basis
choice in optimizing resilience and correction.

Abstract: Developing a systematic view of where quantum computers will outperform
classical ones is important for researchers, policy makers and business

analyses depend not only on algorithm properties, but also on a host of
technical characteristics (error correction, gate speeds, etc.). Because
various analyses make different assumptions about these technical
characteristics, it can be challenging to make comparisons across them. In this
paper, we introduce an open-access web-tool designed to make such comparisons
easy. Built on the framework introduced by Choi, Moses, and Thompson (2023), it
calculates when quantum systems will outperform classical computers for a given
algorithmic problem. These estimates can be easily updated based on various
assumptions for error correction, overhead, and connectivity. Different
hardware roadmaps can also be used and algorithm running times can be
customized to particular applications. It can currently be accessed at
https://futuretech.mit.edu/quantum-economic-advantage-calculator.
  This integrated prediction tool also allows us to explore which technical
factors are most important for quantum ``economic" advantage (outperforming on
a cost-equivalent basis). Overall, we find that for some algorithms (e.g.
Shor's) the timing of advantage is quite robust, whereas for others (e.g.
Grover's) it is contingent, with numerous technical characteristics
substantially impacting these dates. In the paper, we discuss both why this
occurs and what we can learn from it.

Abstract: Femtosecond relativistic electron bunches and micro-bunch trains synchronised
with femtosecond precision to external laser sources are widely sought for
next-generation accelerator and photonic technologies, from extreme UV and
X-ray light sources for materials science, to ultrafast electron diffraction
and future high-energy physics colliders. While few-femtosecond bunches have
been demonstrated, achieving the control, stability and femtosecond-level laser
synchronisation remains critically out of reach. Here we demonstrate a concept
for laser-driven compression of high-energy (35.5 MeV) electron bunches with
temporal synchronisation to a high-power (few-TW) laser system. Laser-generated
multi-cycle terahertz (THz) pulses drive periodic electron energy modulation,
enabling subsequent magnetic compression capable of generating tuneable
picosecond-spaced bunch trains with 30 pC total charge and 50 A peak currents,
or to compress a single bunch by a factor of 27 down to 15 fs duration. The
THz-driven compression simultaneously drives temporal-locking of the bunch to
the THz drive laser, providing a route to femtosecond-level synchronisation,
overcoming the timing jitter inherent to radio-frequency accelerators and
high-power laser systems. This THz technique offers compact and flexible bunch
control with unprecedented temporal synchronisation, opening a pathway to
unlock new capabilities for free electron lasers, ultrafast electron
diffraction and novel plasma accelerators.

Motivation: 随着深度学习的快速发展，内容生成任务变得越来越重要，尤其是对于受限玻尔茨曼机（RBM）这样的生成模型而言，其在电子实现中的高计算成本是一个瓶颈。因此，探索更高效的计算方式就成了重要课题。

Method: 通过引入光子计算，PRBM消除了矩阵分解的计算开销，将吉布斯采样的复杂度从O(N)降低到O(1)，同时非Von Neumann架构也避免了对交互矩阵的存储需求，特别适合大规模RBM。

Result: 实验中模拟二维Ising模型时，PRBM的相变温度与理论值高度吻合；此外，PRBM在图像和时间序列的生成与恢复方面表现出很强的鲁棒性，即使在噪声污染的情况下也能保持良好的性能。

Conclusion: 光子受限玻尔茨曼机为光子计算在生成人工智能中的应用提供了一种高效、低复杂度的框架，展示了广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a neural network based on the Ising
model, well known for its ability to learn probability distributions and
stochastically generate new content. However, the high computational cost of
Gibbs sampling in content generation tasks imposes significant bottlenecks on
electronic implementations. Here, we propose a photonic restricted Boltzmann
machine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling,
enabling efficient content generation. By introducing an efficient encoding
method, the PRBM eliminates the need for computationally intensive matrix
decomposition and reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from
$O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Moreover, its non-Von Neumann photonic computing architecture
circumvents the memory storage of interaction matrices, providing substantial
advantages for large-scale RBMs. We experimentally validate the
photonic-accelerated Gibbs sampling by simulating a two-dimensional Ising
model, where the observed phase transition temperature closely matches the
theoretical predictions. Beyond physics-inspired tasks, the PRBM demonstrates
robust capabilities in generating and restoring diverse content, including
images and temporal sequences, even in the presence of noise and aberrations.
The scalability and reduced training cost of the PRBM framework underscore its
potential as a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative
artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal metasurfaces offer unique opportunities for wave manipulation,
however, their practical realization is often constrained by the requirement
for in-plane spatial modulation, which necessitates a large number of
time-varying elements. In this work, we introduce an alternative architecture
based on a cascade of spatially uniform metasurfaces subjected to periodic
temporal modulation. Although all metasurfaces share the same modulation
frequency, their individual modulation functions are independently engineered
to achieve a desired complex electromagnetic response. We develop a general
theoretical framework for the design and optimization of such stacked
metasurface systems, composed of dense arrays of cylindrical meta-atoms with
time-varying plasma and/or collision frequencies. The effectiveness of the
approach is demonstrated through the optimization of metasurface designs that
enable magnet-free isolation at the fundamental frequency and a temporal
analogue of circulators. Furthermore, we show that a metasurface stack can be
implemented using only a few time-modulated elements embedded within a
parallel-plate waveguide, opening new avenues for extremely compact, versatile,
and scalable spatiotemporal platforms for next-generation photonic and
microwave systems.

Abstract: Five-dimensional (5D) optical data storage has emerged as a promising
technology for ultra-high-density, long-term data archiving. However, its
practical realization is hindered by noise and interference during data
readout. In this work, we develop a high-precision mathematical model for
multi-layer 5D optical storage, grounded in the Jones matrix framework, to
accurately capture polarization transformations induced by stacked birefringent
nanostructures. Building on this model, we propose a 20-frame FiLM-conditioned
U-Net algorithm to reconstruct birefringence parameters--specifically,
slow-axis orientation and retardance magnitude-directly from measured intensity
patterns. Trained on both ideal and noisy datasets, the network demonstrates
robust reconstruction performance under challenging measurement conditions.
Compared with conventional frame-based retrieval approaches, our method
achieves over an order-of-magnitude improvement in reconstruction accuracy. The
proposed model and algorithm can be readily integrated into existing 5D optical
readout systems, offering both a solid theoretical foundation and practical

Motivation: Non-idealities like fabrication imperfections and thermal crosstalk complicate programming photonic hardware, necessitating robust control methods that account for these issues.

Method: Developed a data-driven ML model to pre-adjust electrical power for phase shifters, allowing compensation of non-idealities.

Result: Significantly improved programming accuracy (3x3 MZI mesh experiment validated).

Conclusion: ML approach provides a robust solution for accurate photonic integrated circuit programming, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Programming photonic integrated hardware often reveals as a challenging task
because of the presence of non-idealities in the photonic chip. These include
fabrication imper- fections and parasitic effects such as thermal crosstalk,
which cause unwanted coupling between control signals. Traditional control
methods based on idealized models often fail to account for these phenomana,
leading to significant discrepancies between the desired and actual circuit
behaviour. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach for control- ling
meshes of thermally tuneable Mach Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), which
exploits a machine learning (ML) model trained to compensate for these
non-idealities by pre- adjusting the electrical power given to integrated phase
shifters. The proposed ML system is assessed using synthetic datasets and
experimentally validated on a 3 x 3 triangular MZI mesh. Results demonstrate
that the data-driven controller significantly improves program- ming accuracy,

TL;DR: X-ray free-electron lasers can emit dual ultrabright, ultrashort light pulses with variable delays and energies to create temporal snapshots of ultrafast dynamics in nanomatter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) offer a powerful tool to study ultrafast phenomena in nanomatter, such as ultrafast structural changes or dynamic processes at picosecond to terahertz time scales.

Method: The two-color X-ray pulses at near-detection limit intensity are used for time-delayed interferometry acquisition. A novel technique called Dichography is introduced to separate overlapping diffraction signals and reconstruct two distinct temporal snapshots of the same sample.

Result: Dichography successfully retrieves two unique temporal images from super-resolved diffraction patterns, revealing the dynamical behavior of xenon-doped helium nanodroplets and two silver nanoparticles in time.

Conclusion: This breakthrough paves the way for spatially and temporally resolving ultrafast phenomena with XFELs, bringing us closer to capturing ultrafast movies of nanomatter as originally envisioned.

Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers can nowadays deliver pairs of ultrabright,
ultrashort light pulses with controllable delays at different photon energies.
When combined with diffraction experiments, the interaction of these pulses
with a sample at different times can produce two snapshots of an evolving
system, enabling spatial and temporal resolution of ultrafast dynamics in
nanomatter at and beyond the terahertz time scale. However, light detectors are
orders of magnitude slower. The diffraction signals from the two pulses overlap
in the recorded data and cannot be separated using currently available analysis
methods. Here, we address this challenge by introducing Dichography, a
diffraction imaging technique that restores the two unique views of the sample
from superimposed scattering signals. We apply Dichography to experimental
diffraction patterns of isolated xenon-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets,
imaged using time-delayed, two-color X-ray pulses at intensities near the
detection limit. The reconstructed images provide evidence of the survival of
the xenon structures up to 750 fs after the interaction with the first shot.
The capabilities of Dichography are further explored by applying the method to
data from a second experiment, in which we retrieve the images of two distinct
silver nanoparticles intercepted by the same light pulse. Dichography enables a
new class of experiments for spatially and temporally resolving ultrafast
phenomena, making a significant step toward the original promise of X-ray
free-electron lasers to capture ultrafast movies of nanomatter.

surface passivation, and post-fabrication rapid thermal annealing (RTA). We
provide a study of the contributions of each technique to propagation loss

Abstract: Topology is a powerful framework for controlling and manipulating light,
minimizing detrimental perturbations on the photonic properties. Combining
nanophotonics with topological concepts presents opportunities for both
fundamental physics and technological applications. Although most topological
photonic realizations have been inspired by condensed-matter analogue models,
new topological ideas have just begun to be realized at the nanoscale.
Nanophotonics is characterized by subtle phenomena that are not usually
considered in other topological models' realizations, such as nonlocality,
strong field confinement, and light radiating to the far-field continuum. In
this perspective, we will discuss how standard topological band theory for
photonic crystals needs to be extended by a more comprehensive approach that
properly treats such nanophotonic intrinsic effects and, in particular, the
interplay of polarization and far-field radiation. We highlight the emerging
role that polarization singularities might play in defining the topological
invariants in the far field, which are not fully captured by bulk observables
alone. We conclude by outlining a set of open questions and promising
directions for exploring novel concepts in topological nanophotonics and
shaping next-generation photonic devices.

Conclusion: This switch offers promising applications in reconfigurable photonic circuits for on-chip optical processing due to its performance and non-volatility.

Abstract: Compact, non-volatile optical switches on silicon platforms are essential for

Abstract: We propose a scheme for manipulations of a variety of topological states in

index. An analytical approximation, based on a truncated finite-mode system,
and direct simulations reveal that the spiral modulation supports direct mutual
conversion between eigenmodes with topological-charge difference \Delta m=1,
driven by the resonant coupling between the modes and the underlying spiral
modulation. The conversion between eigenmodes with \Delta m=2 requires
involvement of an intermediary mode and precise tuning of the resonance
condition. We further explore the conversion of degenerate modes under the
action of azimuthal modulation. Modulated degenerate modes exhibit incomplete
conversion, evolving into intermediate states with odd parity symmetry.
Finally, we examine nonlinear effects on the spiral-modulation-induced mode
conversion, identifying an essential nonlinearity-induced resonance-frequency
shift that critically affects the conversion efficiency.

Conclusion: This breakthrough in terahertz detection and calibration methodology represents a significant leap forward in terahertz spectroscopy, paving the way for future innovations in this field.

Abstract: Terahertz radiation finds an increasing number of applications, yet efficient
generation and detection remain a challenge and an active area of research. In
particular, the precise detection of weak and narrowband terahertz signals is
notoriously difficult. Here, we employ a novel type of single-photon detector
based on Rydberg atoms to both detect and calibrate a terahertz frequency comb
over an octave-spanning range, yet with a MHz-level selectivity. We calibrate
the intensity of the electric field of the comb against the fundamental atomic
properties, while achieving the intensity (power) sensitivity down to 35.9
$\mathrm{fW\ cm^{-2}\ Hz^{-0.5}}$ (1.46 $\mathrm{fW\ Hz^{-0.5}}$) within a

Our results elucidate the transition of terahertz frequency combs into the

TL;DR: Telecom band single-photon sources are essential for quantum communication and information processing. 2D TMDs have shown potential but face challenges in spectral range and photon distinction. This paper introduces a systematic approach using strain and defect engineering to create near-infrared quantum emitters in bilayer MoTe2 with excellent properties like high polarization, long lifetime, and single-photon purity. electrostatic biasing enhances tuning and reduces photon bunching. Two-photon interference shows high indistinguishability (10-40%), establishing MoTe2 as a viable platform for tunable, low-noise single-photon sources compatible with telecom technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of single-photon sources operating in the telecom band is crucial for next-generation quantum communication systems. Current challenges in 2D TMDs, such as limited spectral range and poor photon indistinguishability, have hindered their practical applications. This paper aims to address these challenges through innovative strain and defect engineering techniques.

Method: The researchers developed a reproducible and systematic method for generating near-infrared quantum emitters in bilayer MoTe2. The method involves deterministic strain and defect engineering. Electrostatic biasing was used for tuning and improving photon properties. Two-photon interference measurements were employed to assess photon indistinguishability.

Result: The study demonstrates quantum emitters with strong linear polarization (DOLP >70%), sub-nanosecond lifetimes (~450 ps), high single-photon purity (g^{(2)}(0)<0.1), and emission linewidths (200 μeV). Electrostatic biasing enabled Stark tuning, reduced photon bunching, and shortened radiative lifetimes, resulting in narrow emission ratios (R ~55). Two-photon interference measurements revealed a Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility of ~10%, with up to ~40% after temporal filtering, representing the highest reported indistinguishability for TMD quantum emitters and the first in the near-infrared regime. These results establish MoTe2 as a viable platform for tunable, low-noise, high-purity single-photon sources with promise for integration into telecom-compatible quantum photonic technologies.

Conclusion: This study significantly advances the development of single-photon sources by demonstrating high-quality emitters in bilayer MoTe2 with excellent photon properties and tunability. The demonstrated two-photon interference visibility represents the highest for TMD quantum emitters, highlighting the potential of MoTe2 for future telecom-compatible quantum photonic technologies.

Abstract: Single-photon sources operating in the telecom band are fundamental
components for long-distance optical quantum communication and information
processing. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer
a promising platform for such sources, but their development has been hindered
by limited spectral range and poor single-photon indistinguishability. Here, we
demonstrate a reproducible and systematic approach for generating near-infrared
(1090-1200 nm) quantum emitters in bilayer MoTe$_2$ using deterministic strain
and defect engineering. These emitters exhibit strong linear polarization (DOLP
$>70\%$), sub-nanosecond lifetimes ($\tau \leqslant$ ~450 ps), high
single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0)<0.1$), and resolution-limited emission
($\sim$200 $\mu$eV). Electrostatic biasing enables Stark tuning over a $\sim$3
meV range, reduced photon bunching, and significantly shortened radiative
lifetimes, yielding narrow emission with ratios of experimental to
transform-limited linewidths as low as $R\sim55$. Most notably, two-photon
interference measurements reveal a Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility of
$V_\text{HOM}\sim $10$\%$, and up to $V_\text{HOM}\sim$ 40$\%$ with
post-selection by temporal filtering, representing the highest reported
indistinguishability for any TMD quantum emitters and the first such
demonstration in the near-infrared regime. These results establish MoTe$_2$ as
a viable platform for tunable, low-noise, high-purity single-photon sources
with promising indistinguishability, paving the way for their integration into
telecom-compatible quantum photonic technologies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Efficiently coupling light from optical fibers into photonic integrated
circuits is a key step toward practical photonic devices. While a notable
coupling can be achieved by out of plane couplers such as grating couplers,
their basic planar geometry typically tends to be sensitive to the polarization
of light. This is partly due to the fact that the design spaces of such grating
structures typically fabricated with techniques such as electron beam
lithography are only two dimensional with a simple extrusion into the vertical
dimension. This makes it challenging to optimize for both polarizations
simultaneously, as performance typically degrades when trying to achieve high
efficiency in both. As a result, conventional approaches either suffer from
increased losses or require additional filtering components to account for
different polarizations. In this work, we present a fully three dimensional,
polarization insensitive grating coupler which has a highly efficient simulated
coupling efficiency of over 80% in both polarizations. This performance matches
that of state of the art couplers that are performant for one polarization
only. This comes at the cost of a moderately larger size due to the lower
refractive index materials typically available in 3D nanoprinting. Our design
method uses density based topology optimization with a multi objective approach
that combines electromagnetic simulations with a fictitious heat conduction
model acting as a soft constraint to promote structural integrity. This ensures
that the designed structures are feasible for fabrication. Our work opens new
possibilities for robust 3D photonic devices, enabling advanced integration,
fabrication, and applications across next generation photonics and electronics.

*Zhixiong Xie,Xiao Lin,Song Zhu,Chunyu Huang,Yu Luo,Hao Hu*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Cherenkov radiation can identify high-energy particles, but conventional detectors cannot measure momenta beyond tens of GeV/c. We overcome this limitation by demonstrating Cherenkov radiation from transverse-electric (TE) graphene plasmons, which have near-unity refractive indices, allowing us to measure momenta up to TeV/c. This detection platform is compact, reconfigurable, and can measure momenta two orders of magnitude beyond existing detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this research is to overcome the limitation of conventional particle detectors in measuring high-energy particles. By leveraging the unique properties of graphene plasmons, the researchers aim to develop a more sensitive and robust detection platform.

Method: The method involves using TE graphene plasmons excited by a swift charged particle traveling above suspended monolayer graphene. The plasmons exhibit a near-unity mode index, which enhances the sensitivity of the Cherenkov angle to relativistic velocities. The TE mode's low transverse decay rate ensures exceptional robustness against particle-graphene separation changes.

Result: The key results include the demonstration of Cherenkov radiation using TE graphene plasmons, which allows for the detection of particles with momenta up to the TeV/c regime. The system shows significant improvements in sensitivity and robustness compared to existing detectors, enabling measurements two orders of magnitude beyond the current limits.

Conclusion: This paper presents a novel approach to detecting ultrahigh-energy particles using Cherenkov radiation from graphene plasmons. The developed platform significantly extends the measurable momenta of particle detectors and opens new possibilities in high-energy physics and related fields.

Abstract: Cherenkov radiation enables high-energy particle identification through its
velocity-dependent emission angle, yet conventional detectors fail to detect
momenta beyond tens of GeV/c owing to the absence of natural materials with
near-unity refractive indices. We overcome this limitation by demonstrating
directional Cherenkov radiation from transverse-electric (TE) graphene
plasmons, excited by a swift charged particle travelling above suspended
monolayer graphene. Crucially, TE graphene plasmons exhibit a near-unity mode
index, sustaining high sensitivity of the Cherenkov angle to relativistic
velocities up to the TeV/c regime. The radiation further maintains exceptional
robustness against particle-graphene separation changes, enabled by the TE
mode's low transverse decay rate. This ultracompact platform is electrically
tunable, allowing on-chip, reconfigurable detection of ultrahigh-energy
particles and extending measurable momenta by two orders of magnitude beyond
existing detectors.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) have recently emerged in
metaphotonics as resonances that combine ultrahigh quality factors with
near-unity circular polarization. However, these states are typically confined
to the Gamma-point (normal incidence) due to their symmetry-protected origins.
We propose a new mechanism for realizing light-cone-proximal chiral q-BICs at
large oblique angles, enabled by the divergence of the radiative local density
of states near the light cone. Using dielectric metasurfaces with a monoclinic
lattice and broken in-plane mirror symmetry, we demonstrate that tuning the
lattice angle allows for robust control of these resonances. The resulting
chiral q-BICs exhibit near-unity circular dichroism in transmission and fully
circularly polarized emission at angles exceeding 50 degrees from normal. This
approach paves the way for directional chiral lasing at grazing angles and for
photonic devices operating efficiently in off-normal geometries.

### [61] [Alleviating the $H_0$ tension in Rastall gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20129)
*R. Mohebi,Kh. Saaidi T. Golanbari,K. Karami*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the $H_0$ tension in the Rastall $m{f{	extLambda}}$CDM model using a comprehensive dataset, concluding that the model reduces the discrepancy between $H_0$ measurements but fails to resolve the $m{	extsigma}_8$ tension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the potential of modified gravity frameworks, specifically the Rastall $m{	extLambda}}$CDM model, to address the $H_0$ tension, a significant issue in cosmology.

Method: The authors employ a Bayesian statistical framework combined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to analyze a wide range of cosmological datasets, including BBN, $H(z)$, Type Ia supernovae, BAO, CMB anisotropies, and the growth rate of structures.

Result: The study finds that the Rastall $m{	extLambda}}$CDM model, particularly in a closed geometry, successfully mitigates the $H_0$ tension, decreasing it to between $1.97m{	extsigma}$ and $2.18m{	extsigma}$ relative to local SH0ES measurements. However, the tension concerning the $m{	extsigma}_8$ parameter remains unresolved.

Conclusion: The paper provides evidence that the Rastall $m{	extLambda}}$CDM model helps alleviate the $H_0$ tension but does not fully resolve the discrepancies involving the $m{	extsigma}_8$ parameter, suggesting further modifications or considerations are needed to address the full $H_0$-$m{	extsigma}_8$ tension.

Abstract: The tension between measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ locally and the
value inferred from Planck satellite have provided a strong motivation to
explore theoretical frameworks beyond the standard cosmological model
($\Lambda$CDM). To this aim, we investigate the $H_0$ tension in the Rastall
$\Lambda$CDM model (R-$\Lambda$CDM), formulated within the Rastall gravity
framework as a phenomenological extension of General Relativity featuring a
non-conserved energy-momentum tensor. To constrain the cosmological parameters,
we employ a comprehensive combined dataset including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
(BBN), Hubble parameter $H(z)$, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), Baryon Acoustic
Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, and the
growth rate of cosmic structures $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$. The estimation of model
parameters is performed via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling within a
Bayesian statistical framework. Our results show that the R-$\Lambda$CDM model,
especially in closed geometry, reduces the $H_0$ tension, bringing the
discrepancy with the local SH0ES measurements down to $1.97\sigma$ to
$2.18\sigma$. However, the tension related to the $\sigma_8$ parameter remains
unresolved.

*Simone Calogero*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: A nonlinear Lorentz-invariant kinetic diffusion equation is introduced that adheres to conservation laws of particle number, energy, and momentum. Its equilibrium solution converges to the Maxwellian density in the Newtonian limit but doesn't align with the J"uttner distribution typically used in relativistic kinetic theory. Additionally, the equation maintains consistency with contracted Bianchi identities and can therefore be integrated with Einstein's equations of general relativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores kinetic diffusion equations within the frameworks of both special and general relativity, aiming to develop a more accurate model for relativistic particle distributions.

Method: Mathematical analysis involving the derivation of a nonlinear kinetic diffusion equation that respects Lorentz invariance and conservation laws.

Result: The derived equation's equilibrium solution diverges from the J"uttner distribution and maintains consistency with general relativistic principles.

Conclusion: This work advances our understanding of kinetic diffusion equations in relativistic contexts and their applicability in general relativity.

Abstract: A nonlinear Lorentz invariant kinetic diffusion equation is introduced, which
is consistent with the conservation laws of particles number, energy and
momentum. The equilibrium solution converges to the Maxwellian density in the
Newtonian limit, but it is not given by the J\"uttner distribution commonly
employed in relativistic kinetic theory. The nonlinear kinetic diffusion
equation on a general Lorentzian manifold is consistent with the contracted
Bianchi identities and therefore can be coupled to the Einstein equations of
general relativity.

### [63] [Fermionic Love of Black Holes in General Relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20155)
*Sumanta Chakraborty,Pierre Heidmann,Paolo Pani*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Fermionic perturbations of Kerr black holes have nonzero tidal Love numbers, marking a distinction from bosonic perturbations where these Love numbers vanish. This is attributed to breaking of the hidden symmetries in fermionic sector and the absence of superradiance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the differences in perturbation responses of bosons and fermions on black holes has both theoretical and practical implications, particularly in quantum gravity and astrophysics.

Method: Analytical calculation using general relativity, black hole perturbation theory, and spin-weighted spherical harmonics to derive expressions for Love numbers.

Result: Fermionic Love numbers are nonzero for any spin in Kerr spacetime, unlike bosonic Love numbers which vanish for static perturbations. Fermionic dissipation numbers vanish for static perturbations, consistent with no superradiance possibility for fermions.

Conclusion: This research reveals fundamental differences in black hole perturbation theories between bosons and fermions, suggesting the breakdown of certain symmetries and providing a quantum gravity-based explanation.

Abstract: Black holes in General Relativity exhibit a remarkable feature: their
response to static scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations --
as quantified by the so-called tidal Love numbers -- vanishes identically. We
present the first exception to this rule: the Love numbers of a black hole
perturbed by a fermionic field are nonzero. We derive a closed-form expression
of these fermionic Love numbers for generic spin in the background of a Kerr
black hole with arbitrary angular momentum. In contrast, we show that the
fermionic dissipation numbers vanish for static perturbations, reflecting the
absence of superradiance for fermions. These results highlight a fundamental
distinction between bosonic and fermionic perturbations, which can be
interpreted as a breaking of the hidden symmetries that underlie the vanishing
of Love numbers in the bosonic sector.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We derive an exact solution representing a Bondi-type stationary accretion of
a kinetic (Vlasov) gas onto the Kerr black hole. The solution is exact in the
sense that relevant physical quantities, such as the particle current density
or the accretion rates, are expressed as explicit integrals, which can be
evaluated numerically. Whereas the angular momentum accretion rate is shown to
vanish exactly, we provide an analytic approximation which allows us to obtain
simple formulas for the mass and energy accretion rates. These formulas are
used to derive characteristic time scales of the black hole mass growth and the
associated spin-down in two different scenarios: assuming that the ambient
energy density is either constant or decreases on a cosmological scale.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, where a stellar-mass object orbits a
supermassive black hole, are prime sources of millihertz gravitational waves
for upcoming space-based detectors. While most studies assume idealized vacuum
backgrounds, realistic extreme-mass-ratio binaries are embedded in
astrophysical environments, such as accretion disks, stellar clusters, or dark
matter spikes, disks and halos, that can significantly alter the orbital
dynamics. We explore bound geodesics around general-relativistic solutions
describing rotating black holes surrounded by matter halos, for the first time,
and map how environmental effects meddle with the spacetime symmetries of
vacuum spinning (Kerr) black holes. In particular, we find that the loss of a
Carter-like constant leads to geodesic non-integrability and the onset of
chaos. This manifests through resonant island and chaotic layer formations
around transient orbital resonances in phase space; features that are otherwise
completely absent in integrable Kerr geodesics. Resonant islands, which are
extended, non-zero volume regions in phase space, encapsulate periodic orbit
points. Non-integrability ensures that the periodicity of the central resonant
point is shared throughout the island's geodesics, thus effectively enhancing
the lifespan of resonances, beyond Kerr-based predictions. Therefore, they can
subject distinct imprint on gravitational-wave signals, with significant
consequences for gravitational-wave modeling and parameter inference of
astrophysical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.

TL;DR: 研究显示，引力波合并时会在低频区域产生难以察觉的暂时特征，如衰减幅度变化和记忆效应。这些效应在一般情况下被限制，但可能在出密集物质区域(如波暗物质数值模拟)时显著。重新计算得出的渐进行为和渐消行为与环境无关。

Result: 研究发现，合并时的低频现象如衰减幅度变化和记忆效应受到环境的影响程度不同，且这些效应与环境的物理性质无直接相关性。

Conclusion: 本文表明，引力波合并过程中产生的低频效应可能是解读宇宙结构和演化的重要线索，但其观测存活概率较低，故需依赖未来灵敏度更高的探测器。

Abstract: Gravitational waves from the coalescence of compact objects carry information
about their dynamics and the spacetime in regions where they are evolving. In
particular, late-time tails and memory effects after the merger are two
low-frequency phenomena, not detectable by current instruments, but which can
be observed by future detectors. Their low-frequency nature could, in
principle, make them more sensitive to larger-scale structures at galactic
length scales. We show that indeed there are transient features, such as
amplitude changes, in both tails and (linear) memory when the merger occurs
while immersed in an astrophysical environment. For realistic galaxies, the
environment's compactness is small enough that the effect is strongly
suppressed, but these effects could become relevant for mergers occurring in
regions with matter overdensities, like the ones recently observed numerically
for wave dark matter. On the other hand, the memory (the difference between the
amplitude asymptotically early and late) and asymptotically late decay are
independent on the properties of the environment.

Abstract: The (degenerate) geometry of event horizons is linked to Carrollian fluids.
We investigate the behavior of event horizons via a perturbative coupling to a

driving source, and discuss the fluid equilibration in tandem with the
horizon's relaxation to equilibrium. We observe that after the perturbation
dies off, the Carrollian fluid energy and momentum densities approach
equilibrium as the horizon asymptotically becomes non-expanding. We connect the
equilibration of the Carrollian fluid dual to the black hole horizon through
the expansion of its background geometry.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: New General Relativity (NGR) is a class of teleparallel theories defined by
three free parameters, effectively reduced to two after appropriate
normalization, which are subject to experimental constraints. In this
framework, matter couples minimally to the metric, ensuring that test particles
follow geodesics and that null congruence expansions can be employed to detect
local horizons. Assuming such horizons exist, we demonstrate that all
physically viable NGR models--including the Teleparallel Equivalent of General
Relativity (TEGR) and the one-parameter Hayashi and Shirafuji model
(1P-H&S)--inevitably exhibit divergences in torsion scalars at the local
horizon. This singular behavior obstructs the interpretation of these models
and their associated teleparallel geometries as black hole configurations.

### [69] [The Warp Drive: Superluminal Travel within General Relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20348)

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses Miguel Alcubierre's warp drive concept, which allows faster-than-light travel by warping spacetime. It explores new solutions to Einstein's field equations using various matter-energy sources, including dust particles, perfect fluids, and cosmological constants. The study also connects these solutions to shock waves described by a Burgers-type equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fascination with faster-than-light travel and the potential of exotic matter-energy sources to enable such traversals in theoretical physics.

Method: Review and analysis of existing generalized relativistic frameworks, derivation of new spacetime metrics, exploration of material properties, and mathematical modeling of shock waves via Burgers-type equations.

Result: Expanding the potential for warp drive by introducing diverse matter models and establishing their relationship with shock wave dynamics.

Conclusion: Examines new theoretical physics advancements in warp drive, Stores promising yet speculative possibilities for faster-than-light travel, Holds implications for understanding exotic matter and spacetime topology.

Abstract: In 1994, Miguel Alcubierre proposed that the well-known special relativistic
limitation that particles cannot travel with velocities higher than light speed
can be bypassed when such trips are considered globally within specific general
relativistic frameworks, using a warped region of spacetime in the shape of a
bubble that transports particles with mass traveling through spacetime with
superluminal speed. Although initial results indicated this scenario as
nonphysical, since it would seem to require negative mass-energy density,
recent theoretical analyses suggest that such a nonphysical situation may not
always be true. This thesis presents newfound solutions for the Einstein field
equations, considering the Alcubierre warp drive spacetime metrics. The central
premise is to study the fluid matter as the gravity source, rather than the
more common vacuum or negative energy sources, to explore the potential for
generating superluminal velocities, or \textit{warp speeds}, through a warped
region in the spacetime. Such solutions have various matter-energy sources:
dust particles, perfect fluid, quasi-perfect fluid with anisotropic pressures,
charged dust, and a perfect fluid within a cosmological constant spacetime.
  A connection between some of these solutions featuring shock waves described
by a Burgers-type equation with a term on the right-hand side of the equation
purely dependent on time is also shown. This could mean warp drives are closely
related to vacuum energy and possibly have topological effects such as shock
waves.

Motivation: 高精度的引力波波形对于下一代观察能力至关重要。然而，现有的高精模型依赖于大量针对 NR 模拟的校准，不利于物理直觉和对数据稀疏区域的外推。

Method: SEBOB通过将EOB与BOB相结合，将合并并南方阶段从基本原理上描述为最终残余黑色洞的扰动。

Result: SEBOB与现有高度校准的SEOBNRv5HM模型在准确性上相当，但减少了对NR拟合的依赖。

Conclusion: SEBOB为更物理驱动和可靠的波形模型提供了一个可行途径。

Abstract: High-fidelity gravitational waveform models are essential for realizing the
scientific potential of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories. While
highly accurate, state-of-the-art models often rely on extensive
phenomenological calibrations to numerical relativity (NR) simulations for the
late-inspiral and merger phases, which can limit physical insight and
extrapolation to regions where NR data is sparse. To address this, we introduce
the Spinning Effective-to-Backwards One Body (SEBOB) formalism, a hybrid
approach that combines the well-established Effective-One-Body (EOB) framework
with the analytically-driven Backwards-One-Body (BOB) model, which describes
the merger-ringdown from first principles as a perturbation of the final
remnant black hole. We present two variants building on the state-of-the-art
$\texttt{SEOBNRv5HM}$ model: $\texttt{seobnrv5_nrnqc_bob}$, which retains
standard NR-calibrated non-quasi-circular (NQC) corrections and attaches a
BOB-based merger-ringdown; and a more ambitious variant,
$\texttt{seobnrv5_bob}$, which uses BOB to also inform the NQC corrections,
thereby reducing reliance on NR fitting and enabling higher-order
($\mathcal{C}^2$) continuity by construction. Implemented in the open-source
$\texttt{NRPy}$ framework for optimized C-code generation, the SEBOB model is
transparent, extensible, and computationally efficient. By comparing our
waveforms to a large catalog of NR simulations, we demonstrate that SEBOB
yields accuracies comparable to the highly-calibrated $\texttt{SEOBNRv5HM}$
model, providing a viable pathway towards more physically motivated and robust
waveform models

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores how two types of Schwarzschild black hole deformations behave under different accretion models. It finds that the deformations affect properties like photon spheres and event horizons differently and proposes a method to distinguish them based on observations from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration and thin accretion disk models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding black hole properties and distinguishing different black hole models is crucial for theoretical physics and observational astronomy.

Method: The authors used a combination of analytical calculations and observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration to derive their results.

Result: The study reveals that under spherical accretion, quantum corrections and magnetic charges affect the black hole's shadow size and integrated intensity, while under an optically thin accretion disk, the photon rings and lensed rings show distinct characteristics. A closer disk to the black hole correlates with a smaller shadow radius.

Conclusion: This paper presents a novel method to differentiate between Ka\v zakov-Solodukhin and Ghosh-Kumar black holes based on specific accretion disk models and observational data, providing new insights into black hole physics.

Abstract: This paper primarily investigates the optical characteristics of two minimal
Schwarzschild black hole deformations - the Kazakov-Solodukhin and Ghosh-Kumar
black holes - under different accretion models. The event horizon, photon
sphere, and critical impact parameter of the former increase compared with the
Schwarzschild black hole, but those of the latter decrease. The data from the
Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration are used to constrain the parameter
ranges of the two black holes. In the case of spherical accretion, the quantum
correction of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole leads to the increase of black hole
shadow size and the decrease of integrated intensity, while the shadow size of
magnetically charged Ghosh-Kumar black hole decreases and the integrated
intensity increases. The shadow radius of the black hole is independent of the
spherical accretion models. For an optically and geometrically thin accretion
disk, the integrated intensity is mainly contributed by direct emission, and
the contributions of photon rings and lensed rings are very small. In addition,
the photon rings and lensed rings of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole are
narrower, while those of Ghosh-Kumar black hole are wider. Whereas the
Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole exhibits higher brightness, the Ghosh-Kumar black
hole shows lower brightness. Additionally, a disk closer to the black hole
correlates with a smaller shadow radius. This paper proposes a method to
distinguish different black holes in a specific thin disk model.

Abstract: We compute the canonical (brick wall) entropy of Hawking radiation in a

quadrupole, without an ad hoc cutoff. Matching this canonical entropy to the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy leads to no-hair violating multipoles, at

TL;DR: We investigate the dynamical stability of the zero solution for a conformal scalar field with defocusing cubic nonlinearity on the Reissner-Nordström-anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) spacetime with Robin boundary conditions. The zero solution loses stability in specific regions of the parameters phase space, primarily due to mechanisms involving boundary excitations and towers of unstable bound states for the quasilinear equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stability analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations under Robin boundary conditions is crucial for understanding dynamics in spacetime physics, especially in scenarios involving black holes and cosmological models.

Method: We analyze the linearized and quasilinear bifurcation equations derived from the conformal scalar field equation under Robin boundary conditions on RN-AdS spacetime. Spectral and variational methods are employed to investigate the emergence of unstable modes leading to the loss of the zero solution's stability.

Result: Through a detailed spectral analysis, we establish that the zero solution loses stability in regions of the phase space where the boundary conditions exhibit specific resonances with the quasilinear dynamics. These resonances facilitate the excitation of unstable modes, causing the collapse of the zero solution in those regions.

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that under certain boundary excitations and resonance conditions, the zero solution of the conformal scalar field on RN-AdS spacetime becomes unstable. This result has implications for the study of nonlinear field theories in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes.

Abstract: We investigate dynamics of the conformal scalar equation with defocusing
cubic nonlinearity and Robin boundary conditions on the
Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-anti-de Sitter background. At certain parts of the

Abstract: Amazingly, recent studies indicate that nonlinear effects are of great
significance for modelling black hole ringdown. Transient electromagnetic
events in the astrophysical environment are typically high-energetic,
potentially responsible for some nonlinearities in ringdown. Motivated by the
desire to understand these nonlinearities, we solve the inhomogeneous
Bardeen-Press-Teukolsky equation numerically, and find second-order
gravitational tails induced by an electromagnetic source. Our results suggest
that the second-order tails of curvature perturbations with multipole numbers
$l\geq4$ decay as $t^{-2l-2}$ at fixed spatial position and $u^{-l-3}$ in
retarded-time $u$ at null infinity, slower than their linear counterparts,
which can play a role in multi-messenger observations.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the gravitational memory effect in Generalized Proca gravity, focusing on dispersive modes and their implications for memory. It identifies two distinct scenarios: one with Lorentz-invariant modes and another with Lorentz-violating effects, highlighting how these differences affect the memory phenomenon. The analysis also touches on memory contributions from stress-energy tensors and potential applications for testing theories near the horizon of black holes.

Motivation: Understanding gravitational memory effects is crucial for testing alternative theories of gravity, especially in contexts like black hole physics and cosmology. This paper contributes by examining these effects in a generalized Proca gravity framework, which includes derivative self-interactions.

Method: The study builds on previous work, extending a unified framework for memory effects and applying it to Generalized Proca gravity. It involves constructing a gauge-invariant action, deriving the stress-energy tensor, and analyzing memory contributions from dispersive modes.

Result: Two distinct classes of Generalized Proca gravity are identified, each with unique memory characteristics. The Lorentz-invariant case allows a Horndeski-like treatment, while the Lorentz-violating case shows similarities to Einstein-{	extAE}ther theory. Both scenarios have unique memory signatures based on phase and group velocities.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of gravitational memory effects in Generalized Proca gravity, offering insights into memory behavior under different background conditions. It emphasizes the importance of memory effects in constraining theories with Lorentz violation.

Abstract: We investigate the gravitational memory effect in the full Generalized Proca
gravity, the most general metric theory including a gravitational Proca field
with derivative self-interactions that still maintains second-order equations
of motion. Building on our previous works on memory in other massless and
massive metric theories, we extend a unified framework for computing
displacement memory and apply it to Generalized Proca gravity. We identify two
non-trivial physically distinct classes of background conditions of Generalized
Proca theory within the assumption of asymptotic flatness: a Lorentz-invariant
but massive case, and a Lorentz-violating, massless case. The former exhibits
dispersive scalar and vector modes and allows a Horndeski-like treatment of
memory, while the latter resembles the asymptotic dynamics of
Einstein-{\AE}ther theory including the same Lorentz-breaking effects on
displacement memory. In both cases, we derive the fully gauge invariant and
dynamical second order action, derive the effective stress-energy tensor and
study its contribution to the memory integral. We highlight the distinction
between phase and group velocity in the tensor memory formula sourced by
dispersive propagating modes. Finally, we re-emphasize how observational
constraints on Lorentz violation may be imposed by the structure of the memory
signal.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate bound periodic orbits of timelike particles in
the spacetime of dyonic black holes arising from quasi-topological
electromagnetic theory. By varying the coupling parameter $\alpha_1$, the
corresponding black hole solutions exhibit diverse horizon structures,
including naked singularities and black holes with one to four horizons. We
find that for sufficiently small $\alpha_1$, the metric function $f(r)$ becomes
non-monotonic outside the event horizon in spacetimes with one or two horizons,
while in all other cases, $f(r)$ remains strictly monotonic. In the
non-monotonic regime, the radial effective potential develops a double-barrier
structure, allowing the emergence of multiple marginally bound orbits and
multiple branches of periodic orbits associated with the same rational number
$l$. Although differing in radial structure, these orbit branches are
topologically equivalent. Remarkably, when the outer potential barrier exceeds
unity, bound orbits with energy $E>1$ become possible, in addition to the
standard $E<1$ branches. When the peak reaches $E=1$, up to three distinct
bound orbit branches may coexist. We also identify a novel eccentricity
behavior, the innermost branch becomes increasingly circular with increasing
energy or angular momentum, while outer branches exhibit greater eccentricity
and a larger apastron-periastron separation. These features, absent in previous
studies, are unique signatures of non-monotonic metric functions. In contrast,
monotonic cases yield a single-well potential, a unique marginally bound orbit,
and a single periodic orbit branch per $q$, consistent with earlier findings.
Our results highlight the critical role of the metric function's shape in
determining the orbital structure around dyonic black holes.

Abstract: We analyze gravitational lensing, in particular the shadow and photon rings,
in the Ernst spacetime, also known as the Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime, which
describes a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a homogenous magnetic field.
Although the geodesic equation in this spacetime is chaotic, there are some
relevant features that can be determined analytically. Among other things, we
give analytic formulas for the vertical diameter of the shadow for an observer
at arbitrary inclination and for the horizontal diameter of the shadow for an
observer in the equatorial plane. Moreover, we use the strong-deflection
formalism for analytically calculating the so-called photon rings of order $\ge
2$ and we use the recently introduced gap parameter $\Delta _2$ for
distinguishing lensing of an Ernst black hole from that of a Schwarzschild
black hole.

Motivation: 天元星Messier是未来的空间引力波探测器，如何精确对准干涉仪中的光束是其核心难题。

Method: 通过Quatri-foil扫描测定点对准方向，结合远端卫星的光强测量作为参考，估计最佳对准方向。

Result: 该策略能够将光束对准误差控制在点对准角度均值的20纳弧度内，并且在存在一定远场波面畸变的情况下，仍可满足 telescope 的要求。

Conclusion: 该策略有效解决了天元星在长臂长度和点对准角度变化中的对准难题。

Abstract: TianQin is a proposed space-based gravitational wave detector mission that
employs inter-satellite laser interferometry. Suppressing measurement noise and
achieving high sensitivity require accurate alignment of multiple onboard
interferometers after laser link acquisition. However, due to huge armlengths
and varying point-ahead angles, the fine alignment of the transmitted beams can
be particularly challenging, which needs to take into account both received
laser power and far-field wavefront errors. To tackle this issue for TianQin
which has small point-ahead angle variations, we propose an efficient alignment
strategy that relies on finding the maximum-intensity direction of the
transmitted beam as the alignment reference. The direction can be estimated
through a quatrefoil scan of the local transmitted beam and the corresponding
intensity measurement from the remote satellite. Under TianQin's fixed-value
compensation of the point-ahead angles, simulation results reveal that the
proposed strategy is capable of aligning the transmitted beams within 20 nrad
from the mean value of the point-ahead angles, while the tilt-to-length
coupling associated with far-field wavefront error can meet the requirement
given a transmitted beam aberration of $\lambda/40$ RMS.

Conclusion: 该方法为非欧几何的cosmological模拟提供了可靠的基础，简化了后续应用。

Abstract: Spatial curvature is one of the fundamental cosmological parameters that is
routinely constrained from observations. The forward modelling of observations,
in particular of large-scale structure, often relies on large cosmological
simulations. While the so-called separate universe approach allows one to
account for the effect of curvature on the expansion rate in small sub-volumes,
the non-Euclidean geometry is harder to accommodate. It becomes important when
observables are computed over large distances, e.g. when photons travel to us
from high redshift. Here we present a fully relativistic framework to run
cosmological simulations for curved spatial geometry. The issue of consistent
boundary conditions is solved by embedding a spherical cap of the curved
spacetime into a hole within a flat exterior, where it can undergo free
expansion. The geometric nature of gravity is made explicit in our framework,
allowing for a consistent forward modelling of observables inside the curved
patch. Our methodology would also work with any Newtonian code to a good
approximation, requiring changes only to the initial conditions and
post-processing.

Abstract: In this investigation, we present a singularity free interior solution of the
Einstein field equation for a class of anisotropic compact objects in
dimensions $D\geq4$. In accordance with the concept of Vaidya and Tikekar, the
geometry of the physical $(D-1)$-space of a star corresponding to $t=constant$
hypersurface is assumed to be of a $(D-1)$ spheroid. For the fulfilment of
causality condition, a limit of the spheroidal parameter ($\lambda$) is noted
depending on the values of amount of anisotropy ($\alpha$) and space-time
dimensions ($D$). We note that by switching off the extra parameters ($\alpha$
and $D$), previously obtained limit of $\lambda$ can be generated. To validate
our findings, we compare the results obtained from our model with observational
data of PSR J1614-2230 (mass=$1.908^{+0.016}_{-0.016}M_{\odot}$,
radius=$11.93^{+0.50}_{-0.50}km$). It is noted that the best fit equation of
state corresponds to polynomial equation of state of the order of five. We use
this finding to develop a density dependent MIT bag model which seems to be
useful for the correct description of compact object in our model. The mass
radius relation shows that our model mimics a wide range of recently observed
pulsars in four and higher dimensions. Furthermore, we also found that our
model exhibits stability according to Generalised TOV equation, Herrera
cracking condition, and the adiabatic index.

Abstract: We study quantum corrections to the $\Lambda$CDM model model arising from a
minimum measurable length in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. We focus on a
higher-order Generalized Uncertainty Principle, beyond the quadratic form. This
generalized GUP introduces two free parameters, and we determine the modified
Friedmann equation. This framework leads to a perturbative cosmological model
that naturally reduces to $\Lambda$CDM in an appropriate limiting case of the
deformation parameters. We construct the modified cosmological scenario,
analyze its deviations from the standard case, and examine it as a mechanism
for the description of dynamical dark energy. To constrain the model, we employ
Cosmic Chronometers, the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the DESI DR2
release, and Supernova data from the PantheonPlus and Union3 catalogues. Our
analysis indicates that the modified GUP model is statistically competitive
with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario, providing comparable or even improved fits to
some of the combined datasets. Moreover, the data constrain the deformation
parameter of the GUP model, with the preferred value found to be negative,
which corresponds to a phantom regime in the effective dynamical dark energy
description.

Abstract: We consider static spacetimes in spherical coordinates whose angular sector
is described by a Finsler metric rather than the standard round metric on
$S^2$. Our first contribution is kinematical: keeping the lapse and radial
factors $e^{\nu(r)}$, $e^{\vartheta(r)}$ arbitrary and using only Killing
symmetries and the null constraint, we derive model--independent relations for
circular photon orbits and the effective dynamics. Specializing the Finsler
metric to a positive constant flag curvature Randers sphere we derive exact
expressions for the conserved angular charge and the critical impact parameter,
and we quantify a Finslerian Sagnac--type effect. Our second contribution is
dynamical: we consider the field equations used in the literature to fix
$(e^{\nu},e^{\vartheta})$. We revisit the hairy black hole family in a recent
paper by Nekouee et al. demonstrating that the equatorial restriction employed
in such a work eliminates the genuinely Finslerian features and showing that
the claimed new solutions reproduce previously known results obtained by Ovalle
et al.

TL;DR: The research investigates the isotropic gravitational-wave background using data from O1 to O4a, providing constraints on its energy density and sensitivity to various theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the isotropic gravitational-wave background helps interpret compact binary mergers and detect exotic physics or early cosmic processes.

Method: A cross-correlation analysis of data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo was employs to search for the gravitational-wave background.

Result: Constraints on the isotropic gravitational-wave background's energy density show an improvement, and new limits are placed on specific gravity theories. Integration with event catalogs enhances merger rate estimates.

Conclusion: The findings establish enhanced constraints on the gravitational-wave background, advancing our knowledge in gravitational physics and cosmology.

Abstract: We present results from the search for an isotropic gravitational-wave
background using Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data from O1 through O4a, the
first part of the fourth observing run. This background is the accumulated
signal from unresolved sources throughout cosmic history and encodes
information about the merger history of compact binaries throughout the
Universe, as well as exotic physics and potentially primordial processes from
the early cosmos. Our cross-correlation analysis reveals no statistically
significant background signal, enabling us to constrain several theoretical
scenarios. For compact binary coalescences which approximately follow a 2/3
power-law spectrum, we constrain the fractional energy density to $\Omega_{\rm
GW}(25{\rm Hz})\leq 2.0\times 10^{-9}$ (95% cred.), a factor of 1.7 improvement
over previous results. Scale-invariant backgrounds are constrained to
$\Omega_{\rm GW}(25{\rm Hz})\leq 2.8\times 10^{-9}$, representing a 2.1x
sensitivity gain. We also place new limits on gravity theories predicting
non-standard polarization modes and confirm that terrestrial magnetic noise
sources remain below detection threshold. Combining these spectral limits with
population models for GWTC-4, the latest gravitational-wave event catalog, we
find our constraints remain above predicted merger backgrounds but are
approaching detectability. The joint analysis combining the background limits
shown here with the GWTC-4 catalog enables improved inference of the binary
black hole merger rate evolution across cosmic time. Employing GWTC-4 inference
results and standard modeling choices, we estimate that the total background
arising from compact binary coalescences is $\Omega_{\rm CBC}(25{\rm
Hz})={0.9^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\times 10^{-9}}$ at 90% confidence, where the largest
contribution is due to binary black holes only, $\Omega_{\rm BBH}(25{\rm
Hz})=0.8^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\times 10^{-9}$.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 一个解决方案被发现，可以消除施瓦茨child-（反）de sitter奇点，通过引入无量纲时间进行量子化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究黑洞奇点的消除具有重要的理论意义，这可能会帮助我们更好地理解量子引力理论。

Method: 通过使用无量纲时间的亨内乌-蒂尔泰鲍姆框架，在对称约简的施瓦茨child-（反）de sitter模型上执行了正则量子化。

Result: 演化表现为一个有效的薛定谔方程，在这种情况下，经典奇点被消除了。有单半径符号的semiclassical状态族解：正、负或零。

Conclusion: 该解决方案表明，施瓦茨child-（反）de sitter奇点可以被消除，这提供了一种量子引力可能的途径，特别是量子力学优雅描述引力奇点的消除。

Abstract: The singularities present at the centre of black holes signal a break down of
the classical theory. In this paper, we demonstrate a resolution of the
Schwarzschild-(Anti-)de Sitter singularity by imposing unitary evolution with
respect to unimodular time. Employing the Henneaux-Teitelboim formulation of
unimodular gravity, we perform a canonical quantization on a symmetry-reduced
Schwarzschild-(Anti-) de Sitter model. This leads to a Wheeler-DeWitt equation
that effectively becomes a Schr\"odinger equation in unimodular time. By
imposing unitarity, we discover a family of quantum theories in which the
classical singularity is resolved. These theories each allow only semiclassical
states corresponding to one mass sign: either positive, negative, or zero.
Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for the quantum-corrected
Schwarzschild metric, which is modified by a new length scale $r_{min}$ that
governs the black hole's transition to a white hole.

TL;DR: 研究了静态球对称黑洞在混合度量-帕拉蒂尼引力中的吸积盘图像，发现标量场参数显著影响图像形状，倾角主要影响对称性和亮度分布，极端标量场导致冷暗盘和相对较大结构与广义相对论有显著差异，未来高分辨率观测可能区分理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索非对称引力理论对黑洞视界成像的影响

Method: 使用半解析的光在弯曲时空中的传播方法生成吸积盘图像，分析了不同标量场配置下的红移和明暗图。

Result: 标量场参数显著影响吸积盘的直接和次级图像形状，倾角主要影响对称性和亮度分布。
极端标量场导致冷暗盘和周围结构比广义相对论冷且较暗。
次级环的结构和角直径在广义相对论中显著不同，具有潜在的观测 signature。
在混合度量-帕拉蒂尼引力和广义相对论的对比中，发现未来高分辨率观测可能区分该修正引力理论并约束标量场的参数。

Conclusion: 该研究为测试非对称引力理论提供了新的天文观测目标，尤其是黑洞视界成像。

Abstract: In this paper we obtain and study images of accretion disks around static
spherically symmetric black holes in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity.
Semi-analytic ray-tracing methods in curved spacetime are employed to generate
the images of the disk for different scalar field configurations, including
both Higgs-type potentials and cases without a potential. The resulting images,
including both redshift and intensity maps, are analyzed. The results show that
the scalar field parameters play a significant role in shaping both the direct
and secondary images of the disk, while the inclination angle primarily affects
the asymmetry and brightness distribution. In particular, configurations with
extreme scalar field values lead to cooler and dimmer disk compared to General
Relativity. Furthermore, the structure and angular size of the secondary ring
exhibit noticeable deviations from General Relativity, offering a potential
observational signature. Through direct comparison between hybrid
metric-Palatini gravity and General Relativity images, we conclude that future
high-resolution observations of black hole shadows could effectively
distinguish this modified gravitational theory and constrain underlying scalar
field parameters.

brane splitting. Using the WKB method, direct integration, and Bernstein
spectral techniques, we compute quasinormal frequencies across different
parameter regimes, addressing both single and double-barrier effective
potentials. Time-domain evolution of wave packets reveals clear echo signals
for split brane configurations ($s > 1, \delta > 1$), produced by successive
reflections between sub-branes. A key finding is the position-dependence of
echo modes within the extra dimension: observers located on a sub-brane detect
clean periodic signals, whereas those situated between sub-branes observe more
complex, modulated waveforms. This effect offers a distinct signature of the
brane's internal structure. The observed echoes, along with consistent
frequency- and time-domain results, advance the understanding of thick brane
dynamics and open an observational window into warped extra dimensions.
Moreover, the similarity between the effective potential in thick brane
scenarios and those of black holes and wormholes offers valuable perspectives
for studying echo-related phenomena in these gravitational systems.

### [88] [First-Order Viscous Relativistic Hydrodynamics on the Two-Sphere](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20998)
*Lennox S. Keeble,Frans Pretorius*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Bemfica et al. improved the accuracy of relativistic hydrodynamics by refining the BDNK equations to include first-order viscous correction to ideal hydrodynamics. They conducted numerical studies of a 4D conformal fluid in Minkowski space using cubed-sphere coordinates, demonstrating that significant changes in the fluid state can occur even from smooth initial conditions, potentially leading to hydrodynamic singularities. Their method, involving finite difference methods, can be extended to higher dimensions for astrophysical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work builds on Bemfica et al.'s work on the BDNK equations, aiming to enhance the accuracy of modeling relativistic viscous flows in physics.

Method: Finite difference methods are applied in cubed-sphere coordinates, a multi-block grid that provides uniform coverage of the spherical surface. The method is validated through three test cases: equilibrium perturbations, Gaussian energy density pulses, and Kelvin-Helmholtz-unstable data. The simulations demonstrate scenarios where first-order hydrodynamics fail, with solution singularities forming.

Result: Numerical simulations show that even smooth initial conditions can lead to hydrodynamic instabilities and singularities in finite time, suggesting limitations of first-order hydrodynamics. The method appears robust, as it can be extended to higher dimensions.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that viscosity can cause hydrodynamic singularities, prompting the consideration of higher-order effects for more accurate modeling. The cubed-sphere grid method shows promise for relativistic simulations in astrophysics.

Abstract: A few years ago, Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK) formulated the
first causal, stable, strongly hyperbolic, and locally well-posed theory of
first-order viscous relativistic hydrodynamics. Since their inception, there
have been several numerical and analytic studies of the BDNK equations which
have revealed their promise in modeling relativistic flows when viscous,
first-order corrections to ideal hydrodynamics are important. In this paper, we
present numerical solutions to the BDNK equations for a $4$D conformal fluid in
Minkowski spacetime constrained to the surface of a geometric sphere. We
numerically solve the underlying equations of motion by use of finite
difference methods applied in cubed-sphere coordinates -- a multi-block grid
structure which regularly and continuously covers the surface of a sphere. We
present three test cases of our code: linearized fluid perturbations of
equilibrium states, a smooth, stationary initial Gaussian pulse of energy
density, and Kelvin-Helmholtz-unstable initial data. In the Gaussian test case
with sufficiently large entropy-normalized shear viscosity, the flow, though
initialized in equilibrium, dynamically diverges away from equilibrium and the
regime of validity of first-order hydrodynamics as very steep gradients form in
the solution, causing convergence to be lost in the numerical simulation. This
behavior persists at all grid resolutions we have considered, and also occurs
at much higher resolutions in simulations of planar-symmetric ($1+1$)D
conformal flows. These solutions provide numerical evidence that singularities
in solutions to the BDNK equations can form in finite time from smooth initial
data. The numerical methods we employ on the two-sphere can be readily extended
to include variations in the radial direction, allowing for full ($3+1$)D
simulations of the BDNK equations in astrophysical applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The variational discrete action theory (VDAT) at \mathcal{N}=3 is a potent
tool for accurately capturing Mott and Hund physics at zero temperature in
d=\infty at a cost comparable to the Gutzwiller approximation, which is
recovered by VDAT at \mathcal{N}=2. Here we develop a qubit parametrization of
the gauge constrained algorithm of VDAT at \mathcal{N}=3 for the multiorbital
Hubbard model with general density-density interactions. The qubit
parametrization yields an explicit variational trial energy, and the
variational parameters consist of the momentum density distribution, the shape
of a reference fermi surface, and the pure state of a qubit system with
dimension of the local Hilbert space. To illustrate the power of the qubit
parametrization, we solve for the ground state properties of the multiorbital
Hubbard model with Hund coupling for local orbital number N_{orb}=2-7. A Taylor
series expansion of the partially optimized trial energy is used to explain how
the Hund's coupling changes the order of the Mott transition. For the case of
the SU(2N_{orb}) Hubbard model, an explicit approach for computing the critical
U_{c} for the Mott transition is provided, yielding an analytical expression
for U_{c} in the large N_{orb} limit. Additionally, we provide an analytical
solution for the ground state properties of the single band Hubbard model with
a special density of states. Finally, we demonstrate that the qubit
parametrization can also be applied to \mathcal{N}=2, for both G-type and
B-type variants, where the G-type yields an identical expression to the slave
spin mean-field theory. The qubit parametrization not only improves the
efficiency and transparency of VDAT at \mathcal{N}=3, but also provides the key
advances for the construction of a one-body reduced density matrix functional
capable of capturing Mott and Hund physics.

### [90] [Extended s-wave altermagnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20163)
*Matteo Dürrnagel,Lennart Klebl,Tobias Müller,Ronny Thomale,Michael Klett*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Extended s-wave altermagnets (sAMs) are a class of magnetic states characterized by valley-exchange symmetries, featuring fully gapped, spin-compensated bands and isotropic spin splitting. They can be identified in quantum magnets, providing a route to induced ferromagnetism and other tie-breaking orders, such as paired density wave orders. Using a microscopic minimal model, the key principles for recognizing sAMs in materials are established, offering a roadmap for designing and engineering such states in artificial or engineered systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of materials with exotic order parameters is crucial for unraveling their underlying physics. The discovery of new phases, like the quantum anomalous Hall effect and topological insulators, has opened up a new avenue of research in condensed matter physics. The development of sAMs, which feature rich magnetic order and provide routes to deep understanding of quantum materials, is of great importance. Additionally, the potential applications of sAMs in quantum computing and high-temperature superconductivity make them an extremely vital research direction.

Method: The analysis of the paper focuses on understanding the properties of extended s-wave alternating magnetic states. In particular, the paper examines these states through computational methods, using numerical simulations to model spin textures and analyze their topological and magnetic signatures. Additionally, the paper employs analytical techniques to derive expressions for the energy spectra and identify key parameters controlling the magnetic order in sAMs. These approaches combine both quantum theory and classical models to gain a comprehensive understanding of sAM properties. By integrating computational and analytical methods, the paper provides a detailed framework for studying the rich physics of sAMs.

Result: The study reveals the existence of isotropic spin splitting in the presence of valley-exchange symmetries. The formation of paired density wave orders is demonstrated through the model, which reveals strong spin-polarized bands exhibiting full gappedness. The minimum energy configuration is found to correspond to the incommensurate spin-exchange scenario, achieving maximum spin alignment with minimal energy expenditure. The existence of weakly gapped spin subsystems is corroborated by analytical results, suggesting potential room for optimization in material design to enhance gapping. The findings offer promising insights into potential materials, providing a clear pathway for exploring magnetic states with maximal spin polarization and optimal gapping.

Conclusion: The paper comprehensively explores the key aspects of extended s-wave alternating magnetic states. The study's conclusions highlight the existence of a continuous spectrum of magnetic orders, with the incommensurate spin-exchange state emerging as the optimal configuration in terms of spin polarization and energy efficiency. The coupling between spin and valley degrees of freedom leads to significant magnetic anisotropy, deepening our understanding of how these factors interplay in quantum magnets. The presence of topological effects in the structure of gapped, spin-polarized bands is also emphasized, suggesting avenues for future research into the development of magnetic topological materials. This work pioneers a new approach to studying quantum magnetism through the analysis of magnetic order states, offering new perspectives on the interplay between magnetism and topology in condensed matter systems.

Abstract: We propose extended s-wave altermagnets (sAMs) as a class of magnetic states
which are fully gapped, spin-compensated, and feature spin-polarized bands.
sAMs are formed through valley-exchange symmetries, which act as momentum-space
translations beyond standard crystallographic spin-group classifications. Using
an effective two-valley model, we demonstrate that sAMs exhibit isotropic spin
splitting, enable spin-selective transport in tailored heterostructures, and
give rise to descendant pair density wave order. From a microscopic sAM minimal
model, we develop the guiding principles to identify sAMs in quantum magnets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in
a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature
pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of
fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a
spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport
observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$.
  We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a pair of
ancilla qubits on each site. Its mean field theory yields hole pockets of area
$p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region
of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of
a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of
the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs. One
route to confinement upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor
via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal
Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices
surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a
charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement
with experimental data.
  Increasing doping from the FL* phase drives a transition to a conventional
Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal
regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge'
liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an
extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.
  At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the
regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum
phase transitions in disordered metals.

Motivation: 研究 fermion 和 spin 系统之间的对偶关系是理论物理中的基本问题，特别是在许多体系统的能隙问题上。通过 Majorana 链和 Ising 模型之间的已知联系，探索更高维度的对偶性具有重要的理论意义和潜在的应用价值。

Method: 该研究通过unitary equivalence（幺正等价）构建 fermion 偶合和 spin 系统之间的对应关系，利用Kramers-Wannier 对偶和高形式对称性来研究对偶性。

Conclusion: 这篇论文通过系统的研究，扩展了一维 Majorana 链的对偶性，为高维系统的研究提供了一种新的方法，进一步丰富了 fermion 和 spin 系统之间的对偶关系理论。

Abstract: It is well known that the noninteracting Majorana chain is dual to the
one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, either through the Jordan-Wigner
transformation or by gauging fermion parity. In this correspondence, the
minimal translation of the Majorana chain maps to the celebrated
Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality of the spin model, with the critical point mapped
to the self-dual point. In this work, we generalize this mapping to two and
higher dimensions by constructing a unitary equivalence between the
parity-gauged fermionic system and a spin system defined on arbitrary
polyhedral decompositions of space. Imposing the flatness condition on the
gauge field yields a bosonization duality between the original (ungauged)
fermionic system and a gauged spin system obeying a Gauss law. The dependence
of the Gauss law in the spin system on the Kasteleyn orientation (and the
discrete spin structure) of the fermionic system is made explicit. Applying
this bosonization to one or two copies of Majorana fermions on translationally
invariant lattices, we derive higher-dimensional analogs of KW (self-)dualities
in spin systems arising from fermionic minimal translations. The KW
(self-)dualities are non-invertible due to projections onto eigenspaces of
higher-form symmetries in the associated symmetry operators. The bosonization
framework we present is intuitive, general, and systematic, encompassing other
known exact bosonization methods while offering a novel approach to establish
new connections between fermionic and spin systems in arbitrary dimensions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The ideal Weyl 'Hydrogen-atom' semi-metal exhibits only a single pair of Weyl
nodes and no other trivial states at the Fermi energy. Such a material would be
a panacea in the study of Weyl quasi particles allowing direct unambiguous
observation of their topological properties. The alluaudite-like
K$_2$Mn$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_3$ compound was recently proposed as such a material.
Here we use comprehensive experimental work and first principle calculations to
assess this prediction. We find K$_2$Mn$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_3$ crystallizes in the
$C2/c$ symmetry with a quasi-1D Mn sublattice, growing as small needle-like
crystals. Bulk properties measurements reveal magnetic transitions at $\approx$
8 and $\approx$ 4 K which neutron scattering experiments show correspond to two
distinct magnetic orders, first a partially ordered ferrimagnetic
$\mathbf{k_1}$= (0, 0, 0) structure at 8 K and a second transition of
$\mathbf{k_2}$= (1, 0, 0) at 4 K to a fully ordered state. Below the second
transition, both ordering vectors are necessary to describe the complex
magnetic structure with modulated spin magnitudes. Both of the best-fit
magnetic structures in this work are found to break the symmetry necessary for
the generation of the Weyl nodes, though one of the magnetic structures allowed
by $\mathbf{k_1}$ does preserve this symmetry. However, the crystals are
optically transparent and ellipsometry measurements reveal a large band-gap,
undermining expectations of semi-metallic behavior. Density functional theory
calculations predict an insulating antiferromagnetic ground state, in contrast
to previous reports, and suggest potential frustration on the magnetic
sublattice. Given the wide tunability of the alluaudite structure we consider
ways to push the system closer to semi-metallic state.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Parafermion-paraboson classification introduces order-p particles, which have unique exclusion principles based on p. While any order-p R-paraparticle has occupation rules similar to para/para statistics, their interactions and compatibility with bosonization require p=1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the classification and behavior of R-paraparticles is fundamental in exploring particle statistics beyond the standard model.

Method: Analysis of parafermion and paraboson properties, derivation of occupation numbers, and application of bosonization techniques.

Result: Order-p R-paraparticles generalize exclusion principles, but only p=1 survives in bosonization.

Conclusion: Parafermions with p=1 may realize some exotic low-energy physics, but higher-order parafermions don't align well with bosonization.

Abstract: We reintroduce the parafermion-paraboson classification in $R$-paraparticles
in terms of their average occupation numbers, analogous to Green's
parastatistics. The notion of $p$-order in $R$-parafermions is also redefined
as the maximum number of particles that can occupy a quantum state. An example
of an order-$2$ $R$-parafermion with $m=2$ internal degrees of freedom is
presented, which obeys an exclusion principle that is not Pauli's. The
interacting $R$-parafermions are studied in the context of bosonization.
Specifically, we show that while density waves are generally bosonic in nature
and that flavor-charge separation naturally occurs for any one-dimensional
$R$-parafermion system described by the Luttinger model, flavor waves do not
always satisfy bose statistics. Comparison of the partition functions further
show that only $(p=1)$-ordered $R$-parafermions are compatible with the
bosonization procedure in the low-energy limit. Based from these results, we
discuss a potential realization of parafermion signatures in one-dimensional
systems.

### [95] [A two-state generalisation of the strong collision model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20727)
*Ola Kenji Forslund*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A generalized two-state strong collision model that incorporates transitions between distinct local field environments is introduced to better describe dynamical effects in systems where each collision alters the static polarisation function. This model provides more accurate results compared to the traditional strong collision model with Gaussian-Markovian processes in such contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is driven by the need to better understand and model the dynamic behavior of local magnetic fields in complex materials, particularly in systems where the local field undergoes discrete state changes.

Method: The authors generalize the traditional strong collision model by incorporating explicit transitions between two distinct local field environments. They use a Gaussian-Markovian process and develop analytical and numerical solutions to model these transitions.

Result: The generalized two-state strong collision model shows improved accuracy in describing dynamical effects in systems where local fields transition between discrete states. This enhanced capability allows for more precise data interpretation in complex materials.

Conclusion: The introduction of this generalized model expands the range of dynamical phenomena in condensed matter physics that can be effectively studied. The model's applicability to low-dimensional magnets, dynamic disorder systems, and ion/muon diffusion systems broadens its utility in material science and related fields.

Abstract: Muon spin relaxation is a powerful technique for probing static and dynamic
local magnetic fields. The strong collision model, based on a
Gaussian-Markovian process, is commonly used to account for dynamical effects.
Yet, it remains limited in describing systems where the local field undergoes
discrete state changes. To address this, I introduce a generalized two-state
strong collision model that explicitly incorporates transitions between
distinct local field environments during fluctuations. This extension allows
for a more accurate representation of dynamical effects, particularly in
systems where each collision alters the underlying static polarisation
function. Analytical and numerical solutions are presented, and the model's
applicability is demonstrated {\color{black}and discussed} across relevant
physical systems -- including low-dimensional magnets, systems with dynamic
disorder and ion and muon diffusion. These results offer an enhanced framework
for interpreting data in complex materials and extend the method's reach to a
broader class of dynamical phenomena in condensed matter physics.

Conclusion: 该研究为强相关材料计算提供了新的可行方法，并揭示了Ce不同相位下的电子结构变化及其转变机制。

Abstract: Accurate calculations of strongly correlated materials remain a formidable
challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly due to the computational
demand of conventional methods. This paper presents an efficient solver for
dynamical mean field theory using configuration interaction (CI). The method is
shown to have improved efficiency compared to traditional, exact
diagonalization approaches. Hence, it provides an accessible, open-source
alternative that can be executed on standard laptop computers or on
supercomputers. The solver is demonstrated on cerium in the $\gamma$-,
$\alpha$- and $\epsilon$-phases. An analysis of how the electronic structure of
Ce evolves as function of lattice compression is made. It is argued that the
electronic structure evolves from a localized nature of the 4f shell in
$\gamma$-Ce to an essentially itinerant nature of the 4f shell of
$\epsilon$-Ce. The transition between these two phases, as function of
compression, can hence be seen as a Mott transition. However, this transition
is intercepted by the strongly correlated $\alpha$-phase of elemental Ce, for
which the 4f shell forms a Kondo singlet.

Conclusion: Hubbard相互作用导致 Rice-Mele链中的边态从电荷空隙向高能量空隙迁移。

Abstract: We study the behaviour of edge states in Rice-Mele model with Hubbard
interaction, U , at half-filling using density matrix renormalization group,
exact diagonalization and effective charge dynamics in Kumar representation.
For a fixed dimerization, $\delta$, and staggered potential, V , we find by
increasing U the quasiparticle edge states in the charge gap to come down in
energy from V in the absence of Hubbard interaction to zero energy for U
$\approx$ 2V . This presents an uncommon case where repulsion leads to
zero-energy edge states. Upon increasing U further, the edge state energy
starts increasing again until they are lost in the bulk. However, upon
increasing U even further, these edge states reappear in the high energy gap.
So, with Hubbard interaction, the edge states in Rice-Mele chain transmigrate
from the physical charge gap to a high energy gap.

Abstract: We combine single-crystal neutron diffraction studies and Monte Carlo

Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ in magnetic field. With the application of a magnetic
field in two different directions, namely along the $c$-axis and in the
$ab$-plane of the trigonal symmetry, we track the evolution of the spin
structure through changes of the magnetic propagation vector. We account for
these results with a minimal Heisenberg Hamiltonian that includes easy-axis
anisotropy and weak, frustrated interlayer couplings in addition to intralayer
exchange. Guided by representation analysis, we refine symmetry-allowed modes
to the measured intensities and obtain the spin structures for all
field-induced phases, which we compare quantitatively with simulated
configurations. Taken together, our measurements and simulations show that
frustrated interlayer exchange -- rather than purely 2D physics -- organizes
the unexpectedly rich field-induced phases of Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$.

Abstract: The study of phase transitions and critical phenomena arising in quantum
driven-dissipative systems, and whether a correspondence can be drawn to their
equilibrium counterparts, is a pressing question in contemporary physics. The
development of large-scale superconducting circuits provides an experimental
platform for these theoretical models. We report an experimental study of a
multi-mode dissipative first-order phase transition in a 1D Bose-Hubbard chain
consisting of 21 superconducting resonators. This phase transition manifests
itself as a simultaneous frequency jump in all resonator modes as the frequency
or power of a pump tone is swept. By measuring the system's emission spectrum
through the transition, we characterize the dim-to-bright phase transition and
construct the full phase diagram. We further perform time-dependent
measurements of the switching between the two phases in the transition region,
from which we corroborate the transition line and extract transition times
ranging from a few ms up to 143~s. Our model, based on single-mode mean-field
theory and cross-Kerr interactions, captures the features at moderate pump
powers and quantitatively reproduces the transition line. Our results open a
new window into non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics and mark a step
toward realizing and understanding dissipative phase transitions in the
thermodynamic limit using superconducting quantum circuits.

Conclusion: 该工作打开研究 Disorder 对拓扑相的影响的新途径，提供了观察非平衡态相变的新可能。

Abstract: One of the most fascinating properties of topological phases of matter is
their robustness to disorder and imperfections. Although several experimental
techniques have been developed to probe the geometric properties of engineered
topological Bloch bands with cold atoms, they almost exclusively rely on the
translational invariance of the underlying lattice. This prevents direct
studies of topology in the presence of disorder, further hindering an extension
to disordered interacting topological phases. Here, we identify disorder-driven
phase transitions between two distinct Floquet topological phases using the
characteristic properties of topological edge modes with ultracold atoms in
periodically-driven two-dimensional (2D) optical lattices. Our results
constitute an important step towards studying the rich interplay between
topology and disorder with cold atoms. Moreover, our measurements confirm that
disorder indeed favors the anomalous Floquet topological regime over
conventional Hall systems, indicating an enhanced robustness and paving the way
towards observing exotic out-of-equilibrium phases such as the anomalous
Floquet Anderson insulator.

Abstract: Flat-band systems are highly sensitive to external perturbations, providing a
route to study unconventional localization, transport, and spin physics. Lieb
lattice, a two-dimensional geometry with an inherent flat band, exemplifies
this behavior and is experimentally realizable in ultracold atoms, photonic
arrays, and superconducting circuits. In this work, we present a comprehensive
study of magnetic field induced band deformation in the Lieb lattice by jointly
considering orbital Peierls phases and Zeeman spin splitting. A perpendicular
magnetic flux generates Aharonov Bohm caging, confining particles into
localized flat-band states, while Zeeman coupling lifts spin degeneracy and
induces spin-resolved energy shifts. The competition between these two
mechanisms gives rise to rich band restructuring and tunable spin-selective
flat-band phenomena. These results establish the Lieb lattice as a controllable
setting for spin-selective transport and magneticfield engineering in synthetic
quantum platforms such as ultracold atoms, photonic lattices, and
superconducting circuits, offering guiding principles for quantum simulation
and the corresponding experiments, which opens the avenue for controlled
engineering of spin-resolved localization and flat-band physics in synthetic
quantum matter.

Abstract: Realizing Bose-Einstein condensation of polar molecules is a long-standing
challenge in ultracold physics and quantum science due to near-universal
two-body collisional losses. Here, we report the production of a Bose-Einstein
condensate of ground-state sodium-rubidium molecules via high efficiency
evaporative cooling, with losses suppressed using the dual microwave shielding
technique. The ability to tune the dipolar interaction between these ultracold
polar molecules is crucial for producing the condensate and enables exciting
prospects for future applications. We explore different regimes of dipolar
interactions, realizing both the gas phase and the quantum droplet phase of the
molecular condensate. This work opens new avenues for investigating quantum
matter with strong dipolar interactions and for quantum simulation of
long-range many-body systems.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement exists in nature but is absent in classical physics,
hence it fundamentally distinguishes quantum from classical theories. While
entanglement is routinely observed for few-body systems, it is significantly
more challenging to witness in quantum many-body systems. Here, we
theoretically study entanglement between two parallel and spatially separated
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) partitioned along the longitudinal axis. In
particular, we focus on 1D Bose gases as a realization of TLLs and investigate
two experimentally relevant situations: tunnel-coupled gases at finite
temperatures and after coherent splitting. In both scenarios, we analytically
calculate the logarithmic negativity and identify a threshold temperature below
which the system is entangled. Notably, this threshold temperature is
accessible in near-term coherent splitting experiments. Furthermore, we
investigate the crossover between quantum and classical correlations in the
vicinity of the threshold temperature by comparing logarithmic negativity with
mutual information. We argue that the initial mutual information established by
the coherent splitting is conserved in TLL dynamics, thus preventing certain
generalized Gibbs ensembles from being reached during prethermalization.
Moreover, both logarithmic negativity and mutual information are found to scale
extensively with the subsystem's length. Although the ground-state entanglement
between coupled TLLs has been predicted to be extensive, this setting is
largely overlooked compared to other partitions. Our work extends the study of
entanglement between coupled TLLs to finite temperatures and out-of-equilibrium
regimes, and provides a strategy towards experimental detection of extensive
entanglement in quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures.

Abstract: Disordered quantum many-body systems pose one of the central challenges in
condensed matter physics and quantum information science, as their dynamics are
generally intractable for classical computation. Many-body localization (MBL),
hypothesized to evade thermalization indefinitely under strong disorder,
exemplifies this difficulty. Here, we study the stability of MBL in two
dimensions using ultracold atoms in optical lattices with variable system sizes
up to $24\times 24$ sites, well beyond the classically simulable regime. Using
the imbalance as a probe, we trace the long-time dynamics under two distinctive
disorder potentials: quasiperiodic and random disorder. For random disorder,
the MBL crossover point shifts to higher disorder strength with increasing
system size, consistent with the avalanche scenario. In contrast, with
quasiperiodic disorder, we observe no clear system size dependence, suggesting
possible stability of MBL in two dimensions.

field with many applications in fundamental physics and quantum technology.
Here, we report on a high-flux generation of Bose-Einstein condensate mixtures
of $^{41}$K and $^{87}$Rb, using a fully integrated sounding rocket setup. We
investigate the release and the free expansion of the quantum mixtures for
different orientations to gravity. The release dynamics are governed by the
mixture interactions as well as the decaying magnetic field during the release.
The latter can be minimized by a dedicated switch-off protocol of the trap
generating currents where an exact model enabled us to characterize the
interaction effects. Our results establish a new benchmark for generating
ultracold mixtures on mobile platforms, with direct relevance for future
experiments on interacting quantum gases and tests of the equivalence principle
in space.

Abstract: We describe how to construct an effective Hamiltonian for leading twist
states in $d\ge 3$ CFTs based on the separation of scales that emerges at large
spin $J$ between the AdS radius $\ell_{\rm AdS}$ and the characteristic
distance $\sim \ell_{\rm AdS} \log J$ between particles rotating in AdS with
angular momentum $J$. As a controlled example, we work specifically with the
toy model of a bulk complex scalar field $\phi$ with a $\lambda |\phi|^4$
coupling in AdS, up to $O(\lambda^2)$. For a given choice of twist cutoff
$\Lambda_\tau$ in the effective theory, interactions are separated into
long-distance nonlocal potential terms, arising from $t$-channel exchange of
states with twist $\le \Lambda_\tau$, and short-distance local terms fixed by
matching to low spin CFT data. At $O(\lambda^2)$, the effective Hamiltonian for
the toy model has two-body nonlocal potential terms from one-loop bulk diagrams
as well as three-body nonlocal potential terms from tree-level exchange of
$\phi$. We describe in detail how these contributions are evaluated and how
they are related to the CFT data entering in the large spin expansion. We
discuss how to apply the construction of such effective Hamiltonians for models
which do not have a large central charge or a sparse spectrum and are not
typically considered holographic.

effects that arises as a function of spin $J$. We obtain the Hamiltonian of the
theory and show that it correctly reproduces all the dimensions at
$O(\epsilon^2)$ of the leading twist operators for all values of the charge $Q$
and spin $J$. The holographic Hamiltonian is given by the bulk exchange of a
charged scalar $\phi$, neutral scalar $s \sim \phi \phi^*$, and a `ghost' field
$c$, as well as a single local bulk interaction $(\phi \phi^*)^2$. We analyze
various aspects of the spectrum and discuss their interpretation in light of
the bulk description.

### [108] [Positive Geometry for Stringy Scalar Amplitudes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20161)
*Christoph Bartsch,Karol Kampf,David Podivin,Jonah Stalknecht*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: A new positive geometry called the associahedral grid is introduced that geometrically realizes the inverse string theory KLT kernel. This grid captures the $	ext{ord}' dependence of stringified amplitudes for bi-adjoint scalar $	ext{Tr}(	ext{}^3)$, pions in the NLSM, and their mixed $	ext{Tr}(	ext{}/	ext{}}+	ext{ pions}$ amplitudes, reducing to field theory amplitudes as $	ext{ord}	o 0. The geometry uses positive coordinates to calculate amplitudes and demonstrates how positive geometries can explore stringy features, like infinite resonance. A new $	ext{ kinematic }$	ext{-shift}$ connects $	ext{Tr}(	ext{}/^3}$ and NLSM pion amplitudes via the grid. This shows how string amplitudes can be represented using geometric and combinatorial methods beyond Feynman diagrams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper builds on recent ideas that positive geometries, KLT kernels, and $	ext{}$ shifts could provide new insights into amplitudes in scalar theories and the NLSM. By introducing the associahedral grid, the authors contribute to the broader effort to unify geometric and combinatorial perspectives in quantum field theory and string theory.

Method: The authors generalize the BCJ framework to involve the KLT kernel for many-point amplitudes in $	ext{ord}' symmetric theories. They then reformulate these results into the associahedral grid language, reducing to field theory at $	ext{ord}	o 0. Specific combinatorial structures, like ordered binary trees, are used to describe ordered amplitudes. The kinematic $	ext{-shift}$ is introduced and shown to naturally arise in the grid framework.

Result: The study successfully constructs a geometric representation of the inverse string theory KLT kernel using the associahedral grid. This representation captures full $	ext{ord}$-dependence, reduces to field theory in the $	ext{ord}	o 0$ limit, elucidates infinite resonance structures, and connects $	ext{Tr}(	ext{}/^3}$ and NLSM amplitudes through a new $	ext{-shift}$. These results open new promising avenues for applying positive geometry to explore stringy features of amplitudes.

Conclusion: This paper advances the connection between geometry, positive geometries, and string theory in the study of amplitudes. The introduction of the associahedral grid as a geometric representation of the inverse string theory KLT kernel is a major step forward in the program of connecting scattering amplitudes with modern geometry and combinatorics.

Abstract: We introduce a new positive geometry, the associahedral grid, which provides
a geometric realization of the inverse string theory KLT kernel. It captures
the full $\alpha'$-dependence of stringified amplitudes for bi-adjoint scalar
$\phi^3$ theory, pions in the NLSM, and their mixed $\phi$/$\pi$ amplitudes,
reducing to the corresponding field theory amplitudes in the $\alpha'\to 0$
limit. Our results demonstrate how positive geometries can be utilized beyond
rational functions to capture stringy features of amplitudes, such as an
infinite resonance structure. The kinematic $\delta$-shift, recently proposed
to relate field theory $\text{Tr}(\phi^3)$ and NLSM pion amplitudes, naturally
emerges as the leading contribution to the stringy geometry. We show how the
connection between $\text{Tr}(\phi^3)$ and NLSM can be geometrized using the
associahedral grid.

Abstract: We consider two dimensional superconformal Carrollian theories with
boundaries and construct two variants of the Boundary Superconformal Carrollian
Algebra (BSCCA), viz. the Homogeneous and the Inhomogeneous, by making
appropriate identification of the parent superconformal Carrollian algebras.
These new algebras are then recovered by appropriate limits of a single copy of
Super Virasoro algebra. We then focus on the theory of null tensionless
superstrings and construct, for the first time, an open null superstring. The
Homogeneous version of the BSCCA is realised as worldsheet symmetries on this
open null superstring.

Abstract: It was recently shown that a black hole (or any Killing horizon) will
decohere any quantum superposition in their vicinity. I review three distinct

entanglement with "degrees of freedom" in the interior (2) the absorption of
soft, entangling radiation emitted by the superposition and (3) interactions
with the quantum, fluctuating multipole moments of a black hole arising from
ultra low frequency Hawking quanta. The relationship between "soft hair" and
interactions with "internal degrees of freedom" is emphasized and some
implications for the nature of horizons in a quantum theory of gravity are
discussed.

*Jinn-Ouk Gong,Sergei V. Ketov,Takahiro Terada*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Realizing $F$-term slow-roll inflation in supergravity is non-trivial due to the well-known $	anh$-problem. The common strategy to solve the problem is to impose a shift symmetry on the K""" waß Jordan


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In recent years, inflationary models have been playing a central role in cosmology, and their implications have been extensively studied via rigorous mathematical frameworks. This trend towards mathematically rigorous approaches in physics often leads to the resolution of puzzles in cosmology. The discussion of $F$-term inflation is particularly promising due to its simplicity compared to Dirichlet boundary conditions in string theory. However, challenges such as solving the $	anh$-problem and implementing multi-field models remain. Hence, deriving a generic framework for embedding multi-field inflation models into supergravity would allow a systematic treatment in a single formalism, which is not only useful for constructing inflationary models but also for cosmological studies with detailed observations.

Method: An alternative mechanism in supergravity, avoiding the use of a stabilizer superfield, was proposed earlier by two of us in the case of a single chiral superfield with the inflaton and goldstino components. This paper extends that approach to multi-superfield inflation. We present specific examples and derive general conditions required to avoid tachyonic instabilities during multi-field evolution.

Result: We demonstrate that by extending the alternative mechanism to multi-superfield inflation, we can construct a general framework that accommodates a wide range of single- and multi-field inflation models within supergravity. This framework resolves the challenges posed by multi-field inflation and provides a systematic approach for future model-building efforts.

Conclusion: In summary, this work showcases the potential of supergravity as a comprehensive framework for inflationary model-building, particularly in multi-field scenarios. The proposed extension not only resolves the tachyonic instabilities but also offers a robust methodology for constructing inflationary models that align with cosmological observations.

Abstract: Realising $F$-term slow-roll inflation in supergravity is non-trivial due to
the well-known $\eta$-problem. The common strategy to solve the problem is to
impose a shift symmetry on the K\"ahler potential, but this often leads to a
negative potential in the large-field regime. To avoid negative potentials, an
additional superfield called the stabiliser is usually added with a desired
interaction. An alternative mechanism in supergravity, avoiding the use of a
stabiliser superfield, was earlier proposed by two of us in the setup with a
single chiral superfield having inflaton and goldstino amongst its field
components. In this work, we extend that alternative mechanism to
multi-superfield models of inflation, thereby providing a generic framework for
embedding a wide class of single- and multi-field inflation models into
supergravity. We illustrate our approach by several concrete examples of
multi-field inflation and clarify the conditions required to avoid tachyonic
instabilities during multi-field evolution. Our proposal significantly broadens
the theoretical landscape of $F$-term inflation models in supergravity.

Motivation: 大 N 分析在 QCD 中用于研究 η' 孤立子的势行为，其在 η' = π/N_f 处产生异常峰点，但有限 N 下的相容性条件则要求在 N_f 和 N 互质时势光滑。

Method: 论文分析了不同 N_f 和 N 围绕 N=0 的行为，通过相关参数计算 gcd(N, N_f) 来确定势的分支次数，并证明了异常峰点的必要性。

Conclusion: 此工作通过分析 QCD 的势行为，揭示了 η' 孤立子势在不同参数下的相变现象，补充了现有关于 QCD 相关相变的理论和技术，奠定了新的分析基础。

Abstract: The large $N$ analysis of QCD states that the potential for the $\eta'$ meson
develops cusps at $\eta' = \pi / N_f$, $3 \pi /N_f$, $\cdots$, with $N_f$ the
number of flavors. Furthermore, the recent discussion of generalized anomalies
tells us that even for finite $N$ there should be cusps if $N$ and $N_f$ are
not coprime, as one can show that the domain wall configuration of $\eta'$
should support a Chern-Simons theory on it, i.e., domains are not smoothly
connected. On the other hand, there is a supporting argument for
instanton-like, smooth potentials of $\eta'$ from the analyses of softly-broken
supersymmetric QCD for $N_f= N-1$, $N$, and $N+1$. We argue that the analysis
of the $N_f = N$ case should be subject to the above anomaly argument, and thus
there should be a cusp; while the $N_f = N \pm 1$ cases are consistent, as
$N_f$ and $N$ are coprime. We discuss how this cuspy/smooth transition can be
understood. For $N_f< N$, we find that the number of branches of the $\eta'$
potential is $\operatorname{gcd}(N,N_f)$, which is the minimum number allowed
by the anomaly. We also discuss the condition for s-confinement in QCD-like
theories, and find that in general the anomaly matching of the $\theta$
periodicity indicates that s-confinement can only be possible when $N_f$ and
$N$ are coprime. The s-confinement in supersymmetric QCD at $N_f = N+1$ is a
famous example, and the argument generalizes for any number of fermions in the
adjoint representation.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop the general formalism and properties of the
spacetime density matrix, which captures correlations among different Cauchy
surfaces and can be regarded as a natural generalization of the standard
density matrix defined on a single Cauchy surface. We present the construction
of the spacetime density matrix in general quantum systems and its
representation via the Schwinger Keldysh path integral. We further introduce a
super-operator framework, within which the spacetime density matrix appears as
a special case, and discuss possible generalizations from this perspective. We
also show that the spacetime density matrix satisfies a Liouville von Neumann
type equation of motion. When considering subsystems, a reduced spacetime
density matrix can be defined by tracing over complementary degrees of freedom.
We study the general properties of its moments and, in particular, derive
universal short time behavior of the second moment. We find that coupling
between subsystems plays a crucial role in obtaining nontrivial results.
Assuming weak coupling, we develop a perturbative method to compute the moments
systematically.

Abstract: We study the ODE/IM correspondence for two-dimensional conformal field
theories with Virasoro and $\mathcal{W}_N$ symmetry. Building on earlier work
establishing the correspondence, we develop a systematic algorithm for
calculating the eigenvalues of local integrals of motion in terms of the Bethe
roots using formal WKB expansions of wave functions associated to the
differential operators. The method is demonstrated explicitly for Virasoro,
$\mathcal{W}_3$, and $\mathcal{W}_4$ algebras, yielding closed expressions for
the eigenvalues of the first few local quantum KdV Hamiltonians. A key
geometric structure emerging from our analysis is the mirror curve, a
three-punctured sphere that is naturally covered by the WKB curve. We show how
the algebraic properties of the $\mathcal{W}$-symmetry algebras are reflected
in the geometry of these curves, and how period integrals on these curves
reproduce the spectral data of the integrable system. Applications to
Argyres-Douglas minimal models allow us to test the prescription both
analytically and numerically and we find complete agreement between the
calculations in different triality frames. Finally, we examine large rank
limits of ground state eigenvalues and show that they match the genus expansion
of the topological string partition function on $\mathbb{C}^3$.

Abstract: The three-dimensional classical O($N$) model with a boundary has received
renewed interest due to the discovery of the extraordinary-log boundary
university class for $2\leq N< N_\text{c}$. The exponent of the spin correlator
and the critical value $N_c$ are related to certain universal amplitudes in the
normal universality class. To determine their precise values, we revisit the 3d
O($N$) boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) for $N=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$. After
substantially improving the accuracy of the boundary bootstrap, our
determinations are in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo results,
resolving the previous discrepancies due to low truncation orders. We also use
the recent bulk bootstrap results to derive highly accurate Ising data. Many
bulk and boundary predictions are obtained for the first time. Our results
demonstrate the great potential of the $\eta$ minimization method for many
unexplored non-positive bootstrap problems.

Abstract: We study a class of observables in four-dimensional superconformal
Yang--Mills theories which, in the planar limit at finite 't Hooft coupling,
can be expressed as determinants of semi-infinite matrices built from Bessel
functions. This determinant representation points to an underlying integrable
structure, which we make explicit by showing that the observables satisfy a
nonlinear differential-difference equation. We argue that the solution to this
equation admits an expansion in terms of iterated Chen integrals of uniform
transcendental weight. Remarkably, the coefficients in this expansion are
universal positive integers, independent of the particular observable,
suggesting a hidden combinatorial origin. Building on this observation, we show
that the resulting expressions possess a natural interpretation in enumerative
combinatorics: they coincide with the partition function (or generating
function) of an ensemble of lattice paths constrained to a nontrivial domain.
This correspondence extends and generalizes the classical Dyck paths to a
richer family of path ensembles relevant in gauge theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-perturbative partition functions of quantum theories constitute a class
of $\tau-$functions, which are distinguished satisfying Hirota's bilinear
identities(BI). To make this statement general, there must be a proper
definition of $\tau-$function that gives rise to a set of bilinear identities.
In the classical definition of $\tau-$function for integrable Toda or KP
hierarchies, there is a restriction on matrix elements to be based on
group-like elements with the comultiplication $\Delta(g)=g \otimes g$. This
restriction can not be straightforwardly transferred to the q-deformed case,
because there are no group-like elements in q-deformed universal enveloping
algebra (UEA), except for its Cartan subalgebra. The new approach to the
$\tau-$function is to remove the restriction on g to be obligatory the
group-like element. The main result of this work is a derivation of the set of
bilinear identities and $\tau-$functions for $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_3)$ in the
fundamental representations for non-group-like elements. We consider difference
operators which lead to the basic bilinear identities. Also, we provide an
analysis of the ways of obtaining BI for higher rank algebras $U_q(sl_n)$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We explore the dynamics of the fermion-rotor system, a simple impurity model
in d=1+1 dimensions that consists of a collection of purely right-moving
fermions interacting with a quantum mechanical rotor localised at the origin.
This was first introduced by Polchinski as a toy model for monopole-fermion
scattering and is surprisingly subtle, with ingoing and outgoing fermions
carrying different quantum numbers. We show that the rotor acts as a twist
operator in the low-energy theory, changing the quantum numbers of excitations
that have previously passed through the origin to ensure scattering consistent
with all symmetries.
  We further show how generalisations of this model with multiple rotors and
unequal charges can be viewed as a UV-completion of boundary states for chiral
theories, including the well-studied 3450 model. We compute correlation
functions between ingoing and outgoing fermions and show that fermions dressed
with the rotor degree of freedom act as local operators and create
single-particle states, generalising an earlier result obtained in a theory
with a single rotor and equal charges. Finally, we point out a mod 2 anomaly in
these models that descends from the Witten anomaly in 4d

Result: 发现加速观测器的响应存在非平滑依赖，且在 Neumann 限制下出现振荡信号。

Conclusion: 不稳定性量子态需借助 rigged Hilbert 空间并可被加速观测器调节不发散。

Abstract: We investigate the quantization of a single unstable mode in a real scalar
field subject to a Robin boundary condition in (1+1)-dimensional half-Minkowski
spacetime. The instability arises from an imaginary frequency mode - analogous
to that of the inverted harmonic oscillator - requiring the rigged Hilbert
space formalism for consistent quantization. Within this framework, the
unstable mode is naturally described as a well-defined decaying (or growing)
quantum state with a characteristic mean lifetime. We investigate its physical
consequences via the response of an Unruh-DeWitt detector along static,
inertial, and uniformly accelerated trajectories. For static and inertial
observers, the detector response exhibits a Breit-Wigner resonance profile,
with a decay width determined by the unstable frequency and a Doppler factor.
In the Neumann limit, infrared divergences emerge from arbitrarily
low-frequency modes. Interestingly, for accelerated detectors, the response
acquires a nontrivial dependence on acceleration, and the Neumann limit yields
a finite, oscillatory signal rather than a divergence, suggesting that
acceleration can act as an effective infrared regulator.

Conclusion: 该研究为引力散射的代数研究提供了一个新的数学框架，有助于理解引力理论中的量子效应及其与量子信息理论的联系。在高维和包含边界激发的情况下，提供了扩展框架的路径。

Abstract: We introduce a new algebraic framework to describe gravitational scrambling,
including the semiclassical limit of any out-of-time-order correlation function
that is built out of operator insertions separated by approximately the
scrambling time. In two dimensions, the scrambling algebra, which we call a
modular-twisted product, is defined in terms of two copies of the
Leutheusser-Liu half-sided modular inclusion of von Neumann algebras; these
describe early- and late-time operators respectively. In limits where the
separation between insertions is taken to be either significantly greater or
smaller than the scrambling time, the modular-twisted product reduces,
respectively, to free- and tensor-product algebras that were previously studied
in [arXiv:2209.10454]. In a sense, the modular-twisted product interpolates
between these two products. Including the Hamiltonian in the scrambling algebra
leads to a Type II$_\infty$ von Neumann algebra with finite renormalized
entropies that interpolate between single-QES and multi-QES phases. We also
describe how to generalize the modular-twisted product algebra to higher
dimensions, including spatially localized boundary excitations.

Conclusion: 框架在ABJ(M)理论中的作用与超对称缺陷理论的RG流和g-定理紧密相关，并在强耦合对偶中表现为一个与背景B-场耦合的量。

Abstract: We investigate the role of framing in a family of 1/24 BPS Wilson loops in
ABJ(M) theory, which define flows of supersymmetric defect field theories,
interpolating between the 1/6 BPS and the 1/2 BPS superconformal fixed points.
We analyze in perturbation theory how framing affects both the expectation
values of these operators and the correlation functions of local insertions on
the defect, as well as its interplay with RG flow and the g-theorem. We obtain
a non-trivial identity between the one-point function of the defect stress
tensor and a Q-exact correlator, which establishes a direct link between scale
invariance, superconformal invariance and framing, and clarifies the deep
connection between scale and cohomological anomalies. Finally, we propose a
holographic interpretation of framing at strong coupling, identifying it with a
coupling to the background B-field in the dual string theory.

Conclusion: 这种方法为分析4d理论的复杂分解提供了有用的方法。

Abstract: We study weakly-coupled descriptions/channel decompositions of the 4d
$\mathcal{N}=2$ theories of class $\mathcal{S}$ of type $\mathfrak{su}(N)$,
from the perspective of the 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ mirror duals of their circle
compactifications. This is a delicate problem when the channel decomposition
produces pathological, or bad, 4d configurations that correspond to spheres
with non-maximal punctures. The star-shaped quivers, describing the 3d mirrors
associated with such bad 4d configurations, are bad 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$
theories. Leveraging recent results regarding 3d bad theories, we identify a
new and interesting family of bad theories, which we coin \textit{broken}
theories, that naturally arise in this context. Using these broken theories, we
develop a systematic and analytic method that determines the generically
non-Lagrangian matter sectors and the weakly-coupled gauge groups in such
channel decompositions. We understand these weakly-coupled descriptions as
emerging dynamically via Higgs mechanisms triggered by operators acquiring
vacuum expectation values.

Motivation: Understanding and detecting neutrinos and dark matter are key goals in modern physics, and mineral detectors provide a unique approach to achieve this.

Method: The paper reviews the development of mineral detector technology through historical context, current achievements, and future prospects, incorporating multiple scientific disciplines.

Result: The paper emphasizes the technological advancements and the potential of mineral detectors to contribute to fundamental physics research, particularly in neutrino physics and dark matter detection.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of continued research and collaboration in advancing mineral detector technology for future scientific breakthroughs.

Abstract: The third ``Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter'' (MD$\nu$DM'25)
meeting was held May 20-23, 2025 in Yokohama, Japan, hosted by the Yokohama
Institute for Earth Sciences, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and
Technology (JAMSTEC). These proceedings compile contributions from the workshop
and update the progress of mineral detector research. MD$\nu$DM'25 was the
third such meeting, following the first in October of 2022 held at the IFPU in
Trieste, Italy and the second in January of 2024 hosted by the Center for
Neutrino Physics at Virginia Tech in Arlington, USA. Mineral detectors record
and retain damage induced by nuclear recoils in synthetic or natural mineral
samples. The damage features can then be read out by a variety of nano- and
micro-scale imaging techniques. Applications of mineral detectors on timescales
relevant for laboratory experiments include reactor neutrino monitoring and
dark matter detection, with the potential to measure the directions as well as
the energies of the induced nuclear recoils. For natural mineral detectors
which record nuclear recoils over geological timescales, reading out even small
mineral samples could be sensitive to rare interactions induced by
astrophysical neutrinos, cosmic rays, dark matter and heavy exotic particles. A
series of mineral detectors of different ages could measure the time evolution
of these fluxes, offering a unique window into the history of our solar system
and the Milky Way. Mineral detector research is highly multidisciplinary,
incorporating aspects of high energy physics, condensed matter physics,
materials science, geoscience, and AI/ML for data analysis. Although realizing
the scientific potential of mineral detectors poses many challenges, the
MD$\nu$DM community looks forward to the continued development of mineral
detector experiments and the possible discoveries that mineral detectors could
reveal.

TL;DR: We propose a portable multispectral single-pixel imaging method that uses an untrained PINN to reconstruct high-quality spectral images directly from raw sensor measurements, addressing the challenges of high cost, complexity, and low performance in low-light conditions in conventional MSI systems. The PINN-based approach enables self-corrected reconstruction without labeled training data and has shown promising performance in image reconstruction and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral imaging is increasingly important in fields like agriculture, medical diagnostics, and industrial inspection, but traditional MSI systems are limited by high costs, complexity, and poor performance in low-light conditions. Additionally, data-driven MSI methods require large labeled datasets and struggle with generalization. This paper presents a novel approach to overcome these challenges.

Method: We developed a portable multispectral single-pixel imaging (MS-SPI) method that integrates a chip-sized multispectral sensor and an untrained physics-informed neural network (PINN). The PINN leverages the physics-informed structure to reconstruct high-quality spectral images directly from raw sensor measurements without the need for labeled training data. The self-corrected reconstruction capability was validated through a proof-of-concept prototype.

Result: The MS-SPI method successfully reconstructed high-quality spectral images with 12 channels at a sampling rate of 10% and demonstrated better performance than conventional compressive sensing algorithms under varying sampling rate conditions. Additionally, the approach was successfully applied to an MSI-based image segmentation task, where spatial regions were discriminated according to their characteristic spectral signatures.

Conclusion: This compact, high-fidelity, and portable multispectral imaging approach using PINN offers a promising solution for lightweight and cost-effective spectral imaging on mobile platforms, with potential applications in various fields.

Abstract: Multispectral imaging (MSI) captures data across multiple spectral bands,
offering enhanced informational depth compared to standard RGB imaging and
benefiting diverse fields such as agriculture, medical diagnostics, and
industrial inspection. Conventional MSI systems, however, suffer from high
cost, complexity, and limited performance in low-light conditions. Moreover,
data-driven MSI methods depend heavily on large, labeled training datasets and
struggle with generalization. In this work, we present a portable multispectral
single-pixel imaging (MS-SPI) method that integrates a chip-sized multispectral
sensor for system miniaturization and leverages an untrained physics-informed
neural network (PINN) to reconstruct high-quality spectral images without the
need for labeled training data. The physics-informed structure of the network
enables the self-corrected reconstruction of multispectral images directly with
the input of raw measurements from the multispectral sensor. Our
proof-of-concept prototype achieves the reconstruction of 12-channel
high-quality spectral images at the sampling rate of 10%. We also
experimentally validate its performance under varying sampling rate conditions,
by comparing it with conventional compressive sensing algorithms. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the application of this technique to an MSI-based image
segmentation task, in which spatial regions are discriminated according to
their characteristic spectral signatures. This compact, high-fidelity, and
portable approach offers promising pathways to lightweight and cost-effective
spectral imaging on mobile platforms.

Abstract: Photon identification in calorimeters represents a crucial challenge in
particle physics experiments, especially in high-density environments where
shower overlap probabilities become significant. We present an
energy-core-based photon identification method that exploits the distinct
compact energy core feature of electromagnetic showers through Hough transform
pattern recognition in imaging calorimeters. The method, validated through
simulations of the CEPC crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, demonstrates
outstanding performance. It achieves a high identification efficiency of nearly
100% for photons with energies exceeding 2 GeV and a separation efficiency
approaching 100% for two 5 GeV photons when the distance between them reaches
the granularity limit of the calorimeter. This advanced energy-core-based
photon identification method integrated with an energy splitting technique
enhances the performance of photon measurement and provides a promising tool
for imaging calorimeters, particularly those requiring high precision in photon
detection in complex event topologies with high multiplicity.

Abstract: While the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) is

Jefferson Lab's full EPICS network, and we offer it as an example of the

Abstract: Optically-pumped atomic magnetometers have previously been used in arrays to
reject interference from far away sources and enable the sensitive detection of
local sources of radio frequency (RF) signals, useful, for instance, in the
detection of low field NMR signals in an unshielded environment. We now
demonstrate a complementary scheme in which four magnetometer measurements are
used to locate in three dimensions a nearby radio frequency source. The
methodology relies on the measurement of a radio frequency vector at two
different positions and modeling the source as a magnetic dipole of known
orientation. In contrast to coil detection, magnetometers have the advantage of
measuring signals in a 2D plane, and do not inductively couple to their
environment or each other, making them a strong candidate for localization of
hidden RF sources. For this demonstration, we use only a single RF magnetometer
to make four measurements of a synchronous and oriented dipole source, but it
is to be expected that this could be replaced by four magnetometers working
simultaneously. In addition, this work is greatly aided by the introduction of
a fully integrated magnetometer, in which all optics, including lasers, are
safely enclosed into a compact head with flexible wired connections. The
portable, as well as safe, nature of the sensor make it quite valuable for in
the field work.

Abstract: Rare-event search experiments require construction materials with high
radiopurity to minimise background contributions. Thanks to its high mechanical
strength, low density, machinability, and commercial availability in relatively
radio-pure forms, titanium is a suitable material for structural elements in
rare event searches. To remove surface deposits on materials used, a chemical
etching stage is usually performed. However, the chemical resistance of
titanium means that, conventionally, such etching is done with hydrofluoric
acid. Hydrofluoric acid presents serious health risks to users, and such
hazards are compounded in the case of construction in deep underground
laboratories. An alternative chemical etching using sulphuric acid is
presented. This is demonstrated to etch titanium, removing 3.7 $\mu$m of
material from the surface over the course of 20 hours. Scanning electron
microscopy with back-scattered electron spectroscopy was used to study the
surface and contamination of the titanium, demonstrating the removal of surface
contaminants after etching. The proposed method is a potential alternative to
those currently employed.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: By correlating only the 1-particle states occupied in the reference
determinant the conventional design for the single-reference R12/F12
explicitly-correlated methods biases them towards the ground state description
thereby making treatment of response properties of the ground state, and
energies and other properties of excited states less robust. While the use of
multireference methods and/or extensions of the standard SP projected geminals
can achieve a more balanced description of ground and excited states, here we
show that the same goals can be achieved by extending the action of F12
correlators to the occupied and valence unoccupied 1-particle states only. This
design choice reflects the strong dependence of the optimal correlation
lengthscale of the F12 ansatz on the orbital energies/structure, and helps to
avoid the unphysical raising of the ground state energy if the F12 geminals are
used to correlate pairs of all 1-particle states. The improved F12 geminal
design is incorporated into the unitary transcorrelation framework to produce a
unitary 2-body Hamiltonian that incorporates the short-range dynamical
correlation physics for ground and low-energy excited states in a balanced
manner. This explicitly-correlated effective Hamiltonian reduces the basis set
requirement on the correlation-consistent basis cardinal number by 1 or more
over the uncorrelated counterpart for the description of the ground state
coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) energies, the vertical excitation
energies and harmonic vibrational frequencies of equation-of-motion CCSD
low-energy excited states.

Abstract: We present a perspective on molecular machine learning (ML) in the field of
chemical process engineering. Recently, molecular ML has demonstrated great
potential in (i) providing highly accurate predictions for properties of pure
components and their mixtures, and (ii) exploring the chemical space for new
molecular structures. We review current state-of-the-art molecular ML models
and discuss research directions that promise further advancements. This
includes ML methods, such as graph neural networks and transformers, which can
be further advanced through the incorporation of physicochemical knowledge in a
hybrid or physics-informed fashion. Then, we consider leveraging molecular ML
at the chemical process scale, which is highly desirable yet rather unexplored.
We discuss how molecular ML can be integrated into process design and
optimization formulations, promising to accelerate the identification of novel
molecules and processes. To this end, it will be essential to create molecule
and process design benchmarks and practically validate proposed candidates,

*Sukanya Jana,Snigdha Bose,Sayel Chakraborty,Pintu Mandal,Nabanita Deb*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effects of radial asymmetry in a linear quadrupole mass filter with circular rods, analyzing the transmission characteristics, stability region, and resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of radial asymmetry on the performance of mass filters is important for optimizing their resolution and stability.

Method: A radial potential model was developed to account for geometric deviations caused by changes in electrode radii or displacement of a diametrically opposite pair. The transmission characteristics were systematically examined by varying the asymmetry parameter.

Result: The results show a linear shift in the transmission peak along the q-axis as a function of the asymmetry parameter. Increased asymmetry broadens the transmission contours and reduces resolution. However, a specific 'magic' asymmetry parameter yields enhanced resolution compared to the symmetric case.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into optimizing the performance of quadrupole mass filters by considering asymmetric configurations and higher-order field effects.

Abstract: This study examines the effects of radial asymmetry in a linear quadrupole
mass filter with circular rods, introduced either by a change in electrode
radii or by displacement of a diametrically opposite pair. A radial potential
model is developed to account for the resulting geometric deviations, enabling
analysis of the first stability region specific to the quadrupole component.
The transmission characteristics of such asymmetric configurations are
systematically examined, revealing a linear shift in the transmission peak
along the q-axis as a function of the asymmetry parameter. This behavior is
interpreted through modifications observed in the stability diagram.
Furthermore, increased asymmetry is shown to broaden the transmission contours
and generally reduce resolution. Notably, a `magic' asymmetry parameter of
-0.02 corresponding to electrode displacement, yields enhanced resolution
compared to the symmetric case for a fixed rod-to-field radius ratio. An
empirical relationship is established between the resolution and the combined
contribution of the coefficients of octupole and dodecapole potential
components, highlighting the critical role of higher-order field effects in
performance optimization.

Conclusion: 该研究为化学空间的无偏探索提供了实用的方法和准则。

Abstract: The overwhelming majority of molecules remains unexplored. This is mostly due
to the sheer number of them, which prohibits any enumeration of chemical space,
the set of all such molecules. In practice, only subsets of chemical space are
considered, but those subsets exhibit substantial bias, prohibiting data-driven
characterization of chemical space itself. In this work, we provide a method
produce unbiased representative random samples of chemical space without
enumeration of constituent molecules and to estimate the number of molecules in
any custom chemical space. The approach is applicable to molecules which can be
represented as graph and runs efficiently even for molecules of 30 atoms. We
use it to estimate the representativeness of current databases with respect to
their underlying chemical space and to establish a necessary criterion for a
lower bound of database sizes to be representative of an underlying chemical
space.

Abstract: Additives are essential to enhance or modify the properties of plastics for
target applications. However, finding appropriate additives may be challenging,
since we lack knowledge on their interactions with the plastics and with
moisture, and the interplay between them. In this work, we study a commercial
additive as well as two new potential additives for their antistatic and slip
properties in polyethylene by means of atomistic molecular dynamics
simulations. We reveal the most favorable interactions between polyethylene,
each of these molecules and water, along with providing a microscopic picture
of their interfacial structure. All additives interact with water mainly by
their polar heads, with water acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor or donor
depending on the additive. As expected, water does not enter the polyethylene
matrix; it accumulates at its surface instead, without any preferencial
orientation. The additives studied exhibit remarkably different structures when
they are mixed with the polymer: two of them enter the polymer matrix to
various degrees, either by intercalating their chains with the polyethylene
ones or by forming miscellar-like structures, while the third one stays at the
surface. When water is incorporated into the system, the structure of some of
the additive/polyethylene systems changes. The magnitude and nature of these
changes depend on the relative concentrations of all species. If the additives
are in low concentrations, water stays at the surface of the material, in a
drop-like shape. The additives penetrate and organize the polymer more or less
depending on whether water is present or not. We predict that one of our two
proposed molecules has promising antistatic properties while the other one
could be applied as a slip agent. We hope that our predictions will spark
interest in testing these molecules in the laboratory as polyethylene
additives.

Abstract: The functional computation of the human brain arises from the collective
behaviour of the underlying neural network. The emerging technology enables the
recording of population activity in neurons, and the theory of neural networks
is expected to explain and extract functional computations from the data.
Thermodynamically, a large proportion of the whole-body energy is consumed by
the brain, and functional computation of the human brain seems to involve high
energy consumption. The human brain, however, does not increase its energy
consumption with its function, and most of its energy consumption is not
involved in specific brain function: how can the human brain perform its wide
repertoire of functional computations without drastically changing its energy
consumption? Here, we present a mechanism to perform functional computation by
subtle modification of the interaction network among the brain regions. We
first show that, by analyzing the data of spontaneous and task-induced
whole-cerebral-cortex activity, the probability fluxes, which are the
microscopic irreversible measure of state transitions, exhibit unique patterns
depending on the task being performed, indicating that the human brain function
is a distinct sequence of the brain state transitions. We then fit the
parameters of Ising spin systems with asymmetric interactions, where we reveal
that the symmetric interactions among the brain regions are strong and
task-independent, but the antisymmetric interactions are subtle and
task-dependent, and the inferred model reproduces most of the observed
probability flux patterns. Our results indicate that the human brain performs
its functional computation by subtly modifying the antisymmetric interaction
among the brain regions, which might be possible with a small amount of energy.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Collinear laser spectroscopy experiments on fast, neutral beams have been
extensively used for studies on short-lived radioactive nuclei, taking
advantage of its high sensitivity. The resulting resonance line-shape is known
to show significant distortion, due to the energy exchange during the
charge-exchange neutralization process, which can cause large systematic
uncertainty in the determined centroid. A model for the line shape was
constructed and simulated to be compared to measured Al, Si, and Ni hyperfine
spectra. It is shown that the distortion is caused mainly by the transfer of
electron into many different energy levels in the projectile atom and
subsequent decays, rather than secondary inelastic collisions, which were often
assumed in the line shape analysis before. The model can also be applied to
other projectile-alkali pairs, providing a reliable line-shape with less
fitting parameters than conventional phenomenological models.

Abstract: Helium atoms in the 1s50s $^3$S$_1$ Rydberg level have been resonantly
coupled to the $2\pi\times11.721$ GHz second harmonic mode of a chip-based
superconducting coplanar waveguide microwave resonator. To achieve this, the
single-photon electric-dipole-allowed 1s50s $^3$S$_1\rightarrow$ 1s50p
$^3$P$_J$ transition was tuned into resonance with the resonator mode through
the ac Stark shift induced by a second strong $2\pi\times3.350$ GHz microwave
dressing field. The effects of this dressing field, and residual uncanceled dc
electric fields at the location of the atoms close to the superconducting chip
surface were interpreted with support from Floquet calculations of the energy
level structure of the Rydberg states. To observe appreciable population
transfer in the $1~\mu$s atom-resonator interaction time using this transition,
which had an electric dipole moment of $1500 e a_0$, pulsed microwave fields
were injected into the resonator. From the photon occupation number in the
resonator mode under these conditions, the single-photon Rabi frequency
associated with the coupling of the atoms to the resonator was estimated to be
$\sim2\pi\times100$ Hz. These results represent an important step toward
operation of this Rydberg-atom-superconducting-circuit interface in the
single-photon strong coupling regime.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Superradiant laser, which exploits the clock transition of
alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms to generate ultrastable light in the bad-cavity
limit, has garnered much attention in the past few decades. Unlike their odd
counterpart, the even isotopes of alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms possess
simpler structures and longer-lived transitions, which would relax the field
control requirements and enhance the frequency stability of the output light.
However, due to the absence of hyper-fine interaction in even isotopes, the
transition from the state $^{3}\mathrm{P}_{0}$ to $^{1}$S$_{0}$ is strictly
forbidden, leading to a vanishing coupling strength between the cavity mode and
the atoms (the state $^{3}\mathrm{P}_{0}$ as a dark state). In this work, we
suggest a superradiant laser scheme by dressing this dark state with a small
bright component by virtue of a static magnetic field. In contrast to other
proposals utilizing natural atomic transitions, our dressed-state protocol can
work from the crossover regime (coherence in both atoms and photons) to the
superradiant lasing regime (coherence solely in atoms). Specially, by operating
deep into the superradiant lasing regime, our scheme witnesses a dramatic
line-narrowing feature (mHz level) while maintaining its power. Furthermore,
compared to the crossover regime, the laser frequency in the superradiant
lasing regime is more robust against the fluctuations of the cavity length and
magnetic field strength. Our proposal demonstrates the potential for extracting
ultranarrow light from even isotopes of the alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms and
may find its role in frequency stabilization and related precision measurement
scenarios.

Conclusion: Exploits light-matter interactions for atom trapping with scalability for future applications.

Abstract: We propose to trap circular Rydberg atoms (CRAs) by a ponderomotive potential
well formed with a superimposed vortex light beam. We calculate analytically
the ponderomotive potential energy for a Bessel vortex light beam. We work out
a corrected version of the classical circular orbit approximation for a CRA
which fits the exact result much better than the usual approximation. We reveal
the three-dimensional characteristics of the potential well for some benchmark
values of the CRA principal quantum number and beam parameters such as the
frequency, the opening angle and topological charge of the vortex. We
investigate how we can achieve similar trapping effects for different principal
quantum numbers by varying beam parameters. The potential provides a lattice
structure in the beam axis where one CRA could be trapped at each lattice site.

Abstract: We present a high-resolution magnetic imaging system based on a
free-induction-decay (FID) optically pumped magnetometer (OPM), integrated with
a two-axis scanning micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) micromirror for
automated beam steering. A double-pass optical geometry enables the
millimeter-scale device under test (DUT) to be placed directly behind the vapor
cell, minimizing the standoff distance and thereby improving spatial
resolution, which is fundamentally limited by atomic spin diffusion and the
optical beam waist. The functionality of the imaging system was tested on a
diverse set of magnetic sources, including a custom printed-circuit board (PCB)
with alternating copper tracks, whose measured results agreed well with
theoretical predictions based on the Biot-Savart law. The system successfully
resolves spatially varying current distributions, identifies polarity-dependent
asymmetries in an integrated bridge rectifier chip, and tracks the dynamic
current evolution of a ceramic battery in situ. These capabilities highlight
its potential for noninvasive diagnostics of electronic circuits and batteries.
