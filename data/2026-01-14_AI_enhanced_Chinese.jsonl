It was previously argued that the backreaction of gravitons on the spacetime perturbs the area of the horizon at second-order which gives rise to a non-trivial constraint on the algebra of physical observables in the subregion. The corresponding \"dressed\" algebra including fluctuations of the total horizon area admits a well-defined trace and is Type II. In this paper we show that, at the same perturbative order at which the horizon area (and angular momentum) fluctuates, gravitational backreaction also perturbs the horizon area in an angle-dependent way. These fluctuations are encoded in horizon charges -- i.e., \"edge modes\" -- which are related to an infinite dimensional \"boost supertranslation\" symmetry of the horizon. Together, these charges impose an infinite family of nontrivial constraints on the gravitational algebra. We construct the full algebra of observables which satisfies these constraints. We argue that the resulting algebra is Type II and its trace is shown to take a universal form. The entropy of any \"semiclassical state\" is the generalized entropy with an additional \"edge mode\" contribution as well as a state-independent constant. For any black hole spacetime, the algebra has no maximum entropy state and is Type II$_{\\infty}$. In de Sitter, the static patch is defined relative to the worldline of a localized \"observer\". We show that a consistent quantization of the static-patch algebra requires a more realistic model of the observer, in which higher multipole moments perturb the \"shape\" of the cosmological horizon. We argue that a proper account of the observer's rotational kinetic energy and (non-gravitational) binding energy implies that the algebra is of Type II$_{1}$ and thereby admits a maximum entropy state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ea6\u4e3a128\u9875\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u5c40\u90e8\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e10\u8fd1\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5fae\u5206\u540c\u80da\u7ec4\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027.", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa Including observer \u7684\u5c40\u57df\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u5c40\u57df\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272", "method": "\u6784\u9020\u5c40\u57df\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6e10\u8fd1\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5fae\u5206\u540c\u80da\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u7684\u5c40\u57df\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5fae\u5206\u540c\u80da\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd9\u79cd\u6e10\u8fd1\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u7fa4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c40\u57df\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651observer\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u968f\u7740observer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5316\uff0cedge modes\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

We address this in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, where a natural physical clock emerges by promoting the vacuum energy to a dynamical variable: the vacuum cosmological constant becomes a top form degree of freedom conjugate to spacetime volume, thereby defining a notion of bulk physical time. This construction is naturally formulated in the Henneaux-Teitelboim (HT) framework. We show that the boundary dynamics is the Schwarzian mode coupled to a free particle on $U(1)$, matching the universal low-energy effective action of the complex SYK model. By further clarifying the role of the vacuum cosmological constant as a top form, we establish the equivalence between JT gravity coupled to two-dimensional Maxwell theory and 2d HT gravity via an explicit field redefinition. The initial question is addressed: we show that the resulting boundary theory can itself be rewritten as an observer action, equivalently a $(0+1)$-dimensional HT theory. This yields a direct identification of the boundary clock with the $U(1)$ phase mode, and makes its relation to the bulk clock explicit.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We construct half-sided supertranslation generators by extending subregion phase spaces of the event horizon to include doubled pairs of corner edge modes obtained from splitting the horizon, namely relative boosts and null translations of the respective corners. These edge modes carry a corner symplectic form and give rise to canonical charges generating half-sided boosts and translations. We show that the null translation generator is necessarily two-sided in the complementary translation edge modes. The charges act nontrivially on gravitationally dressed local observables on the horizon, such that the horizon subalgebra naturally takes the form of a crossed product by the associated automorphism group. Quantizing the extended phase space after linearizing around a black hole background, we obtain for each horizon cut a Type II$_{\\infty}$ von Neumann algebra equipped with a trace, whose von Neumann entropy coincides with the generalized entropy of that cut. The integrability of the half-sided null translation generator lifts to the existence of a self-adjoint operator that implements null time evolution on the Type II$_\\infty$ horizon subalgebras. The area operator is identified as the bulk implementation of the Connes cocycle flow for one-sided observables in excited states.

Motivated by the primordial KaiBC system in cyanobacteria, we study a driven, finite-state molecular clock that advances through a small number of biochemical states under an intrinsic driving energy and a rotating energy landscape set by day-night metabolism. In the continuum limit, coherence is maximized at a resonant operating point where the intrinsic drift matches the driving frequency. In realistic clocks with a finite number of states, discreteness matters: as the rotating landscape sweeps over a lattice of states, it generates a small and high frequency vibration of the collective phase that makes timing inaccurate. Combining the resonant cost with this discreteness penalty yields a trade-off in the number of states: few states are energetically cheap but noisy; many states are precise but costly. The optimum lies at moderate discretization (typically five to fifteen states) and an environmental coupling that is strong enough for responsiveness yet weak enough to avoid large discrete-state vibrations.

Current detection and classification technologies, including cameras, LiDAR, and conventional radar systems, often struggle to reliably identify and differentiate drones, especially those of similar models, under diverse environmental conditions and at extended ranges. Moreover, low radar cross sections and clutter further complicate accurate drone identification. To address these limitations, we propose a novel drone classification method based on artificial micro-Doppler signatures encoded by resonant electromagnetic stickers attached to drone blades. These tags generate distinctive, configuration-specific radar returns, enabling robust identification. We develop a tailored convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of processing raw radar signals, achieving high classification accuracy. Extensive experiments were conducted both in anechoic chambers with 43 tag configurations and outdoors under realistic flight trajectories and noise conditions. Dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), provided insight into code separability and robustness. Our results demonstrate reliable drone classification performance at signal-to-noise ratios as low as 7 dB, indicating the feasibility of long-range detection with advanced surveillance radar systems. Preliminary range estimations indicate potential operational distances of several kilometers, suitable for critical applications such as airport airspace monitoring.

In this work, we demonstrate that the observed fragment energy distribution $P(E)$ following a sudden Coulomb explosion is a direct manifestation of the initial state's 3D radial geometry. By applying a Bohmian-inspired local energy framework to Slater-type orbitals, we identify a universal \\textbf{``0.5 Rule''}: for ground-state configurations, the ratio of the peak detected energy to the integrated average energy ($R_E = E_{peak}/\\langle E \\rangle$) is strictly bounded below 0.5. Our systematic parametric study reveals that this ratio is highly sensitive to the orbital exponent $\u03b6$ and the principal quantum number $n$. Specifically, $R_E$ decreases significantly as $\u03b6$ increases, suggesting that the kinetic energy of fragments from inner-shell orbitals is far more suppressed than that of valence electrons. We further show that for excited states ($n > 1$), the emergence of secondary high-energy peaks provides a theoretical explanation for the structured KER spectra observed in $H_2^+$ ionization experiments. Finally, we propose that this geometric energy shift offers a new perspective on the ``missing energy'' problem in particle physics. Our findings suggest that a detected energy peak lower than the statistical mean may be an intrinsic signature of 3D quantum-spatial distribution ($r^2|\u03c8|^2$) rather than proof of undetected particles.

We numerically verify the theoretical findings in two cases: (i) In free-evolution cases, although the discrete (nonlinear) spectrum remains unchanged as guaranteed by an integrable system's isospectrality, an initial arbitrary wavenumber spectrum quickly evolves into a thermo-equilibrium state, demonstrating the kinetic aspect of the system; (ii) in forced-dissipated cases, we find stationary power-law spectra that agree with the theoretical predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u6d45\u6c34\u6ce2\u4e2d\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6ce2\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u534f\u5b9a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d45\u6c34\u6ce2\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6c34\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u53ef\u79ef\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528KdV\u65b9\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfcWKE\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u7531\u6f14\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u8feb\u7edd\u6563\u5c04\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u5f97\u51fa\u7b26\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u8c31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u79ef\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027."}}

For explicit SUSY state counting, we use a parametric monodromy method for the 4--charge $(1,1,1,5)$ and $(1,1,1,6)$ configurations and find that the results match the U--dual picture.

They are excellent temperature probes of the corresponding astronomical regions and are thought to be the origin of many unknown lines in astronomical survey spectra. Rovibrational spectra provide accurate vibrational energies and can guide subsequent pure rotational studies. The Automated Spectral Assignment Procedure (ASAP) greatly simplifies the rovibrational analysis when the rotational spectrum of either the upper or lower vibrational state is known with a high degree of accuracy (e.g., from a rotational analysis). Here, we present a new implementation of ASAP for the analysis of cyclopentadiene, a cyclic pure hydrocarbon that has already been detected astronomically toward the cold core of the Taurus Molecular Cloud. Using the synchrotron radiation extracted by the AILES beamline of the SOLEIL facility, we recorded mid- and far-infrared high-resolution spectra of cyclopentadiene. We analyzed the rovibrational spectrum of the $\u03bd_{21}$ fundamental (961 cm$^{-1}$) with ASAP and used ASAP$^2$ to determine the vibrational energies of the eight vibrational modes below 860 cm$^{-1}$. ASAP$^2$ is an extension of ASAP for rovibrational bands where the rotational structures of the lower and upper states are known with high accuracy, leaving only the vibrational band center to be determined. The presented rovibrational fingerprints agree with the results from pure rotational spectroscopy, demonstrating the efficiency and reliability of our new ASAP implementation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The study investigates the propagation characteristics of higher-order adiabatic Lamb modes in waveguides with linearly varying thickness, with a focus on the influence of critical thicknesses on their propagation. This is achieved by leveraging the broadband excitation capabilities of a pulsed laser generating higher order Lamb modes to reveal various critical thicknesses, such as the cut-off and Zero-Group Velocity (ZGV) thicknesses. Remarkably, ZGV resonances can be induced at locations well beyond the laser source. Moreover, the mode's behavior is strongly influenced by thickness variations in all directions, imparting the plate an anisotropic-like behavior. Additionally, based on the observed effects, our experimental approach enables precise reconstruction of elastic waveguide profiles in additively manufactured aluminum plates with such thickness variations.

Understanding the nature and origins of these discrete charge fluctuations may provide insights into material improvements or means of mitigating charge noise in semiconductor quantum dot devices. In this work, we measure multi-level charge fluctuations present in a Si/SiGe double quantum dot device over a range of device operating voltages and temperatures. To characterize the parameter-dependent dynamics of the underlying fluctuating degrees of freedom, we perform a detailed analysis of the measured noise timeseries. We perform algorithmically assisted drift detection and change point detection to detrend the data and remove a slow fluctuator component, as a preprocessing step. We perform model comparison on the post-processed time series between different $n$-level fluctuator ($n$LF) factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs), finding that although at most sweep values the independent pair of 2LFs model would be preferred, in a particular region of voltage space the 4LF model outperforms the other models, indicating a conditional rate dependence between the two fluctuators. By tracking fluctuator transition rates, biases, and weights over a range of different device configurations, we estimate gate voltage and conductivity sensitivity. In particular, we fit a phenomenological, detailed balance model to the extracted independent 2LFs rate data, yielding lever arm estimates in the range of $-2 \u03bc$eV/mV up to $4 \u03bc$eV/mV between the two 2LFs and nearby gate electrodes.

The model employs efficient inference using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model sampling and is pre-trained on GEANT4 simulations before being adapted to a new calorimeter geometry through Low-Rank Adaptation, requiring only a small post-training dataset. We evaluate physically meaningful observables, including total deposited energy, energy-weighted radius, and shower dispersion, obtaining relative root mean square error values below 2% for representative high-energy cases. This is in line with state-of-the-art calorimeter surrogates which report comparable fidelity on high-level observables.

The diffusion surrogate reproduces the qualitative structure and directional trends of the true utility landscape, providing usable sensitivities for gradient-based optimization.

In the \\textit{Defect Turbulence} regime, system dynamics are governed by topological phase singularities (spiral waves) whose motion couples to manifold curvature via geometric pinning. Conventional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) using ReLU or Tanh activations suffer from fundamental \\textit{spectral bias}, failing to resolve high-frequency gradients and causing amplitude collapse or phase drift. We propose a Multi-Scale SIREN-PINN architecture leveraging periodic sinusoidal activations with frequency-diverse initialization, embedding the appropriate inductive bias for wave-like physics directly into the network structure. This enables simultaneous resolution of macroscopic wave envelopes and microscopic defect cores. Validated on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation evolving on latent Riemannian manifolds, our architecture achieves relative state prediction error $\u03b5_{L_2} \\approx 1.92 \\times 10^{-2}$, outperforming standard baselines by an order of magnitude while preserving topological invariants ($|\u0394N_{defects}| < 1$). We solve the ill-posed \\textit{inverse pinning problem}, reconstructing hidden Gaussian curvature fields solely from partial observations of chaotic wave dynamics (Pearson correlation $\u03c1= 0.965$). Training dynamics reveal a distinctive Spectral Phase Transition at epoch $\\sim 2,100$, where cooperative minimization of physics and geometry losses drives the solver to Pareto-optimal solutions.

In particular, when monopole operators exhibit quasi-long-ranged order at the boundary, we find that the extraordinary-log exponent of the NCCP$^{N-1}$ model in the large-$N$ limit is $q=N/4$, signifying a new family of boundary universality classes parameterized by $N$.

As a result, depositing a chlorophyll layer on the diamond surface reduces the NV fluorescence lifetime from approximately 14 ns to below 4 ns, indicating efficient energy transfer. Laser-induced photobleaching of chlorophyll restores the unquenched NV lifetime. In contrast, NV centers located deeper within the diamond at depths of 40 nm and 72 nm remain unaffected, confirming that the observed quenching originates from a short-range FRET mechanism.

Such a magnetic structure is expected to exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and the nonlinear Hall effect from the symmetry breaking of the antiferromagnet ordering. Here, we theoretically investigate the intrinsic anomalous and nonlinear Hall effect of NbMnP induced by the quantum geometry of Bloch band using the first-principles calculation and the Wannier interpolation method. We found that the intrinsic Hall response of NbMnP is predominantly governed by the strongly enhanced Berry curvature and Berry-connection-polarization dipole on a specific mirror plane.

The two gauges are found to produce qualitatively different ionization dynamics, with LG having positive and VG having negative Wigner delays. The advancement of several femtoseconds, found for Wigner delays in VG, raises some concern for causality when atoms are ionized by attosecond pulses that are shorter than the absolute value of the Wigner delay. Reassuringly, numerical simulations of wave packets with RTDCIS show that the electrons behave in a causal way in both gauges. Weighted delays that take into account the temporal window of excitation (or the bandwidth of the pulses) are constructed from the Wigner distribution to reach agreement between the numerical simulations and our simple wave packet model.

These hierarchical mergers carry distinct spin and tilt features relative to first-generation black holes, for which previous studies have found evidence at a population level by interpreting features in the effective inspiral spin domain. We introduce an astrophysically-motivated model in the joint space of effective inspiral and precessing spins, which captures the dominant spin dynamics expected for hierarchical mergers. We find decisive evidence both for a population transition above $\\sim 45M_\\odot$, consistent with the anticipated onset of the pair-instability gap, as well as a peak at $\\sim 15 M_\\odot$, which we interpret as the global peak in the hierarchical merger rate. The existence of low- and high-mass subpopulations of higher-generation black holes suggests the contribution of both near-solar-metallicity and metal-poor star clusters to the hierarchical merger population.

While quantum error correction codes like the Steane $[\\![7,1,3]\\!]$ code provide elegant theoretical solutions, their practical success hinges critically on how we measure errors - a process called syndrome extraction. The challenge lies in the ancilla qubits used for measurement: when they fail, errors can cascade across the entire quantum system, destroying the very information we're trying to protect. We address this fundamental problem by implementing and comparing three sophisticated syndrome measurement strategies: Shor's cat-state approach, which distributes measurements across multiple entangled ancillas achieving 85-92% preparation success; Steane's encoded-ancilla method using complete error-corrected logical qubits reaching 97.8% syndrome fidelity; and a flexible unified framework that adapts strategies based on hardware capabilities. Through extensive simulations using IBM's Qiskit platform spanning randomized benchmarking and T-heavy circuits, we demonstrate that intelligent ancilla management improves error suppression by up to 2.4$\\times$ compared to standard approaches. Our implementations achieve logical error rates as low as $5.1 \\times 10^{-5}$ under realistic noise conditions with physical error rates of $10^{-3}$, while maintaining near-unity logical fidelity (0.99997) even for deep circuits.

This paper reports the optical design and optimization of this spectrometer, aiming for an ultrahigh energy resolution of <10 meV in the soft X-ray range. Conventional RIXS spectrometers using monochromatic incident X-rays suffer from a severe trade-off between energy resolution and measurement efficiency, which makes achieving resolutions of <10 meV practically unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we adopted the $h\u03bd^2$ concept using dispersive incident X-rays, based on a comparative study. This approach decouples the energy resolution from the incident bandwidth. We estimate that our 2D-RIXS spectrometer improves efficiency by more than a factor of 10 compared to conventional spectrometers.

By engineering slot couplers with an effectivemedium channel for impedance and modal matching, the waveguide achieves a fractional 3-dB bandwidth of 40% with a maximum coupling efficiency of 90% in the WR-2.2 band (330-500 GHz). By employing a broadband uni-traveling-carrier photodiode transmitter and sub-harmonic mixer receivers, we achieve an aggregated data rate of 0.8 Tbit/s with quadrature amplitude modulation schemes across 14 channels from 330-600 GHz. The effective-medium-slot waveguide platform yields robust broadband coupling with enhanced mechanical protection, offering reliable interconnects for ultra-high-speed terahertz integrated systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u57fa\u5e95\u7684TeSPas\u6709\u6548\u6027\u63d2\u7535\u5c42\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u5728WR-2.2\u9891\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6781\u5bbd\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8026\u5408\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": " terahertz\u901a\u4fe1\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u4f4e\u635f\u8017\u3001\u4f4e\u8272\u6563\u548c\u5bbd\u9891\u6bb5\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\u7ed3\u6784\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": " \u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6548\u5e94\u4ecb\u7535\u5c42\u901a\u9053\u5b9e\u73b0\u963b\u6297\u5339\u914d\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u91d1\u5c5e\u7a7a\u5fc3\u6ce2\u5bfc\u548c\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u8fc7\u6e21\u754c\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f4\u63a5\u8026\u5408\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u901a\u9053\u5149\u8c03\u5236\u5668\u548c\u8f7d\u6ce2\u578b\u4e09\u6781\u7ba1\u6536\u4fe1\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "result": "\u5728330-500 GHz\u9891\u6bb5\uff0c\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5b9e\u73b040%\u76843dB\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u8026\u5408\u6548\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe90%\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u77e2\u91cf\u8c03\u5236\u5b9e\u73b014\u4e2a\u4fe1\u9053\u5728330-600 GHz\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u7387\u8fbe\u52300.8 Tbit/s\u3002\u5728\u8d85\u9ad8\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5bbd\u9891\u6bb5\u8026\u5408\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u9632\u62a4\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9ad8\u96c6\u6210\u5ea6\u7684Terahertz\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

Their three-dimensional (3D) helical architecture and tunable inter-strand coupling enable control of spin chirality, including the stabilization of topological 3D magnetic states such as helical domains and domain walls, topological stray fields, and extended helical vortex/skyrmion tubes. So far, the study of these and other 3D nanostructures is usually confined to a limited number of magnetic microscopy experiments in large facilities. Here, we investigate the reversal mechanism of a single DH nanowire using Dark-Field magneto-optical Kerr effect (DF-MOKE) magnetometry under external 3D magnetic fields. By analyzing the angular dependence of the DF-MOKE signal, we fit the reversal process using established models for domain-wall nucleation and propagation, finding a characteristic behavior similar to that reported for cylindrical nanowires. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the reversal process goes through nucleation of the helical vortex tube in a curling manner while ptychographic X-ray magnetic circular dichroism data reveal that this helical vortex tube state forms through a mixed nucleation-propagation process. These observations provide a consistent microscopic picture of reversal mediated by a helical vortex tube extending along the nanowire. Our work provides a comprehensive characterization of magnetization reversal in DH nanowires and demonstrates that DF-MOKE magnetometry is effective for probing reversal mechanisms in single 3D nanostructures. This lab-based approach expands the range of accessible experiments beyond large-scale facilities, enabling extensive exploration of the rich spin states supported by 3D nano-geometries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc\u94fe\u87ba\u65cb\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\uff08DH\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\uff09\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u53cd\u8f6c\uff0c\u5229\u7528 dark-field \u9ad8 resolved \u78c1\u4ecb\u7535\u6548\u5e94\uff08DF-MOKE\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0 DH \u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u53cd\u8f6c\u7531\u626d\u7ed3\u73af\u91cf\u5b50\u7ba1\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5706\u67f1\u5f62\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u78c1\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5355\u6839 DH \u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5927\u578b\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd lab-based \u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7 DF-MOKE \u78c1\u6548\u5e94\u6d4b\u91cf DH \u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u53cd\u8f6c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u53f7\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c micromagnetic \u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u78c1\u6027\u53cd\u8f6c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7531\u73af\u91cf\u5b50\u7ba1\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5706\u67f1\u5f62\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u73af\u91cf\u5b50\u7ba1\u4ee5\u87ba\u65cb\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u90e8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "DH \u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u53cd\u8f6c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u73af\u91cf\u5b50\u7ba1\u7684\u6269\u5f20\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u7ef4\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u78c1\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u89d2\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The interface is realized by introducing inclined vacuum slits along the lateral sides of the plate. This geometry intentionally breaks symmetry and produces a strongly localized, vortex-like deformation near the slit tips, which provides an efficient coupling pathway from the antisymmetric incident response to a symmetric reflected component. The conversion is quantified in a consistent, field-based manner by extracting the reflected antisymmetric level from the standing-wave envelope on a probe line placed sufficiently far from the slits, and then inferring the converted symmetric energy under a lossless assumption with only two reflected propagating channels.

By revealing a magic wavelength at $905.4(2)$ nm, we successfully achieve the atomic spectrum narrower than $100$ Hz. The interleaved clock operation between isotopes allows us to determine isotope shifts of four bosonic isotope pairs at Hz-level uncertainties, which is combined with those of other four ultra-narrow transitions in $\\mathrm{Yb}$ and $\\mathrm{Yb}^+$ to construct the King plot. Importantly, the new isotope shift data reported in this work is a key to exclude the possibility of attributing the observed nonlinearity of the three-dimensional King plot solely to the new physics, while the previous works rely on the other terrestrial bound set by the neutron scattering and $(g-2)_e$ measurements.

The negative curvature is found mostly but not exclusively at the highest densities and pressures, and predominantly for stiff EOSs and for the most compact and most massive stars. Furthermore, we improve the quasi-universal relation between the stellar gravitational mass $M$ and the baryonic mass $M_\\mathrm{b}$, which allows us to express analytically one in terms of the other with a maximum variance of only $\\sim 3\\%$.

The nearly isotropic magnets enable low-current dynamical stabilisation of the magnetisation in the direction opposite to an applied magnetic field, thereby realising a spintronic analogue of the Kapitza pendulum. In an intermediate current regime, the STT drives large magnetisation vector fluctuations that cover the entire Bloch sphere.

This issue is particularly pressing for tackling fraud in the red wine industry, valued at billions of dollars globally, where product authenticity, brand reputation, and consumer trust are paramount. Whilst many techniques exist for authenticating wine externally, to date performing accurate classification of the contents within unopened bottles remains elusive. Using only a single near-infrared optical excitation source operating at a wavelength of 785 nm, in combination with a bespoke geometry to circumvent the confounding signal of the glass, we demonstrate that through-bottle fluorescence spectra can distinguish between twenty different red wines in their original, intact bottles. All twenty wine bottles were correctly classified with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed strong varietal grouping. This non-invasive and rapid technique has the potential to enable on-site, routine wine authentication to combat the growing issue of wine fraud.

Despite recent research efforts, existing QFL frameworks struggle to achieve optimal model training performance primarily due to inherent heterogeneity in terms of (i) quantum noise where current quantum devices are subject to varying levels of noise due to varying device quality and susceptibility to quantum decoherence, and (ii) heterogeneous data distributions where data across participating quantum devices are naturally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). To address these challenges, we propose a novel integrated sporadic-personalized approach called SPQFL that simultaneously handles quantum noise and data heterogeneity in a single QFL framework. It is featured in two key aspects: (i) for quantum noise heterogeneity, we introduce a notion of sporadic learning to tackle quantum noise heterogeneity across quantum devices, and (ii) for quantum data heterogeneity, we implement personalized learning through model regularization to mitigate overfitting during local training on non-IID quantum data distributions, thereby enhancing the convergence of the global model. Moreover, we conduct a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed SPQFL framework, with both sporadic and personalized learning considerations. Theoretical findings reveal that the upper bound of the SPQFL algorithm is strongly influenced by both the number of quantum devices and the number of quantum noise measurements. Extensive simulation results in real-world datasets also illustrate that the proposed SPQFL approach yields significant improvements in terms of training performance and convergence stability compared to the state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This yields a dramatic speedup in dilute regimes ($N_e \\ll N$), opening unbiased access to large-scale simulations of strongly correlated low-density phases. We validate the method on the dilute electron gas with onsite Hubbard interactions, observing the suppression of the fermion sign problem in the dilute limit. Furthermore, we apply this approach to an one-dimensional flat-band system, where the canonical ensemble allows for precise control over filling.

Extending our previous work, where multistate SFDM solutions were shown to form ``gravitational atoms'' capable of explaining the anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies (VPOS), we analyze here the coupled dynamics of the scalar and a gauge field at the perturbative level. By solving the perturbed Klein-Gordon and gauge-field equations, we find the temporal evolution and show that the spatial structure of the induced electromagnetic fields is governed by the same spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics that characterize the ground and excited states of the multi-state SFDM halo. Remarkably, the presence of the gauge field does not modify the dark-matter density distribution, which preserves the multi-state configuration previously obtained. Our results demonstrate that a charged multi-state SFDM halo can generate coherent, large-scale magnetic fields whose morphology is determined by the excited modes of the scalar field, providing a unified framework in which both galactic magnetic fields and VPOS-like structures originate from the underlying quantum nature of dark matter.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The minuteness of $\u03b1_S$ relative to $\u03b1$ ($\u03b1_S/\u03b1\\sim 10^{-21}$) effectively hides the effects in usual quantum experiments. In an Aharonov-Bohm double-slit experiment, the theory predicts that the position probability density depends on which slit the particle trajectory crosses, due to a non-integrable scale induced by the magnetic flux. This experimental prediction can be realistically tested for an electrically neutral, heavy molecule with mass $m \\sim 10^{-19} \\text{g}$ at a $\\sim 10^6 \\text{ esu}$ flux regime. We analyse the Weyl-Einstein debate on the second-clock effect using the theory and show that spectral frequencies are history-independent. We thereby resolve Einstein's key objection against local scale invariance, and obtain two further experimental predictions. First, spectral intensities turn out to be history-dependent. Second, energy eigenvalues are modified by tiny imaginary corrections that modify spectral linewidths. We argue that the trajectory dependence of the probabilities renders our theory empirically distinguishable from other quantum formulations that do not use pilot-wave trajectories, or their mathematical equivalents, to derive experimental predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Yet, direct observation of rotational dynamics at the single-molecule level in liquids remains challenging due to the trade-off between optical detectability and hydrodynamic responsiveness. Labels that are bright enough for rapid readout typically introduce excessive drag, while minimally perturbing probes are difficult to detect at high speed. This limits access to fast rotational dynamics required for direct torque measurements. Here, we introduce cylindrical-polarization-based interferometric scattering microscopy (cypiSCAT), a method encoding the orientation of anisotropic scatterers directly into a single interferometric point spread function, while intrinsically suppressing the isotropic background. We achieve rotational tracking of low-drag orientation labels based on DNA origami-attached gold nanorods with sub-degree angular precision and microsecond temporal resolution, allowing quantitative characterization of nanoscale rotational dynamics. This capability provides direct access to torque metrology at the single-molecule level, here demonstrated through the extraction of optically induced torques as small as ~1 pN nm.

Focusing on the ultraviolet regime, where higher-order spatial curvature terms dominate, we derive analytical solutions in this UV limit for both the original Horava-Lifshitz action and its analytically continued counterpart. We study their behavior near the event horizon and the classical singularity, with particular attention to the interpretation of the wave function in terms of the annihilation-to-nothing scenario proposed in general relativity. In this paper, we have considered cases in which the two-dimensional spatial section is spherical, planar, or hyperbolic, as well as models with positive, negative, or vanishing cosmological constant. In all cases, we find that the terms dominating in the ultraviolet regime, together with the effects of the running scaling parameter, act to suppress the annihilation-to-nothing behavior. These results suggest that, at least within the range explored in this study, the characteristic annihilation-to-nothing behavior does not appear in the ultraviolet regime of Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and provide a new perspective on the understanding of singularity resolution in quantum gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we show that with a new homodyne detection technique, we can apparently circumvent this symmetry-imposed constraint and observe robust SHG in pristine centrosymmetric crystals, without any symmetry-breaking field.

Ultrafast quantum optics seeks to generate, shape, and measure quantum states of light on femtosecond and attosecond timescales. Here we introduce a quantum light field squeezer (QLFS) that enables the generation and attosecond control of ultrafast broadband squeezed light. Using degenerate four-wave mixing in a quasi-collinear focusing geometry, our approach overcomes conventional broadband phase-matching limits, producing intensity- and phase-squeezed states directly from few-cycle laser pulses. Our ultrafast quantum optical metrology reveals a time-dependent squeezing distribution across individual half-cycles of the electric field. Incorporating this time-dependent squeezing into strong-field simulations shows that the temporal redistribution of quantum uncertainty reshapes the high-harmonic emission. Moreover, by tuning the relative pulse delay and phase-matching angle, we achieve attosecond precision in controlling the squeezing characteristics by visualizing inferred effective Wigner representations of the quantum light field. Beyond characterization, we demonstrate that the quantum light-induced tunneling-current noise is sensitive to the nonclassical intensity-noise statistics of the driving squeezed light, with sub-femtosecond control. Together, these results extend the generation, control, and effective phase-space representation of squeezed light into the ultrafast and attosecond regime, opening new avenues for quantum optics in strong-field and solid-state systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Originally proposed to bypass the limitations imposed by von Neumann's theorem on the impossibility of hidden-variable models in quantum mechanics, it faced strong opposition from the outset. Over time, however, its use in tackling specific problems across various branches of physics has led to a gradual shift in attitude, turning the early resistance into a more moderate acceptance. A plausible explanation for this change may be that, since the late 1990s and early 2000s, Bohmian mechanics has been taking on a more operational and practical role. The original hidden-variable idea has gradually faded from its framework, giving way to a more pragmatic approach that treats it as a suitable analytical and computational tool. This discussion explores how and why such a shift in perspective has occurred and, therefore, answers questions such as whether Bohmian mechanics should be considered once and for all a legitimate quantum representation (i.e., worth being taught in elementary quantum mechanics courses) or, by extension, whether these ideas can be transferred to and benefit other fields.

Tsuchiya"], "title": "On theta function expressions of cyclic products of fermion correlation functions in genus two", "comment": null, "summary": "In arXiv:2211.09069, significant progress was made in decomposing simple products of fermion correlation functions, and in summing over spin structures of superstring amplitudes in genus two under cyclic constraints. In this manuscript we consider part of the same subject using a framework in which one of the branch points of the genus two curve is fixed at infinity. This framework is a direct generalization of the popular one in the case of genus one. We address some of the issues that remained unresolved in our previous paper arXiv:2209.14633. We show that the spin structures of the simple products of fermion correlation functions with cyclic conditions depend only on the Pe-function values at the half-periods of the genus two surface, for any number of factors in the products. Similar to the genus one case, we can provide basis functions to decompose the product. Consequently, the trilinear relations found in arXiv:2211.09069 can be derived from the known set of differential equations of genus two Pe-functions by simply setting the variables equal to the half-periods of the non-singular and even spin structures, as is the case for genus one. The focus of this manuscript is on the procedures for expressing the results of decomposed formulae in terms of the unique genus two theta function. At present we cannot provide a procedure for deriving the general form of the decomposed formula totally expressed in terms of the theta functions for an arbitrary number of the fermion correlation functions in the product, by the reason described in the text. We present some general results and demonstrate that concrete expressions of both the spin structure dependent and independent parts will be derived and simplified to analyze using the logic of the derivations of the classical solutions to Jacobi inversion problem and their modifications which will be given in this manuscript.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e86\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u6b67\u70b9\u5728\u65e0\u7a77\u8fdc\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5206\u6b67\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8d85\u5f26\u632f\u5e45\u7684\u603b\u548c\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u66f2\u9762\u4e8c\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u524d\u4e00\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u672a\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u6b67\u70b9\u540e\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u5bf9\u5076\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d85\u5f26\u632f\u578b\u548c\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e00\u7bc7\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u5df2\u77e5\u7684P\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u7f6e\u53d8\u91cf\u4e3a\u534a\u5468\u671f\u503c\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u89e3\u540e\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eP\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u534a\u5468\u671f\u5904\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u4e4b\u524d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e09\u89d2\u5173\u7cfb\u53ef\u4ee5\u4eceP\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6765\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u65af\u66f2\u9762\u4e0b\u7684\u632f\u578b\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u56e0\u7d20\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Here we show that this assumption can be violated on contemporary hardware, with direct implications for the interpretation of observed Bell violations. We introduce an ensemble-divergence framework in which slow temporal drift of the preparation process induces context-dependent effective ensembles, even when measurement independence and locality are preserved. This leads to a relaxed Bell bound $|S| \\le 2 + 6\u03b4_{\\mathrm{ens}}$, where $\u03b4_{\\mathrm{ens}}$ quantifies preparation nonstationarity. Because $\u03b4_{\\mathrm{ens}}$ is not directly observable, we develop an operational witness $\u03b4_{\\mathrm{op}}$ based on bin-resolved outcome statistics for fixed measurement channels. Using Pauli-axis measurements on IBM superconducting processors, we observe statistically significant operational drift that persists after full two-qubit readout mitigation, ruling out measurement artifacts. In contrast, drift extracted from CHSH-optimal measurements is eliminated by mitigation, demonstrating that such settings are unsuitable for diagnosing preparation nonstationarity. We further show that the observed Bell violations imply only modest ensemble divergences, comparable in scale to those required in Hall-type measurement-dependence models, but arising here solely from preparation drift combined with experimental scheduling.

Furthermore, we comment on the presence of vanishing as well as negative eigenvalues and show how the Green's function method provides a natural prescription for handling them.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020contour\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fd\u6570\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982Gel'fand-Yaglom\u5b9a\u7406\u548cGreen\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u7b49\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u7ef4\u7b97\u7b26\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u7684\u6bd4\u503c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6587\u4e2d\u8fd8\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5f53\u7b97\u7b26\u6709\u6d88\u5931\u6216\u8d1f\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u503c\u65f6\uff0cGreen\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u978d\u70b9\u5c55\u5f00\u7b49\u8bb8\u591a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u90fd\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u6587\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u7814\u7a76\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6784\u9020contour\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fd\u6570\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6587\u4e2d\u5f15\u7528\u4e86Gel'fand-Yaglom\u5b9a\u7406\u548cGreen\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020contour\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u6bd4\u503c\u65f6\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u548c\u6280\u672f\u4e0a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u65f6\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u7ef4\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0cGel'fand-Yaglom\u5b9a\u7406\u548cGreen\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6587\u4e2d\u660e\u786e\u6307\u51faGreen\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6709\u6d88\u5931\u6216\u8d1f\u672c\u5f81\u503c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u540e\uff0c\u8be5\u6587\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u7ef4\u7b97\u7b26\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0cGel'fand-Yaglom\u5b9a\u7406\u548cGreen\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cGreen\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5e26\u6709\u6d88\u5931\u6216\u8d1f\u672c\u5f81\u503c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We employed the finite element method-based COMSOL simulation and Jones-Mueller formalisms to probe the variations in optical parameters by systematically varying the angle of incidence and azimuthal angle of the incident plane wave source, thereby quantifying the variations in the polarization anisotropy parameters. The enhancement of optical properties at various resonances and the tunability of the hybridized modes are discussed. Importantly, our study reveals that despite the system being perfectly inversion-symmetric and achiral, it exhibits circular polarization anisotropy effects for non-zero finite azimuthal angles, manifested in the off-block-diagonal elements of the constructed Mueller matrices. The origin of this intriguing circular anisotropy effect is unravelled using the sequential linear birefringence and linear diattenuation effects arising from geometrical polarization transformation. Its implications in the spin-orbit interaction of light in the plasmonic crystal system are discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6ce2\u5bfc\u578b\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u6676\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6781\u5316\u5149\u7167\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u5149\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6cd5\u548cCOMSOL\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u5408\u743c\u65af- misuse formalisms\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u5165\u5c04\u89d2\u548c\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5149\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u5b8c\u7f8e\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4f46ount \u5728\u975e\u96f6\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u65f6\u5374\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5706\u6781\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e5f\u88ab\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u7ebf\u6027\u53cc\u8f74\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5149\u7684\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u6ce2\u5bfc\u578b\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u6676\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u7167\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u7684\u5149\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u6781\u5316\u7279\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6cd5\u548cCOMSOL\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u5408\u743c\u65af-Mueller formalisms\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u5165\u5c04\u89d2\u548c\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5149\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u5206\u89e3\u5176\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u5b8c\u7f8e\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5706\u6781\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u5176\u8d77\u6e90\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u6781\u5316\u53d8\u6362\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u7ebf\u6027\u53cc\u8f74\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u4e0d\u540c\u6781\u5316\u5149\u7167\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u63a7\u6ce2\u5bfc\u578b\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u5149\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4f7f\u5f97\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5706\u6781\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u5149\u7684\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Motivated by the need for more realistic analytical black hole models, our construction incorporates two key ingredients often neglected in exact solutions: a fully dynamical cosmological background and the non-perturbative backreaction of external electromagnetic fields. The compact object is obtained by dressing a Schwarzschild black hole with a radially and temporally dependent scalar field, yielding a time-dependent generalization of the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution within the Fonarev framework. The external electromagnetic field is generated via a Lie point symmetry of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell system, which exports the effect of a Harrison transformation to dynamical settings provided a spacelike Killing vector is present. The resulting spacetime combines a spherically symmetric dynamical horizon with an axisymmetric electromagnetic field and exhibits a rich asymptotic structure mixing Friedmann-Lema\u00eetre-Robertson-Walker and Levi-Civita geometries.

In practice, however, numerical instability and memory cost limit the number of coefficients that can be computed exactly. In response to these challenges, the standard approach relies on fitting early coefficients to asymptotic forms, but such procedures can miss subleading, history-dependent structures in the coefficients that subsequently affect reconstructed observables. In this work, we treat the Lanczos coefficients as a causal time sequence and introduce a transformer-based model to autoregressively predict future Lanczos coefficients from short prefixes. For both classical and quantum systems, our machine-learning model outperforms asymptotic fits, in both coefficient extrapolation and physical observable reconstruction, by achieving an order-of-magnitude reduction in error. Our model also transfers across system sizes: it can be trained on smaller systems and then be used to extrapolate coefficients on a larger system without retraining. By probing the learned attention patterns and performing targeted attention ablations, we identify which portions of the coefficient history are most influential for accurate forecasts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4bLanczos\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Lanczos\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4bLanczos\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5386\u53f2\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u6765\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4bLanczos\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u91cd\u6784\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6e10\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

This makes them prospective for next-generation optoelectronic and quantum devices. However, despite the intense research activity, the reported values for exciton binding energies, quasiparticle gaps, and spectral features exhibit substantial variation across both experimental and theoretical studies. In this article, we present a comprehensive and critical assessment of the current understanding of excitonic properties in single-layer TMDs, integrating results from the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), photoluminescence (PL) measurements, and other experimental techniques with first-principles theoretical insights. Special emphasis is placed on the comparison and reconciliation of discrepancies observed across different experimental setups and sample qualities. Furthermore, we highlight our state-of-the-art GW-BSE calculations, which include both equilibrium and laterally strained systems, to systematically analyse the behaviour of direct and indirect excitons. By evaluating the effect of strain as a tunable control variable, we demonstrate its potential to engineer excitonic properties, supported by cross-validation against prior theoretical predictions and experimental findings.

It takes on an essential role across a vast array of applications and the quest for enhanced theorem-proving capabilities remains a prominent pursuit in artificial intelligence. Here, we propose a generic framework for quantum automated theorem proving, where the intrinsic quantum superposition and entanglement features would lead to potential advantages. In particular, we introduce quantum representations of knowledge bases and propose corresponding reasoning algorithms for a variety of tasks. We show how automated reasoning can be achieved with quantum resolution in both propositional and first-order logic with quadratically reduced query complexity.

The mirror consists of a high-contrast, near-subwavelength, one-dimensional dielectric grating on a Bragg mirror. We optimized this structure using a genetic algorithm and demonstrated its robustness against geometric imperfections and oblique incidence. Experimental reflection spectra measured under normal incidence in a circular polarization basis demonstrate a more than 100-nm-wide reflection band in which more than 98% of the reflected light preserves its handedness. The total reflection coefficient reached 80%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the fabricated mirror maintains high performance even under oblique incidence for angles up to $\\pm 15^\\circ$.

Attosecond qubits can be prepared, coherently manipulated, and read out using existing attosecond techniques, providing a compact Hilbert-space description of strong-field dynamics beyond semiclassical trajectory pictures. A density-matrix formulation makes explicit the roles of coherence, dephasing, and decoherence, arising from continuum propagation, Coulomb interaction, infrared dressing, and macroscopic averaging, within a reduced description that remains far from thermalization.

Using the Metric-Noise-Resource methodology, we establish a quantitative connection between experimental control parameters, dominant noise processes, and energetic resources through a performance metric tailored to Boson Sampling. We estimate the energy cost per sample and identify operating regimes that optimize energetic efficiency. By comparing the energy consumption of quantum and state-of-the-art classical implementations, we demonstrate the existence of a quantum energetic advantage -- defined as a lower energy cost per sample compared to the best-known classical implementation -- that emerges before the onset of computational advantage, even in regimes where classical algorithms remain faster.

To be submitted to Physical Review Research Journal", "summary": "Feedback-based quantum algorithms (FQAs) operate by iteratively growing a quantum circuit to optimize a given task. At each step, feedback from qubit measurements is used to inform the next quantum circuit update. In practice, the sampling cost associated with these measurements can be significant. Here, we ask whether FQA parameter sequences can be predicted using classical machine learning, obviating the need for qubit measurements altogether. To this end, we train a teacher-student model to map a MaxCut problem instance to an associated FQA parameter curve in a single classical inference step. Numerical experiments show that this model can accurately predict FQA parameter curves across a range of problem sizes, including problem sizes not seen during model training.

This take the reference frame calibration between communicating parties as a necessary prerequisite. However, in mobile communications scenarios, achieving continuous and accurate reference frame calibration poses significant challenges. To address this issue, this paper proposes a reference-frame-independent (RFI) QSDC protocol. This protocol only requires ensuring the calibration accuracy of one direction of the reference frame, while allowing a misalignment angle $\u03b2$ in the other two directions. To improve the protocol's robustness against reference frame fluctuations, we introduce a $\u03b2$-independent parameter C into the security analysis framework and rederive the protocol's security bounds. Additionally, we construct a system model and optimize the pulse intensity of the signal states, enabling the protocol to achieve optimal performance under each level of channel attenuation. At an attenuation of 10 dB (corresponding to a communication distance of 25 km), the secrecy message capacities for $\u03b2= 0^{ \\circ} $ and $45^{ \\circ} $ are $8.765 \\times10^{-6}$ bit/pulse and $4.150 \\times10^{-6}$ bit/pulse, respectively. Compared with the single-photon-based QSDC, the communication distance of the protocol proposed in this paper is significantly extended.

A unitless quantity has been defined, corresponding to the photon-pairs flux per frequency unit: it has been found equal to 0.369 at this limit. The ratio between the magnitudes of the electric fields of the generated photons and of vacuum has been also calculated, equal to 1.718, and the pump intensity has been plotted as a function of the interaction length for different values of the second-order electric susceptibility in the case of SPDC and of the third-order electric susceptibility for FWM. These quantitative results confirm that below the limit, the nonlinear process can be truly considered as spontaneous, i.e. mainly seeded by the quantum fluctuations of vacuum, while the generated photons mainly govern the pump photon splitting above the limit, which corresponds more to an optical parametric amplification / difference frequency generation regime.

This paper presents a methodological analysis of empirical studies in QST through a systematic examination of 59 primary studies identified from a literature pool of size 384. We organize our analysis around ten research questions that cover key methodological dimensions of QST empirical studies, including objects under test, baseline comparison, testing setup, experimental configuration, and tool and artifact support. Through cross-study analysis along these dimensions, we characterize current empirical practices in QST, identify recurring limitations and inconsistencies, and highlight open methodological challenges.

Designing and verifying such architectures requires a unified formalism that integrates linear algebraic reasoning with probabilistic and control-flow structures. In this work, we introduce a graphical framework for distributed quantum computing that brings together linear optics, the ZX-calculus, and dataflow programming. Our language supports the formal analysis and optimization of distributed protocols involving both qubits and photonic modes, with explicit interfaces for classical control and feedforward, all expressed within a synchronous dataflow model with discrete-time dynamics.

This approach increases resource utilization and mitigates initialization latency while maintaining result fidelity. Currently, state-of-the-art compilers for neutral atom architectures do not support multi-programming.\n  To fill this gap, we introduce MultiQ, the first system designed for this purpose.

Our approach employs a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) as well as generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP and GQSVT) to implement projectors. These projectors can then be coherently applied as state filters prior to quantum phase estimation (QPE). We analyze their asymptotic gate complexities for explicit circuit realizations. For the particle number and $S_z$ symmetries, GQSP offers favorable resource usage features owing to its low ancilla qubit requirements and robustness to finite precision rotation gate synthesis. For the total spin projection, the structured decomposition of $\\hat{P}_{S,M_S}$ reduces the projector T gate count. Numerical simulations show that symmetry filtering substantially increases the QPE success probability, leading to a lower overall cost compared to that of unfiltered approaches across representative molecular systems. Resource estimates further indicate that the cost of symmetry filtering is $3$ to $4$ orders of magnitude lower than that of the subsequent phase estimation step This advantage is especially relevant in large, strongly correlated systems, such as FeMoco, a standard strongly correlated open-shell benchmark. For FeMoco, the QPE cost is estimated at ${\\sim}10^{10}$ T gates, while our symmetry projector requires only ${\\sim}10^{6}$--$10^{7}$ T gates.

We provide a concise summary of relevant hardware roadmaps, distinguishing superconducting and ion-trap technologies, their current states, modalities, and projected scaling trajectories. The core of the presented work are the use case evaluations in the domains of optimization problems and machine learning applications. For the conducted experiments, we apply a consistent set of evaluation criteria (model formulation, scalability, solution quality, runtime, and transferability) which are assessed in a shared system of three categories, ranging from optimistic (solutions produced by quantum computers are competitive with classical methods and/or a clear path to a quantum advantage is shown) to pessimistic (significant hurdles prevent practical application of quantum solutions now and potentially in the future).

In this work, we address quantification of superposition from an information-theoretic perspective. We introduce a family of quantifiers of superposition, the phase-sensitive superposition, by taking into account the phases of amplitudes in the superposition of a fixed basis states (e.g., computational basis states). We establish a conservation relation for the phase-sensitive superposition, which is a kind of complementary relation and is reminiscent of wave-particle duality. We evaluate explicitly the second moment of phase-sensitive superposition and show that it is intrinsically related to the $l^2$-norm coherence. We characterize the dephasing channel induced by the maximally superposed states.

For this optimal protocol, we provide a complete, dimension-dependent classification of deterministic entanglement-swapping measurements: unique in dimensions $d=2,3$, infinite for $d=4$, and comprising $72$ inequivalent classes for $d=5$. We further consider a general network with multiple swapping nodes and show that, for $d=2,3$ the resulting end-to-end state is independent of the order in which the repeaters perform the optimal measurements.

The QFI serves as an upper bound on the classical Fisher information (CFI), representing the maximum extractable information about the unknown parameter from measurements on a physical system. Thus, a central goal in quantum parameter estimation is to find a measurement, described by a POVM, that saturates the QFI (achieves maximum CFI), and thereby achieves the QCRB. In the idealization that one uses pure states and unitary encodings for sensing, discontinuities can appear in the CFI but not the QFI.

In this study, we propose a QA-in-the-loop kernel learning framework that integrates QA not merely as a substitute for Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling but as a component that directly determines the learned kernel for regression. Based on Bochner's theorem, a shift-invariant kernel is represented as an expectation over a spectral distribution, and random Fourier features (RFF) approximate the kernel by sampling frequencies. We model the spectral distribution with a (multi-layer) restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), generate discrete RBM samples using QA, and map them to continuous frequencies via a Gaussian--Bernoulli transformation. Using the resulting RFF, we construct a data-adaptive kernel and perform Nadaraya--Watson (NW) regression. Because the RFF approximation based on $\\cos(\\bm\u03c9^{\\top}\u0394\\bm{x})$ can yield small negative values and cancellation across neighbors, the Nadaraya--Watson denominator $\\sum_j k_{ij}$ may become close to zero. We therefore employ nonnegative squared-kernel weights $w_{ij}=k(\\bm{x}_i,\\bm{x}_j)^2$, which also enhances the contrast of kernel weights. The kernel parameters are trained by minimizing the leave-one-out NW mean squared error, and we additionally evaluate local linear regression with the same squared-kernel weights at inference. Experiments on multiple benchmark regression datasets demonstrate a decrease in training loss, accompanied by structural changes in the kernel matrix, and show that the learned kernel tends to improve $R^2$ and RMSE over the baseline Gaussian-kernel NW. Increasing the number of random features at inference further enhances accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We introduce the Noisy-device-enhanced Classical Simulation (NDE-CS) protocol, which improves stabilizer-based classical Monte Carlo simulation methods by incorporating data obtained from noisy quantum hardware. Specifically, NDE-CS uses noisy executions of a target circuit together with noisy Clifford circuits to learn how the target circuit can be expressed in terms of Clifford circuits under realistic noise. The same learned relation can then be reused in the noiseless Clifford limit, enabling accurate estimation of ideal expectation values with substantially reduced sampling cost. Numerical simulations on Trotterized Ising circuits demonstrate that NDE-CS achieves orders-of-magnitude reductions in sampling cost compared to the underlying purely classical Monte Carlo approaches from which it is derived, while maintaining the same accuracy. We also compare NDE-CS with Sparse Pauli Dynamics (SPD), a powerful classical framework capable of simulating quantum circuits at previously inaccessible scales, and provide an example where the cost of SPD scales exponentially with system size, while NDE-CS scales much more favorably.

They are basic elements for quantum commmunication, computation, and error correction. In particular, when performed on logical qubits encoded in physical photonic qubits, they allow for a read-out of stabilizer syndrome information to enhance loss tolerance in qubit-state transmission and fusion. However, even in an ideal setting without photon loss, BMs cannot be done perfectly based on the simplest experimental toolbox of linear optics. Here we demonstrate that any logical BM on stabilizer codes can always be mapped onto a single physical BM perfomed on any qubit pair from the two codes. As a necessary condition for the success of a logical BM, this provides a general upper bound on its success probability, especially ruling out the possibility that the stabilizer information obtainable from only partially succeeding, physical linear-optics BMs could be combined into the full logical stabilizer information. We formulate sufficient criteria to find schemes for which a single successful BM on the physical level will always allow to obtain the full logical information by suitably adapting the subsequent physical measurements. Our approach based on stabilizer group theory is generally applicable to any stabilizer code, which we demonstrate for quantum parity, five-qubit, standard and rotated planar surface, tree, and seven-qubit Steane codes. Our schemes attain the general upper bound for all these codes, while this bound had previously only been reached for the quantum parity code.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

It is well known that, in this classical setting, increasing the girth of the Tanner graph while maintaining regular degree distributions leads simultaneously to good belief-propagation (BP) decoding performance and large minimum distance. In the quantum setting, however, this principle does not directly apply because quantum LDPC codes must satisfy additional orthogonality constraints between their parity-check matrices. When one enforces both orthogonality and regularity in a straightforward manner, the girth is typically reduced and the minimum distance becomes structurally upper bounded.\n  In this work, we overcome this limitation by using permutation matrices with controlled commutativity and by restricting the orthogonality constraints to only the necessary parts of the construction, while preserving regular check-matrix structures. This design breaks the conventional trade-off between orthogonality, regularity, girth, and minimum distance, allowing us to construct quantum LDPC codes with large girth and without the usual distance upper bounds. As a concrete demonstration, we construct a girth-8, (3,12)-regular $[[9216,4612, \\leq 48]]$ quantum LDPC code and show that, under BP decoding combined with a low-complexity post-processing algorithm, it achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-8}$ on the depolarizing channel with error probability $4 \\%$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
