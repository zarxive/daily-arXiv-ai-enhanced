Research on clocks has either focused on long-term stability using an oscillator stabilized by a level transition, limiting precision at short timescales, or on making individual stochastic ticks as precise as possible. Here, we prove the viability of a conceptually different avenue: the autonomous self-correction of consecutive ticks by quantum correlations. This provides a new paradigm that integrates the advantages and insights from quantum transport theory to operate clocks at ultra-short timescales. We fully solve a model of coupled quantum systems and show how the emergent Pauli exclusion principle correlates the clock at the quantum level yielding an exponential advantage in precision. We furthermore demonstrate through simulations with realistic imperfections that this remarkable gain in precision remains stable providing a roadmap for implementation with contemporary quantum technologies."}

Codes such as the rectangular surface code or XZZX code substantially reduce the qubit overhead under biased noise, but they still face challenges. The rectangular surface code suffers from a relatively low threshold, while the XZZX code requires twice as many physical qubits to maintain the same code distance as the surface code. In this work, we introduce a 2D local code construction that outperforms these codes for noise biases $η\\ge 7\\times10^{4}$, reducing the qubit overhead by over 50% at $p_Z=10^{-3}$ and $η= 2 \\times 10^6$ to achieve a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$. Our construction relies on the concatenation of two classical codes. The inner codes are repetition phase-flip codes while the outer codes are high-rate bit-flip codes enabled by their implementation at the logical level, which circumvents device connectivity constraints. These results indicate that under sufficiently biased noise, it is advantageous to address phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different layers of the coding scheme. The inner code should prioritize a high threshold for phase-flip errors, while the bit-flip outer code should optimize for encoding rate efficiency. In the strong biased-noise regime, high-rate outer codes keep the overhead for correcting residual bit-flip errors comparable to that of the repetition code itself, meaningfully lower than that required by earlier approaches."}

By mapping the resulting mixed state to the ensemble of completely packed loops on a square lattice, we relate the extended phase to the Goldstone phase of the loop model. In particular, CMI is controlled by the characteristic length scale of loops, and we use analytic results of the latter to establish polylogarithmic decay of CMI in the critical phase. We find that the critical phase retains partial logical information that can be recovered by a global decoder, but not by any quasi-local decoder. To demonstrate this, we introduce a diagnostic called punctured coherent information which provides a necessary condition for quasi-local decoding."}

We present a general construction that embeds stabilizer states as QMBS of local Hamiltonians. The method relies on a notion of factorizability of Pauli strings on a lattice, which is used to convert stabilizer elements into local, few-body operators that annihilate the stabilizer state. This enables the systematic construction of parent Hamiltonians with zero-energy stabilizer QMBS typically near the middle of the spectrum. The method reproduces several known results in a unified framework, including recent examples of volume-law entangled QMBS, such as the ``rainbow'' QMBS and the entangled antipodal Bell pair state. We also apply the framework to construct examples of stabilizer QMBS with a more complex entanglement structure, such as the cluster state, the toric code state, and a volume-law entangled state we dub the antipodal toric code (ATC) state. Exact diagonalization confirms our results and reveal the stabilizer states as exact eigenstates of their parent Hamiltonian."}

Our analysis reveals an excess intensity in the inner shadow region that points to a potential observational signature of the novel behavior of light rays propagating near the event horizon. This excess could be a probe for horizon-scale modifications of black hole geometries. Furthermore, although the horizon surface of the Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole continuously accumulates photons and energy, we show that its backreaction response differs from that of stable light rings found in various exotic compact objects."}

They are compared to those of a special case of the Rosenzweig-Porter model with random matrices composed of two diagonal blocks modeling the spectral properties of the QBs, that are coupled with a tunable parameter. We demonstrate that this model is suitable for the description of the experimental data and thus may be employed to determine the strength of the coupling. It results from the increasing overlap of eigenmodes in the QBs penetrating through the opening into the other one, leading to a mixing of their eigenstates, and the breaking of the symmetry present in the QB with integrable dynamics. This implicates deviations of the spectral properties from those of typical quantum systems with integrable and chaotic dynamics, respectively, and approaches those of a fully chaotic system for sufficiently large coupling strength. In contrast in previous studies the transition from integrable to chaotic dynamics was induced by introducing a random potential of increasing strength into such a QB and applicability of a variant of the Rosenzweig-Porter model was tested."}

However, the allosteric mechanisms underlying non-hotspot mutations remain elusive. Using p53 dimer as models, we constructed p53-WT, non-hotspot p53-E180R, and hotspot p53-R248W dimer-DNA complexes to compare the structural and functional impacts of these two mutation types. Our results reveal that both mutations weaken intramolecular interactions in p53-DBD and enhance structural flexibility. Specifically, E180R perturbs dimer interface interactions, impairing dimer stability and cooperative DNA binding; R248W disrupts interactions between the L3/L1 loops and DNA, leading to the loss of DNA-binding capacity.

In the compressible SF, increasing impurity-bath coupling $|U_{\\mathrm{ib}}|$ drives an \\emph{interaction-driven winding-collapse crossover}: a light, extended polaron with finite winding evolves continuously into a heavy polaron and ultimately a self-trapped state -- a repulsive \\emph{saturated bubble} or an attractive \\emph{bound cluster} -- even while the bath remains globally superfluid, establishing localization without any bath phase transition. By contrast, upon tuning the bath across the SF-MI transition at fixed impurity-bath coupling $U_{\\mathrm{ib}}$, localization becomes \\emph{compressibility controlled}: the vanishing bath compressibility quenches polaronic dressing and collapses the impurity-centered density response, converting the polaron into an almost free defect and, deep in the MI, into a fully localized vacancy or particle defect. In the incompressible regime, localization proceeds via \\emph{quantized defect formation}, manifested by discrete changes in the total bath occupation.

This approach enables access to a distinct parameter regime wherein RR dominates electron dynamics while quantum effects remain modest. Numerical simulations demonstrate that three key observables exist for identifying the RR within this CRDR regime: (i) quantitative measurement of energy spectra to validate the quantum correction factor; (ii) control of the collision time delay with charge-counting to map intensity dependence of RR; and (iii) verification of large angle ($90^\\circ$) photon emission under the recoil condition $2γ\\gtrsim a_0$.

Similar designs are appealing yet largely unexplored in engineered materials due to the complexity of integrating multiple components into a single material platform. Here, we report a dual-latched magneto-elastic shell device capable of selectively activating the latches to regulate snapping pathways and energy output based on specific actuation requirements. Differential deswelling across the thickness acts as the motor to load the elastic energy into the shell, which is then released via the snap-through instability once the loading reaches the critical threshold, constituting an intrinsic mechanical latch. Activation of the external magnetic latch delays snapping onset beyond the threshold of the intrinsic latch, leading to a power-amplified supercritical snap-through instability as well as a bifurcation instability. The combined function of both latches allows for flexible control over energy storage and release. Additionally, this integrated LaMSA system possesses an untethered anchoring mechanism, enabling the device to launch in arbitrary directions from the substrate, driven by the energy released during snapping. We envision that the design principles of dual-latched LaMSA systems will create opportunities for power-dense actuation in engineered materials and robotic devices."}

Through illustrative examples and a practical case inspired by CERN's existing components, the paper underlines the necessity of anticipating lifecycle demands, ensuring manufacturability, and safeguarding operational reliability. Particular emphasis is placed on the contractual value of 2D drawings, the practical application of functional dimensioning, and tolerance chain analysis. By reviewing common pitfalls and exploring best practices, the paper seeks to orient engineers towards design choices that balance cost, reliability, and performance."}

Gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) are generated by PLAL using the corresponding target. The target is submerged in a transparent liquid solution made previously with tetraetylorthosilicate (TEOS) adding diluted hydrochloric acid as catalyzer. In the case of gelatins commercial gelatin and tap water are used. The laser source is a Nd:YAG laser emitting at 1064 nm, with an energy of 100 mJ and 8 ns pulse duration at 10 Hz repetition rate focused on the target in a 2 mm diameter laser spot. The ablation time is 10 min for the glasses and gelatins. The Au-NPs are uniformly dispersed in the solution. After the ablation process the gels are sealed and stored at room temperature for several days. The samples are characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, HRTEM, ellipsometry and AFM microscopy, these measurements reveal optical transparency and a refractive index near 1.45 for the pure glass, whereas a colorful aspect, a refractive index of 1.42, and a small surface roughness of 1.92 nm for the glass containing Au-NPs. In the case of gelatins self-sustained flexible films are obtained."}

Here, we introduce a curated hierarchy of chemically decisive benchmark systems designed to probe distinct regimes of electronic correlation relevant to molecular, bioinorganic, and heavy-element chemistry. Moving beyond minimal toy models, our benchmark set spans multireference bond breaking (N$_2$), high-spin transition-metal chemistry (FeS), biologically relevant iron-sulfur clusters ([2Fe-2S]), and actinide-actinide bonding (U$_2$), which exhibits extreme sensitivity to active-space choice, relativistic treatment, and correlation hierarchy even within advanced multireference frameworks. As a concrete realization, we benchmark a recently developed automated and adaptive quantum algorithm based on generator-coordinate-inspired subspace expansion,ADAPT-GCIM, using a black-box workflow that integrates entropy-based active-space selection via the ActiveSpaceFinder tool. Across this chemically diverse problem set, ADAPT-GCIM achieves high accuracy in challenging correlation regimes. Equally importantly, these benchmarks expose general failure modes and design constraints-independent of any specific algorithm-highlighting the necessity of problem-aware and correlation-specific strategies for treating strongly correlated chemistry on quantum computers. To support systematic benchmarking and reproducible comparisons, the Hamiltonians for all systems studied are made openly available."}

Using large-scale, sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on the worm algorithm, we track the impurity winding number, the bath superfluid density and compressibility, and impurity--bath density correlations. First, by fixing the bath interaction at $U_{\\mathrm{b}}/t=13.3$ in the superfluid regime and tuning the attractive impurity-bath coupling from $U_{\\mathrm{ib}}/t=-1.0$ to $-40.0$, we uncover an interaction-driven winding-collapse localization: the impurity evolves from a mobile light polaron with finite winding to a heavy polaron and, finally, to a bound cluster with vanishing winding, while the bath remains globally superfluid. Second, we analyze impurity in Mott-insulating baths for both attractive and repulsive impurity--bath couplings, contrasting the resulting deformation clouds and localization patterns. Third, for a moderate attractive impurity-bath coupling $U_{\\mathrm{ib}}/t=-8.0$, we tune the bath interaction $U_{\\mathrm{b}}/t$ across the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition and find a compressibility-controlled localization crossover of coherent impurity motion. Finally, together with our companion Letter [\\emph{The Fate of a Single Impurity in the Bose--Hubbard Model}], which focused on repulsive impurity-bath couplings, these results provide a unified microscopic picture of impurity localization in the Bose--Hubbard model, connecting interaction-driven and compressibility-controlled mechanisms across both attractive and repulsive regimes."}

By solving Maxwell's equations in covariant form, we show that torsion induces intrinsic chirality and circular birefringence: right- and left-circular polarizations acquire different wavenumbers, leading to a purely geometric optical activity. The polarization plane of a linearly polarized beam rotates according to the simple law $Δθ= ΩρL$, linear in the dislocation density $Ω$, propagation length $L$, and transverse coordinate $ρ$. This can be recast as an effective birefringence $Δn = 2cΩρ/ω$, providing geometric design rules for torsion-induced rotatory power. Using parameters from dislocated semiconductors, we obtain millidegree rotations over millimetre-scale paths, within reach of modern polarimetric techniques and amenable to enhancement in metamaterial platforms. We also show that the same spiral geometry implements a broadband geometric phase gate for polarization qubits and has an electronic analogue on the surface of cylindrical topological insulators, where torsion shears the Dirac cone, establishing a unified geometric link between torsion, optical activity, and topological electronic responses."}

We investigate how strongly correlated states of the decoupled two-dimensional Hubbard model on the surface evolve under inclusion of such an SSH-like interlayer coupling. For large parts of the phase diagram as a function of the interlayer hopping parameters, the physics of the two-dimensional system prevails, with antiferromagnetic, superconducting d-wave, and ferromagnetic correlations taking center stage. However, for intermediate interlayer couplings the superconducting state at intermediate interaction strengths separates into two regimes by a small region of incommensurate spin-density-wave and spin-bond order, enabling the potential realization of chiral spin-bond order."}

We attribute this dispersion primarily to (i) the electric-field window probed in TCT measurements, (ii) the choice of mobility model, and (iii) the excitation source (alpha, laser, or electron). Using an aggregated literature dataset, we benchmark the Trofimenkoff and Caughey-Thomas parameterisations together with a new piecewise model for both conduction- and valence-band transport. For electrons, the piecewise model provides the best global description over a broad electric-field range and is shown to arise as the room-temperature limit of a more general superposition framework that explicitly incorporates intervalley repopulation in the conduction band. For holes, the Caughey-Thomas model remains the statistically preferred description, in line with the absence of a strong repopulation effect in the accessible data. Furthermore, we demonstrate a systematic source dependence (alpha versus laser) and quantify its impact on fitted mobility and saturation-velocity values. We provide temperature scalings over narrow intervals around room temperature and recommend parameter sets for implementation in device and detector simulation frameworks. Together, these results reconcile much of the apparent inconsistency in the literature and offer clear guidance for model selection, experimental design, and device-level simulation of charge transport in intrinsic diamond."}

In the case of equilibrium for relativist particles, the Juttner distribution is derived. For relativistic waves, a full derivation of the Planck spectrum including zero-point radiation is obtained within classical theory. For relativistic waves, relativistic behavior and conformal symmetry are crucial. It is emphasized that the classical two-point correlation function for classical zero-point radiation depends upon the geodesic separation between the spacetime points and is independent of the coordinate system choice.

The coupling between PPs and NEs through the radiated optical field leads to establishment of a significant cross-correlation between NEs, so that their internal dynamics (photocurrent affected by the laser irradiation) depends on the NR's plasma frequency $ω_{p}$. The transition to this regime,combined with the nonlinearity of the system, leads to a steep increase of the photocurrent in the NEs, as well as to non-smooth (chimera-like or chaotic) behavior in the critical (transition) region, where small variations of $ω_{p}$ lead to significant changes in the level of the NE pairwise cross-correlations. The chimera-like state is realized as coexistence of locally synchronized and desynchronized NE dynamical states. A fit of the dependence of the critical current on $ω_{p}$ is found, being in agreement with results of numerical simulations. The critical effect may help to design new optical devices, using dispersive nanolattices which are made available by modern nanoelectronics."}

We present a detailed, orbital-by-orbital analysis of these corrections for three semi-local density functional approximations (DFAs) situated on the three lowest rungs of the Jacob's Ladder of approximations. The analysis is based on Fermi-Löwdin Orbital Self-Interaction Correction calculations performed at several steps along the reaction pathway from the reactants (R) to the transition state (TS) to the products (P) for four representative reactions selected from the BH76 benchmark set. For all three functionals, the major contribution to self-interaction corrections of the barrier heights can be traced to stretched bond orbitals that develop near the TS configuration. The magnitude of the ratio of the self-exchange-correlation energy to the self-Hartree energy (XC/H) for a given orbital is introduced as an indicator of one-electron self-interaction error. For the exact, but unknown density functional, XC/H = 1.0 for all orbitals, while for the practical DFAs studied here, XC/H spans a range of values. The largest values are obtained for stretched or strongly lobed orbitals. We show that significant differences in XC/H for corresponding orbitals in the R, TS, and P configurations can be used to identify the major contributors to the SIC of barrier heights and reaction energies. Based on such comparisons, we suggest that barrier height predictions made using the SCAN meta-generalized gradient approximation may have attained the best accuracy possible for a semi-local functional using the Perdew-Zunger SIC approach."}

Cold gases of ytterbium (Yb) atoms have been proposed to be an ideal platform to study the Kondo effect since different internal states of the atom can be used to create both the impurity and the fermionic environment. In Yb gases, however, the atomic impurity interacts with the fermionic environment both through magnetic and potential scattering. These two scattering mechanisms counteract one another, raising the question of how robust Kondo screening remains. Here, we show that potential scattering can quench the Kondo screening in one-dimensional Yb gases; yet, strikingly, Kondo physics survives this quench in well-defined regimes. Combining analytical renormalization-group theory for a Luttinger liquid with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we identify a transition from a strongly- to a weakly-entangled impurity as potential scattering is increased. The two approaches show excellent agreement concerning the stability of Kondo physics throughout the different parameter regimes considered. Our results provide a quantitative criterion for the emergence of Kondo screening in one-dimensional Yb gases and delineate experimentally accessible regimes for its realization in cold-atom platforms."}

Indeed, this progress has entailed investigations into various HCPCF designs, allowing for attaining diverse properties of interest such as ultralow loss, polarization filtering, and specific modal operation. Among HCPCFs with tailored modal characteristics are fibers displaying microstructures with modified symmetry, which allow for changing the loss hierarchy between the guided modes, hence favoring the propagation of higher-order modes. In this context, we here demonstrate the realization of an angle sensor utilizing a tubular HCPCF with a two-fold symmetric cladding. This specific fiber design enables the generation of an output intensity profile resulting from the superposition of LP01 and LP11-like modes, whose excitation and resulting output intensity spatial distribution are dependent on the polarization angle of the incident light. Thus, by rotating the input beam's polarization and analyzing the evolution of the resulting output profile, we characterized a rotation angle sensor exhibiting a sensitivity of 25 counts/degree and an estimated resolution of 0.3°.

Moving beyond minimal toy models, our benchmark set spans multireference bond breaking (N$_2$), high-spin transition-metal chemistry (FeS), biologically relevant iron-sulfur clusters ([2Fe-2S]), and actinide-actinide bonding (U$_2$), which exhibits extreme sensitivity to active-space choice, relativistic treatment, and correlation hierarchy even within advanced multireference frameworks. As a concrete realization, we benchmark a recently developed automated and adaptive quantum algorithm based on generator-coordinate-inspired subspace expansion,ADAPT-GCIM, using a black-box workflow that integrates entropy-based active-space selection via the ActiveSpaceFinder tool. Across this chemically diverse problem set, ADAPT-GCIM achieves high accuracy in challenging correlation regimes. Equally importantly, these benchmarks expose general failure modes and design constraints-independent of any specific algorithm-highlighting the necessity of problem-aware and correlation-specific strategies for treating strongly correlated chemistry on quantum computers.

By sweeping the temporal separation between the interaction windows, the probe directly samples the absorbers population correlator, enabling bosonic noise spectroscopy that discriminates Markovian temperature noise from slow or spectrally structured fluctuations.

Our results confirm the parametric nature of few-body bound states in a continuum (BIC) and extend this characterization to a broader set of system parameters. Specifically, we find that variations of both interaction parameters and the mass ratio can lead to the formation of at least one three-body BIC.

These results suggest that the mechanism of few-body BIC formation is more sensitive to the kinematic structure of the problem than to the specific details of the two-body interaction."}

The transition to this regime,combined with the nonlinearity of the system, leads to a steep increase of the photocurrent in the NEs, as well as to non-smooth (chimera-like or chaotic) behavior in the critical (transition) region, where small variations of $ω_{p}$ lead to significant changes in the level of the NE pairwise cross-correlations. The chimera-like state is realized as coexistence of locally synchronized and desynchronized NE dynamical states.

A stacked configuration consisting of two scintillator modules wrapped together and read by two SiPM sensors, which are operated in coincidence mode via linked Arduino microcontrollers, is presented.

This computational cost increases significantly in the time domain, which requires non-diagonal covariance matrices to compute the likelihood. Consequently, parameter estimation of long-duration gravitational wave signals, such as binary neutron star mergers, becomes computationally infeasible in time domain. In this work, we detail a framework for the heterodyned likelihood that enables rapid inference in the time domain. Our method is applicable to signals with arbitrary mode content, and leverages the smoothness of the ratio of complex-valued waveform modes, approximating the ratio as a linear function within appropriately chosen time bins. This allows downsampling of the waveform modes and a reformulation of the likelihood, such that it depends only on the bin edges. We demonstrate that this likelihood recovers posteriors that are indistinguishable from those obtained using the standard likelihood in the time domain. We also observe dramatic improvement in speed - for a 128 seconds-long gravitational wave signal, our method is at least $\\sim 400$ times faster than the standard time-domain analysis, reducing the wall clock time to just a few hours. We also demonstrate the reliability and unbiasedness of the likelihood using percentile-percentile tests for binary black hole and binary neutron star injections. We use the Gohberg-Semencul representation of the inverse of Toeplitz covariance matrix to accelerate matrix-vector products, which has potential applications even in non heterodyned time-domain inference."}

Recently, strong interactions have been demonstrated to induce strain and dielectric screening tunable topological phases such as quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI), trivial insulator, higher-order topological insulator, and metallic phase, in the ground state of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$. Moreover, charge dosing has been demonstrated to convert the QSHI into a dual QSHI state. Although the band structure of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ is central to interpreting its topological phases in transport experiments, direct experimental access to its intrinsic electronic structure has so far remained elusive. Here we report direct measurements of the monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ band structure using spatially resolved micro-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) with micrometre-scale resolution. The observed dispersions show quantitative agreement with density functional theory calculations using the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional, establishing the insulating ground state and revealing no evidence for strong electronic correlations. We further uncover a pronounced electron-hole asymmetry in the doping response. Whereas hole doping is readily induced by electrostatic gating, attempts to introduce electrons via gating or alkali metal deposition do not yield a rigid upward shift of the Fermi level. Fractional charge calculations demonstrate that added electrons instead drive band renormalization and shrink the band gap. Taken together, our experimental and theoretical results identify the microscopic mechanism by which induced charges reshape the band topology of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$, showing that doping can fundamentally alter the electronic structure beyond the rigid band behaviour that is typically assumed."}

The noncommutative geometry introduces modifications to the underlying phase space structure, which can lead to new insights, and potentially solves outstanding problems in theoretical physics. In this work, we adopt a semiclassical perspective to perform a thermostatistical analysis of well-established potential models - Yukawa and Lee-Wick - within a noncommutative phase space. We obtain statistical thermodynamics quantities such as the density of states, partition function, average energy, and the heat capacity. We employ both the microcanonical and canonical ensemble formalisms, with the system embedded in a phase space modified by the noncommutativity of the space-time. We analyzed the negative heat capacities results obtained here in this noncommutativity scenario as a function of the modification of the microstructure of phase space thanks to the $θ$-parameter introduction. The entire treatment is conducted within the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics framework."}

This model is a natural extension of an exactly solvable model whose interaction between a qubit and single-mode photons is given by a product of the Pauli $z$ operator of the qubit and a linear combination of annihilation and creation operators of the photons. By contrast, a photon's part of the interaction of our model is given by the square of the linear combination. Because our model is not solvable, we approximately investigate its time evolution up to the second-order perturbation. Our numerical calculations show that violation of the LG inequality diminishes as the temperature increases. Moreover, it exhibits power laws of the temperature, whose exponents vary depending on the coupling constant of the interaction between the qubit and photons. The violation of the LG inequality decreases and becomes less sensitive to the temperature as the coupling constant of the interaction gets larger."}

Although these configurations are thermodynamically unstable, they provide a continuous interpolation between the confining soliton and the deconfined black hole phases. Using probe fundamental strings, we show that the theory remains confining along the unstable branch, with a string tension that decreases smoothly and vanishes only in the black hole limit. Introducing fundamental matter via probe D5-branes, we find that chiral symmetry breaking follows the same pattern: the condensate decreases continuously and switches off precisely where confinement disappears.

This enables the systematic construction of parent Hamiltonians with zero-energy stabilizer QMBS typically near the middle of the spectrum. The method reproduces several known results in a unified framework, including recent examples of volume-law entangled QMBS, such as the ``rainbow'' QMBS and the entangled antipodal Bell pair state. We also apply the framework to construct examples of stabilizer QMBS with a more complex entanglement structure, such as the cluster state, the toric code state, and a volume-law entangled state we dub the antipodal toric code (ATC) state. Exact diagonalization confirms our results and reveal the stabilizer states as exact eigenstates of their parent Hamiltonian."}

The polarization plane of a linearly polarized beam rotates according to the simple law $Δθ= ΩρL$, linear in the dislocation density $Ω$, propagation length $L$, and transverse coordinate $ρ$. This can be recast as an effective birefringence $Δn = 2cΩρ/ω$, providing geometric design rules for torsion-induced rotatory power. Using parameters from dislocated semiconductors, we obtain millidegree rotations over millimetre-scale paths, within reach of modern polarimetric techniques and amenable to enhancement in metamaterial platforms.

Several error correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. These features collectively open the door to countless possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence."}

Our framework is based on the Power-Zienau-Woolley representation of quantum electrodynamics, which provides an optimal separation between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom and is therefore particularly well suited for constructing quantum descriptions of polaritonic excitations in strongly dispersive media. Within this formulation, the fundamental electronic oscillator is identified as the bulk plasmon mode, which is nonperturbatively coupled to the radiative continuum of free photon modes. This coupling induces a geometry-dependent renormalization of the bulk plasma frequency, giving rise to confined plasmonic resonances. As specific applications, we recover the localized surface plasmon modes of metallic nanoparticles, including radiative frequency shifts and decay, as well as the exact dispersion relation of propagating surface plasmon polaritons at planar interfaces. Our quantum treatment further reveals that light-matter interactions at metal-dielectric interfaces are inherently in the ultrastrong coupling regime. As a result, in the quasistatic limit, the system exhibits unconventional ground-state quantum fluctuations that can be controlled through the refractive index. These results open new intriguing perspectives in the field of quantum plasmonics."}

Additionally, several new quantitative characterizations of the stochastic properties that govern the light fields are derived. Furthermore, the validity of the theoretical framework and corresponding results is experimentally verified by analyzing the statistical properties of the propagated light fields after determining the spatial and temporal stochastic features of the random media. The results presented here provide a more accurate theoretical basis for better understanding random phenomena in emerging domains such as free-space optical communication, detection, and imaging in transparent random media.

Cold gases of ytterbium (Yb) atoms have been proposed to be an ideal platform to study the Kondo effect since different internal states of the atom can be used to create both the impurity and the fermionic environment. In Yb gases, however, the atomic impurity interacts with the fermionic environment both through magnetic and potential scattering. These two scattering mechanisms counteract one another, raising the question of how robust Kondo screening remains. Here, we show that potential scattering can quench the Kondo screening in one-dimensional Yb gases; yet, strikingly, Kondo physics survives this quench in well-defined regimes. Combining analytical renormalization-group theory for a Luttinger liquid with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we identify a transition from a strongly- to a weakly-entangled impurity as potential scattering is increased. The two approaches show excellent agreement concerning the stability of Kondo physics throughout the different parameter regimes considered. Our results provide a quantitative criterion for the emergence of Kondo screening in one-dimensional Yb gases and delineate experimentally accessible regimes for its realization in cold-atom platforms."}

Our framework is based on the Power-Zienau-Woolley representation of quantum electrodynamics, which provides an optimal separation between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom and is therefore particularly well suited for constructing quantum descriptions of polaritonic excitations in strongly dispersive media. Within this formulation, the fundamental electronic oscillator is identified as the bulk plasmon mode, which is nonperturbatively coupled to the radiative continuum of free photon modes. This coupling induces a geometry-dependent renormalization of the bulk plasma frequency, giving rise to confined plasmonic resonances. As specific applications, we recover the localized surface plasmon modes of metallic nanoparticles, including radiative frequency shifts and decay, as well as the exact dispersion relation of propagating surface plasmon polaritons at planar interfaces. Our quantum treatment further reveals that light-matter interactions at metal-dielectric interfaces are inherently in the ultrastrong coupling regime. As a result, in the quasistatic limit, the system exhibits unconventional ground-state quantum fluctuations that can be controlled through the refractive index. These results open new intriguing perspectives in the field of quantum plasmonics."}

Here, we demonstrate that amorphous Ge (a-Ge) films overcome this limitation, possessing inherent ultrashort carrier lifetimes ~ 1.11-1.38 ps. We leverage this property to demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, coherent THz pulse detection using undoped a-Ge-on-Si PCAs.

Recently, strong interactions have been demonstrated to induce strain and dielectric screening tunable topological phases such as quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI), trivial insulator, higher-order topological insulator, and metallic phase, in the ground state of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$. Moreover, charge dosing has been demonstrated to convert the QSHI into a dual QSHI state. Although the band structure of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ is central to interpreting its topological phases in transport experiments, direct experimental access to its intrinsic electronic structure has so far remained elusive. Here we report direct measurements of the monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ band structure using spatially resolved micro-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) with micrometre-scale resolution. The observed dispersions show quantitative agreement with density functional theory calculations using the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional, establishing the insulating ground state and revealing no evidence for strong electronic correlations. We further uncover a pronounced electron-hole asymmetry in the doping response. Whereas hole doping is readily induced by electrostatic gating, attempts to introduce electrons via gating or alkali metal deposition do not yield a rigid upward shift of the Fermi level. Fractional charge calculations demonstrate that added electrons instead drive band renormalization and shrink the band gap. Taken together, our experimental and theoretical results identify the microscopic mechanism by which induced charges reshape the band topology of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$, showing that doping can fundamentally alter the electronic structure beyond the rigid band behaviour that is typically assumed."}

Here, we address these limitations by realizing erasure conversion in a single fluxonium operated at zero flux, where the logical state is encoded in its 0-2 subspace. A single, carefully engineered resonator provides both mid-circuit erasure detection and end-of-line (EOL) logical measurement. Post-selection on non-erasure outcomes results in more than four-fold increase of the logical lifetime, from $193~μ$s to $869~μ$s. Finally, we characterize measurement-induced logical dephasing as a function of measurement power and frequency, and infer that each erasure check contributes a negligible error of $7.2\\times 10^{-5}$.

The parity of the dominant tunneling process, i.e.~whether an odd or even number of Cooper pairs tunnel, results in qualitatively different properties, and controlling this opens up a wide range of applications in superconducting technology. However, access to even-dominated regimes has remained challenging and has so far relied on complex multi-junction or all-hybrid architectures. Here, we demonstrate a simple \"harmonic parity qubit\" (HPQ); an element that combines two aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions in parallel to a gate-tunable InAs/Al nanowire junction forming a SQUID, and use spectroscopy versus flux to reconstruct its energy-phase relation at 85 gate voltage points. At half flux quantum, the odd harmonics of the Josephson potential can be suppressed by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the even harmonics, producing a double-well potential dominated by even harmonics with minima near $\\pmπ/2$.

Through combined theoretical analysis and experimental verification on superconducting qubits with engineered noise spectra, we show that two-qubit gate errors scale predictably with the noise power spectral density at frequency 2g, extending the concept of $T_{1ρ}$ relaxation to interacting systems. This frequency-selective relaxation mechanism, universal across platforms, enriches our understanding of decoherence pathways during gate operations.

Our approach combines classical micromagnetic simulations, achieving skyrmion diameters as small as 3 nm, with quantum circuit models inspired by superconducting qubits. In this work, we demonstrate: (i) unidirectional skyrmion transport via the skyrmion Hall effect in asymmetric junctions, spanning length scales from 20 nm down to 3 nm; (ii) potential compatibility with flux-tunable quantum architectures; and (iii) preliminary insights into anharmonicity in skyrmion-based qubit systems. These results establish both the operational feasibility and the scaling behavior necessary for a hybrid skyrmion-quantum platform. Our work outlines a path toward integrating skyrmion based quantum components into practical device architectures, enabling low-dissipation, unidirectional quantum information transport. This capability is crucial for scalable quantum computing, spintronic logic, and hybrid quantum systems, and opens opportunities for chipscale, pump-free isolators and directional quantum links that enhance readout fidelity, reduce cryogenic load, and support modular skyrmion-superconducting processors"}

Contextuality of the input state in MBQC has been identified as a key resource for quantum advantage, and in a stronger form, underlies algebraic relations between (measurement) operators which obey classically unsatisfiable (linear) constraints. Here, we compare these two perspectives on contextuality, and study to what extent they are related. More precisely, we associate a LCS to certain MBQC which exhibit strong forms of state-dependent contextuality, and ask if the measurement operators in such MBQC give rise to state-independent contextuality in the form of quantum solutions of its associated LCS. Our main result rules out such quantum solutions for a large class of MBQC. This both sharpens the distinction between state-dependent and state-independent forms of contextuality, and further generalises results on the non-existence of quantum solutions to LCS in finite odd (prime) dimension."}

A key contributor to these failures is biological uncertainty, which complicates trial design and weakens the ability to detect true treatment effects. In particular, inadequate patient stratification often results in covariate imbalances across treatment arms, masking treatment effects and reducing statistical power, even when therapies are effective for specific patient subpopulations. This work presents an optimization-based, quantum-enhanced approach to patient stratification that explicitly minimizes covariate imbalance across numerical and categorical variables, without altering protocol design or trial endpoints. Using real clinical trial data, we demonstrate that hybrid quantum-classical optimization methods achieve high-quality stratification while scaling efficiently to larger cohorts. In our benchmark study, the quantum-enhanced pipeline delivered over a 100x improvement in computational efficiency compared to classical approaches, enabling faster iteration and practical deployment at scale. This report shows how improved stratification can lead to decision-relevant gains, including up to a fivefold increase in statistical significance in treatment effect estimation, reducing treatment-effect dilution and increasing trial sensitivity. Together, these results show that optimization-driven stratification can strengthen clinical trial design, improve confidence in downstream decisions, and reduce the risk of costly late-stage failure."}

The algorithm, called matching decomposition, works by decomposing a continuous-time quantum walk Hamiltonian into a collection of exactly implementable Hamiltonians corresponding to matchings in the underlying graph followed by a novel graph compression algorithm that merges edges in the graph. Lastly, we convert the walks to a circuit and Trotterize over these components. The dynamics of the walker on each edge in the matching can be implemented in the circuit model as sequences of CX and CRx gates. We do not use Pauli decomposition when implementing walks along each matching. Furthermore, we compare matching decomposition to a standard Pauli-based simulation pipeline and find that matching decomposition consistently yields substantial resource reductions, requiring up to 43% fewer controlled gates and up to 54% shallower circuits than Pauli decomposition across multiple graph families. Finally, we also present examples and theoretical results for when matching decomposition can exactly simulate a continuous-time quantum walk on a graph."}

This work presents a detailed benchmarking and robustness investigation of classical classifiers under class imbalance mitigation using the Quantum Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (QSMOTE) and quantum-inspired perturbations modelled using six noise channels. Four different datasets, the Solar Panel Image Dataset (SPID), the CWRU Bearing Dataset (CWRUBD), the Engine Failure Detection Dataset (EFDD), and the Industrial Fault Detection Dataset (IFDD), are tested across multi-class scenarios to determine the universality of these impacts. The results show that QSMOTE consistently corrects distributional skew and significantly enhances the performance of non-linear classifiers such as Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees (DT), yielding improvements of up to 170% on EFDD and achieving near-perfect accuracy ($\\geq$0.99) on IFDD. Linear and probabilistic models, such as Linear Regression (LR) and Naive Bayes (NB), produce mixed results, with significant degradation in overlapping feature spaces due to interpolation-induced boundary distortion. A parallel robustness analysis under different noise models reveals that ensemble models (RF) and margin-based learners (SVM) maintain strong resilience, often preserving over 95% of baseline accuracy even under maximum noise. In contrast, NB and DT show substantial instability, especially on high-variance datasets. The findings establish a rigorous baseline for understanding how classical models behave under realistic imbalance and quantum-inspired noise."}

We demonstrate that this model is suitable for the description of the experimental data and thus may be employed to determine the strength of the coupling. It results from the increasing overlap of eigenmodes in the QBs penetrating through the opening into the other one, leading to a mixing of their eigenstates, and the breaking of the symmetry present in the QB with integrable dynamics. This implicates deviations of the spectral properties from those of typical quantum systems with integrable and chaotic dynamics, respectively, and approaches those of a fully chaotic system for sufficiently large coupling strength. In contrast in previous studies the transition from integrable to chaotic dynamics was induced by introducing a random potential of increasing strength into such a QB and applicability of a variant of the Rosenzweig-Porter model was tested."}

Our framework is based on the Power-Zienau-Woolley representation of quantum electrodynamics, which provides an optimal separation between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom and is therefore particularly well suited for constructing quantum descriptions of polaritonic excitations in strongly dispersive media. Within this formulation, the fundamental electronic oscillator is identified as the bulk plasmon mode, which is nonperturbatively coupled to the radiative continuum of free photon modes. This coupling induces a geometry-dependent renormalization of the bulk plasma frequency, giving rise to confined plasmonic resonances. As specific applications, we recover the localized surface plasmon modes of metallic nanoparticles, including radiative frequency shifts and decay, as well as the exact dispersion relation of propagating surface plasmon polaritons at planar interfaces. Our quantum treatment further reveals that light-matter interactions at metal-dielectric interfaces are inherently in the ultrastrong coupling regime. As a result, in the quasistatic limit, the system exhibits unconventional ground-state quantum fluctuations that can be controlled through the refractive index. These results open new intriguing perspectives in the field of quantum plasmonics."}
