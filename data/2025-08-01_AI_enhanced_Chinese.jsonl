Traditional models for cellular information processing\nhave focused on networks of chemical reactions between molecules.

The study extends this mapping to higher dimensions and addresses a puzzle with Wess-Zumino terms in odd dimensions, resulting in insights into dual field theories.", "motivation": "Understanding the AdS/CFT correspondence is crucial as it helps link higher-dimensional theories to lower-dimensional conformal field theories, providing insights into quantum gravity and string theory. This paper seems to contribute to the understanding by introducing a novel field redefinition and extending the mapping to more general cases.", "method": "The authors use a variational principle, field redefinition, and analysis of equations of motion to construct the duality between conformal galileons and DBI galileons in various dimensions. They also thoroughly analyze the structure of Wess-Zumino terms in odd dimensions to resolve potential puzzles.", "result": "The paper successfully constructs the duality between conformal galileons and DBI galileons across different dimensions, reconciling concerns about Wess-Zumino terms in odd dimensions. This dual formulation likely offers new perspectives on the interplay between conformal symmetry breaking and gravitational effects in dual field theories.", "conclusion": "The authors conclude by emphasizing the significance of their field redefinition in the AdS/CFT correspondence, suggesting potential impacts on future research into the dual descriptions of conformal field theories with broken conformal symmetry and their gravitational duals in AdS space. They also hint at broader implications for understanding quantum gravity and the AdS/CFT correspondence itself, calling for further exploration of these insights."}}

Burton"], "title": "Geometric direct minimization for low-spin restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock", "comment": "17 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "It has recently been shown that configuration state functions (CSF) with\nlocal orbitals can provide a compact reference state for low-spin open-shell\nelectronic structures, such as antiferromagnetic states. However, optimizing a\nlow-spin configuration using self-consistent field (SCF) theory has been a\nlong-standing challenge, since each orbital must be an eigenfunction of a\ndifferent Fock operator. Here, I introduce a low-spin restricted open-shell\nHartree-Fock (ROHF) algorithm to optimize any CSF at mean-field cost.

In this article, we present numerical evidence that the presence of\nquantum scars is a microscopic ingredient that enables and enhances\nnon-Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems. We exemplify this with the PXP\nmodel and its deformations which either enhance or erase the signatures of\nscarred dynamics when quenched from a simple product state that is known to\nhave significant overlaps with the scarred subspace in the spectrum. By probing\ninformation backflows with the dynamical behaviour of the distances between\ntemporally-separated states of small subsystems, systematic signatures of\nsubsystem non-Markovianity in these models are presented, and it is seen that\nscarring-enhancing (erasing) deformations also exhibit enhanced (diminished)\nsubsystem non-Markovianity.

It makes use of absolutely localized orbitals and correlated states\nevaluated on isolated fragments, which are then used to recover the interaction\nin an ab-initio manner based on a biorthogonal framework. The correlated\nmonomer information can be heavily truncated, and the Hamiltonian can be\nexpanded in a rapidly converging series, allow- ing the Hamiltonian to be built\nand diagonalized in a scalable fashion. However, the methodology still lacks an\nefficient bottom-up procedure, capable of producing optimized model state\nspaces for the isolated fragments, without ever building the Hamiltonian in the\nfull monomer state spaces. In order to address this issue, this work presents\nan algorithm utilizing monomer gradients at three different levels as well as\nan efficient pre-screening of the determinant space, ensuring compact model\nstate spaces and intermediates. Numerical results are presented for the\nberyllium dimer, showing that the algorithm is indeed capable of building\ncompact model state spaces, yielding results that closely resemble those of the\noptimal model state spaces. Furthermore, it is shown that model state spaces,\noptimized at the zeroth order of the Hamiltonian expansion, can also be used to\naccurately recover first order results, enabling very efficient optimization,\nas the optimization can be conducted at a lower order than the targeted final\nlevel.

To tackle this, the authors propose an algorithm that leverages monomer gradients at different levels and a preprocessing step to screen the determinant space efficiently.

A phenomenological model capable of\ndescribing this broad set of systems must also account for nemato-elasticity,\nby which nematic and elastic degrees of freedom become intertwined. However,\nbeing a tensor gauge field theory, elasticity must satisfy the compatibility\nrelations which guarantee the integrability of lattice deformations. Here, we\ndevelop a formalism for nemato-elasticity that manifestly respects the elastic\ncompatibility relations. We show that these constraints bifurcate the phase\nspace of nematic fluctuations into two orthogonal sectors: one compatible and\nthus critical, the other incompatible and therefore gapped.

Additionally, the study reveals that open boundaries reduce hardware costs but may come at the expense of logical efficiency. The optimal choice of code family depends on the specific trade-offs between hardware and logical performance, with each code excelling under different scenarios.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of Hardware-Aware Layout (HAL) as a powerful framework for evaluating the hardware feasibility of quantum error correction codes. It emphasizes that while achieving asymptotically lower overheads is a significant advancement, the practical implementation must balance hardware costs and maintaining logical efficiency. The findings suggest that the choice of QECC family and its implementation should be guided by the specific constraints and requirements of the underlying quantum hardware. HAL provides a valuable tool for optimizing QECC design and implementation, contributing to the development of scalable and reliable quantum computing architectures by guiding the discovery of new codes that better match realistic hardware conditions."}}

While\nboth quantities are rank-2 tensors, the strain tensor is constrained through\nthe Saint Venant compatibility relations. These three coupled second-order\npartial differential equations arise from the lattice displacement vector's\nrole as a potential field, and they reflect the underlying gauge invariance of\ngeometric deformations which are violated only in the presence of crystalline\ndefects. In this work, we develop a theory of nemato-elasticity that\nincorporates elastic compatibility explicitly through a co-rotating helical\nbasis. With our formalism, we show elasticity bestows tensor compatibility upon\nthe nematic order parameter by suppressing incompatible nematic fluctuations.\nAs a result, nemato-elasticity is markedly different from bare nematicity. In\nideal media devoid of defects, we show the suppression of incompatible\nnematicity underlies direction-selective criticality, even in the absence of\ncrystalline anisotropy. In systems with defects, meanwhile, we show that\nelastic pinning fields emanate from quenched defects, generating random\nlongitudinal and transverse conjugate fields for the local nematic order\nparameter. The coexistence of direction-selective nematic criticality with\npinning effects from random fields is explained within our theory from the\ntransformation to the helical basis, implying that local experimental probes of\nnematicity will be influenced by a linear -- but nonlocal -- combination of\nlong-ranged and short-ranged helical nematic modes. Because the compatibility\nrelations are gauge constraints endowed in the isotropic medium, our results\nconstitute universal features of nemato-elastic criticality present in all\ncrystalline systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u8272 basictics\uff08nematicity\uff09\u4e0e\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u53d8\u573a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3aflow-elasticity\u3002\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u65cb\u8f6c\u57fa\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5e94\u53d8\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u5bb9\u6027\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u914d\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f39\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u8272\u5e94\u53d8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b9\u5411\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e94\u53d8\u573a\u4f1a\u8feb\u4f7fnematic\u6709\u5e8f\u53c2\u6570\u4ea7\u751f\u7eb5\u5411\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u7684\u5171\u8f6d\u573a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u65cb\u8f6c\u57fa\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u5f97\u5230\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u9002\u914d\u6027\u662f\u8303\u5fb7\u8499\u5fb7\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u6676\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u7535\u5b50\u8272\u5e94\u53d8\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u9002\u914d\u6027\u4e0e\u5f39\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5bf9\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5305\u542b\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65cb\u8f6c\u57fa\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9002\u914d\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fanematic\u6709\u5e8f\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u5e94\u53d8\u573a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5f39\u6027\u5e94\u53d8\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7684nematic\u8272\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b9\u5411\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4e34\u754c\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f39\u6027\u573a\u4ea7\u751f\u7eb5\u5411\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u7684\u5171\u8f6d\u573a\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86nematic\u6709\u5e8f\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u6676\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7535\u5b50\u8272\u5e94\u53d8\u573a\u5728\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u914d\u6027\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u5f39\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cdnematic\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u8272\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Recent theoretical advances have reignited interest in its\nnonlinear counterpart, the nonlinear Edelstein effect, in which spin\nmagnetization is induced by a second-order electric field. However, the\nintrinsic contribution to both effects is generally forbidden in systems\npreserving time-reversal symmetry ($\\mathcal{T}$) or composite symmetries such\nas $\\mathcal{T}\\tau_{1/2}$, where $\\tau_{1/2}$ denotes a half-lattice\ntranslation. In such systems, spin magnetization typically emerges either from\nextrinsic mechanisms but limited to metals due to their Fermi-surface property,\nor from dynamical electric fields with a terahertz driving frequency. Here, we\npropose a new mechanism for spin magnetization, arising from the interplay of\nmagnetic and electric fields, termed the nonlinear magnetoelectric Edelstein\neffect. Remarkably, its intrinsic component, determined purely by the\nmaterial's band structure, can appear even in $\\mathcal{T}$-invariant\nmaterials, but lacking inversion symmetry ($\\mathcal{P}$), including\ninsulators.

The behaviour when the intercepts move from below\nto their critical values compatible with the Froissart limitation is studied.\nThe singuarities in the form of non-trivial branch points indicating a phase\ntransition are found in the vicinity of five fixed points found in the previous\npublication.

The model considers different bare intercepts and slopes for the pomeron and odderon. By varying the intercepts towards their critical values (in line with the Froissart bound), the study identifies singularities in the form of non-trivial branch points near five fixed points.

The motivation could be to explore how these models can predict and explain phenomena like Pomeron trajectories and their limitations, contributing to a deeper understanding of hadronic forces.", "method": "The authors used the Regge-Gribov model as a foundation, employing the renormalization group technique in a single-loop approximation. They considered the presence of both Pomeron and odderon with different bare parameters and studied their behavior as intercepts approach critical values influenced by the Froissart bound. Through this, they identified singularities near fixed points and assessed the implications for the model's physicality under varying intercept conditions. The methodology is grounded in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) principles and non-perturbative effects, likely requiring advanced computational tools,", "result": "The key findings indicate phase transitions in the system characterized by non-trivial branch points, which complicate the physical interpretation of the model beyond certain critical intercept values. The study reveals that the model remains valid only when the bare intercepts are below their critical thresholds, as exceeding these leads to a breakdown in symmetry and thus the model's feasibility is restricted in such scenarios. These results contribute to understanding the limitations and applicability of the Regge-Gribov model within the broader framework of hadron physics and QCD. The singularities identified suggest new avenues for exploring beyond the current model's capabilities in describing strong interaction dynamics. Overall, the findings highlight the critical role of intercept values in maintaining the model's physical consistency within the studied framework.", "conclusion": "The paper successfully applies the Regge-Gribov model to analyze the behavior of the Pomeron and Odderon in a non-trivial transverse space, utilizing the renormalization group technique to understand the system's phase transitions and singularities. By identifying critical fixed points and analyzing their vicinity, the study examines the conditions under which the model remains a valid physical framework. Ultimately, the research demonstrates that the Pomeron-Odderon system must respect certain symmetry constraints to ensure its applicability in describing hadronic interactions within the confines of the Froissart bound and QCD principles. The conclusions emphasize the importance of these constraints and provide insights into the potential for extending the model to more complex systems."}}

Due to the islets exhibiting perpendicular\nmagnetic anisotropy, the stray-field interaction between them leads to a shift\nin the SW dispersion depending on the magnetic alignment of neighboring islets.\nThis significantly changes the efficiency of the magnetoelastic interaction at\nspecified frequencies. We predict changes in SAW transmission of 28.9 dB/mm at\n3.8 GHz depending on the state of the device. For the efficient simulation of\nthe device, we extend a prior energy conservation argument based on analytical\nsolutions of the SW to finite-difference numerical calculations, enabling the\nmodeling of arbitrary magnetization patterns like the proposed islet-based\ndesign.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u5185\u90e8\u78c1\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0SAW\u6291\u5236\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u78c1\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cdSAW\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u8fbe\u5230\u51e0\u5341\u5206\u8d1d\u6bcf\u6beb\u7c73\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63a2\u7d22SAW\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u78c1\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u4e86Rayleigh SAW\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u81ea\u65cb\u6ce2\uff08SW\uff09\u5728\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u78c1\u6001\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u6291\u5236\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u78c1\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u8bbe\u5907\u57283.8 GHz\u9891\u6bb5\u7684SAW\u4f20\u8f93\u6291\u5236\u6548\u679c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8628.9 dB/mm\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u5185\u90e8\u8c03\u5236\u578bSAW\u6291\u5236\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The\nphysical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological\ninvariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored\nfor static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven\nscenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet\nnon-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological\nproperties of time-periodic NH systems. Em- ploying a high-frequency Magnus\nexpansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and\nformulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven\nquasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered\ncomplex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust\n(despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving\nparameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to\nemergent longer- range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame\napproach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when\nappropriately combined, account for the full edge-state struc- ture. To\nsubstantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit\n(TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the\nskin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of\ndistinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance\nprofiles, respectively.

Here we\npresent a joint model selection and parameter estimation algorithm that is fast\nand operable on a large number of model parameters.

The regularization can further\nseparate the degrees of freedom, e.g. quantum systems in the environment or\nprocesses, which contribute to major features in the observed dynamics, with\nrespect to others featuring small coupling, which only contribute to a\nbackground. As an application of the introduced framework, we consider the\nproblem of the identification of multiple individual nuclear spins with a\nsingle electron spin quantum sensor, relevant for nanoscale nuclear magnetic\nresonance.

Using the steady-state Boltzmann equation,\nwe find that intra-band transitions yield a strong field-like torque on the\nCrI$_3$ layer, while inter-band transitions give rise to a comparatively weaker\ndamping-like torque in the WSe$_2$/CrI$_3$ system. Remarkably, the damping-like\ncomponent is enhanced by up to three orders of magnitude in n-doped MoSe$_2$,\nreaching a strength comparable to the field-like torque, which itself is an\norder of magnitude larger than that in the WSe$_2$-based bilayer. Both torque\ncomponents exhibit strong asymmetry between n-type and p-type doping in WSe$_2$\nand MoSe$_2$ systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the twist angle plays a\ncrucial role: depending on the TMDC and chemical potential, twisting can\nreverse the sign of the SOT and significantly modulate its magnitude. Finally,\nwe show that a transverse gate electric field enables substantial tunability of\nthe SOT, by nearly one order of magnitude, and induces a sign reversal at a\ntwist angle of $10.16^{\\circ}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528WSe\u2082\u548cMoSe\u2082\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5355\u5c42\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u4e0eCrI\u2083\u5236\u6210\u590d\u5408\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u6d41\u8bf1\u5bfc\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u548c\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u8f6c\u77e9\uff08SOT\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6ce2\u6bb5\u95f4\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u78c1\u963b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fn\u63ba\u6742\u7684\u65cfII\u65cf\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u4f7f\u5f97\u6291\u5236\u6548\u679c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u64cd\u63a7\u5c42\u6781\u5316\u540e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63ba\u6742\u6001\u5728\u65cfII\u65cf\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u95f4\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u77e9\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002\u5916\u52a0\u8f6c\u89d2\u548c\u7535\u573a\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u78c1\u963b\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u538b\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": " interested in exploring the potential of combining two-dimensional materials as spin sources for spin-orbit torque applications, particularly beyond the linear response regime.", "method": "used the steady-state Boltzmann equation to model and analyze the current-induced spin polarization and resulting SOT in bilayer systems composed of TMDC and ferromagnetic CrI\u2083.", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6ce2\u6bb5\u95f4\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u78c1\u963b\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dCrI\u2083\u5c42\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\uff0cMoSe\u2082/Sp/graphene\u590d\u5408\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u6291\u5236\u6548\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u81f3\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0cCrI\u2083\u5c42\u548cWSe\u2082/Sp/graphene\u7cfb\u7edf\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684n-\u548cp-\u63ba\u6742\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u8f6c\u89d2\u548c\u5916\u52a0\u6307\u6570\u7535\u573a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u77e9\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "Our findings highlight the potential of using two-dimensional materials such as WSe\u2082, MoSe\u2082, and CrI\u2083 in spin-orbit torque applications, particularly by tuning the bilayer geometry and external electric field to manipulate the self-spinning effects."}}

Furthermore, to perform quantum computing\neffectively and efficiently, it implements key features, such as transpilers,\nmultiprogramming, and error mitigation, in an area as close as possible to a\nquantum computer, an area that system vendors rarely disclose. Finally, this\nstudy presents experimental results of applying OQTOPUS to a real quantum\ncomputer. OQTOPUS is publicly available on GitHub and will notably lower the\nbarrier to entry into the quantum computing field, contributing to the\nformation of a quantum computing developer community through open discussion.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses the challenges in quantum computing system design and proposes a full-stack open-source system called OQTOPUS to address these challenges, with experimental results showing its effectiveness.", "motivation": "The paper addresses the lack of transparency and control in quantum computing systems, which is a critical issue as quantum computing moves from research to practical applications.", "method": "The method involves designing and implementing OQTOPUS with features like transpilers, multiprogramming, and error mitigation, then testing it on a real quantum computer.", "result": "Experiments demonstrate OQTOPUS's effectiveness in improving quantum computing system performance.", "conclusion": "OQTOPUS helps lower the entry barrier for quantum computing and supports developing a community of quantum computer developers."}}

These findings precisely align with the known examples of vertex algebras arising from 4D N=2 SCFTs.

They have made progress towards classifying the vertex algebras that can arise from such theories. The results not only align with existing knowledge but also offer a pathway for further understanding the correspondence between 4D and 2D conformal field theories through the lens of vertex algebra unitarity."}}

Zero-Noise\nExtrapolation (ZNE), which we mainly consider in this work, is one of prominent\nquantum error mitigation methods. For algorithms with deep circuits - such as\niterative quantum algorithms involving multiple oracle calls - ZNE's\neffectiveness is significantly degraded under high noise. Extrapolation based\non such low-fidelity data often yields inaccurate estimates and requires\nsubstantial overhead. In this study, we propose a lightweight,\nextrapolation-based error mitigation framework tailored for structured quantum\nalgorithms composed of repeating operational blocks. The proposed method\ncharacterizes the error of the repeated core operational block, rather than the\nfull algorithm, using shallow circuits. Extrapolation is used to estimate the\nblock fidelity, followed by a reconstruction of the mitigated success\nprobability. We validate our method via simulations of the 6-qubit Grover's\nalgorithm on IBM's Aer simulator, then further evaluating it on the real\n127-qubit IBM Quantum system based on Eagle r3 under a physical noise\nenvironment. Our results, particularly those from Aer simulator, demonstrate\nthat the core block's error follows a highly consistent exponential decay. This\nallows our technique to achieve robust error mitigation, overcoming the\nlimitations of conventional ZNE which is often compromised by statistically\nunreliable data from near-random behavior under heavy noise. In low-noise\nconditions, our method approaches theoretical success probability, outperforms\nZNE.

This advancement makes QPE more practical for real-world applications like medicine and materials science.roud\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08QPE\uff09\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u836f\u7269\u3001\u7535\u6c60\u3001\u6750\u6599\u7b49\u3002 sandwiches\u6d4b\u8bd5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08QPE\uff09\u4e2d Hadamard \u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002 sandwiches \u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u603b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a O(k\u00b2 ln k / (\u03b5\u00b2 s_min\u2076))\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4 SHT \u7684 O(k\u00b3 / (\u03b5\u00b2 r_min\u00b2)) \u66f4\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002 \u8fd9\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u4f7f QPE \u66f4\u52a0\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u3001\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": " Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is a fundamental quantum algorithm with applications in various fields such as chemistry, material science, and medicine.

This\ninvolves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a\nsuperradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of\nthe squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the\nsqueezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the\nsuperradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR\nprocess of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many\norders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons,\ninduced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant\nsqueezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose\nlifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is\neffective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\uff08GR\uff09\u548c\u5e26\u6709\u5fae\u5206Chern-Simons\uff08CS\uff09\u5f15\u529bomaly\u9879\u7684CS\u5f15\u529b\u5728\u8f74ion\u4e91\u5468\u56f4\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d7 squeeze \u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u5bf9\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u3002GR\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f74ion\u7684\u6e6e\u706d\u4ea7\u751f\u4e24\u4e2a\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u7684 squeeze \u6548\u6548\u663e\u8457\u5f3a\u4e8eCS\u5f15\u529b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8f74ion\u8870=root\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u591a\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u7684 excitation\u6548\u7387.", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u548c\u8f74ion\u4e91\u4e0e\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04 Kerr\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7Chern-Simons\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u5f15\u529bomaly\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d7 squeeze \u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u548cChern-Simons\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f74ion\u4e91\u4e0e\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04Kerr\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728GR\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f74ion\u7684\u6e6e\u706d\u90fd\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e24\u4e2a\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u7684\u53d7 squeeze \u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u7535\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800cCS\u5f15\u529b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8f74ion\u8870[root]\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u6548\u7387\u8981\u5c0f\u5f97\u591a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u51c6\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5728\u8f74ion\u6e6e\u706d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u7684\u53d7 squeeze \u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u6548\u5e94\u8fdc\u5f3a\u4e8e\u5e26\u6709\u5fae\u5206\u5f15\u529bomaly\u7684Chern-Simons\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u8f74ion\u4e91\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u6d3b\u4f7f\u5f97CGS\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ecd\u7136\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46GR\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002"}}
