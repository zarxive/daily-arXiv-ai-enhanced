While originally this puzzle was presented in the context of BPS\ntwo-sided black holes in two-dimensional supergravity, the negativity in fact\npersists for more general two-sided black holes in the presence of a large\nnumber of matter excitations. Since the entanglement and R\\'enyi entropies in\nordinary quantum systems cannot be negative, resolving this puzzle is a\nnecessary step towards understanding the quantum mechanical description of\nblack holes. In this paper, we explain how to address the entanglement\nnegativity puzzle, both in the original setting discussed by LMRS and in more\ngeneral non-supersymmetric settings, by summing over all non-perturbative\ncontributions to the gravitational path integral.

In this work,\nwe introduce OSI-flex, a flexible, open-source computational framework for\nquantitative phase reconstruction from sheared phase-difference measurements.\nThe method leverages modern machine learning tools, namely automatic\ndifferentiation and the advanced ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer.\nThe method simultaneously estimates the phase and shear values, enabling it to\nadapt to experimental conditions where the shear cannot be precisely\ndetermined. Because defining shear value is inherently difficult in most\nsystems, yet crucial for effective phase reconstruction, this joint\noptimization leads to robust and reliable phase retrieval. OSI-flex is highly\nversatile, supporting arbitrary numbers, magnitudes, and orientations of shear\nvectors. While optimal reconstruction is achieved with two orthogonal shears,\nthe inclusion of regularization - specifically total variation minimization and\nsign constraint - enables OSI-flex to remain effective with nonorthogonal or\neven single-shear measurements. Moreover, OSI-flex accommodates a wide range of\nshear magnitudes, from subpixel (differential configuration) to several dozen\npixels (semi-total shear configuration).

In this paper, we present a novel approach\nto determine the isomeric lifetime based on the survival time of ions obtained\nfrom IMS. The survival lifetimes of the ground and isomeric states of 94Ru44+\nwere measured to be s and s in the laboratory, respectively. Given that the\nground state of 94Ru44+ has a natural lifetime of approximately 75 min, its\nsurvival lifetime in the experimental setup was predominantly determined by the\nbeam-loss lifetime, including interactions with residual gas in the storage\nring and carbon foil of the detector. In contrast, the survival lifetime of\n94mRu44+ was governed by its intrinsic nuclear lifetime and additional\nbeam-loss effects. The nuclear decay lifetime of 94mRu44+ was extracted through\ndifferential survival lifetime analysis between ground and isomeric states,\nunder the assumption that the beam-loss lifetimes for both quantum systems are\nidentical. Using this novel methodology, the lifetime measured in the\nlaboratory frame was s. After relativistic time-dilation corrections, the\ncorresponding rest-frame half-life was calculated to be s.

The key performance\nmetric is the paint swap ratio, the average number of colour changes per car,\nwhich directly impacts production efficiency and cost. Prior work showed that\nthe Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) at depth $p=7$ achieves a\npaint swap ratio of $0.393$, outperforming the classical Recursive Greedy (RG)\nheuristic with an expected ratio of $0.4$ [Phys.

In this study, we develop\nthe theoretical foundations for applying QAOA to BPSP through a reduction of\nBPSP to weighted MaxCut, and use this framework to benchmark two\nstate-of-the-art low-depth QAOA variants, eXpressive QAOA (XQAOA) and Recursive\nQAOA (RQAOA), at $p=1$ (denoted XQAOA$_1$ and RQAOA$_1$), against the strongest\nclassical heuristics known to date. Across instances ranging from $2^7$ to\n$2^{12}$ cars, XQAOA$_1$ achieves an average ratio of $0.357$, surpassing\nRQAOA$_1$ and all classical heuristics, including the conjectured performance\nof RSG.

The strength of the hybridization is driven by the Van Hove\nsingularity in the JDOS at the band gap: the stronger the singularity, the more\na photon is hybridized with the interband transitions. In order to increase the\nsingularity and thus the polariton hybridization without absorption, we propose\nto engineer a non-parabolic momentum dispersion of the bands around the gap in\norder to implement a high-order Van Hove singularity (HOVHS) in the JDOS.\nUltracold atoms in tunable optical lattices are an ideal platform to engineer\ntwo-dimensional gapped phases with non-trivial band dispersions at the gap.\nMoreover, the intrinsic non-interacting nature of polarized fermionic atoms\nprevents the emergence of sub-gap excitations, which are common in solid-state\nsystems and could otherwise spoil the absence of absorption below the gap. Our\nfindings identify band-engineering at the gap edge as a promising route for\npolariton control with applications in quantum-nonlinear optics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6805\u539f\u5b50\u4eba\u4e3a\u6784\u9020\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5e26\u72b6\u95f4\u9694\u76f8\uff0c\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u9891\u6bb5\u5185\u6fc0\u53d1\u4ecb\u7535\u80fd\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u9636\u68b5\u970d\u592b\u5947\u70b9\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u4ecb\u7535\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5408\u6210\u5149\u6805\u4ecb\u7535\u6781\u5316\u58f0\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u6784\u9020\u7684\u5149\u6805\u539f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u4ecb\u7535\u80fd\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5149\u6805\u4ecb\u7535\u6781\u5316\u58f0\u5b50\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u8303\u970d\u592b\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u51fa\u65e0\u5438\u6536\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8c03\u5236\u5149\u6805\u539f\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5fae\u5206\u7b49\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u6784\u9020\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5e26\u72b6\u95f4\u9694\u76f8\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6781\u5316\u80fd\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9891\u6bb5\u5185\u9002\u5f53\u6784\u9020\u9ad8\u8303\u970d\u592b\u5947\u70b9\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4ecb\u7535\u914d\u4f4d\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ecb\u7535\u80fd\u5b50\u6781\u5316\u58f0\u5b50\u7684\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u501f\u52a9\u8303\u970d\u592b\u5947\u70b9\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u6781\u5316\u58f0\u5b50\u8c31\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u4e8e\u666e\u9002\u8303\u970d\u592b\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u6784\u9020\u7684\u5e26\u72b6\u95f4\u9694\u76f8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u5316\u58f0\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u5438\u6536\u6fc0\u53d1\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The model of non-local conductivity is developed on the basis of the\nKubo technique applied to the Dirac equation for pseudospins. As a result, the\neffective boundary conditions for the electromagnetic (EM) field on a CNT\nsurface are formulated. The dispersion relation for the eigenmodes of an\ninfinitely long CNT is obtained and analyzed. It is shown that due to\nnonlocality, a new type of eigenmodes are created that disappear in the local\nconductivity limit. These eigenmodes should be properly accounted for in the\ncorrect formulation of the CNT end conditions for the surface current, which\nare manifested in the EM-field scattering problem. Additional boundary\nconditions that consider nonlocality effects are also formulated based on the\nexact solution obtained for the surface current by means of using the\nWiener-Hopf (WH) technique for a semi-infinite CNT. The scattering pattern of\nthe EM-field is simulated by a finite-length model of a CNT, using a\nnumerically solved integral equation for the surface current density and its\napproximate analytical solution. Thus, the scattering field of a CNT prevailing\nin the wide frequency range from THz to infrared light is analytically solved\nand analyzed.

The analysis leads to insights into wavelength-to-inch resonance within a finite-length CNT and suggests potential applications at THz/near-infrared frequencies, as well as implications for nanoantenna design. The findings may pave the way for designing electronic devices such as highly sensitive optical forces meters and ultrafast molecular switches.", "motivation": "Carbon nanotubes are a hot topic in material science and optics, with potential applications in quantum computing, electronics, and photonics.

These are distinct from their local counterparts and could result in systematic errors in previously used CNT end boundary conditions. Additionally, the study provides a formulation for considering nonlocal effects in the boundary conditions suitable for Wiener-Hopf solutions. The scattering in near field due to finite length is also considered, and two different approaches\u2014computing with exact integral equations and by Wiener-Hopf approximations\u2014are presented. The W.H. solution coincides with the direct numerics, which is a considerable result. The scattering pattern is computed in the THz and near-infrared frequency ranges, showing standing waves responsible for the wavelength-to-inch resonance. An analytical approximation is also found, making the results broadly applicable in materials science and optoelectronics.", "conclusion": "The paper is a solid combining of solid-state CNT theory with wave-mechanics to achieve a novel theoretical perspective on CNT's effective boundary conditions and their electromagnetic response. It offers a pathway for accurately predicting and eventually designing CNT-based nanodevices. While the theoretical framework can be advanced, this seems sufficiently strong for addressing contemporary needs in nanoscience."}}

Molecular Dynamical\ncalculation of 8-oxoguanine located in B-DNA provide an average C1' backbone\nspacing of 1.1 nm compared to adenine-thymine spacing of 1.05 nm but remains\nwithin the error margin, however when in the polymerase environment,\n8-oxoguanine and the canonical adenine - thymine spacing match at 1.11-1.12nm\nspacing while 8-oxoguanine is located on the template strand, but is disrupted\nby tyrosine 251 while situated on the triphosphate strand. We observe that\n8-oxoguanine, when paired with adenine in polymerase {\\lambda}, can mimic the\nadenine-thymine structure, as predicted in experimental results, and thus would\nbe misincorporated, but is strongly dependent on its conformation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728DNA\u805a\u5408\u9176\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c8-\u6c27\u57fa\u9e1f\u560c\u5464\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u817a\u560c\u5464\u901a\u8fc7\u6c22\u952e\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e0e\u80f8\u817a\u5627\u5576\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a768-\u6c27\u57fa\u9e1f\u560c\u5464\u5728DNA\u805a\u5408\u9176\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0e\u817a\u560c\u5464\u914d\u5bf9\u65f6\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3DNA\u4fee\u590d\u673a\u5236\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u7387\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e868-\u6c27\u57fa\u9e1f\u560c\u5464\u4e0e\u817a\u560c\u5464\u548c\u80f8\u817a\u5627\u5576\u7684\u6c22\u952e\u914d\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728DNA\u805a\u5408\u9176\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u914d\u5bf9\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "8-\u6c27\u57fa\u9e1f\u560c\u5464\u4e0e\u817a\u560c\u5464\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u6bd4\u817a\u560c\u5464-\u80f8\u817a\u5627\u5576\u914d\u5bf9\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728DNA\u805a\u5408\u9176\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c8-\u6c27\u57fa\u9e1f\u560c\u5464\u4e0e\u817a\u560c\u5464\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u817a\u560c\u5464-\u80f8\u817a\u5627\u5576\u914d\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728 tryptophan 251 \u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u8bef\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u793a8-\u6c27\u57fa\u9e1f\u560c\u5464\u5728DNA\u805a\u5408\u9176\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

For each low-ionisation open d- and f-subshell atomic\nspecies, around $10^3$ fine structure level energies can be determined through\nyears of analysis of $10^4$ observable spectral lines.

Removing the\nperiodic potential and treating Coulomb interactions self-consistently at the\nHartree-Fock level, the resulting phase diagrams host a variety of crystalline\nstates, including anomalous Hall crystals, halo Wigner crystals in which\nlocalized electrons spontaneously acquire orbital angular momentum leading to\ndepleted electron occupation at the zone center, and a novel halo anomalous\nHall crystal that combines these properties with a finite Chern number. We\nidentify why these phases are energetically favorable through analytical and\nenergetic considerations. Our results provide insight into the interplay\nbetween crystallization and band geometry, while also offering a simple toy\nmodel amenable to numerical methods beyond mean-field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6676\u4f53\u76f8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u76f8\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u7531\u51e0\u4f55\u975e\u5e73\u51e1Band\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u6676\u683c\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5141\u8bb8\u8c03\u8282Berry\u66f2\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u603b\u901a\u91cf\u3002\u5728\u975e\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6781\u9650\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7C6\u5bf9\u79f0\u5468\u671f\u52bf\u7684\u5f15\u5165\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5355\u80fd\u5e26\u6295\u5f71\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e3a\u4eba\u77e5\u7684Chern\u6570\u901a\u7528\u516c\u5f0f\u3002\u5f53\u53bb\u9664\u5468\u671f\u52bf\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u81ea\u6d3dCoulomb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u5728Hartree-Fock\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u76f8\u56fe\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u6676\u683c\u6001\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f02\u5e38Hall\u6676\u683c\u3001\u5728\u533a\u5fc3\u7535\u5b50\u81ea\u52a8\u83b7\u5f97\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u5bfc\u81f4\u7535\u5b50\u5360\u636e\u7a7a\u7f3a\u7684halo Wigner\u6676\u683c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u8ff0\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6709\u9650Chern\u6570\u7684halo\u5f02\u5e38Hall\u6676\u683c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u4e3a\u4f55\u662f\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0a\u6709\u5229\u7684\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6676\u683c\u5316\u4e0e\u80fd\u5e26\u51e0\u4f55\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6613\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7b80\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u975e\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u6676\u683c\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u975e\u5e73\u51e1Bands\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5bfb\u627e\u591a\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u76f8\u53ca\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0b\uff0c\u662f\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8fde\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Chern\u6570\u548c\u6676\u683c\u6001\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Hartree-Fock\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408 Analytical \u548c energetic \u8003\u8651\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5728\u975e\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0cC6\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u5468\u671f\u52bf\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u76f8\u56fe\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f31\u52bf\u6781\u9650\u5f97\u5230\u4e86Chern\u6570\u7684\u901a\u7528\u516c\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Hartree-Fock\u81ea\u6d3d\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38Hall\u6676\u683c\u3001halo Wigner\u6676\u683c\u548chalo\u5f02\u5e38Hall\u6676\u683c\u7b49\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u4e3a\u4f55\u6709\u5229\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u591a\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u6676\u683c\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6613\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u6676\u683c\u5316\u4e0e\u80fd\u5e26\u51e0\u4f55\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

They serve as\npromising candidates for exploring the nature of strong gravity and potential\nextensions of GR by providing testing grounds to understand how quantum\ncorrections might manifest in astrophysical black holes. In the present work,\nwe investigate the regular BH scenario described by the Simpson-Visser (SV)\nspacetime and explore its imprints on the high-frequency quasi-periodic\noscillations (HFQPOs) observed in the black hole power spectrum. The\nSimpson-Visser spacetime represent the simplest, globally regular extensions of\nthe Schwarzschild scenario, through the presence of a regularizing parameter.\nWe explore the imprints of the regularizing parameter on the orbital and\nepicyclic frequencies associated with the motion of test particles in the\nrotating SV spacetime. Models aimed to explain the observed HFQPOs often invoke\nthese fundamental frequencies and hence can potentially constrain the\nregularizing parameter from the available HFQPO data.

Based on the present data, we report that the observationally\nfavored models cannot discriminate between the Kerr and the Simpson-Visser\nscenario.

Focusing on the Simpson-Visser (SV) spacetime, which is a regular black hole solution, this paper investigates how specific parameters in the spacetime affect high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in black hole power spectra. By analyzing HFQPO models and comparing their results with observations from multiple black hole sources, this study demonstrates that current data cannot reliably distinguish between the Kerr metric and the Simpson-Visser scenario, suggesting GR may still be valid for these phenomena.

Black holes provide unique labs for testing these ideas, especially since they host extreme gravitational fields where quantum effects may become significant.

The method also involves statistical model comparison techniques to assess the goodness of fit and to evaluate which models best accommodate the observed HFQPO data.", "result": "The study reveals that the observed HFQPO data from black hole sources do not conclusively support any single model for explaining the HFQPO signatures. Specifically, the data cannot differentiate between the predictions of the Kerr black hole metric and the Simpson-Visser regular black hole scenario. This suggests that either more precise measurements or improved theoretical models are needed to resolve the ambiguity. Furthermore, the results highlight significant discrepancies between independently measured spin parameters from various sources, indicating a possible deviation from GR in the strong gravity regime near black holes. The findings emphasize the importance of continued research into both high-energy astrophysics and quantum gravity to better understand these enigmatic objects.", "conclusion": "The primary conclusion of this research is that existing HFQPO data from black hole sources do not provide sufficient evidence to rule out or confirm any particular model within the current understanding of regular black holes and their relation to GR. In particular, the data fail to distinguish between the Kerr metric and the Simpson-Visser scenario, a finding that has significant implications for future studies in this field. The study underscores the need for further high-precision observational data, as well as the development of more sophisticated theoretical models, to disentangle the nature of quantum gravity effects near black holes and to resolve the discrepancies in spin parameter measurements that currently obscure the full picture."}}

Conventional mechanisms such as thermo-optic, free-carrier, or\nmechanical tuning are usually volatile and require continuous power, limiting\ntheir suitability for low-frequency and low power-consumption programmable\noperations. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an electrically reconfigurable\nbeam splitter based on the low-loss phase-change material Sb2Se3, enabling\nmulti-level and arbitrary splitting-ratio (SR) control. By locally triggering\nphase transitions in the coupling region with integrated micro-electrodes, we\nexploit the high refractive-index contrast between different phases and\nnegligible absorption in the near-infrared wavelength of Sb2Se3 to precisely\ntune the coupling strength with non-volatile retention. 8-level of power\nsplitting states is achieved within a compact footprint of ~14.5-{\\mu}m in the\nexperiments, with insertion loss is ~1 dB across 1515-1550 nm and near-zero\nstatic power.

Our analysis reveals that such\npatterns form naturally when the magnetoelastic interaction is sufficiently\nstrong, while the coupling between flexural phonons and the substrate is\nsufficiently weak.

We present an efficient tensor-network approach to compute\ndispersion relations via imaginary-time evolution within the infinite projected\nentangled-pair states (iPEPS) framework. Benchmarking on the transverse-field\nIsing model, the method successfully captures dispersion relations in both\nparamagnetic and ferromagnetic phases for two- and three-dimensional lattices,\nachieving strong agreement with series expansion methods, where these are\napplicable.

The model incorporates the effects of quadrupole splitting and Overhauser fields, taking into account the position-dependent anisotropy of hyperfine interactions in the cubic crystal structure.

(3) Quadrupole splitting is absent for lead spins but plays a critical role in halogen spins, significantly affecting their dynamic polarization. (4) Overhauser fields of dynamically polarized nuclei are calculated and found to maintain the magnetization of lead nuclei even without an external magnetic field. (5) The dynamic polarization of halogen spins generates magnetic fields that sustain the magnetization of lead nuclei. (6) Experimental results corroborate the theoretical model, revealing a nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time of approximately 10 seconds. These findings highlight the unexpected strength of nuclear spin polarization in lead nuclei and provide insights into the interplay between electronic spin states and nuclear spin dynamics in perovskite materials.", "conclusion": "The research conclusively demonstrates that optically-oriented charge carriers in lead halide perovskites induce substantial dynamic polarization of nuclear spins, with lead nuclei exhibiting notably enhanced magnetic properties compared to isolated electrons and holes. The theoretical framework successfully explains the experimental observations, underscoring the importance of considering hyperfine interactions and Overhauser effects in understanding spin dynamics in such materials. This work opens new avenues for exploring spin-based phenomena in perovskite semiconductors and has implications for the development of advanced spintronic and quantum devices."}}

The compiler accepts a high-level quantum circuit, a\nchosen error detection code, and a target hardware topology and then produces\nan optimized and executable circuit. It can also automatically select an\nappropriate detection code for the user based on circuit structure and resource\nestimates. QuantEM currently supports Pauli check sandwiching and Iceberg codes\nand is designed to support future QED schemes and hardware targets. By\nautomating the complex QED compilation flow, this work reduces developer\nburden, enables fast code exploration, and ensures consistent and correct\napplication of detection logic across architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Using\natomistic simulation methods based on tight-binding electronic states and\nself-consistent mean-field optical response, we reveal that a moderate\nelectrical bias can significantly break reciprocity for propagation of guided\nplasmon modes in GNRs and CNTs exhibiting electronic band gaps. The excitation\nby a nearby point dipole emitter and subsequent propagation of guided plasmon\nmodes can thus be actively controlled by the applied current, which can further\nbe leveraged to mediate nonlocal interactions of multiple emitters.

The\ndimension of the swarm, the number of iterations of the algorithm, and the\nnumber of trainable parameters can be set. In this study, PSO has been used to\ntrain the entire structure of VQCs, allowing it to select which quantum gates\nto apply, the target qubits, and the rotation angle, in case a rotation is\nchosen. The algorithm is restricted to choosing from four types of gates: Rx,\nRy, Rz, and CNOT. The proposed optimization approach has been tested on various\ndatasets of the MedMNIST, which is a collection of biomedical image datasets\ndesigned for image classification tasks. Performance has been compared with the\nresults achieved by classical stochastic gradient descent applied to a\npredefined VQC. The results show that the PSO can achieve comparable or even\nbetter classification accuracy across multiple datasets, despite the PSO using\na lower number of quantum gates than the VQC used with gradient descent\noptimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, due to the\nunavoidable dark counts in single-photon detectors (SPDs), it has long been\nconstrained by the rapid increase of the quantum bit error rate (QBER) induced\nby empty signals at the receiver, which prevents it from extending to\narbitrarily long distances. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an\nempty-signal detection (ESD) strategy for quantum communication receivers,\nwhich integrates state preparation, controlled gates, and multi-copy analysis\ninto a single block. The core idea is to encode photon-existence information\nonto an auxiliary degree of freedom (DOF) that is independent of the\nmessage-encoding DOF, allowing the receiver, through controlled gates on the\nauxiliary DOFs and subsequent measurements on the auxiliary copies, to verify\nthe non-emptiness of the received signal without disturbing the transmitted\nmessage. In this way, empty signals can be excluded from further communication\nprocessing, thereby resolving the QBER explosion problem caused by empty\nsignals. Moreover, the proposed design relies solely on practical, even\ncommercially available, devices, and can be realized under current\ntechnological conditions. Therefore, this study provides a framework for\nachieving arbitrarily long-distance quantum communication by allowing a lossy\nchannel to be asymptotically regarded as lossless in QBER estimations, and\noffers a proof-of-principle demonstration that secure quantum communications\ncan be extended to arbitrary distances under current technology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u5ea6\u6570-of-freedom\uff08DOF\uff09\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6392\u9664\u7a7a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u514b\u670d\u56e0\u7a7a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08QBER\uff09\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\uff08QKD\uff09\uff0c\u5df2\u957f\u671f\u53d7\u5230\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff08SPDs\uff09\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u6697\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6697\u8ba1\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u56e0\u7a7a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u6025\u5267\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\uff08ESD\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 informations\u6574\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u53d7\u63a7\u95e8\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u4efd\u5206\u6790\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u5757\u5185\u3002\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u5c06\u5149\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9DOF\uff0c\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u7684DOF\u72ec\u7acb\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8f85\u52a9DOF\u53d7\u63a7\u95e8\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u540e\u7eed\u6d4b\u91cf\u8f85\u52a9\u526f\u672c\uff0c\u4fbf\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0d\u5e72\u6270\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u7a7a\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u3001\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728QBER\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5c06\u6709\u635f\u4fe1\u9053\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5730\u770b\u4f5c\u65e0\u635f\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8f85\u52a9DOF\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6392\u9664\u7a7a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We argue that fuzzy metrics are unnecessary for\nmodeling such uncertainty: instead, the well-established structure of complex\nHilbert spaces - the foundational language of quantum mechanics for over a\ncentury - provides a natural, rigorous, and non-contradictory metric space\nwhere the ``points'' are quantum states themselves. The distance between states\nis given by the Hilbert norm, which directly encodes state distinguishability\nvia the Born rule. This framework inherently captures the non-classical nature\nof uncertainty without requiring fuzzy logic, t-norms, or membership degrees.\nWe demonstrate its power by modeling AI concepts as Gaussian wavefunctions and\nclassifying ambiguous inputs via quantum overlap integrals. Unlike fuzzy\nmethods, our approach naturally handles interference, distributional shape, and\nconcept compositionality through the geometry of state vectors.

The framework encodes states,\nactions, rewards, and transitions entirely within the quantum domain, enabling\nparallel exploration of state-action sequences through superposition and\neliminating classical subroutines. Dynamic circuit operations, including\nmid-circuit measurement and reset, allow reuse of the same physical qubits\nacross multiple agent-environment interactions, reducing qubit requirements\nfrom 7*T to 7 for T time steps while preserving logical continuity. Quantum\narithmetic computes trajectory returns, and Grover's search is applied to the\nsuperposition of these evaluated trajectories to amplify the probability of\nmeasuring those with the highest return, thereby accelerating the\nidentification of the optimal policy. Simulations demonstrate that the\ndynamic-circuit-based implementation preserves trajectory fidelity while\nreducing qubit usage by 66 percent relative to the static design. Experimental\ndeployment on IBM Heron-class quantum hardware confirms that the framework\noperates within the constraints of current quantum processors and validates the\nfeasibility of fully quantum multi-step reinforcement learning under noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum conditions.
