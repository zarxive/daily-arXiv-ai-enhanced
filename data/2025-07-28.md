Abstract: During brittle crack propagation, a smooth crack front curve frequently
becomes disjoint, generating a stepped crack and a material ligament that
unites the newly formed crack fronts. These universal features fundamentally
alter the singular field structure and stability of propagating cracks;
however, a quantitative analysis of their mechanics is lacking. Here, we
perform in-situ 3D measurements to resolve the deformation field around stepped
cracks, and crucially, within the ligament feature. The 3D kinematic data are
obtained by scanning a thin laser sheet through the brittle hydrogel samples,
while recording the scattered intensity from the embedded tracer particles. We
find that the ligament concentrates the strain energy density, and moreover,
the apparent fracture energy increases proportionally to the strain energy
within the ligament.

### [2] [Non-singular bouncing cosmology in $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ gravity with energy condition violations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18670)

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究利用f(T, T)引力模型中的特定 bounce 情景，发现通过满足 NEC 条件，系统可以实现非奇性的 bounce 哪怕是通过在 bounce 周期点压力为零。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索 f(T, T) 引力模型在 bounce 情景下是否可能实现非奇性的宇宙演化，尤其是在满足能量条件的情况下。

Method: 通过建立 f(T, T) 模型方程并使用给定的标度因子，分析了两种模型的运动学行为和能量条件。观察到 bounce 周期点满足 H=0，且在 bounce 前和后的压力行为。

Result: 在两种模型中， bounce 前后经历了压力和方程状态参数的显著变化，特别是需要 NEC 违olation才能获得进入phantom区域的方程状态。

Conclusion: 只有满足 NEC 违olation，系统才能实现非奇性 bounce 景观，这为解决宇宙早期奇异性问题提供了一种可能。

Abstract: The singularity and inflationary problems have posed significant challenges
for understanding the universe's origin and evolution. Bouncing cosmology has
emerged as a promising alternative to standard cosmological models, offering a
non-singular approach to early universe dynamics by facilitating a "bounce"
rather than a singular beginning. In this study, we explore the feasibility of
modeling specific bouncing scenarios within the framework of $ f(T,
\mathcal{T}) $ gravity, allowing for a comprehensive coupling between the
torsion scalar $T$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $\mathcal{T}$.
We analyze two $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ models: a linear model $f(T, \mathcal{T}) =
\alpha T + \beta \mathcal{T}$ and a non-linear model $f(T, \mathcal{T}) =
\alpha \sqrt{-T} + \beta \mathcal{T}$, with a parameterized scale factor $a(t)
= \sqrt{a_0^2 + \gamma^2 t^2}$ to capture the bounce behavior. The analysis
confirms a cosmic bounce at $t = 0 $, where the Hubble parameter $H = 0$
signals a transition from contraction to expansion. A crucial condition for
achieving the bounce is the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) near
the bounce, enabling the equation of state (EoS) parameter to enter the phantom
region ($\omega < -1$). Both models exhibit an increase in energy density as
the universe approaches the bounce, peaking at the bounce epoch and then
decreasing post-bounce. Pressure remains negative throughout, with the EoS
parameter crossing into the phantom region near the bounce in both positive and
negative time zones. Our findings show that NEC and strong energy condition
(SEC) violations are essential for the non-singular bounce, while the dominant
energy condition (DEC) is satisfied, ensuring a consistent matter
distribution...

### [3] [Doubly Separable Spacetimes and Symmetry Constraints on their Self-Gravitating Matter Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18706)

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Error

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A popular approach to constructing exact stationary and axisymmetric
nonvacuum solutions in general relativity has been to use solution-generating
techniques. Here we revisit a recent variant of the Newman-Janis-Azreg-Ainou
algorithm, restricted to asymptotically-flat spacetimes, and demonstrate that
this method exclusively generates Konoplya-Stuchlik-Zhidenko spacetimes.
Therefore, the equations for geodesic motion and scalar-wave propagation are
both separable. We call these "doubly separable" spacetimes. We identify a
subclass of the spacetimes that might admit a separable Dirac equation by
explicitly obtaining the Killing-Yano tensor. The high degree of symmetry in
these spacetimes suggests that the self-gravitating matter must also be in
specialized field configurations. For this reason, we investigate whether these
spacetimes can even be sourced by arbitrary types of matter. We show that
doubly separable spacetimes cannot be sourced by massless real scalar fields or
perfect fluids, and that electromagnetic fields lead only to the Kerr-Newman
family. Notably, this rules out the elusive spinning counterpart of the
Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity spacetime, which contains a scalar
field, as a member of this metric class. While the algorithm generates
spacetimes with rich symmetry structures, valuable for studying phenomena like
black hole shadows and quasinormal modes, our results highlight the need for
caution when using it to construct physically consistent solutions with
prespecified matter content.

Result: 量子几何离散性（面积量子化）显著影响了黑洞视角下的 decoherence 效应，甚至可能完全消除这些效应，尤其是在 Planck 面积量级或更大的时候。

Conclusion: 这一发现为理解黑洞蒸发过程中的量子力学行为提供了新的理论框架，并增强了量子几何离散性在黑洞热力学中的重要性。这也提出了未来研究中需要更详细的分析这些效应及其对量子效果定律的潜在影响。

Abstract: There is mounting theoretical evidence that black hole horizons induce
decoherence on a quantum system, say a particle, put in a superposition of
locations, with the decoherence functional, evaluated after closure of the
superposition, increasing linearly with the time the superposition has been
kept open. This phenomenon has been shown to owe its existence to soft modes,
that is modes with very low frequencies, of the quantum fields -- sourced by
the particle -- which pierce through the horizon, or also can be understood as
coming from the interaction with the black hole described as a thermodynamic
quantum system at Hawking's temperature. Here we investigate the effects of
ensuing quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the horizon, in an effective
perspective in which the quantum geometry of the horizon is captured by
existence of a limit length or by horizon area quantisation. We show that the
discreteness of the energy levels associated to the different geometric
configurations might have strong impact on the results, in particular reducing
the decoherence effects even to a negligible level in case of quanta of area
$A_0 = \mathcal{O}(1) \, \, l_p^2$ or larger, with $l_p$ the Planck length.

### [5] [White dwarf structure in $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity: beyond the Chandrasekhar mass limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18745)
*Edson Otoniel,Juan M. Z. Pretel,Clésio E. Mota,César O. V. Flores,Victor B. T. Alves*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过引入非极小耦合项，修改后的爱因斯坦引力理论在高温下允许白矮星超过经典钱德拉塞卡限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在不同引力理论下白矮星的极限性质，为解释超大质量白矮星提供理论依据。

Result: 发现，随着α的变化，白矮星的最大质量有显著增加或减少的趋势，甚至在某些情况下无法形成传统意义上的极限点。

Conclusion: 该理论框架在高温下可能能够解释超过钱德拉塞卡极限的白矮星现象。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relativistic structure of white dwarfs (WDs)
within the framework of modified gravity theory $f(R, T, L_m) = R + \alpha T
L_m$, which introduces a non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature.
Using a realistic equation of state (EoS) that includes contributions from a
relativistic degenerate electron gas and ionic lattice effects, we solve the
modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations for two standard choices of
the matter Lagrangian density: $L_m = p$ and $L_m = -\rho$. We show that the
extra $\alpha TL_m$ term significantly alters the mass-radius relation of WDs,
especially at high central densities $( \rho_c \gtrsim 10^8 - 10^9\,\rm
g/cm^3)$, allowing for stable super-Chandrasekhar configurations. In
particular, depending on the sign and magnitude of the parameter $\alpha$, the
maximum mass can increase or decrease, and in some regimes, the usual critical
point indicating the transition from stability to instability disappears. Our
findings suggest that $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity provides a viable framework to
explain the existence of massive WDs beyond the classical Chandrasekhar limit.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了带有负压力的流体对施瓦zschild黑洞影子影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究 wanting to explore the effects of exotic fluids on black hole properties, particularly the shadow

Result: 发现带有负压力的流体显著影响了影子的形状和亮度

Conclusion: 表明这种流体可以用来研究暗能量效应及其对黑洞视界的影响

Abstract: We here investigate the consequences of an exotic fluid, exhibiting negative
radial and tangential pressures, \emph{de facto} violating the Zel'dovich
limit, on a regular solution that easily generalizes the Schwarzschild black
hole. More precisely, we focus on the regular Fan-Wang spacetime, computing how
the black hole shadow images, surrounded by the quoted fluid, is modified
through the presence of \emph{negative} equations of state for the two pressure
components. Even though quite different from quintessence, we consider constant
radial and tangential equations of state with the aim of emulating, but not
reproducing, dark energy effects. Moreover, we explore the main properties of
infalling spherical accretion flows and, accordingly, the influence of the
equations of state on the horizons, photosphere, and impact parameter of the
Fan-Wang black hole. Afterwards, we examine the luminosities of the shadow and
the photon ring in two distinct spherically accretion flows, as well as the
observed specific intensity of the shadow itself. Last but not least, we
physically interpret the impact of negative pressures on our findings and
discuss possible extensions to the isotropic case.

Abstract: Starobinsky gravity, as one of the simplest and best-behaved higher-curvature
gravity theories, has been extensively studied in the context of neutron stars
over the past few decades. In this work, we investigate the adiabatic radial
oscillation stability of neutron stars within the framework of Starobinsky
gravity. We find that gravitational modifications can significantly impact
stellar stability. Specifically, the higher-derivative nature of the theory
causes the exterior spacetime to dynamically respond to fluid oscillations, in
contrast to general relativity where Birkhoff's theorem ensures a static
exterior. For stellar models with low central densities, the fundamental
frequency becomes nearly independent of the central density when the coupling
constant is large. For stellar models with high central densities, the
transition from stability to instability still approximately occurs near the
maximum-mass configuration, similar to the case in general relativity. Our main
analysis is conducted in the Jordan frame of the scalar-tensor gravity
equivalent to Starobinsky gravity, and we explicitly verify consistency with
results obtained in the Einstein frame. We further extend our study to a class
of Gauss-Bonnet extensions of Starobinsky gravity.

### [8] [Relativistic scalar dark matter drag forces on a black hole binary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18934)
*Shuo Xin,Elias R. Most*

Result: 双黑洞的引力相互作用导致复杂的非线性效应，影响它们的运动轨迹，可能改变引力波信号相位。

Conclusion: 双黑洞引力波信号可能存在失相现象，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Dark matter around black holes can induce drag forces through dynamical
friction and accretion, potentially affecting the orbital evolution and
gravitational wave emission of binary systems. While dynamical friction from
scalar field dark matter has been studied in the relativistic regime for single
black holes, the case of a binary black hole (BBH) has remained unexplored. As
a first step, we present a series of two-dimensional general-relativistic
simulations of BBH in a wind tunnel for an asymptotically homogeneous scalar
field background. We extract the drag forces, torque, mass and charge accretion
acting on the binary, and analyze their dependence on the binary separation,
velocity and the scalar field parameters. We find that the binary's drag is not
a simple superposition of two isolated black holes; the presence of a companion
modifies the gravitational wake and yields significant nonlinearities. This
additional force and torque can (in principle) modify the inspiral and induce a
dephasing of the gravitational wave signal.

Precisely, we extend our investigations beyond the Einstein's gravity to
explore the Natural inflation model via the term $F(\phi)T$. We compute the
inflation dynamics to derive the slow-roll parameters, i.e., the
tensor-to-scalar ratio ``$r$'' and the scalar spectral index ``$n_s$''. This
modified form of the gravity yields not only the predictions of the original
models but also better-fitting with the Planck/BICEP/Keck data.

### [10] [Kalb-Ramond Black Holes Sourced by ModMax Electrodynamics: Some Perturbative Properties in the Phantom Sector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19088)
*Y. Sekhmani,A. Baruah,S. K. Maurya,J. Rayimbaev,M. Altanji,I. Ibragimov,S. Muminov*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study proposes a new class of black hole solutions with Lorentz-violating gravity and ModMax electrodynamics, exploring how parameters like electric charge, Lorentz violation, and coupling affect the black hole's properties and QNMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to enhance our understanding of black hole behavior in modified theories of gravity, particularly those with Lorentz symmetry violation, which could have implications for fundamental physics and cosmology.

Method: The authors analyze spacetime solutions, calculate quasinormal modes, greybody factors, and Hawking radiation properties using analytical and numerical methods.

Result: The results show that increasing the Lorentz violation parameter (ℓ) and ModMax parameter (γ) leads to higher quasinormal mode frequencies and faster damping, especially in the phantom sector. The Hawking radiation becomes sparser as ℓ increases.

Conclusion: The study contributes to the understanding of nonminimally coupled electrodynamics and Lorentz-violating gravity, offering insights into the stability and properties of these black hole solutions under varying parameters.

Abstract: We formulate and analyze a new class of electrically charged black hole (BH)
solutions in Lorentz-violating gravity, where nonlinear ModMax electrodynamics
is nonminimally coupled to a Kalb-Ramond (KR) two-form field. The spontaneous
breaking of local Lorentz symmetry is triggered by a nonzero vacuum expectation
value of the KR field, characterized by a small dimensionless parameter $\ell$.
To incorporate both standard and phantom sectors, we introduce a discrete
sign-flip parameter $\zeta = \pm1$, which flips the gauge-kinetic terms in the
phantom ($\zeta = -1$) branch. Assuming a vanishing cosmological constant and a
self-interacting potential with minimum $V' = 0$, we obtain exact analytical
solutions for the metric function and electric potential. The resulting
spacetime interpolates between Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, and ModMax
BHs, with curvature scalars showing deviations controlled by $(\ell, \gamma,
\zeta)$. We study scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations
using both frequency-domain (Pade-averaged WKB) and time-domain
(Gundlach-Price-Pullin plus Prony) methods. We find that increasing either
$\ell$ or the ModMax parameter $\gamma$ enhances the real and imaginary parts
of QNMs, indicating higher oscillation frequencies and faster damping,
especially in the phantom sector. The effective potentials deepen under phantom
deformation, supporting more tightly bound modes. Furthermore, we analyze the
greybody factors and compute the sparsity $\eta$ of Hawking radiation, which
quantifies the nonthermal character of particle emission. We show that $\eta$
is significantly affected by $\ell$, decreasing with increasing Lorentz
violation and asymptotically approaching a scaled version of the Schwarzschild
value.

Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of noncommutative
geometry-inspired dirty black holes, focusing on both non-extremal and extremal
configurations. These gravitational objects, characterized by smeared energy
distributions within a modified de Sitter-like equation of state, modify the
classical Schwarzschild metric and regularize central singularities. We employ
a spectral method based on Chebyshev polynomials to solve the eigenvalue
problem for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations. Our
results reveal new overdamped modes indicative of rapid decay without
oscillation, particularly prominent in near-extremal and extremal regimes.
Additionally, we establish that the QNMs converge to classical Schwarzschild
values for large mass parameters, validating our method's robustness. Our
findings highlight the impact of dirtiness and noncommutative effects on black
hole QNM spectra, offering potential observational signatures for
distinguishing these objects in gravitational-wave detections.

Abstract: We investigate a static traversable wormhole sustained by a combination of a
minimally coupled scalar field and an electric field, with exotic matter
sourced by Casimir energy. Considering two scenarios, where the Casimir plate
separation is either radially variable or fixed, we derive analytical
near-throat solutions for both massless and massive scalar fields. To ensure
consistency of the field equations, a thermal tensor is also incorporated,
consisting solely of pressure terms that vanish at the throat. In all cases, we
obtain well-behaved wormhole manifolds with throat sizes that scale
proportionally with the number of elementary charges the wormhole can support.

TL;DR:  paper introduces MATDIR, an enhanced time delay interferometry (TDI) method for improving LISA's light travel time (LTT) estimation precision and resilience, especially in challenging scenarios like PRN failures. Through modulation of laser phase, MATDIR significantly boosts signal-to-noise ratio and mitigates GW interference, enabling more reliable LTT estimates with shorter integration times compared to the baseline PRN method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  LISA is a key mission in gravitational wave astronomy, and improving its operational strategies for better sensitivity and noise reduction is crucial for detecting faint GW signals.

Method:  paper proposes MATDIR, which uses phase modulation to enhance TDI's effectiveness. The method involves modulating laser phase near 1Hz to improve SNR and reduce impact of GW and instrument noise. It also incorporates theoretical frameworks and numerical simulations to validate the improvements over existing PRN-based methods.

Result:  MATDIR achieves LTT precision comparable to the PRN baseline, with reduced integration times and enhanced robustness against failure scenarios.

Conclusion:  The introduction of MATDIR marks a significant advancement in LISA's operational capabilities, offering an improved approach for LTT estimation that is more efficient and resilient compared to traditional methods. This advancement is expected to boost LISA's sensitivity and success in gravitational wave detection.

Abstract: Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA represents the next frontier in
gravitationalwave GW astronomy targeting the detection of millihertz
gravitational signals Central to LISAs operation is the nanosecondprecision
estimation of the light travel times LTTs between its constituent spacecraft
Precise LTT estimates are critical for suppressing dominant laser noise with
timedelay interferometry TDI and ensuring the required sensitivity to GW
signals The baseline method is to modulate a pseudorandom noise PRN code on the
laser beams exchanged between the spacecraft Timedelay interferometric ranging
TDIR was proposed as a simpler alternative LTT estimation method TDIR LTT
estimates are chosen to minimize the TDI residual noise over the full LISA
frequency band TDIR can be used in case of PRN failure or to calibrate the
biases of the PRN method In this study we introduce modulationassisted TDIR
MATDIR an enhanced variant of TDIR that significantly improves LTT estimation
precision and resilience MATDIR achieves this by modulating the laser phase at
specific frequencies close to 1Hz thereby artificially elevating the laser
phase content relative to secondary unsuppressed noises This modulation
strategy not only enhances the signaltonoise ratio for TDIR but also mitigates
the impact of GW signals and instrumental artifacts enabling more reliable LTT
estimates with reduced integration times We develop the theoretical framework
of MATDIR incorporating the full constellation of three spacecraft laser
locking and multiple Michelson TDI combinations Analytical predictions
confirmed by numerical simulations indicate that MATDIR can achieve LTT
estimates comparable to the 1mrms at fs 4 Hz of the PRNbased baseline method We
therefore suggest that the possibility to modulate lasers is added to the laser
system requirements of LISA

*Nikola Herceg,Nikola Konjik,A. Naveena Kumara,Andjelo Samsarov*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores the impact of noncommutative spacetime on Dirac quasinormal modes in a modified Reissner-Nordström black hole spacetime using a noncommutative gravity-fermion effective model. The results indicate that the oscillation frequencies and damping times of the Dirac quasinormal modes change significantly, mimicking a Zeeman-like splitting effect.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate how noncommutative spacetime affects the properties of quasinormal modes in a modified black hole geometry, potentially offering new insights into quantum gravity mechanisms by altering the dynamics of fermions near the event horizon.

Method: The authors use a mathematical approach involving the effective model of noncommutative gravity coupled to fermions. They derive the perturbation equations for the Dirac field in this setup, solve them numerically, and compare the results with the commutative case to observe the differences in oscillation frequencies and damping times.

Result: The analysis shows significant changes in the quasinormal modes' behavior due to noncommutative spacetime, including frequency shifts and enhanced damping times, with features akin to Zeeman splitting. These results imply that noncommutative effects could play a role in quantum gravity phenomena by modifying black hole dynamics.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that spacetime noncommutativity introduces notable effects on Dirac quasinormal modes, offering a promising avenue for studying quantum gravity by examining modified black hole geometries and their implications for fermionic behavior near singularities.

Abstract: Noncommutative (NC) geometry may open an alternative route to quantum
gravity. We study the influence of the spacetime noncommutativity on the Dirac
quasinormal modes in the modified Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole spacetime.
The framework for the latter study is provided by a certain effective model of
gravity coupled to fermions which in itself encapsulates noncommutative
deformation. This model describes a classical Dirac field coupled to a modified
Reissner-Nordstr\"om geometry where the corresponding metric acquires an
additional nonvanishing $r-\varphi $ component. As the earlier study shows,
this model appears to be equivalent to a model of semiclassical NC gauge theory
in which a NC gauge field is being coupled to a NC fermion field on the one
side and the classical Reissner-Nordstr\"om background on the other. In
comparison to the undeformed model where the Dirac field is coupled to the
commutative Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, the numerical results show that
the oscillation frequencies and magnitude of damping of the Dirac quasinormal
modes change to an extent that cannot be neglected. In fact, the influence of
spacetime noncommutativity is shown to produce features reminiscent of a
Zeeman-like splitting in the effective potential and quasinormal-mode spectrum.

Abstract: We provide a general algorithm to construct a Hamiltonian, such that its
dynamical flow covariantly defines any given spherically symmetric and static
metric. This Hamiltonian is defined as a linear combination of the standard
(general relativistic) radial diffeomorphism constraint plus a Hamiltonian
constraint that is appropriately deformed as compared to its corresponding form
in general relativity though it does not include higher-derivative terms.
Therefore, given a static model of spherical gravity, it is possible to obtain
its Hamiltonian, and, thus, its canonical (second-order) equations of motion. A
particularly relevant application of this construction is the study of regular
black holes, where proposed geometries often lack an underlying dynamical
theory. The present method provides such a theory. In particular, for a wide
class of deformations of the Schwarzschild geometry, we explicitly obtain their
corresponding Hamiltonian. This construction can be further used to covariantly
couple matter. In this way, one can analyze the backreaction of matter fields
on the geometry of interest, and, specifically, whether a particular black-hole
model may emerge as the end state of a dynamical collapse.

*Chao-Guang Huang,Shibei Kong*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses a detailed Hamiltonian analysis of general relativity in a Bondi-like coordinate system, breaking down the symmetry group and identifying constraints and degrees of freedom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The provided abstract is from a paper on advanced theoretical physics, specifically discussing the application of the Hamiltonian formulation to general relativity. The work likely aims to contribute to understanding gravitational dynamics in specific coordinates, possibly for applications in gravitational wave studies or quantum gravity.

Method: The paper uses the Hamiltonian formalism, decomposing spacetime symmetry groups, employing Dirac's constraint analysis, and applying the Palatini action to derive constraints and degrees of freedom in a Bondi-like coordinate system.

Result: The analysis reveals 2 scalar constraints, 1 vector constraint, and determines the local physical degrees of freedom as 2, with integrability conditions provided for Lagrange multipliers and equations of motion.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a Hamiltonian approach to 4D spacetime in Bondi-like coordinates, identifying key constraints and degrees of freedom, with the formulation potentially useful for theoretical studies such as gravitational wave dynamics or quantum gravity theories.

Abstract: We discuss the Hamiltonian formulation of gravity in 4-dimensional spacetime
under Bondi-like coordinates{v, r, x^a, a=2, 3}. In Bondi-like coordinates, the
3-dimensional hypersurface is a null hypersurface and the evolution direction
is the advanced time v. The internal symmetry group SO(1,3) of the
4-dimensional spacetime is decomposed into SO(1,1), SO(2), and T^\pm(2), whose
Lie algebra so(1,3) is decomposed into so(1,1), so(2), t^\pm(2)
correspondingly. The SO(1,1) symmetry is very obvious in this kind of
decomposition, which is very useful in so(1,1) BF theory. General relativity
can be reformulated as the 4-dimensional coframe (e^I_\mu) and connection
({\omega}^{IJ}_\mu) dynamics of gravity based on this kind of decomposition in
the Bondi-like coordinate system. The coframe consists of 2 null 1-forms e^-,
e^+ and 2 spacelike 1-forms e^2, e^3. The Palatini action is used. The
Hamiltonian analysis is conducted by the Dirac's methods. The consistency
analysis of constraints has been done completely. There are 2 scalar
constraints and one 2-dimensional vector constraint. The torsion-free
conditions are acquired from the consistency conditions of the primary
constraints about {\pi}^\mu_{IJ}. The consistency conditions of the primary
constraints {\pi}^0_{IJ}=0 can be reformulated as Gauss constraints. The
conditions of the Lagrange multipliers have been acquired. The Poisson brackets
among the constraints have been calculated. There are 46 constraints including
6 first class constraints {\pi}^0_{IJ}=0 and 40 second class constraints. The
local physical degrees of freedom is 2. The integrability conditions of
Lagrange multipliers n_0, l_0, and e^A_0 are Ricci identities. The equations of
motion of the canonical variables have also been shown.

Abstract: We study the properties of remnants formed in prompt-collapse binary neutron
star mergers. We consider non-spinning binaries over a range of total masses
and mass ratios across a set of 22 equations of state, totaling 107 numerical
relativity simulations. We report the final mass and spin of the systems
(including the accretion disk and ejecta) to be constrained in a narrow range,
regardless of the binary configuration and matter effects. This sets them apart
from binary black-hole merger remnants. We assess the detectability of the
postmerger signal in a future 40 km Cosmic Explorer observatory and find that
the signal-to-noise ratio in the postmerger of an optimally located and
oriented binary at a distance of 100 Mpc can range from ${<}1$ to 8, depending
on the binary configuration and equation of state, with a majority of them
greater than 4 in the set of simulations that we consider. We also consider the
distinguishability between prompt-collapse binary neutron star and binary black
hole mergers with the same masses and spins. We find that Cosmic Explorer will
be able to distinguish such systems primarily via the measurement of tidal
effects in the late inspiral. Neutron star binaries with \emph{reduced tidal
deformability} $\tilde\Lambda$ as small as ${\sim}3.5$ can be identified up to
a distance of 100 Mpc, while neutron star binaries with $\tilde\Lambda\sim22$
can be identified to distances greater than 250 Mpc. This is larger than the
distance up to which the postmerger will be visible. Finally, we discuss the
possible implications of our findings for the equation of state of neutron
stars from the gravitational-wave event GW230529.

### [18] [Connecting Early Dark Energy to Late Dark Energy by the Diluting Matter Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17095)
*Eduardo I. Guendelman,Ramon Herrera,Pedro Labrana*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper proposes a scale-invariant gravity theory with two scalar fields that leads to inflation, early dark energy, and late dark energy through a spontaneously broken scale symmetry. The model predicts H0 ~74 and Ωm ~0.3, which aligns with observations including CMB and BAO data, showing a 2.5σ improvement in fit to H0 tension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the Hubble tension discrepancy by introducing a novel gravity theory that dynamically transitions between different eras of the universe, each governed by distinct dark energy phases. By incorporating two scalar fields with a measure defined from degrees of freedom, the model allows for the potential to create flat regions corresponding to different epochs, enabling a natural transition from early to late dark energy with potential implications for resolving the H0 tension.

Method: The authors use a scale-invariant gravity theory with two scalar fields and a measure based on degrees of freedom. They integrate the degrees of freedom, leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking and an effective potential for dust particles. The potential has three flat regions corresponding to inflation, early dark energy, and late dark energy. They model the transition from early to late dark energy via tunneling and use Bayesian analysis on CMB, BAO, and H0 measurements to determine the best-fit parameters, finding an early dark energy fraction of ~30% at z'=5000.

Result: The model modifies the sound horizon before recombination, potentially resolving the Hubble tension, while maintaining late-time cosmological consistency. Bayesian analysis shows the model is viable, with best-fit parameters estimating H0 ~74, Ωm ~0.3, and 30% early dark energy at z'=5000, aligning with observations and improving the fit to the Hubble tension by ~2.5σ.

Conclusion: The paper presents a unified cosmological framework where the scale-invariant gravity theory explains the evolution of the early universe through different dark energy epochs, offering a coherent solution to the Hubble tension by adjusting the sound horizon before recombination. The model's predictions, validated by multiple observational datasets, provide a plausible explanation for the observed cosmic parameters and the Hubble tension.

Abstract: In this work we study a scale invariant gravity theory containing two scalar
fields, dust particles and a measure defined from degrees of freedom
independent of the metric. The integration of the degrees of freedom that
define the measure spontaneously break the scale symmetry, leaving us in the
Einstein frame with an effective potential that is dependent on the density of
the particles. The potential contains three flat regions, one for inflation,
another for early dark energy and the third for late dark energy. At a certain
point, as the matter dilutes, tunneling from the early dark energy to the late
dark energy can start efficiently. This mechanism naturally alleviated the
observed Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon prior to recombination
while preserving late-time cosmology. Moreover, the model predictions are
consistent with observations from the reduced CMB, BAO, and local measurement
of $H_0$, providing a coherent and unified description of the universe. In this
context, the Bayesian analysis of these datasets confirms the viability of our
scenario, with the best-fit parameters indicating an early dark energy fraction
of approximately 30$\%$ at a redshift of $z'=5000$.

Abstract: We construct an integrable hierarchy of the Boussinesq equation using the
Lie-algebraic approach of Holod-Flashka-Newell-Ratiu. We show that finite-gap
hamiltonian systems of the hierarchy arise on coadjoint orbits in the loop
algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(3)$, and possess spectral curves from the family of
$(3,3N\,{+}\,1)$-curves, $N\,{\in}\, \Natural$. Separation of variables leads
to the Jacobi inversion problem on the mentioned curves, which is solved in
terms of the corresponding multiply periodic functions. An exact finite-gap
solution of the Boussinesq equation is obtained explicitly, and a conjecture on
the reality conditions is made. The obtained solutions are computed for several
spectral curves, and illustrated graphically.

Abstract: We present a novel method for mapping in situ the spatial distribution of
photon momentum across a laser beam using a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) as a
moving probe. By displacing the BEC, we measure the photon recoil by atom
interferometry at different positions in the laser beam and thus reconstruct a
two-dimensional map of the local intensity and effective dispersion of the $k$
wave vector. Applied to a beam diffracted by a diaphragm, this method reveals a
local extra recoil effect, which exceeds the magnitude $h\nu/c$ of the
individual plane-waves over which the beam can be decomposed. This method
offers a new way to precisely characterize wavefront distortions and to
evaluate one of the major systematic bias sources in quantum sensors based on
atom interferometry.

Conclusion: 该成果为核钟构建铺平道路，具有量子 metrology和核量子光学的广泛应用前景。

Abstract: The exceptionally low-energy isomeric transition in $^{229}$Th at around
148.4 nm offers a unique opportunity for coherent nuclear control and the
realisation of a nuclear clock. Recent advances, most notably the incorporation
of large ensembles of $^{229}$Th nuclei in transparent crystals and the
development of pulsed vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) lasers, have enabled initial
laser spectroscopy of this transition. However, the lack of an intense,
narrow-linewidth VUV laser has precluded coherent nuclear manipulation. Here we
introduce and demonstrate the first continuous-wave laser at 148.4 nm,
generated via four-wave mixing (FWM) in cadmium vapor. The source delivers 100
nW of power with a linewidth well below 100 Hz and supports broad wavelength
tunability. This represents a five-orders-of-magnitude improvement in linewidth
over all previous single-frequency lasers below 190 nm, marking a major advance
in laser technology. We develop a spatially resolved homodyne technique to
place a stringent upper bound on the phase noise induced by the FWM process and
demonstrate sub-hertz linewidth capability. These results eliminate the final
technical hurdle to a $^{229}$Th-based nuclear clock, opening new directions in
quantum metrology, nuclear quantum optics and precision tests of the Standard
Model. More broadly, they establish a widely tunable, ultranarrow-linewidth
laser platform for applications across quantum information science, condensed
matter physics, and high-resolution VUV spectroscopy.

TL;DR: The paper discusses how the SSH model with defects can be used to engineer localized spin centers as qubits. By adding defects, they can control the number of spin qubits and their pairing, which is crucial for quantum devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore topological materials and their applications in quantum devices, particularly using SSH model as a basis for spin qubits.

Method: They use the SSH model with defects to create localized spin states and demonstrate the pairing of these states as qubits.

Result: The result shows that adding defects allows control over the number of spin qubits and their organization into singlet or triplet states, leading to potential applications in quantum devices.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that inserting defects in the SSH model enables the engineering of controlled spin qubits, offering a new method for quantum information processing.

Abstract: The ability to engineer topologically distinct materials opens the
possibility of enabling novel phenomena in low-dimensional nano-systems, as
well as manufacturing novel quantum devices. One of the simplest examples, the
SSH model with both even and odd number of sites, demonstrates the connection
between localized edge states and the topology of the system. We show that the
SSH model hosts localized spin centers due to the interplay between the
localized edge states and the on-site Hubbard interaction. We further show how
one can engineer any number of localized spin centers within the chain by
careful addition of defects. These spin centers are paired in spin-singlet or
spin-triplet channels within each block separated by the defects, and together
they construct a chain of spin qubits. As this system is realizable
experimentally, our findings provide a novel way for manipulating and
engineering spin qubits in physical systems.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that polarized x-ray emission spectroscopy can provide insights into valence electron orbital occupations using the Rowland circle geometry, both for spin-1/2 Cu(II) and spin-0 Ni(II) ions. It also shows a method to extract these polarized spectra with good angular resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study builds on the use of polarization in x-ray spectroscopy, initially in absorption, and expands it to emission, aiming to analyze valence electrons' states in magnetic materials.

Method: The authors employ the Rowland circle geometry as a spectropolarimeter for their x-ray emission spectroscopy. They apply this technique to measure polarized emission from Cu(II) in LiVCuO4 and Ni(II) in DyNiC2, focusing on both CtC and VtC lines. Data analysis involves extracting polarization information from emission spectra to infer orbital occupations.

Result: The results reveal orbital occupations in Cu(II) and Ni(II) compounds, which are consistent with expectations from their magnetic properties. Additionally, the method shows the ability to resolve emission from different metal ions, highlighting the effectiveness of polarized x-ray emission spectroscopy.

Conclusion: The work opens new possibilities for using polarized emission techniques as a sensitive probe of valence electron configurations in magnetic materials, contributing to a deeper understanding of electronic structures in such systems.

Abstract: Polarization dependence has historically seen extensive use in x-ray
spectroscopy to determine magnetic and local geometric properties, but more
broadly as a way to gain extra sensitivity to electronic structure at the level
of individual magnetic orbitals. This is often done in the context of x-ray
absorption through techniques like x-ray magnetic circular dichroism or x-ray
linear dichroism, but it has seen little application to x-ray emission. Here we
explore the information contained in the polarized emission of two 3d
transition metal systems across both core-to-core (CtC) and valence-to-core
emission (VtC) lines. We demonstrate how the Rowland circle geometry can be
used as a spectropolarimeter, and apply it to the x-ray emission spectroscopy
of spin-1/2 Cu(II) and spin-0 Ni(II) ions in LiVCuO4 and DyNiC2, respectively.
From this we explore how the polarized XES interrogates of the occupied density
of states at the valence level, either as a second order effect through Coulomb
exchange (CtC x-ray emission) or by direct transitions (VtC x-ray emission). We
find that the polarized x-ray emission can provide insights into the valence
electron orbital occupation, in much the same way that is achievable with
polarized absorption or angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy techniques.
Finally, we highlight how the individually polarized dipole emission spectra
can be extracted from a linearly independent suite of directed emission
spectra, allowing for polarized measurements at high Bragg angle with lower
experimental broadening.

Conclusion: 研究证实了DDFFS模型中的Stripe Order和其多条带间作用对于d-波超导体的形成至关重要。未来研究将探索更多Stripe相关机制。

Abstract: Significant research advances have led to a consensus that the Fermi-Hubbard
model and its extended variants are archetypal frameworks for elucidating the
intertwined relationship between stripe orders and superconductivity in
hole-doped high-$T_c$ materials. Notably, the Hubbard quantum simulator has
recently achieved several remarkable breakthroughs, e.g., being successfully
cooled down to the cryogenic regime and enabling the observation of stable
fluctuating stripes. However, the microscopic mechanism behind $d$-wave pairing
of electrons in the presence of stripes at low temperatures remains poorly
understood due to the intricate interplay among the strongly correlated effects
and non-negligible thermal fluctuations. Here, we conduct a close investigation
of a partially-filled stripe in the representative $t$-$J$ and Fermi-Hubbard
models with both numerical and analytical methods. Analogous to quantum gas
microscopy, the perfect sampling technique allows us to obtain the
high-confidence statistics of the Fock basis states appearing in the
ground-state wavefunction. In a refreshing physical paradigm, these data
demonstrate that two spinons with opposite chiralities tend to spontaneously
pair into a singlet state, which naturally gives rise to the $d$-wave pairing
pattern. Then, using the effective theory of quantum colored string, we
reconstruct the wavefunction and determine the nature of spinon pairing and its
connection to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Furthermore, spinon singlet pairs
enable the establishment of a long-range pair-pair correlation between double
stripes. Our work offers new insights into the role of stripe orders in
mediating $d$-wave superconductivity and paves the way for further exploration
of multi-stripe-mediated pairing mechanisms in the Fermi-Hubbard model.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper explores nonlinear electronic transport in spin-orbit coupled materials under external magnetic fields through the Wigner distribution function. The second harmonic of current density is analyzed, showing maximum response under certain conditions. The direction of current reversal is linked to peak position influenced by disorder relaxation rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the role of spin-orbit coupling in nonlinear transport phenomena under magnetic fields. The authors build on recent experimental findings to develop a theoretical framework.

Method: They use the Wigner distribution function and analyze the quantum kinetic equation to evaluate the magnetic field dependence of the second harmonic, considering both disorder effects and critical fields.

Result: The key results are about the linear increase in second harmonic at small fields, maximum at intermediate fields, and the reversal of nonlinear current direction when magnetic field exceeds a critical value. The position and width of these depend on the relaxation rate due to disorder.

Conclusion: The theory provides a comprehensive understanding of nonlinear transport mechanisms influenced by spin-orbit coupling and magnetic fields, offering insights into material properties and potential applications.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental measurements of the nonlinear
longitudinal resistance of the spin-orbit coupled electron gas in the (111)
LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces under external in-plane magnetic field [G. Tuvia
\emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 146301 (2024)], we formulate a theory of
nonlinear electronic transport based on the analysis of the quantum kinetic
equation for the Wigner distribution function. Specifically, we evaluate the
magnetic field dependence of the second harmonic of the current density at
arbitrary values of the magnetic field. The magnitude of the second harmonic
increases linearly with the magnetic field at small fields. Upon further
increase of the magnetic field, the second harmonic response reaches its
maximum value. We find that the position of the peak and its width strongly
depend on the relaxation rate due to disorder. Importantly, we discover that
the direction of the nonlinear contribution to the current can be completely
reversed when the magnetic field reaches a certain critical value.

Motivation: The study aims to deepen the understanding of skyrmion origins, which are crucial for developing high-density, low-power spin-based electronics for future information technology.

Method: The researchers used X-ray structural analysis, Fermi surface nesting, and density of states calculations across compounds with different X atoms to analyze electronic and magnetic properties.

Result: As X moves from Si to Ge to Sn, the Fermi surface nesting and competing magnetic interactions increase, correlating with higher skyrmion formation under specific temperature and magnetic conditions.

Conclusion: This work provides a framework for designing materials with desired skyrmion properties, enhancing their potential for advanced spintronic applications.

nano-sized spin textures that can enable high-density low-power spin-based
electronics. Despite increasing interest in the discovery of new skyrmion hosts
and their characterization, the electronic origins of the skyrmion formation
remain unknown. Here, we study GdRu2X2 (X = Si, Ge, Sn) as a model system to
study the connection among chemical bonding, electronic instability, and the
critical temperature and magnetic field at which skyrmions evolve. The nature
of the electronic structure of GdRu2X2 is characterized by chemical bonding,
Fermi surface analysis, and density of energy function. As X-p orbitals become
more extended from Si-3p to Ge-4p and Sn-5p, improved interactions between the
Gd spins and the [Ru2X2] conduction layer and increased destabilizing energy
contributions are obtained. GdRu2Si2 possesses a Fermi surface nesting (FSN)
vector [Q = (q, 0, 0)], whereas GdRu2Ge2 displays two inequivalent FSN vectors
[Q = (q, 0, 0); QA = (q, q, 0)] and GdRu2Sn2 features multiple Q vectors. In
addition, competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions
in the Gd plane become more pronounced as a function of X. These results reveal
some correlation among the electronic instability, the competing interaction
strength, and the temperature and magnetic field conditions at which the
skyrmions emerge. This work demonstrates how chemical bonding and electronic
structure enable a new framework for understanding and developing skyrmions
under desired conditions that would otherwise be impossible.

Abstract: Understanding entanglement remains one of the most intriguing problems in
physics. While particle and site entanglement have been studied extensively,
the investigation of length or energy scale entanglement, quantifying the
information exchange between different length scales, has received far less
attention. Here, we identify the quantics tensor train (QTT) technique, a
matrix product state-inspired approach for overcoming computational bottlenecks
in resource-intensive numerical calculations, as a renormalization group method
by analytically expressing an exact cyclic reduction-based real-space
renormalization scheme in QTT language, which serves as a natural formalism for
the method. In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure
of length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in
each coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied
almost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical
calculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating
computational costs in semi-analytical treatments. We present our results for
the one-dimensional tight-binding model with n-th-nearest-neighbor hopping,
where the 2n rescaled couplings generated in the renormalization procedure
precisely match the QTT bond dimension of the one-particle Green's function.

### [29] [Stabilization of the collinear plateau phase by thermal fluctuations in the disordered triangular lattice antiferromagnet Rb$_{(1-x)}$K$_{x}$Fe(MoO$_4$)$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19190)
*V. N. Glazkov,I. A. Krastilevskiy*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper discusses the magnetic phase diagrams of a triangular lattice antiferromagnet, focusing on the collinear 1/3-plateau phase and the effects of thermal and quantum fluctuations versus static disorder caused by impurities. They demonstrate that heating can suppress disorder, allowing the 1/3-plateau phase to reappear in a diluted sample at x=15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the competition between thermal fluctuations, quantum effects, and impurity-induced disorder in stabilizing the magnetic order in RbFe(MoO4)2, the paper presents experimental evidence for the phase transition at the 1/3-plateau and the mechanisms behind its re-emergence upon heating in a diluted sample.

Method: The methods used include inelastic neutron scattering to observe antiferromagnetic order and measure key properties such as spin-flop transitions and magnetic field dependencies. The experiment involves comparing the ordered moment, Neel temperature, and magnetization with and without introducing impurities. Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to probe the electronic structure through the local density of states at the Fe sites, while specific heat measurements help understand the thermal effects on the spin system.

Result: The experimental results confirm that thermal fluctuations dominate over static impurity-induced disorder at higher temperatures, leading to the restoration of the 1/3-plateau magnetic phase in the diluted sample. Additionally, the presence of the spin-flop transition and the temperature dependence of magnetization support the idea that quantum fluctuations play a significant role in the stabilization of the plateau phase.

Conclusion: The study provides strong evidence for the key mechanism behind the competition between quantum, thermal, and impurity effects in stabilizing fluctuation-induced magnetic orders. It suggests that the 1/3-plateau phase can be reactivated by increasing the temperature, highlighting the interplay between these factors in two-dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnets on the Fe- from family of compounds.

Abstract: The triangular lattice antiferromagnet RbFe(MoO$_4$)$_2$ orders
antiferromagnetically in a planar 120$^\circ$-structure below
$T_\textrm{N}\approx 4$ K. A striking feature of RbFe(MoO$_4$)$_2$ magnetic
phase diagram is the presence of collinear ``1/3-plateau'' magnetic phase,
which is stabilized by thermal and quantum fluctuations at magnetization
$M\approx \frac{1}{3} M_\textrm{sat}$. Static disorder caused by impurities is
predicted to act against the effect of fluctuations and to suppress collinear
plateau phase (Maryasin and Zhitomirsky, PRL 111, 247201 (2013)). Balance
between ``dynamic'' thermal and quantum fluctuations and ``static''
impurity-induced disorder is temperature-sensitive, which allows thermal
fluctuations to take over the effect of static disorder and leads to the
revival of the fluctuation-stabilized ``1/3-plateau'' phase on heating. Here we
present experimental results directly confirming this prediction and
demonstrating re-establishment of the plateau-like phase in the diluted
Rb$_{(1-x)}$K$_{x}$Fe(MoO$_4$)$_2$ sample at moderate dilution level $x=15$\%
on heating as the effect of thermal fluctuations increases.

Abstract: Quantum spin chains with competing interactions offer a platform where low
dimensionality and frustration--both acting to suppress magnetic
order--intersect. We studied magnetic ordering in the spin-1/2 chain compound
AgCuVO$_4$ using muon spin spectroscopy and neutron diffraction. Long-range
magnetic order emerges at $T_N = 2.0(1)$ K, which is $\sim$1/200 of the
dominant intrachain coupling $J$ and $\sim$1/15 of the interchain interactions.
The collinear incommensurate amplitude-modulated magnetic structure features a
reduced ordered moment of 0.13(2) $\mu_\mathrm{B}$, confined to the $ab$ plane
and modulated along the $c$ axis--perpendicular to the spin chains--indicating
frustrated interchain couplings. The low $T_N$, small moment, and
incommensurate order highlight strong frustration, positioning AgCuVO$_4$ as a
model system for exploring frustration in quantum spin chains.

Abstract: Fractionalized quasiparticles and their confinement into emergent bound
states lie at the heart of modern quantum magnetism. While the evolution into
magnonic bound states has been well characterized, experimental insight into
the analogous transition to triplons remains limited. Here, using
high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and state-of-the-art spin dynamics
simulations, we uncover the transformation from weakly interacting spinons to
tightly bound triplons in the spin-Peierls compound CuGeO3. Quantitative
comparisons between the measured spectra and tensor network simulations reveal
substantial next-nearest-neighbor frustration and weak external dimerization,
placing the system deep within the spontaneously dimerized regime and near the
exactly solvable Majumdar-Ghosh point. We further show an energy- and
temperature-dependent evolution between two contrasting quasiparticle regimes:
deconfined spinons with markedly suppressed interactions by frustration, and
coherent triplonic bound states with no observable spinon degrees of freedom.
Remarkably, triplon character persists into the two-particle regime, forming a
structured two-triplon continuum with a spectral feature associated with a van
Hove singularity at its lower boundary. These findings challenge the
conventional view that robust triplons require strong external dimerization and
demonstrate how the interplay between frustration and dimerization can reshape
fractionalization and confinement.

*Chakradhar Rangi,Juana Moreno,Ka-Ming Tam*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: non-Hermitian quantum systems can suppress the skin effect in the Hubbard model when strong correlations are present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay between non-Hermitian physics and strong correlations in quantum systems opens new possibilities for engineering transport properties in open systems.

Method: Real-space dynamical mean-field theory (R-DMFT) is used to study the end-to-end Green's function as a probe of directional amplification.

Result: Strong correlations suppress the skin effect, leading to a crossover from boundary-dominated to correlation-driven dynamics. At high hopping asymmetry, amplification is restored despite strong interactions.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into controlling non-reciprocal transport using correlations in non-Hermitian systems, suggesting applications in quantum devices.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems, characterized by their ability to model open
systems with gain and loss, have unveiled striking phenomena such as the
non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where eigenstates localize at boundaries
under open boundary conditions. While extensively studied in non-interacting
systems, the interplay between NHSE and strong electron correlations remains
largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the non-Hermitian Hubbard model with
asymmetric hopping, employing real-space dynamical mean-field theory (R-DMFT),
a novel extension to such non-Hermitian correlated models-to capture both local
correlations and spatial inhomogeneities. By analyzing the end-to-end Green's
function as probes of directional amplification, we demonstrate that strong
correlations can suppress the skin effect, leading to a crossover from
boundary-dominated to correlation-driven dynamics. Our systematic study reveals
that correlations dominate at small to intermediate strength of asymmetric
hopping, inducing exponential decay in the end-to-end Green's function, but
higher strength of asymmetric hopping can restore amplification even at strong
interaction. These results illuminate the tunable interplay between
correlations and non-Hermitian physics, suggesting avenues for engineering
non-reciprocal transport in correlated open quantum systems.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the design and optimization of the SR-_collider, detailing the challenges in achieving high luminosity in a low-energy regime and presenting a novel lattice design with various corrective measures and optimization techniques to improve beam dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the performance of colliders, specifically the SR-collider, to achieve higher luminosity while addressing challenges in low-energy operation, such as severe nonlinear effects and reduced beam stability.

Method: The authors propose a quasi-two-fold symmetric lattice design for SR-collider, focusing on several key areas including linear optics optimization, higher-order aberration corrections, and the use of specialized components like Montag_function and chromatic sextupoles. They employ a genetic algorithm to optimize multiple components simultaneously, aiming to maximize dynamic aperture and momentum bandwidth.

Result: The result involves a detailed description of the optimized lattice configuration, the application of advanced optimization techniques, and the evaluation of the system's performance under error conditions, though specific numerical outcomes are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the novel lattice design effectively mitigates the identified challenges, leading to an improved robustness and beam dynamics suitable for achieving the desired high luminosity in the SR-collider setup.

Abstract: The Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF), China's next-generation
electron-positron collider, targets an unprecedented luminosity exceeding
5x10^34 cm^-2 s^-1 at a center-of-mass energy of 4 GeV. The implementation of a
submillimeter vertical beta function at interaction point (< 1 mm) and
crab-waist collision scheme in this low-energy regime introduces critical
challenges through severe nonlinear effects that constrain dynamic aperture and
degrade Touschek lifetime. To address these constraints, we propose a novel
quasi-two-fold symmetric lattice design integrating several synergistic
features: Linear optics optimization minimizing the H-invariant around the ring
to maximize local momentum acceptance (LMA); Up to third-order of local
chromaticity correction in the interaction region combined with second-order
achromatic arc optics, enhancing off-momentum beam dynamics; Configured FODO
arc structure with interleaved sextupole groups satisfying -I transformation,
suppressing third-order geometric aberrations while optimizing Montague
function distributions; Advanced final focus system integrating chromatic
sextupoles, crab sextupoles, and strategically positioned octupoles to
counteract final quadrupole fringe fields. Furthermore, we develop a
multi-objective genetic algorithm using the in-house toolkit PAMKIT to
simultaneously optimize 46 sextupole families, maximizing both dynamic aperture
and momentum bandwidth. Optics performance is evaluated under error conditions
with appropriate corrections, ensuring robust beam dynamics.

Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules can be achieved by shielding
loss channels with microwave fields. The microwave coupling can be approximated
by effective dipole-dipole interactions with a short-range repulsion. We study
properties and stability of these molecular Bose gases with a many-body
variational method, the hypernetted-chain Euler-Lagrange method for a wide
range of densities and repulsion strengths of the microwave shield. We find a
homogeneous gas-like phase which, however, is unstable at low density against
density waves: at a critical density, which depends on the repulsion strength,
the dipolar fluid undergoes a phase transition to a layer phase. Thus, if the
molecular condensate is expanded adiabatically by decreasing the confinement
strength, it will spontaneously form layers at the critical density. These
quasi-two-dimensional layers can be self-bound, hence form two-dimensional
liquids. By varying the microwave shield, the predicted equilibrium densities
span more than an order of magnitude.

TL;DR: The study compares LSTM RNNs and SINDy for modeling Sargassum raft dynamics, finding SINDy more interpretable despite comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and predicting Sargassum raft motion is crucial for maritime safety and environmental management, making the comparison between these machine learning models relevant.

Method: The researchers evaluated LSTM RNNs and SINDy by applying them to model Sargassum raft dynamics using the eBOMB framework. LSTM was used for mapping from eBOMB variables to raft center-of-mass velocity differences, while SINDy included windowed velocity terms for nonlocal interactions.

Result: Both methods showed comparable performance, with LSTM excelling in straightforward cases while SINDy offering transparency by revealing explicit relationships.

Conclusion: Using SINDy provides interpretability for understanding the dynamics of Sargassum rafts, aiding in prediction and management, despite LSTM's better performance in simple scenarios.

Abstract: Since 2011, rafts of floating \emph{Sargassum} seaweed have frequently
obstructed the coasts of the Intra-Americas Seas. The motion of the rafts is
represented by a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Referred to as
the eBOMB model, this builds on the Maxey--Riley equation by incorporating
interactions between clumps of \emph{Sargassum} forming a raft and the effects
of Earth's rotation. The absence of a predictive law for the rafts' centers of
mass suggests a need for machine learning. In this paper, we evaluate and
contrast Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and
Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). In both cases, a
physics-inspired closure modeling approach is taken rooted in eBOMB.
Specifically, the LSTM model learns a mapping from a collection of eBOMB
variables to the difference between raft center-of-mass and ocean velocities.
The SINDy model's library of candidate functions is suggested by eBOMB
variables and includes windowed velocity terms incorporating far-field effects
of the carrying flow. Both LSTM and SINDy models perform most effectively in
conditions with tightly bonded clumps, despite declining precision with rising
complexity, such as with wind effects and when assessing loosely connected
clumps. The LSTM model delivered the best results when designs were
straightforward, with fewer neurons and hidden layers. While LSTM model serves
as an opaque black-box model lacking interpretability, the SINDy model brings
transparency by discerning explicit functional relationships through the
function libraries. Integration of the windowed velocity terms enabled
effective modeling of nonlocal interactions, particularly in datasets featuring
sparsely connected rafts.

Abstract: We investigate nonlinear aggregation dynamics of phase elements distributed
on the unit circle under parametrically modulated external fields. Our model,
inspired by flaky particle rotation in fluids, employs the equation
${d\alpha/dt} = \lambda(t)\sin 2(\alpha - \phi(t))$ with $\lambda(t) =
\cos(\omega_1 t)$ and $\phi(t) = \omega_2 t$, representing a switching rotating
attractive device where the attractive strength oscillates while the attractive
point rotates at independent frequencies. Through numerical simulations and
analytical approaches, we discover Arnold tongue-like structures in parameter
space $(\omega_1, \omega_2)$, where initially isotropic phase distributions
aggregate into highly anisotropic states. Complete aggregation occurs within
wedge-shaped stability regions radiating from bifurcation points, forming band
structures with characteristic slope relationships. The dynamics exhibit rich
nonlinear behavior including attractors, limit cycles, and quasi-periodic
trajectories in reduced indicator space spanned by aggregation degree ($I$),
field-alignment measure ($O$), and temporal variation ($P$). Our findings
reveal fundamental principles governing collective phase dynamics under
competing temporal modulations, with potential applications spanning from
biological synchronization to socio-economic dynamics and controllable

Abstract: The Josephson junction and shunt capacitor form a transmon qubit, which is
the cornerstone of modern quantum computing platforms. For reliable quantum
computing, it is important how long a qubit can remain in a superposition of
quantum states, which is determined by the coherence time (T1). The coherence
time of a qubit effectively sets the "lifetime" of usable quantum information,
determining how long quantum computations can be performed before errors occur
and information is lost. There are several sources of decoherence in transmon
qubits, but the predominant one is generally considered to be dielectric losses
in the natural oxide layer formed on the surface of the superconductor. In this
paper, we present a numerical study of microwave surface losses in planar
superconducting antennas of different transmon qubit designs. An asymptotic
method for estimating the energy participation ratio in ultrathin films of
nanometer scales is proposed, and estimates are given for the limits of
achievable minimum RF losses depending on the electrical properties of the
surface oxide and the interface of the qubit with the substrate material.

Motivation: Understanding quantum chaos is crucial for various fields. The fact that correspondence fails in certain systems suggests limitations in using certain methods to diagnose chaos.

Method: Analyzing a kicked model with dissipation, comparing spectral correlations.

Result: Ginibre ensembles don't reliably indicate dissipation-induced chaos.

Conclusion: The correspondence principle breaks down in these systems, so using Ginibre dynamics as a diagnostic is flawed.

Abstract: The correspondence between quantum and classical behavior has been essential
since the advent of quantum mechanics. This principle serves as a cornerstone
for understanding quantum chaos, which has garnered increased attention due to
its strong impact in various theoretical and experimental fields. When
dissipation is considered, quantum chaos takes concepts from isolated quantum
chaos to link classical chaotic motion with spectral correlations of Ginibre
ensembles. This correspondence was first identified in periodically kicked
systems with damping, but it has been shown to break down in dissipative
atom-photon systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. In this
contribution, we revisit the original kicked model and perform a systematic
exploration across a broad parameter space, reaching a genuine semiclassical
limit. Our results demonstrate that the correspondence principle, as defined
through this spectral connection, fails even in this prototypical system. These
findings provide conclusive evidence that Ginibre spectral correlations are
neither a robust nor a universal diagnostic of dissipative quantum chaos.

Conclusion: 微腔中的热力学限制了光子凝聚的最低温度，不可逆过程提高了阈值。

Abstract: The trapping and cooling of photon gases in microcavities has been used to
create Bose-Einstein condensates. We investigate the conditions required for
condensation in dye-filled microcavities, with photon populations created
either by driving a transition of the dye or by coupling to an external thermal
photon reservoir such as sunlight. We show that the threshold pump temperature,
above which condensation appears, is determined by the second law of
thermodynamics. The minimum achievable threshold is that of a reversible
three-level heat engine, which we show arises in the dye-pumped case, and for
the external pumping of a two-level cavity. For a many-level cavity
condensation occurs at a similar but higher temperature. The increase is
attributed to irreversible heat transfers and the associated entropy
production.

TL;DR: 摘要提出了一个评估量子计算质量的方法，通过引入变体门来维持电路结构，实现经典可计算性。该方案实用且适合任意通路结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子计算机处于发展的早期，评估其性能变得尤为重要。找到一种既能保持量子特征又能经典求解的方法是一个挑战。

Method: 该方案通过引入变体门来实现，具体方法是将每个门替换为一个门群，这些门群的平均效果形成可解的空间-时间信道。通过半正定规划可以构造新的门群，适用于任意通路结构。

Result: 该方法能够在非氯anner基准测试中检测噪声，估计期望值只需少量实现在。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子计算评估提供了创新方法，实际意义重大。

Abstract: As quantum devices progress towards a quantum advantage regime, they become
harder to benchmark. A particularly relevant challenge is to assess the quality
of the whole computation, beyond testing the performance of each single
operation. Here we introduce a scheme for this task that combines the target
computation with variants of it, which, when averaged, allow for classically
solvable correlation functions. Importantly, the variants exactly preserve the
circuit architecture and depth, without simplifying the gates into a
classically-simulable set. The method is based on replacing each gate by an
ensemble of similar gates, which when averaged together form space-time
channels [P. Kos and G. Styliaris, Quantum 7, 1020 (2023)]. We introduce
explicit constructions for ensembles producing such channels, all applicable to
arbitrary brickwork circuits, and provide a general recipe to find new ones
through semidefinite programming. The resulting average computation retains
important information about the original circuit and is able to detect noise
beyond a Clifford benchmarking regime. Moreover, we provide evidence that
estimating average-computation expectation values requires running only a
limited number of different circuit realizations.

Motivation: The motivation stems from quantum computing advancements, trying to develop efficient algorithms for larger quantum systems without error accumulation.

Method: They use pulse sequences with segmentation, an adaptive update algorithm, and a hybrid quantum gates approach using optimized pulses for better measurement.

Result: Success in numerically demonstrating accurate state preparation and proofs of concept for scalable systems.

Conclusion: Pulse-level algorithms are promising for quantum computing with Rydberg atoms. Future work should expand beyond one-dimensional models and explore scalability.

Abstract: We explore a pulse-based variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for
Rydberg atoms in optical tweezer arrays and evaluate its performance on
prototypical quantum spin models. We numerically demonstrate that the ground
states of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and the
mixed-field Ising model can be accurately prepared using an adaptive update
algorithm that randomly segments pulse sequences, for systems of up to ten
qubits. Furthermore, we propose and validate a hybrid scheme that integrates
this pulse-level analog quantum algorithm with a variational quantum gate
approach, where digital quantum gates are approximated by optimized analog
pulses. This enables efficient measurement of the cost function for target
many-body Hamiltonians.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of predicting switching rates in quantum systems, which is crucial for understanding and improving quantum computing architectures like cat-qubits. By leveraging hidden time-reversal symmetry, the authors expand the applicability of existing methods to a broader class of quantum systems, thus offering new tools for quantum error analysis.

Method: Path integral techniques are employed to derive analytical expressions for switching rates in quantum systems exhibiting hidden time-reversal symmetry, particularly focusing on systems relevant to quantum computing, such as cat-qubits.

Conclusion: This work broadens the scope of quantum systems for which switching rate analysis is feasible, providing valuable insights that can enhance the design and reliability of quantum computing technologies.

Abstract: In this work, we use path integral techniques to predict the switching rate
in a single-mode bistable open quantum system. While analytical expressions are
well-known to be accessible for systems subject to Gaussian noise obeying
classical detailed balance, we generalize this approach to a class of quantum
systems, those which satisfy the recently-introduced hidden time-reversal
symmetry [1]. In particular, in the context of quantum computing, we deliver
precise estimates of bit-flip error rates in cat-qubit architectures,
circumventing the need for costly numerical simulations. Our results open new
avenues for exploring switching phenomena in multistable single- and many-body
open quantum systems.

Motivation: 量子通信的安全性在当前技术中至关重要。寻找在现有技术和检测效率下可行的QKD方案对实际应用至关重要。

Method: 分析了一个在单边设备独立设定下的QKD协议，平衡了设备依赖和独立设置之间的优点。通过分析Steinlechner等人的文献，推导出渐近密钥速率的下界，并基于贝尔对角线状态的混合物进行安全分析。比较了不同噪声条件下的性能，并展示了在较低检测效率下仍可安全生成密钥。

Conclusion: 单边设备独立的QKD协议在当前技术下是可行且实用的，具有替代现有设备独立协议的优势。

Abstract: We study the security of a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol under the
one-sided device-independent (1sDI) setting, which assumes trust in only one
party's measurement device. This approach effectively provides a balance
between the experimental viability of device-dependent (DD-QKD) and the minimal
trust assumptions of device-independent (DI-QKD). An analytical lower bound on
the asymptotic key rate is derived to provide security against collective
attacks, in which the eavesdropper's information is limited only by the
function of observed violation of a linear quantum steering inequality,
specifically the three-setting Cavalcanti--Jones--Wiseman--Reid (CJWR)
inequality. We provide a closed-form key rate formula by reducing the security
analysis to mixtures of Bell-diagonal states by utilizing symmetries of the
steering functional. We show that the protocol tolerates higher quantum bit
error rates (QBER) than present DI-QKD protocols by benchmarking its
performance under depolarizing noise. Furthermore, we explore the impact of
detection inefficiencies and show that, in contrast to DI-QKD, which requires
near-perfect detection, secure key generation can be achieved even with lower
detection efficiency on the untrusted side. These findings demonstrate the
viability of using 1sDI-QKD with current technology and highlight its
advantages as a steering-based substitute for secure quantum communication.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper provides a quantum analysis of Stokes-anti-Stokes scattering, showing it generates entangled photon pairs. They derive electric polarization and four-wave mixing using quantum perturbation theory and relate it to third-order susceptibility. However, a classical description missing a quantum foundation was previously a gap.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper fills a quantum gap in Raman scattering's theoretical understanding, which is important for quantum optics advancements.

Method: They used quantum perturbation theory and Heisenberg operators to derive polarization and four-wave mixing.

Result: Entangled photons generated via SaS, third-order susceptibility derived, resolving the quantum theory gap.

Conclusion: SaS scattering can be used for quantum technologies, quantum description is provided.

Abstract: The process in which Raman scattering produces correlated Stokes and
anti-Stokes radiation is known as Stokes-anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering. It has
been shown recently that this process can generate entangled photon pairs,
making it a promising tool for quantum optical technologies, but a proper
quantum theoretical description was lacking. In this paper, a fully quantum
derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman
response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed. Using quantum
perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the
material electric polarization and show that the correlated SaS scattering
appears in the first order of perturbation, corresponding to a four-wave mixing
phenomenon. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical
susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that
it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on the simulation of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, which are important for quantum technologies. The motivation is to provide accurate modeling to advance quantum computing and sensing applications by addressing the physical platform's complexity and defects.

Method: The authors developed a Python-based simulation software using a non-perturbative time-dependent Hamiltonian model. This model eliminates oversimplifications such as delta-pulses and rotating wave approximations, allowing for more realistic simulations of the spin dynamics under various experimental conditions.

Result: The simulations revealed subtle dynamics due to realistic pulse constraints and were validated by comparing results with experimental works in quantum computing, sensing, and quantum networks.

Conclusion: The digital twin software serves as a reliable numerical modeling tool for application across quantum computing, sensing, and network technologies, with simple usability and accuracy beyond traditional methods.

Abstract: Color centers defects in solids, and particularly the nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
center in diamond, are crucial physical platforms for quantum technology
applications. Therefore, a precise and rigorous numerical modeling of the NV
system is indispensable for the continued advancement of the field. Within this
context, this work develops a Python software for simulating the NV spin
dynamics in pulsed sequences under general experimental conditions, i.e. a
digital twin. The library accounts for electromagnetic pulses and other
environmental inputs, which are used to solve the system's time-evolution
dynamics, resulting in a physical output in the form of a quantum mechanical
observable given by the fluorescence. The simulations framework is based on a
non-perturbative time-dependent Hamiltonian model, solved in the laboratory
frame. Whereby eliminating oversimplifications such as the assumption of
instantaneous $\delta$-pulses and rotating wave approximations, our simulations
reveal subtle dynamics from the realistic pulse constraints that impact quantum
systems. Three use-case examples illustrate the use of the software and
validate it by comparing the simulation results with well-established
experimental works, relevant to the fields of quantum computing (two-qubit
conditional logic gates), sensing (noise resilient dynamical decoupling
sequences between NV and couples spins) and networks (teleportation of a
quantum state between entangled NVs). Overall, this digital twin delivers a
robust and detailed numerical modeling of the NV spin dynamics, with simple and
accessible usability, for an extensive application range.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum computational pseudorandomness has emerged as a fundamental notion
that spans connections to complexity theory, cryptography and fundamental
physics. However, all known constructions of efficient quantum-secure
pseudorandom objects rely on complexity theoretic assumptions.
  In this work, we establish the first unconditionally secure efficient
pseudorandom constructions against shallow-depth quantum circuit classes. We
prove that:
  $\bullet$ Any quantum state 2-design yields unconditional pseudorandomness
against both $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ circuits with arbitrarily many ancillae and
$\mathsf{AC}^0\circ\mathsf{QNC}^0$ circuits with nearly linear ancillae.
  $\bullet$ Random phased subspace states, where the phases are picked using a
4-wise independent function, are unconditionally pseudoentangled against the
above circuit classes.
  $\bullet$ Any unitary 2-design yields unconditionally secure parallel-query
pseudorandom unitaries against geometrically local $\mathsf{QNC}^0$
adversaries, even with limited $\mathsf{AC}^0$ postprocessing.
  Our indistinguishability results for 2-designs stand in stark contrast to the
standard setting of quantum pseudorandomness against $\mathsf{BQP}$ circuits,
wherein they can be distinguishable from Haar random ensembles using more than
two copies or queries. Our work demonstrates that quantum computational
pseudorandomness can be achieved unconditionally for natural classes of
restricted adversaries, opening new directions in quantum complexity theory.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  paper introduces a novel variational framework to optimize both codon usage and secondary structure in mRNA, which are interdependent properties. The approach uses a dual-objective function with quantum-classical methods and validates on IBM's Eagle processor. Results show potential for efficient design of mRNA therapeutics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  researchers often struggle with optimizing mRNA sequences for therapeutic applications. codon optimization and secondary structure are two critical aspects that are often considered separately, leading to suboptimal results. this paper aims to address the gap by developing an integrated method that considers both factors, potentially improving the stability and efficacy of mRNA therapy.

Method:  the method uses a variational framework with a dual-objective function balancing codon adaptation index (cai) and minimum free energy (mfe). it employs a hybrid quantum-classical computational strategy, incorporating quantum algorithms for secondary structure prediction. quantum hardware, specifically IBM's 127-qubit Eagle processor, is utilized for computation.

Result:  the framework is tested on sequences up to 30 nucleotides, with simulations and experiments on IBM's hardware showing its feasibility. the results indicate that the integrated approach can optimize mRNA constructs efficiently, potentially accelerating their design for therapeutic use.

Conclusion:  the paper presents a significant advancement in optimizing mRNA sequences by integrating codon adaptation and secondary structure considerations. using a combination of quantum and classical techniques on IBM hardware, the framework demonstrates the potential to enhance the design of mRNA constructs, making them more effective and stable for therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Co-optimizing mRNA sequences for both codon optimality and secondary
structure is crucial for producing stable and efficacious mRNA therapeutics.
Codon optimization, which adjusts nucleotide sequences to enhance translational
efficiency, inherently influences mRNA secondary structure - a key determinant
of molecular stability both in-vial and in-cell. Because both properties are
governed by the same underlying sequence, optimizing one directly impacts the
other. To address this interdependence, we introduce a novel variational
framework that simultaneously optimizes codon usage and secondary structure.
Our method employs a dual-objective function that balances the codon adaptation
index (CAI) and minimum free energy (MFE), incorporating variational parameters
for codon selection. Leveraging a hybrid quantum-classical computational
strategy and building on prior advancements in quantum algorithms for secondary
structure prediction, we effectively navigate this complex optimization space.
We demonstrate the feasibility of executing this end-to-end workflow on real
quantum hardware, using IBM's 127-qubit Eagle processor. We validate our
approach through both simulations and quantum hardware experiments on sequences
of up to 30 nucleotides. These results highlight the potential of our framework
to accelerate the design of optimal mRNA constructs for therapeutic and
research applications.

Abstract: We investigate a hybrid modeling framework in which a quantum annealer is
used to simulate magnetic interactions in molecular qubit lattices inspired by
experimentally realizable systems. Using phthalocyanine assemblies as a
structurally constrained prototype, we model a continuous deformation from a
Lieb to a kagome lattice, revealing frustration-driven disorder and magnetic
field-induced reordering in the spin structure. The annealer provides access to
observables such as the static structure factor and magnetization over a wide
parameter space, enabling the characterization of magnetic arrangements beyond
the reach of current molecular architectures. This surrogate modeling approach
supports a feedback loop between experiment and programmable quantum hardware,
offering a pathway to explore and iteratively design tunable magnetic states in
synthetic quantum materials. The synthetic design, structural characterization,
and quantum simulation framework established here defines a modular and
scalable paradigm for probing the limits of engineered quantum matter across

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of quantum particles in classically forbidden regions is crucial for quantum mechanics and interpretations like Bohmian mechanics.

Method: Analyzing the system from a pilot-wave perspective and comparing it to ordinary quantum theory.

Result: The experiment's results are consistent with ordinary quantum theory, showing the speed is fictitious.

Conclusion: Bohmian mechanics' interpretation is not necessary; ordinary quantum theory adequately explains the findings.

Abstract: A recent article claims to measure the speed of quantum particles in the
classically forbidden regime where the energy of the particles is lower than
the local potential, and further claims that the results of this experiment
challenge Bohmian mechanics. But this interpretation of the experiment is
incorrect (and dubious even in the context of ordinary quantum mechanics). A
proper analysis of the system from a pilot-wave perspective shows that it
predicts the same distribution of particle positions (and so the same
experimental results) as ordinary quantum theory. The speed measured by the
experiment in this regime is fictitious.

Abstract: Simulating vibronic spectra is a central task in physical chemistry, offering
insight into important properties of molecules. Recently, it has been
experimentally demonstrated that photonic platforms based on Gaussian boson
sampling (GBS) are capable of performing these simulations. However, whether an
actual GBS approach is required depends on the molecule under investigation. To
develop a better understanding on the requirements for simulating vibronic
spectra, we explore connections between theoretical approximations in physical
chemistry and their photonic counterparts. Mapping these approximations into
photonics, we show that for certain molecules the GBS approach is unnecessary.
We place special emphasis on the linear coupling approximation, which in
photonics corresponds to sampling from multiple coherent states. By
implementing this approach in experiments, we demonstrate improved similarities
over previously reported GBS results for formic acid and identify the
particular attributes that a molecule must exhibit for this, and other
approximations, to be valid. These results highlight the importance in forming
deeper connections between traditional methods and photonic approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，量子变分算法如QAOA在求解组合优化问题方面表现出色。为了提高这些算法的性能，研究如何利用QFI作为诊断工具来优化算法参数或策略变得至关重要。

Method: 研究者通过系统性地对QAOA在最大割问题上的应用，分别考察了不同的循环和完全图、不同的米ixer类型（RX-only和RX-RY）、阶数和纠缠阶段，评估了其QFI的表现，并提出了基于QFI的变异操作策略。

Result: 研究发现，完全图相比循环图在QFI上表现更好，但没有达到Heisenberg限（4N²）；引入纠缠主要转移QFI的敏感性，尤其在非局域性较强的完全图中效果显著。提出的QFI-Informed Mutation策略在求解7-和10-qubit实例时，显著提升了平均能量和减少了运行次数的波动。

Conclusion: 通过QFI分析，研究者部分验证了QAOA在解决大型组合优化问题时的潜力，并提出了一个基于QFI的变异策略，该策略在实验中显现出优于传统方法的优势，提示了QFI在改进量子变分算法性能方面的应用前景。

Abstract: Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) can be used to quantify how sensitive a
quantum state reacts to changes in its variational parameters, making it a
natural diagnostic for algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA). We perform a systematic QFI analysis of QAOA for Max-Cut on
cyclic and complete graphs with $N = 4 - 10$ qubits. Two mixer families are
studied, RX-only and hybrid RX-RY, with depths $p = 2, 4, 6$ and $p = 3, 6, 9$,
respectively, and with up to three entanglement stages implemented through
cyclic- or complete-entangling patterns. Complete graphs consistently yield
larger QFI eigenvalues than cyclic graphs; none of the settings reaches the
Heisenberg limit ($4N^2$), but several exceed the linear bound ($4N$).
Introducing entanglement primarily redistributes QFI from diagonal to
off-diagonal entries: non-entangled circuits maximize per-parameter (diagonal)
sensitivity, whereas entangling layers increase the covariance fraction and
thus cross-parameter correlations, with diminishing returns beyond the first
stage. Leveraging these observations, we propose, as a proof of concept, a
QFI-Informed Mutation (QIm) heuristic that sets mutation probabilities and step
sizes from the normalized diagonal QFI. On 7- and 10-qubit instances, QIm
attains higher mean energies and lower variance than equal-probability and
random-restart baselines over 100 runs, underscoring QFI as a lightweight,
problem-aware preconditioner for QAOA and other variational quantum algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the robustness of quantum state transfer against timing inconsistencies is crucial for practical quantum computing applications, as precise timing is often challenging to achieve.

Method: The authors create spin chains engineered to reduce sensitivity and prove their asymptotic optimality.

Result: The constructed spin chains successfully minimize sensitivity for both perfect transfer and fractional revival.

Conclusion: The findings suggest practical methods for improving the reliability of quantum state transfer in real-world applications.

Abstract: When studying the perfect transfer of a quantum state from one site to
another, it is typically assumed that one can receive the arriving state at a
specific instant in time, with perfect accuracy. Here, we study how sensitive
perfect state transfer is to that timing. We design engineered spin chains
which reduce their sensitivity, proving that this construction is
asymptotically optimal. The same construction is applied to the task of
creating superpositions, also known as fractional revival.

Motivation: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Errors in the current generation of quantum processors pose a significant
challenge towards practical-scale implementations of quantum machine learning
(QML) as they lead to trainability issues arising from noise-induced barren
plateaus, as well as performance degradations due to the noise accumulation in
deep circuits even when QML models are free from barren plateaus. Quantum error
correction (QEC) protocols are being developed to overcome hardware noise, but
their extremely high spacetime overheads, mainly due to magic state
distillation, make them infeasible for near-term practical implementation. This
work proposes the idea of partial quantum error correction (QEC) for quantum
machine learning (QML) models and identifies a sweet spot where distillations
are omitted to significantly reduce overhead. By assuming error-corrected
two-qubit CNOTs (Clifford operations), we demonstrate that the QML models
remain trainable even when single-qubit gates are subjected to $\approx0.2\%$
depolarizing noise, corresponding to a gate error rate of $\approx0.13\%$ under
randomized benchmarking. Further analysis based on various noise models, such
as phase-damping and thermal-dissipation channels at low temperature, indicates
that the QML models are trainable independent of the mean angle of
over-rotation, or can even be improved by thermal damping that purifies a
quantum state away from depolarizations. While it may take several years to
build quantum processors capable of fully fault-tolerant QML, our work proposes
a resource-efficient solution for trainable and high-accuracy QML
implementations in noisy environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two quantum Hamiltonian simulation algorithms for multiscale linear transport equations, combining Schrödingerization and exponential integrator methods with asymptotic-preserving schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide efficient quantum solutions for multiscale transport equations, which are challenging due to stiffness and require methods that can handle multiple scales effectively. This is relevant in physics and engineering where such equations commonly appear in kinetic theory.

Method: The authors combine the Schrödingerization method, an asymptotic-preserving scheme, and an exponential integrator within a Hamiltonian simulation framework. This integrated approach allows for stable and accurate simulations while managing stiff terms.

Result: The proposed algorithms significantly improve upon existing methods by reducing the query complexity to O(NvNx² log Nx), making them more efficient for solving multiscale linear transport equations. This is the first time such a combination has been achieved, marking a notable advancement in quantum algorithms for transport phenomena.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a successful integration of advanced numerical methods with quantum computing to address multiscale transport simulations, offering practical advantages and setting a new benchmark in computational efficiency for such problems.

Abstract: In this paper, we present two Hamiltonian simulation algorithms for
multiscale linear transport equations, combining the Schr\"odingerization
method [S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. Lett, 133 (2024), 230602][S. Jin,
N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. A, 108 (2023), 032603] and exponential integrator
while incorporating incoming boundary conditions. These two algorithms each
have advantages in terms of design easiness and scalability, and the query
complexity of both algorithms, $\mathcal{O}(N_vN_x^2\log N_x)$, outperforms
existing quantum and classical algorithms for solving this equation. In terms
of the theoretical framework, these are the first quantum Hamiltonian
simulation algorithms for multiscale linear transport equation to combine the
Schr\"odingerization method with an effective asymptotic-preserving schemes,
which are efficient for handling multiscale problems with stiff terms.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了 fluxonium 架构在支持高效、可靠的可扩展多体 gate 方面的潜力，为超导量子计算提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Fluxoniums have emerged as a compelling qubit modality for superconducting
quantum computing, owing to their strong anharmonicity and high coherence.
However, it remains to be seen whether the implementation of high-fidelity
entangling gates in a scalable manner will be achieved or not for fluxoniums.
Here, we show that fluxonium architectures with tunable plasmon interactions
have the capability to implement scalable multi-qubit gates natively while
remaining compatible with existing single- and two-qubit gate realizations.
Within the architecture, even though qubit states are decoupled, engineered
interactions in noncomputational manifolds can facilitate the realization of
$(C^{\otimes N})Z$ gates (for $N\geq 2$). This is accomplished by driving
qubit-state selective transitions into noncomputational manifolds. Our case
studies show that CCZ, CCCZ, and CCCCZ gates with errors of approximately 0.01
(0.001) are achievable, with gate lengths of $50\,(100)\,\text{ns}$,
$100\,(250)\,\text{ns}$, and $150\,(300)\,\text{ns}$, respectively. These
results underscore the potential of the fluxonium architecture for scalable
quantum computation through fast, high-fidelity native multi-qubit gates.

Abstract: $k$-Uniform states are fundamental to quantum information and computing, with
applications in multipartite entanglement and quantum error-correcting codes
(QECCs). Prior work has primarily focused on constructing exact $k$-uniform
states or proving their nonexistence. However, due to inevitable theoretical
approximations and experimental imperfections, generating exact $k$-uniform
states is neither feasible nor necessary in practice. In this work, we initiate
the study of approximate $k$-uniform states, demonstrating that they are
locally indistinguishable from their exact counterparts unless massive
measurements are performed. We prove that such states can be constructed with
high probability from the Haar-random ensemble and, more efficiently, via
shallow random quantum circuits. Furthermore, we establish a connection between
approximate $k$-uniform states and approximate QECCs, showing that Haar random
constructions yield high-performance codes with linear rates, vanishing
proximity, and exponentially small failure probability while random circuits
can't construct codes with linear code rate in shallow depth. Finally, we
investigate the relationship between approximate QECCs and approximate quantum
information masking. Our work lays the foundation for the practical application
of $k$-uniform states.

Abstract: The growing variety of quantum hardware technologies, each with unique
peculiarities such as connectivity and native gate sets, creates challenges
when selecting the best platform for executing a specific quantum circuit. This
selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the
circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as
circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally
expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors
increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based
predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498
quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using
Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv,
IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte).
Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate
fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on
the trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting
platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids
extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it
as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making
process and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4%
accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting
the best compilation target. The developed code is publicly available on GitHub

Result: 获得了有效控制波包传播时间的方法，避免违背速度极限。

Conclusion: 提出使用MZI解决隧道时间问题操作方法，确认在量子力学中避免超 luminal 或负时间。

Abstract: Controversy surrounding the "tunnelling time problem" stems from the seeming
inability of quantum mechanics to provide, in the usual way, a definition of
the duration a particle is supposed to spend in a given region of space. For
this reason, the problem is often approached from an "operational" angle. One
such approach uses the position of the transmitted wave packet in order to
infer the duration the particle spends in the barrier. Here we replace the
barrier with a tuneable Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). With this analogy
one is able, at least in principle, to achieve any advance or delay of the wave
packet sent to the chosen outgoing port. The Uncertainty Principle prevents one
from combining the durations spent in each arm the MZI into a meaningful
duration when both arms are engaged. There is no justification for invoking
"superluminal" or "negative" times, since the particle is able to arrive at the
same position (and with a higher probability) if the same initial state
propagates through only one arm of the MZI. The same is true, we argue, in the
case of tunnelling,
  where the transmitted wave packet results from destructive interference
between multiple copies of the free state, delayed relative to the free
propagation

Result: 研究结果表明，基于unitary的协议因避免中间测量和经典前馈计算，在当前的NISQ设备上表现更好。而基于测量的协议在未来的更可靠量子设备上预期会表现更好。在连通性限制下，两种方法的效果都有明确的方向性。

Conclusion: 建议在当前情况下优先使用基于unitary的协议，但在未来更可靠、更低噪声的设备架构下，基于测量的协议将成为GHZ态生成的更优选择。这对设计量子计算机的算法和应用具有重要参考价值。incipiently

Abstract: In this work, we focus on GHZ state generation under the practical constraint
of limited qubit connectivity, a hallmark of current NISQ hardware. We study
the GHZ state preparation across different connectivity graphs inspired by IBM
and Google chip architectures, as well as random graphs that reflect
distributed quantum systems. Our approach is a measurement-based protocol
designed to utilize qubit connectivity constraints for the generation of GHZ
states on NISQ devices. We benchmark this against a tailored version of
state-of-the-art unitary-based protocols, also incorporating physical
connectivity limitations. To evaluate the performance of the protocols under
realistic conditions, we conducted implementations on the IBM Eagle r3 chip.
Additionally, to explore near-term scalability, we performed simulations across
a range of graph sizes and connectivity configurations, assessing performance
based on circuit depth, the number of two-qubit gates, and measurement
overhead. We observe a trade-off between the two protocols across different
figures of merit. For current state-of-the-art NISQ architectures, the
unitary-based protocol is more suitable, as it avoids mid-circuit measurements
and classical feedforward. However, the measurement-based protocol is expected
to become more advantageous in the future with more error-resilient quantum
devices, owing to its reduced circuit depth and consequently shorter execution
times. In both settings, our proposed method provides an efficient means of
leveraging the topology of qubit connections available on a given device.

Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the quantum electrodynamic coupled cluster
(QED-CC)wave function ansatz, to describe the strongly coupled light-matter
system in an unpolarized optical Fabry-P\'erot cavity. This is achieved by
explicitly treating two cavity modes in our calculation with perpendicular
polarizations and demonstrate that this ansatz preserves the symmetry of an
unpolarized cavity. Furthermore, exploiting point-group symmetry enables the
assignment of polaritonic excited states as well as their targeted calculation.
Using our implementation, the aromatic species benzene, fluorobenzene and
azulene are investigated. We demonstrate that molecules in unpolarized cavities
have a complicated excited-state landscapes with a plethora of
avoided-crossings. We compare the results for a cavity with a single
polarization to those of an unpolarized cavity described by two perpendicular
polarization vectors using the excited states of the H$_2$ molecule as an
example.

*Fariha Azad,Matteo Inajetovic,Stefan Kühn,Anna Pappa*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for Z₂ lattice gauge theory (LGT), showing promising results in finding gauge-invariant ground states and observing string breaking on IBM's quantum platform. The approach avoids explicit gauge invariance enforcement and has favorable scaling properties, suggesting potential applications for other gauge groups and addressing the challenge of avoiding barren plateaus in quantum computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying gauge theories like Z₂ LGT is important for advancing our understanding of quantum chromodynamics and other areas in theoretical physics. The paper aims to develop efficient quantum methods to simulate these theories, which are complex and challenging to model using classical computers.

Method: The authors developed a VQE specifically designed for Z₂ lattice gauge theory. It uses a two-leg ladder lattice with Kogut-Susskind staggered fermions. To analyze the results, they employed tensor network methods for verification. The simulations were conducted on IBM's quantum platform, and specific strategies were used to avoid barren plateaus by initializing the system in the Gauss law sector and restricting the Hilbert space to the gauge-invariant subspace.

Result: The study demonstrates that the VQE successfully finds gauge-invariant ground states across varying Hamiltonian parameter regimes and in the presence of external charges. The method also shows the ability to observe string breaking, achieved through experiments on a quantum platform. Additionally, the scaling of gradients with the number of qubits is favorable, suggesting scalability. However, classical simulation of Z₂ LGT remains a challenge, and the inherent features of LGTs, such as initialization strategies that respect Gauss law, naturally mitigate the issue of avoiding barren plateaus.

Conclusion: The proposed VQE offers a promising approach for studying Z₂ lattice gauge theories, with potential extensions to other gauge groups. The findings suggest that quantum simulations could be enhanced by incorporating strategies that avoid barren plateaus, leveraging the inherent properties of lattice gauge theories for efficient computation.

Abstract: In this work, we design a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) suitable for
investigating ground states and static string breaking in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
lattice gauge theory (LGT). We consider a two-leg ladder lattice coupled to
Kogut-Susskind staggered fermions and verify the results of the VQE simulations
using tensor network methods. We find that for varying Hamiltonian parameter
regimes and in the presence of external charges, the VQE is able to arrive at
the gauge-invariant ground state without explicitly enforcing gauge invariance
through penalty terms. Additionally, experiments showing string breaking are
performed on IBM's quantum platform. Thus, VQEs are seen to be a promising tool
for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs, and could pave the way for studies of other gauge
groups. We find that the scaling of gradients with the number of qubits is
favorable for avoiding barren plateaus. At the same time, it is not clear how
to efficiently simulate the LGT using classical methods. Furthermore,
strategies that avoid barren plateaus arise naturally as features of LGTs, such
as choosing the initialization by setting the Gauss law sector and restricting
the Hilbert space to the gauge-invariant subspace.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing credit risk is critical for financial institutions, and offering a quadratic speed-up with quantum computing presents an opportunity. The need to efficiently scale quantum implementations is a significant focus, as quantum circuits are costly and complex.

Method: The paper applies QSVT to decrease the cost of the state preparation operator within QAE. They develop an end-to-end code and perform simulations to showcase the benefits.

Result: The simulation results validate the proposed approach and highlight its benefits.

Conclusion: The study suggests QSVT could be a valuable method for enhancing the efficiency and feasibility of quantum-based credit risk analysis applications.

Abstract: The analysis of credit risk is crucial for the efficient operation of
financial institutions. Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) offers the potential
for a quadratic speed-up over classical methods used to estimate metrics such
as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). However, numerous
limitations remain in efficiently scaling the implementation of quantum
circuits that solve these estimation problems. One of the main challenges is
the use of costly and restrictive arithmetic that must be implemented within
the quantum circuit. In this paper, we propose using Quantum Singular Value
Transformation (QSVT) to significantly reduce the cost of implementing the
state preparation operator, which underlies QAE for credit risk analysis. We
also present an end-to-end code implementation and the results of a simulation
study to validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its benefits.

Abstract: Quantum computers are often treated as experimental add-ons that are loosely
coupled to classical infrastructure through high-level interpreted languages
and cloud-like orchestration. However, future deployments in both,
high-performance computing (HPC) and embedded environments, will demand tighter
integration for lower latencies, stronger determinism, and architectural
consistency, as well as to implement error correction and other tasks that
require tight quantum-classical interaction as generically as possible.
  We propose a vertically integrated quantum systems architecture that treats
quantum accelerators and processing units as peripheral system components. A
central element is the Quantum Abstraction Layer (QAL) at operating system
kernel level. It aims at real-time, low-latency, and high-throughput
interaction between quantum and classical resources, as well as robust
low-level quantum operations scheduling and generic resource management. It can
serve as blueprint for orchestration of low-level computational components
"around" a QPU (and inside a quantum computer), and across different
modalities.
  We present first results towards such an integrated architecture, including a
virtual QPU model based on QEMU. The architecture is validated through
functional emulation on three base architectures (x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V),
and timing-accurate FPGA-based simulations. This allows for a realistic
evaluation of hybrid system performance and quantum advantage scenarios. Our
work lays the ground for a system-level co-design methodology tailored for the
next generation of quantum-classical computing.

TL;DR: The paper presents resource-efficient, low-depth quantum circuit designs, specifically for Hadamard tests and parameterized ansatz, which reduce gate counts and maintain accuracy. They test these on Burgers' dynamics, demonstrating successful quantum state preparation with high fidelity, even in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of quantum circuit depth and resource usage, which are crimped by noise and decoherence, especially for NISQ devices. The effectiveness of variational algorithms in solving practical problems, like Burgers' equation, is demonstrated through tailored quantum circuits.

Method: The authors implemented a low-depth Hadamard test circuit and developed a parameterized quantum ansatz for variational algorithms. They tested this on NISQ hardware, specifically the IBEX Q1 trapped-ion processor, to validate the fidelity of quantum states despite noise.

Result: The low-depth structures reduced gate counts by significant margins while maintaining the fidelity of generated quantum states, and the variational algorithm showed high overlap with classical simulations, proving its practical effectiveness despite hardware noise.

Conclusion: This work offers a promising framework for resource-efficient quantum computation, particularly for variational algorithms, addressing scalability and noise issues in NISQ devices.

Abstract: Resource-efficient, low-depth implementations of quantum circuits remain a
promising strategy for achieving reliable and scalable computation on quantum
hardware, as they reduce gate resources and limit the accumulation of noisy
operations. Here, we propose a low-depth implementation of a class of Hadamard
test circuits, complemented by the development of a parameterized quantum
ansatz specifically tailored for variational algorithms that exploit the
underlying Hadamard test framework. Our findings demonstrate a significant
reduction in single- and two-qubit gate counts, suggesting a reliable circuit
architecture for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Building on
this foundation, we tested our low-depth scheme to investigate the expressive
capacity of the proposed parameterized ansatz in simulating nonlinear Burgers'
dynamics. The resulting variational quantum states faithfully capture the
shockwave feature of the turbulent regime and maintain high overlaps with
classical benchmarks, underscoring the practical effectiveness of our
framework. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of hardware noise by modeling
the error properties of real quantum processors and by executing the
variational algorithm on a trapped-ion-based IBEX Q1 device. The outcomes of
our demonstrations highlight the resilience of our low-depth scheme in the
turbulent regime, consistently preparing high-fidelity variational states that
exhibit strong agreement with classical benchmarks. Our work contributes to the
advancement of resource-efficient strategies for quantum computation, offering
a robust framework for tackling a range of computationally intensive problems

Abstract: Establishing a notion of the quantum state that applies consistently across
space and time is a crucial step toward formulating a relativistic quantum
theory. We give an operational meaning to multipartite quantum states over
arbitrary regions in spacetime through the causally agnostic measurement, the
measurement scheme that can be consistently implemented independently of the
causal relation between the regions. We prove that such measurements can always
be implemented with interferometry, wherein the conventional density operator,
the recently developed quantum state over time (QSOT), and the process matrix
formalisms smoothly merge. This framework allows for a systematic study of
mixed states in the temporal setting, which turn out to be crucial for modeling
quantum non-Markovianity. Based on this, we demonstrate that two different
ensembles of quantum dynamics can be represented by the same QSOT, indicating
that they cannot be distinguished through interferometry. Moreover, our
formalism reveals a new type of spatiotemporal correlation between two quantum
dynamics that originates from synchronized propagation in time under
time-reversal symmetry. We show that quantum systems with such correlation can
be utilized as a reference frame to distinguish certain dynamics
indistinguishable under time-reversal symmetry.

### [69] [On the Discretization Error of the Discrete Generalized Quantum Master Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19323)
*Ruojing Peng,Lachlan P. Lindoy,Joonho Lee*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the transfer tensor method (TTM) for modeling non-Markovian quantum dynamics, highlighting an initial time correction discrepancy and proposing a consistent relationship with the continuous-time kernel, validated through the spin-boson model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding non-Markovian dynamics in quantum systems is crucial for accurate simulations. This paper addresses a specific inconsistency in TTM and proposes a relationship with the continuous kernel, which is vital for validating the method's accuracy and applicability.

Method: The authors analytically derived relationships, developed numerical methods for validation, and applied these to the spin-boson model with varying time steps to test convergence.

Result: The TTM method achieves accurate memory kernel reconstructions and dynamics as the time step decreases, validating its consistency despite initial concerns. Alternative schemes are noted but not the focus of this paper.

Conclusion: TTM is a consistent and reliable method for discretizing the Nakajima-Zwanzig equation, and future work should compare it with alternative schemes for optimal applications.

Abstract: The transfer tensor method (TTM) [Cerrillo and Cao, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2014,
112, 110401] can be considered a discrete-time formulation of the
Nakajima-Zwanzig quantum master equation (NZ-QME) for modeling non-Markovian
quantum dynamics. A recent paper [Makri, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2025, 21,
5037] raised concerns regarding the consistency of the TTM discretization,
particularly a spurious term at the initial time \( t=0 \). This Communication
presents a detailed analysis of the discretization structure of TTM, clarifying
the origin of the initial-time correction and establishing a consistent
relationship between the TTM discrete-time memory kernel \( K_N \), and the
continuous-time NZ-QME kernel \( \mathcal{K}(N\Delta t) \). This relationship
is validated numerically using the spin-boson model, demonstrating convergence
of reconstructed memory kernels and accurate dynamical evolution as \( \Delta t
\to 0 \). While TTM provides a consistent discretization, we note that
alternative schemes are also viable, such as the midpoint derivative/midpoint
integral scheme proposed in Makri's work. The relative performance of various
schemes for either computing accurate \( \mathcal{K}(N\Delta t) \) from exact
dynamics, or obtaining accurate dynamics from exact \( \mathcal{K}(N\Delta t)
\), warrants further investigation.

*Zecheng Li,Chunhao Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces an improved quantum algorithm for simulating time-dependent Hamiltonian evolution, which is more efficient than previous methods by addressing evolution time and precision requirements with Duhamel's principle and Gaussian quadrature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses a critical area in quantum computing, specifically the simulation of time-dependent systems, which has broad applications in physics, chemistry, and potentially other fields requiring precise quantum dynamics modeling.

Method: The researchers employ a discrete clock Hamiltonian construction, inspired by their previous work, and enhance the algorithm by using Duhamel's principle and Gaussian quadrature to optimize performance in terms of evolution time and precision.

Result: The outcome is an algorithm that matches the best existing simulation approaches in complexity while improving upon earlier techniques by better handling evolution time and precision.

Conclusion: This advancement simplifies the simulation framework, offering a promising new direction for modeling and simulating time-dependent systems in quantum computing.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept quantum algorithm for simulating
time-dependent Hamiltonian evolution by reducing the problem to simulating a
time-independent Hamiltonian in a larger space using a discrete clock
Hamiltonian construction. A similar construction was first explored for this
simulation problem by Watkins, Wiebe, Roggero, and Lee [PRX Quantum, 2024]. Our
algorithm improves upon their work in terms of the dependence on evolution time
and precision. In addition, the complexity matches the state-of-the-art
simulation algorithms using other approaches. To achieve this improvement, we
use Duhamel's principle to treat the clock and system Hamiltonians separately
and exploit properties of Gaussian quadrature to reduce the simulation cost.
Our approach demonstrates that time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation can be as
efficient in a simpler framework and hence provides a new angle to model and
simulate time-dependent systems.

*Eric R. Bittner,Bhavay Tyagi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses noise-induced synchronization and coherence protection in open quantum systems, highlighting how correlated environments can protect quantum states through symmetry controls and correlations, with implications for quantum devices and biological systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding noise-induced effects in quantum systems is crucial for developing robust quantum technologies and understanding natural phenomena.

Method: The paper uses Lindblad equations to model open quantum systems, analyzing symmetry and environmental correlations to derive decoherence and coherence protection mechanisms.

Result: The result shows that symmetry in noise correlations protects specific modes, leading to phenomena like entanglement and phase locking. Decoherence scales with environment parameters and can protect coherence under certain conditions.

Conclusion: This work unifies classical and quantum synchronization concepts, offering insights into noise roles in quantum sensing and biological systems, suggesting new ways to protect coherence in complex environments.

Abstract: We present a concise review and perspective on noise-induced synchronization
and coherence protection in open quantum systems, with emphasis on recent work
involving coupled spins, oscillators, and anyons. When local environments
exhibit internal correlations, the structure of the noise determines which
collective modes become decoherence-protected. This leads to steady-state
entanglement, phase locking, and exceptional points (EPs) in the Liouvillian
spectrum, signaling a collapse of the mode basis and the emergence of
non-dissipative stabilized dynamics. Using a Lindblad framework, we show that
symmetry in the noise correlations acts as a control parameter, protecting
symmetric or antisymmetric modes depending on the sign of the correlation. In
the pure-dephasing limit, coherence decay mirrors the Anderson-Kubo model,
where the effective fluctuation strength scales as $\sigma^2(1 \pm \xi)$, and
the dynamical regime (Gaussian vs. Lorentzian) is set by the ratio \( \sigma /
\gamma \). Thus, the environment not only drives decoherence but can also
selectively suppress it through symmetry filtering. We also revisit historical
and conceptual origins of this idea, beginning with Huygens synchronized
pendulum clocks and culminating in modern non-Hermitian dynamics. Correlated
noise-though classically stochastic-can organize quantum dynamics and protect
coherence without direct control over the system. These insights offer a
unifying view of synchronization in classical and quantum regimes, with
implications for quantum sensing, engineered decoherence, and long-lived
coherence in complex environments such as biological light-harvesting complexes
or avian magnetoreception.

Abstract: Modelling and predicting protein configurations is crucial for advancing drug
discovery, enabling the design of treatments for life-threatening diseases. A
critical aspect of this challenge is rotamer optimisation - the determination
of optimal side-chain conformations given a fixed protein backbone. This
problem, involving the internal degrees of freedom of amino acid side-chains,
significantly influences the protein's overall structure and function. In this
work, we develop a resource-efficient optimisation algorithm to compute the
ground state energy of protein structures, with a focus on side-chain
configuration. We formulate the rotamer optimisation problem as a Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimisation problem and map it to an Ising model,
enabling efficient quantum encoding. Building on this formulation, we propose a
quantum algorithm based on the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm to
explore the conformational space and identify low-energy configurations. To
benchmark our approach, we conduct a classical study using custom-built
libraries tailored for structural characterisation and energy optimisation. Our
quantum method demonstrates a reduction in computational cost compared to
classical simulated annealing techniques, offering a scalable and promising
framework for protein structure optimisation in the quantum era.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using multiport interferometers and other tools to generate any multimode multiphoton state with controlled steps, leveraging tensor decomposition and photon catalysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The achievement of generating exactly controlled photonic states is crucial for advancing quantum technologies like computing and sensing.

Method: The method connects photonic quantum state engineering with algebraic tensor decomposition, employing symmetric tensors and algebraic geometry results to create a procedure involving interferometers, detectors, photon additions, and displacements.

Result: The method achieves 100% fidelity, outperforming existing techniques in generating these states.

Conclusion: This breakthrough offers a reliable, scalable approach for quantum technologies relying on complex photonic states.

Abstract: Multimode multiphoton states are at the center of many photonic quantum
technologies, from photonic quantum computing to quantum sensing. In this work,
we derive a procedure to generate exactly, and with a controlled number of
steps, any such state by using only multiport interferometers, photon number
resolving detectors, photon additions, and displacements. We achieve this goal
by establishing a connection between photonic quantum state engineering and the
algebraic problem of symmetric tensor decomposition. This connection allows us
to solve the problem by using corresponding results from algebraic geometry and
unveils a mechanism of photon catalysis, where photons are injected and
subsequently retrieved in measurements, to generate entanglement that cannot be
obtained through Gaussian operations. We also introduce a tensor decomposition,
that generalizes our method and allows to construct optimal circuits for
particular classes of states. As a benchmark, we numerically evaluate our
method and compare its performance with state-of-the art results, confirming
100% fidelity on different classes of states.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于iSWAP门的新量子低密度奇偶校验（qLDPC）码，称为定向码，性能优于旋转平面码（RPC）且满足方形网格和稀疏的六边形网格的连通性需求。通过超级导体量子比特电路级别的 Pauli 错误模型进行数值评估，发现定向码在p=1e-3时，比RPC在25-66.67%的物理量子比特下具有更好的纠错性能。研究认为长距离高连通性的硬件可能不是低 overhead 量子计算所需的必要条件。

Motivation: 量子纠错码是量子计算中的基础，低密度奇偶校验（qLDPC）码因其高效性受到关注。探索如何设计高效纠错码，同时满足硬件连通性需求，具有重要意义。

Method: 研究者使用iSWAP门构建量子码，解决了测不相邻位的门路问题，并通过诚实错误的模型评估性能。

Result: 定向码在相同错误率下，比RPC和BB码更高效。

Conclusion: 定向码突破了在低时重计算容错量子计算中的必要性。

Abstract: In this paper we construct a new family of quantum low-density parity-check
(qLDPC) codes, which we call ``Directional Codes'', that outperforms the
rotated planar code (RPC) while naturally meeting the connectivity requirements
of the widely adopted square-grid, and some even the sparser hexagonal-grid.
The key idea is to utilise the iSWAP gate -- a natural native gate for
superconducting qubits -- to construct circuits that measure the stabilisers of
these qLDPC codes without the need for any long-range connections or an
increased degree of connectivity. We numerically evaluate the performance of
directional codes, encoding four, six and twelve logical qubits, using a common
superconducting-inspired circuit-level Pauli noise model. We also compare them
to the RPC and to the bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, currently the two most
popular quantum LDPC code families. As a concrete example, directional codes
outperform RPC by achieving better QEC performance at physical error rate
$p=10^{-3}$ using only $25-66.67\%$ of the physical qubits at distance up to
$10$. Our discovery represents a breakthrough in QEC code design that suggests
complex long-range, high-connectivity hardware may not be necessary for
low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation.

is to find the hidden shift. We analyze the success probability of our
algorithms when using a constant number of queries. For bent functions, they
succeed with probability 1, while for arbitrary functions the success
probability depends on the `bentness' of the function.

Result: 在二分系统中，几乎不可能通过随机量子位移实现AQIM；而在多分系统中，则可以实现。同时，AQIM与量子纠错码相关联。

Conclusion: AQIM应成为量子信息理论的核心概念，跨越信息处理多个领域。

Abstract: Masking information into quantum correlations is a cornerstone of many
quantum information applications. While there exist the no-hiding and
no-masking theorems, approximate quantum information masking (AQIM) offers a
promising means of circumventing the constraints. Despite its potential, AQIM
still remains underexplored, and constructing explicit approximate maskers
remains a challenge. In this work, we investigate AQIM from multiple
perspectives and propose using random isometries to construct approximate
maskers. First, different notions of AQIM are introduced and we find there are
profound intrinsic connections among them. These relationships are
characterized by a set of figures of merit, which are introduced to quantify
the deviation of AQIM from exact QIM. We then explore the possibility of
realizing AQIM via random isometries in bipartite and multipartite systems. In
bipartite systems, we identify a fundamental lower bound for a key figure of
merit, implying that almost all random isometries fail to realize AQIM. This
surprising result generalizes the original no-masking theorem to the
no-random-AQIM theorem for bipartite systems. In contrast, in multipartite
systems, we show almost all random isometries can realize AQIM. Remarkably, the
number of physical qubits required to randomly mask a single logical qubit
scales only linearly. We further explore the implications of these findings. In
particular, we show that, under certain conditions, approximate quantum error
correction is equivalent to AQIM. Consequently, AQIM naturally gives rise to
approximate quantum error correction codes with constant code rates and
exponentially small correction inaccuracies. Overall, our results establish
quantum information masking as a central concept in quantum information theory,
bridging diverse notions across multiple domains.

TL;DR: The paper explores driven-dissipative dynamics of two-level emitters coupled to a single photonic mode, considering disorder in resonant frequencies. It introduces subradiant correlations, which are long-lived states with oscillatory decay, immune to fluctuations and existing in finite-size systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding driven-dissipative systems with disorder is crucial for quantum optics and non-equilibrium physics.

Method: Theor. study using Liouvillian eigenvalues and Dicke phase analysis.

Result: Subradiant correlations longer-lived than usual, immune to disorder fluctuations and present in finite-size systems.

Conclusion: Implications for designing quantum devices that maintain coherence despite disorder.

Abstract: We study theoretically the driven-dissipative dynamics of an array of
two-level emitters, coupled to a single photonic mode, in the presence of
disorder in the resonant frequencies. We introduce the notion of subradiant
correlations in the dynamics, corresponding to the eigenstates of the
Liouvillian with a low decay rate, that can also oscillate in time. While the
usual collective subradiant states do not survive the emitter resonant
frequency fluctuations, these subradiant correlations are immune to such a type
of disorder. These long-living correlations exist in finite-size systems, when
their lifetime is parametrically longer than in the so-called Dicke time
crystal phase.

three directions using wavelength-shifting fibers coupled to silicon
photomultipliers. We developed and optimized WbLS samples for this application
and measured their light yield using cosmic-ray muons. Subsequently, we
constructed a prototype of the WbLS tracking detector and evaluated its
performance with a positron beam. The beam test demonstrated good tracking
performance, although the light yield was lower than required. The result
prompted a review of the surfactant used in the WbLS and the material of the
optical separators, leading to a significant improvement in light yield. In

TL;DR: The paper introduces MaLBEC, a machine learning algorithm that efficiently and accurately calculates neutron activation analysis (NAA) efficiencies for fusion reactors, reducing computation time by 99.96% compared to MCNP while maintaining accuracy within 5% for efficiency values and 3% for activity calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutron flux measurement is critical for sustaining fusion reactions, and MaLBEC offers a faster alternative to traditional methods while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The authors developed MaLBEC using supervised machine learning techniques, inputting four variables to calculate efficiency values. The performance was tested by comparing with MCNP method.

Result: MaLBEC reduces computation time by 99.96% with efficiency values within 5% of MCNP and activity calculations within 3%.

Conclusion: MaLBEC is a highly effective and efficient tool for NAA in fusion research with significant computational advantages.

Abstract: Diagnostics are critical for commercial and research fusion machines, since
measuring and understanding plasma features is important to sustaining fusion
reactions. The neutron flux (and therefore fusion power) can be indirectly
calculated using neutron activation analyses, where potentially large numbers
of activation foils are placed in the neutron flux, and delayed gammas from key
reactions are measured via gamma spectrometry. In gamma spectrometry, absolute
efficiency forms part of the activity calculation, and equals to the ratio of
the total number of photons detected to the number emitted by a radioactive
sample. Hence, it is imperative that they are calculated efficiently and
accurately. This paper presents a novel digital efficiency calculation
algorithm, the Machine Learning Based Efficiency Calculator (MaLBEC), that uses
state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques to calculate efficiency
values of a given sample, from only four inputs. In this paper, the performance
of the MaLBEC is demonstrated with a fusion sample and compares the values to a
traditional efficiency calculation method, Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP). The
efficiencies from the MaLBEC were within an average 5\% of the ones produced by
MCNP, but with an exceptional reduction in computation time of 99.96\%. When
the efficiency values from both methods were used in the activity calculation,
the MaLBEC was within 3\% of the MCNP results.

Abstract: We report a detailed study of post-collision interaction (PCI) in a liquid
medium. We investigate PCI for the Auger KLL electrons of solvated Cl$^-$,
K$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$. All three isoelectronic ions exhibit a very similar PCI
behavior, which is little affected by changing the solvent from water to
methanol or ethanol. The two main factors modifying the PCI interaction in
condensed media is the screening of Coulombic interactions, and scattering of
the electrons. The experimental results are compared with the predictions of a
previously reported semi-classical PCI theory modified to account for screening
and scattering. We show that a better agreement with experiment can be obtained
by instead modeling scattering using electron transport Monte-Carlo
simulations. We suggest that, in turn, PCI experimental data could be used as
another experimental constraint to refine the currently insufficiently
well-known scattering parameters of low-energy electrons in water, which are
crucial in many fields.

approximate fragmented Hamiltonian and correlated sampling to reduce cost
scaling to the point that it is essentially linear with system size, with the
potential to go sub-linear if certain conditions are met. In tests on bond
stretching energies in alcohols and hydrogen dimer chains, we observe the
anticipated linear scaling as well as an explicit cost crossover with standard

*Hui Jiang,Juanjuan Zhang,Tianyu Wang,Jiawei Peng,Cheng Jin,Xiao Zou,Pengfei Zhu,Tao Jiang,Zhenggang Lan,Haiwang Yong,FengHe,Dao Xiang*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method combining ultrafast electron diffraction and a super-resolution algorithm to study molecular dynamics near conical intersections, achieving sub-angstrom resolution and revealing details about bond length differences and traversal times in a ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and visualizing molecular dynamics near complex quantum states, like conical intersections, is crucial for advancing chemical physics and quantum dynamics studies. This paper addresses a key challenge in the field by developing a technique that combines high-resolution imaging with algorithmic enhancements.

Method: The method combines mega-electron-volt ultrafast electron diffraction, known for its high temporal resolution, with a super-resolution real-space inversion algorithm. This allows for super-resolved visualization of nuclear and electronic motions near conical intersections beyond the diffraction limit.

Result: The technique successfully visualized transient structures near conical intersections in a 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring-opening reaction with sub-angstrom resolution. It revealed a bond length difference less than 0.4 Å and a traversal time of about 30 femtoseconds between the two conical intersections.

Conclusion: This research paves the way for a new approach in studying ultrafast quantum dynamics, enabling detailed exploration of molecular processes at the most fundamental level, with potential applications in various fields of chemistry and physics.

Abstract: Conical intersections play a pivotal role in excited-state quantum dynamics.
Capturing transient molecular structures near conical intersections remains
challenging due to the rapid timescales and subtle structural changes involved.
We overcome this by combining the enhanced temporal resolution of
mega-electron-volt ultrafast electron diffraction with a super-resolution
real-space inversion algorithm, enabling visualization of nuclear and
electronic motions at conical intersections with sub-angstrom resolution,
surpassing the diffraction limit. We apply this technique to the textbook
example of the ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which proceeds
through two conical intersections within 100 femtoseconds. The super-resolved
transient structures near conical intersections reveal a C-C bond length
difference of less than 0.4 angstrom and an approximately 30-femtosecond
traversal time of the nuclear wave packet between them. These findings
establish super-resolution ultrafast scattering as a transformative tool for
uncovering quantum dynamics in molecules and open new avenues for studying
light-matter interactions at the most fundamental level.

*Cangtao Yin,Silvan Käser,Meenu Upadhyay,Markus Meuwly*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents atomistic simulations of the H2COO intermediate, focusing on vibrational excitation above the barrier for hydrogen transfer. Quantitative branching ratios into HCO+OH, CO2+H2, and H2O+CO are determined, with HCO+OH being rare (~2%). Other product channels are more accessible (~30% and ~20%). Slow IVR redistribution keeps 40% in reactants. The pathway to CO2+H2 involves a bifurcating route through formic acid. Machine learning enhances understanding of atmospheric gas-phase reactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on reaction dynamics of the H2COO intermediate, which is vital for understanding atmospheric chemistry and energy transfer processes. The study combines molecular dynamics with machine learning techniques to provide detailed product distributions and reaction pathways. This contributes to modeling atmospheric reactions that are challenging to predict with traditional methods.

Method: The researchers conducted extensive MD simulations using a neural network-represented energy function derived from CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ data. They analyzed branching ratios and pathways for vibrational excitation near the reaction barrier. A bifurcation in the reaction pathway was identified, and machine learning accelerated the simulations to capture long-term dynamics.

Result: The simulations reveal that HCO+OH formation is rare, while the other products are more prevalent. The reaction pathway through formic acid is a significant route for CO2+H2 formation. Molecular dynamics with machine learning accurately predicted branching ratios and reaction pathways, demonstrating the potential of ML in studying complex atmospheric reactions.

Conclusion: This study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the H2COO intermediate in atmospheric conditions. The integration of machine learning with traditional MD enhances the understanding of reaction mechanisms and offers a promising approach for modeling similar systems in atmospheric chemistry.

Abstract: The end-to-end dynamics of the smallest energized Criegee intermediate,
H$_2$COO, was characterized for vibrational excitation close to and a few
kcal/mol above the barrier for hydrogen transfer. From an aggregate of at least
5 $\mu$s of molecular dynamics simulations using a neural
network-representation of CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ reference data, the branching
ratios into molecular products HCO+OH, CO$_2$+H$_2$, or H$_2$O+CO was
quantitatively determined. Consistent with earlier calculations and recent
experiments, decay into HCO+OH was found to be rare $(\sim 2 \%)$ whereas the
other two molecular product channels are accessed with fractions of $\sim 30
\%$ and $\sim 20 \%$, respectively. On the 1 ns time scale, which was the
length of an individual MD simulation, more than 40 \% of the systems remain in
the reactant state due to partial intramolecular vibrational redistribution
(IVR). Formation of CO$_2$+H$_2$ occurs through a bifurcating pathway, one of
which passes through formic acid whereas the more probable route connects the
di-radical OCH$_2$O with the product through a low-lying transition state.
Notably, none of the intermediates along the pathway accumulate and their
maximum concentration always remains well below 5 \%. This work demonstrates
that atomistic simulations with global reactive machine-learned energy
functions provide a quantitative understanding of the chemistry and reaction
dynamics for atmospheric reactions in the gas phase.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates how pH affects fluorescence in L-Lysine assemblies, showing an enhancement in fluorescence as pH increases from acidic to basic conditions, linked to differences in protonation and decay pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding pH effects on fluorescence in amino acid assemblies is crucial for developing pH-responsive optical materials for non-invasive biophysical applications.

Method: The study combines experiments and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations to analyze fluorescence changes in L-Lysine under various pH conditions through microscopy and steady-state measurements.

Result: Fluorescence increases with pH, with enhanced protonation under acidic conditions leading to non-radiative decay pathways and brightness dependent on distinct protonation states.

Conclusion: Protonation and counterion effects control fluorescence, enabling the design of pH-responsive optical materials based on amino acids.

Abstract: There is currently a growing interest in understanding the origins of
intrinsic fluorescence as a way to design non-invasive probes for biophysical
processes. In this regard, understanding how pH influences fluorescence in
non-aromatic biomolecular assemblies is key to controlling their optical
properties in realistic cellular conditions. Here, we combine experiments and
theory to investigate the pH-dependent emission of solid-state L-Lysine (Lys).
Lys aggregates prepared at different pH values using HCl and H$_2$SO$_4$
exhibit protonation- and counterion-dependent morphology and fluorescence, as
shown by microscopy and steady-state measurements. We find an enhancement in
the fluorescence moving from acidic to basic conditions. To uncover the
molecular origin of these trends, we performed non-adiabatic molecular dynamics
simulations on three Lys crystal models representing distinct protonation
states. Our simulations indicate that enhanced protonation under acidic
conditions facilitates non-radiative decay via proton transfer, whereas basic
conditions favor radiative decay. These findings highlight pH as a key factor
tuning fluorescence in Lys assemblies, offering insights for designing pH
responsive optical materials based on non-aromatic amino acids.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces an ML tool using neural networks to model rotational transitions of water molecules in collisions, which is traditionally computationally expensive. They use a mixed quantum-classical approach, train NNs on a small dataset, and achieve good accuracy compared to full MQCT calculations with a 13.5% deviation. The methodology is generalizable to other complex molecules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the rotational transitions of water molecules is crucial for astrophysical studies. However, computational quantum methods are too expensive. This paper presents an efficient ML approach, which could greatly enhance our ability to model such systems, making it possible to study other complex molecules as well.

Method: The authors used a machine learning approach with neural networks. They employed data computed using a mixed quantum-classical theory (MQCT), trained neural networks on a small subset of this data, and validated the models. They considered various data architectures for different collision energies and molecular symmetries, and optimized their training and validation datasets to improve prediction accuracy.

Result: The ML model was effective, achieving an average relative root mean square error of 0.409 and an average percent deviation of about 13.5% compared to full MQCT calculations. The models were efficient and accurate enough, and the methodology was found to be robust and applicable to other complex molecular systems.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a promising approach for modeling rotational transitions in water molecules using ML, which could be widely applicable to other complex molecules, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Water (H$_2$O) is one of the most abundant molecules in the universe and is
found in a wide variety of astrophysical environments. Rotational transitions
in H$_2$O + H$_2$O collisions are important in modeling environments rich in
water molecules but they are computationally intractable using quantum
mechanical methods. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) tool using an
ensemble of neural networks (NNs) to predict cross sections to construct a
database of rate coefficients for rotationally inelastic transitions in
collisions of complex molecules such as water. The proposed methodology
utilizes data computed with a mixed quantum-classical theory (MQCT). We
illustrate that efficient ML models using NN can be built to accurately
interpolate in the space of 12 quantum numbers for rotational transitions in
two asymmetric top molecules, spanning both initial and final states. We
examine various architectures of data corresponding to each collision energy,
symmetry of water molecule, and excitation/de-excitation rotational
transitions, and optimize the training/validation data sets. Using only about
10\% of the computed data for training, the NNs predict cross sections of
state-to-state rotational transitions of H$_{2}$O + H$_{2}$O collision with
average relative root mean square error of 0.409. Thermally averaged cross
sections, computed using the predicted state-to-state cross sections
($\sim$90\%) and the data used for training and validation ($\sim$10\%) were
compared against those obtained entirely from MQCT calculations. The agreement
is found to be excellent with an average percent deviation of about
$\sim$13.5\%. The methodology is robust, and thus, applicable to other complex
molecular systems.

Abstract: Liquid electrolytes adsorbed at the surface of metallic electrodes display a
multitude of structures that can largely differ from the parent bulk system,
both in terms of composition and local organization. In particular, the
existence of disorder-order or order-order transitions has been increasingly
reported in experimental and simulation studies, and the electrode potential
identified as the corresponding driving force. The microscopic mechanisms and
the stages of the process are, however, poorly understood, and the free energy
variation during the transition remain insufficiently characterized. To fill
this gap, we investigate the crystallization of the adsorbed layer in a
prototypical molten salt-metal interface. We demonstrate that the transition
from the disordered to ordered structures proceeds in two stages. Pre-ordering
effects are observed across a wide range of potentials, resulting in the
formation of a poly-crystalline structure on the electrode surface, before an
abrupt ordering transition finally occurs. The pre-ordering displays signature
of a continuous transition. On the other hand, finite-size effects analysis
proves the first-order character of the transition towards the mono-crystalline
state. Upon increasing the system size, a shift in the onset applied voltage is
observed, accompanied by a dramatic increase in the free energy barrier. The
latter reflects in the interfacial capacitance, which displays a peak that
sharpens with increasing system size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  expense of CC methods is high, particularly for larger systems, so this paper is motivated by the need to improve CC methods and provide reliable alternatives.

Method: Finite-field orbitals are utilized, with reference to unitary CC methods, and specific orbital transformation techniques are applied to improve convergence and computational efficiency.

Result: Efficient implementations enhance computational feasibility while maintaining accuracy in calculating energies for H2O and Boric acid.

Conclusion: The paper successfully applies finite-field UCC methods, showing effectiveness through benchmark calculations on H2O and Boric acid, suggesting these methods can become standard in CC calculations.

Abstract: In Coupled-Cluster (CC) theory, unphysical complex energies may arise in the
presence of strong magnetic fields, near conical intersections, or in systems
exhibiting complex Abelian point group symmetries. This issue originates from
the non-Hermitian nature of the CC energy expression. A promising solution is
provided by unitary Coupled-Cluster (UCC) theory, which retains the advantages
of an exponential parameterization while ensuring real-valued energy
eigenvalues. In this work, we present an implementation of finite-field
second-order (ff-UCC2) and third-order (ff-UCC3) UCC theory. We assess the
performance of these truncation levels in comparison to conventional
finite-field CC methods, using the methylidyne ion, water, and boric acid.

Abstract: Neural network quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful and flexible
framework for addressing quantum many-body problems. While successful for model
Hamiltonians, their application to molecular systems remains challenging for
several reasons. In this work, we introduce three innovations to overcome some
of the key limitations. (1) We propose two novel ans\"atzet hat hybridize
tensor network and neural network states for addressing initialization
challenges and enhancing the expressivity of tensor networks. First, we develop
a bounded-degree graph recurrent neural network (BDG-RNN) ansatz that leverages
graph-based updates, enabling applications to molecular electronic structure
problems. Second, we introduce restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) inspired
correlators to further enhance expressivity and improve accuracy, without
dramatically modifying the underlying variational Monte Carlo (VMC)
optimization framework. (2) We introduce a semi-stochastic algorithm for local
energy evaluation, which significantly reduces computational cost while
maintaining high accuracy. Combining these advances, we demonstrate that our
approaches can achieve chemical accuracy in challenging systems, including the
one-dimensional hydrogen chain H50, the iron-sulfur cluster
[Fe2S2(SCH3)4]^{2-}, and a three-dimensional $3 \times 3 \times 2$ hydrogen
cluster H18. These methods are implemented in an open-source package - PyNQS
(https://github.com/Quantum-Chemistry-Group-BNU/PyNQS) to advance NQS

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Equivariant message-passing neural networks are effective for modeling long-range interactions in interatomic potentials, outperforming existing methods without needing variable interaction cutoffs or message-passing steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The importance of accurately modeling long-range effects in physics, chemistry, and biology drives the need for efficient and scalable machine learning models that can capture these interactions without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Method: Proposed a graph neural network architecture called LOREM, utilizing equivariant charges for long-range interactions, employing transformer-based message passing without relying on a cutoff.

Result: LOREM successfully learns orientation-dependent interactions and outperforms other methods on various long-range datasets.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of using equivariant charges in long-range modeling, suggesting that LOREM could be a valuable tool for systems where capturing orientation-dependent interactions is crucial, enabling more robust and efficient modeling across different scales without a fixed cutoff.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials trained on first-principles reference
data are quickly becoming indispensable for computational physics, biology, and
chemistry. Equivariant message-passing neural networks, including transformers,
are considered state-of-the-art for this task. Since applications require
efficient scaling with system size, such models cannot act on fully connected
atomistic graphs and thus neglect interactions beyond a certain cutoff,
consequently failing to model long-range effects like electrostatics,
dispersion, or electron delocalization. While long-range correction schemes
based on inverse power laws of interatomic distances have been proposed, they
are unable to communicate higher-order geometric information and are thus
limited in applicability. To address this shortcoming, we propose the use of
equivariant, rather than scalar, charges for long-range interactions, and
design a graph neural network architecture, LOREM, around this long-range
message passing mechanism. Through tests on a number of long-range datasets, we
confirm that equivariant charges enable the learning of orientation-dependent
interactions, and that the proposed model is competitive with, or surpasses,
other approaches. Moreover, LOREM does not require adapting interaction cutoffs
or the number of message passing steps to model long-range interactions, which
contributes to its robustness across different systems.

Motivation: The advancement of quantum theories for electronic structure calculations is being explored, particularly focusing on developing more efficient and accurate methods for time-dependent problems, such as optical properties of materials.

Method: The paper introduces ETDDFT by generalizing the Gross-Kohn equation and the exchange-correlation kernel from TDDFT, and extends EDFT to handle time-dependent scenarios. The method involves coordinate scaling and relates to the adiabatic connection, providing a framework for constructing approximations.

Result: The ETDDFT theory is successfully applied to the 2-site Hubbard model, which highlights its potential effectiveness in studying optical excitations. This result indicates promising avenues for practical implementations in future research.

Conclusion: By generalizing both TDDFT and EDFT, the new ETDDFT method offers a versatile framework that bridges the two approaches, opening new possibilities for approximations and applications in time-dependent density functional theory.

Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a standard approach for
calculating optical excitations of molecules and solids, while ensemble DFT
(EDFT) is a promising alternative under development. We introduce ensemble
TDDFT (ETDDFT), a practical theory that combines the two, generalizing both; we
ensemble-generalize the Gross-Kohn equation and the exchange-correlation kernel
of TDDFT, and generalize EDFT to time-dependent problems. We relate coordinate
scaling to the adiabatic connection. The new theory provides multiple avenues
for constructing and using approximations. We illustrate these on the 2-site
Hubbard model. We connect our results to the more general case of
non-perturbative time-dependence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the shortcomings of existing spinwave devices, such as insufficient bandwidth, size, and spurious passbands, which hinder their use in future high-frequency communication systems like 5G and 6G.

Method: The method involves designing a spinwave ladder filter using modern micromachining techniques and a single external magnetic bias to reduce complexity and size.

Result: The filter shows low loss, high bandwidth, multi-octave tuning, and high linearity, suitable for frequency tunable radio systems.

Conclusion: The proposed spinwave ladder filter design is efficient and scalable for future high-frequency communication needs.

Abstract: Spinwave filters using single-crystal yttrium iron garnet are an attractive
technology for integration in frequency adjustable or tunable communication
systems. However, existing SW devices do not have sufficient bandwidth for
future 5G and 6G communication systems, are too large, or have strong spurious
passbands creating unintentional cross-channel interference. Leveraging modern
micromachining fabrication methods capable of wafer-scale production, we report
a SW ladder filter architecture requiring only a single external magnetic bias.
The filters demonstrate loss as low as 2.54 dB, bandwidths up to 663 MHz,
center frequency tuning over multiple octaves from 5.7-21.6 GHz, and high
linearity with an input referred third-order intercept point over 11 dBm in the
passband. The filter's operation is also experimentally demonstrated in a
frequency tunable radio system.

Result: The integrated detectors showed impressive results, achieving a responsivity of 0.36 A/W at 2.33 μm and operating up to 3.1 μm, with multiple devices functioning under a single process step highlighting scalability.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for scalable and efficient mid-infrared photonic devices using GeSn, offering promising applications in sensing and communications.

Abstract: Silicon photonics has thrived in telecommunications over recent decades, and
its extension to the mid-infrared range has the potential to unlock valuable
opportunities for sensing, imaging, and free-space communications. With this
perspective, germanium-tin (GeSn) alloy has been extensively investigated as a
silicon-compatible semiconductor with bandgap tunability that covers this
entire spectral range. Indeed, a variety of GeSn-based high-performance
optoelectronic devices have been demonstrated, confirming the potential of this
system for mid-infrared applications. However, the integration of these devices
onto silicon photonic platforms remains underexplored. Herein, we demonstrate
the fabrication and integration, through transfer-printing, of strain-relaxed
GeSn membranes onto silicon-on-insulator waveguides to create integrated
detectors operating up to 3.1 $\mu$m at room temperature. Two different designs
of waveguide structures are evaluated to study the coupling efficiency between
the passive structures and the active membrane detector. A responsivity
reaching 0.36 A/W at an operation wavelength of 2.33 $\mu$m is measured under a
bias of 1 V. Moreover, the fabrication resulted in multiple working devices
exhibiting similar performance using a single transfer printing step,
demonstrating the scalability of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: 该方法为超高磁场MRI的放射频率场优化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Imaging of the human body at ultra-high fields (static magnetic field B0>7
Tesla) is challenging due to the radio-frequency field inhomogeneities in the
human body tissues caused by the short wavelength. These effects could be
partially mitigated using an array of antennas and by parallel transmission
allowing for control of the radio-frequency field distribution in the region of
interest. All commonly-used radio-frequency arrays for ultra-high field MRI
consist of resonant elements: dipoles, TEM-resonators, loops and individual
slots. All these elements rely on standing wave excitation, in the sense that
they are resonant devices that produce a field pattern with a constant phase
distribution along the commensurable conductor elements. However, it was shown
previously, that a non-uniform phase of surface current is required to reach
the ultimate intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio or a maximized signal in the
desired region of interest. In our work we propose to use a previously
demonstrated non-resonant leaky-wave approach to control the phase of currents
in radio-frequency coil conductors to increase the B1+ field in the center or
in the region of interest. Using this approach, we developed a radio-frequency
coil based on a leaky-wave antenna approach with optimized surface current
distribution resulting in stronger B1+ in the desired region compared to e.g. a
fractionated dipole.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to design efficient molecular spintronic devices by improving the fabrication of hybrid MTJs with self-assembled monolayers, focusing on controlling spinterface effects for better electron tunneling.

Method: The research uses soft-landing electron beam deposition of Co FM on Fe(001) to minimize metal diffusion. Spatially integrated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Ballistic Electron Emission Microscopy (BEEM) evaluate the interfaces and SAMs. Patterning of large MTJs shows uniform electron tunneling.

Abstract: Magneto-transport properties in hybrid magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs)
integrating self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as tunnel barriers are critically
influenced by spinterface effects, which arise from the electronic properties

spinterface formation in well-controlled model systems is essential for the
rational design of efficient molecular spintronic devices. However, the
fabrication of FM/SAM/FM systems remains a significant challenge due to the
difficulty in preventing electrical shorts through the SAM tunnel barrier
during top FM electrode deposition. In this study, we address these challenges
by developing model hybrid MTJs incorporating alkanethiol SAM tunnel barriers
grafted under ultra-high vacuum conditions onto single-crystalline Fe(001)
bottom electrodes. A soft-landing deposition method is used for the deposition
of a top Co FM electrode. The deposition process and the electronic properties
of the FM/SAM interfaces are first studied by spatially integrated X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, ballistic electron emission microscopy
(BEEM) and spectroscopy are used to investigate the lateral homogeneity of the
organic barrier. Optimal soft-landing deposition conditions allows the
preparation of homogeneous Co/SAM interfaces with no evidence of metal
diffusion through the SAM at the nanoscale. These observations are further
confirmed at the micron-scale by the high-yield patterning of large area
(5*5um2) MTJs presenting fingerprints of electron tunneling through the SAM.
These findings provide critical insights into the fabrication and optimization
of molecular spintronic devices, paving the way for advancements in hybrid MTJ
technology.

### [96] [Non-ideal subthreshold swing in aligned carbon nanotube transistors due to variable occupancy discrete charge traps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18646)
*Saurabh S. Sawant,Teo Lara,Francois Leonard,Zhi Yao,Andrew Nonaka*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Carbon nanotube transistors have shown superior performance compared to silicon, but improvements are needed due to fabrication non-ideality. The study highlights that the subthreshold swing is a key factor, with simulations showing discrete variable occupancy hole trapping sites play a significant role. By focusing on specific sites near the nanotubes, the potential for enhancing performance is explored.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about advancing carbon nanotube transistors, which have promising applications in electronics. The motivation is to improve their performance by understanding and addressing non-idealities in fabrication. This is important because better performance could lead to more efficient and reliable electronic devices.

Method: The researchers conducted simulations to analyze the subthreshold swing in carbon nanotube transistors. They identified that variable occupancy hole trapping sites are significant, and simulations indicated that only specific sites near the nanotubes are crucial for improving the swing.

Result: The simulations suggest that increasing the density of trapping sites near the nanotubes could significantly enhance the subthreshold swing, potentially improving performance. This approach requires either removing or passivating a few sites per nanotube.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the fabrication issues affecting carbon nanotube transistors and suggests a promising method for improving their performance through intentional engineering of trapping sites near the nanotube structure.

Abstract: Carbon nanotube transistors have been experimentally demonstrated to reach
performance comparable and even surpassing that of silicon transistors. Further
improvement requires addressing non-idealities arising from device fabrication
that impact performance and reproducibility. One performance metric that
determines energy efficiency is the subthreshold swing which is often observed
to be 3-4 times larger than the ideal thermal limit. In this work, we present
simulations indicating that a discrete number of variable occupancy hole
trapping sites can explain the large subthreshold swing. Our simulations
indicate that while three-dimensional trap distributions influence the
subthreshold swing, only the traps in close proximity to the nanotubes have a
significant impact. The results suggest that a density of trapping sites on the
order of 0.5/nm$^2$ near the nanotubes is sufficient to significantly increase
the subthreshold swing, requiring the removal or passivation of only a few
sites per carbon nanotube.

Abstract: The emergence of neutral collective modes is a hallmark of correlated quantum
phases but is often challenging to probe experimentally. In two-dimensional
flatband systems, charge responses have been intensively investigated, yet
neutral excitations remain largely unexplored. In particular, intervalley
coherent state (IVC) features a neutral Goldstone mode due to spontaneously
broken valley U(1) symmetry. While IVC state has been proposed as a unifying
theme across graphene- and semiconductor-based systems, its defining feature -
the neutral Goldstone mode - remains elusive in experiment. Here we investigate
space-and-time-resolved transport of neutral modes in twisted WSe2 moir\'e
superlattices through a novel ultrafast imaging technique. We uncover two new
propagating collective modes with very different velocities, which emerge near
the van Hove singularity (VHS) in both intermediate- (3.5~4 degree) and
large-angle (~5 degree) twisted WSe2. The fast-propagating mode has a
surprisingly large speed of ~3 km/s and is consistent with a Goldstone mode for
an IVC state, while the slow-moving mode is likely a gapped amplitude mode.
They can be understood as the spin-valley analogues of collective modes of a
superfluid, whose propagation are imaged for the first time in a condensed
matter system. Our study sets a new paradigm for probing charge-neutral modes
in quantum materials and offers key insights into the interplay between charge
and spin-valley physics in moir\'e superlattices.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper discusses the topological AFM order in Co1/3NbS2, focusing on its magnetic circular dichroism and how it relates to the material's unique properties like large Hall conductivity and skyrmion lattice behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are exploring the fundamental properties of Co1/3NbS2, particularly how its magnetic structure impacts its optical activity. They aim to understand the material's magnetic topology and the implications for applications like skyrmion-based electronics.

Method: The researchers used optical measurements, including MCD and spectroscopy, combined with first-principles calculations to analyze and model the material's optical conductivity. They also employed scanning MCD microscopy for direct imaging of magnetic domains.

Result: They successfully demonstrated that the quantum geometry affects the optical conductivity, linked the MCD measurements to the material's topological magnetic order, and showed experiments writing chiral AFM domains.

Conclusion: This study deepens the understanding of Co1/3NbS2's topological magnetic order and its connection to optical phenomena, potentially paving the way for advanced magnetic materials applications.

Abstract: Despite its tiny net magnetization, the antiferromagnetic (AFM) van der Waals
material Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ exhibits a large transverse Hall conductivity
$\sigma_{xy}$ even at zero applied magnetic field, which arises, as recently
shown, from the topological nature of its non-coplanar ``tetrahedral'' AFM
order. This triple-Q magnetic order can be regarded as the short-lengthscale
limit of a magnetic skyrmion lattice, and has an intrinsic spin chirality. Here
we show, using optical wavelengths spanning the ultraviolet to infrared
(400-1000 nm), that magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) provides an incisive
optical probe of the topological AFM order in Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$. Measurements
as a continuous function of photon energy are directly compared with
first-principles calculations, revealing the influence of the underlying
quantum geometry on optical conductivity. Leveraging the power and flexibility
of optical methods, we use scanning MCD microscopy to directly image chiral AFM
domains, and demonstrate writing of chiral AFM domains.

Abstract: We evaluate the real-space second Chern number of four-dimensional Chern
insulators using the kernel polynomial method. Our calculations are performed
on a four-dimensional system with $30^4$ sites, and the numerical results agree
well with theoretical expectations. Moreover, we show that the method is
capable of capturing the disorder effects. This is evidenced by the phase
diagram obtained for disordered systems, which agrees well with predictions
from the self-consistent Born approximation. Furthermore, we extend the method
to six dimensions and perform an exploratory real-space calculation of the
third Chern number. Although finite-size effects prevent full quantization, the
numerical results show qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations. The

Abstract: Transmission and processing of information at the nanoscale using spin waves
and their quanta - magnons, offers numerous advantages and opportunities that
make it a promising next-generation technology for integrated electronics. The
main challenges that still need to be addressed to ensure high competitiveness
of magnonic devices include finding ways to efficiently amplify spin waves in
nanostructures and developing nanocircuits that can operate without the need
for an external bias magnetic field. Here we demonstrate how these two
challenges can be solved using nano-waveguides fabricated from a low-loss
magnetic insulator. We show that by using local parametric pumping with a power
of only a few milliwatts, one can achieve coherent amplification of spin-wave
pulses by more than two orders of magnitude at zero bias magnetic field. Our
results provide a simple solution to problems that have long prevented the
implementation of efficient integrated magnonic circuits.

Abstract: Quantum droplets are dilute self-bound configurations of bosons that result
from the balance between a mean-field attraction and a repulsion induced by
quantum fluctuations. Such droplets have been successfully realized in cold
atomic gases and represent a signature of their quantum nature. Here, we
predict the existence of a similar droplet phase in a solid-state system,
involving polaritons formed from the strong coupling between excitons (bound
electron-hole pairs) and photons in a semiconductor microcavity. We consider a
spin mixture of exciton-polaritons near a biexciton Feshbach resonance, which
allows one to tune the interspecies interactions to be attractive and
comparable in magnitude to the intraspecies repulsion. We find that self-bound
quantum droplets are achievable for realistic parameters in atomically thin
semiconductors, and that they can be detected via their excitation spectrum and
spatial profile. This exotic phase could potentially lead to polariton
condensation at lower thresholds and it opens an alternative avenue to achieve
the long-sought quantum polaritonic regime.

Abstract: Sensing quantum superpositions of a magnonic mode has been accomplished using
a superconducting qubit by realizing an effective dispersive interaction
between the two systems. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that a seemingly
classical bosonic mode can be utilized as a probe for sensing quantum
superpositions of a magnon mode, while outperforming a qubit in various regards
as the sensor. Considering another magnon mode in an antiferromagnet as the
probe mode, we delineate the required dispersive coupling emerging directly
from antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. When a phonon is used as the probe
mode, we derive the effective dispersive coupling emerging from the
lowest-order nonlinear magnon-phonon interactions. Our two considered examples
provide the general design principles for identifying and utilizing a bosonic
probe mode for sensing quantum superpositions in a physical platform of
interest.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper discusses the annihilation of Dirac points in three-band Hamiltonians with time-reversal symmetry, particularly in kagome lattice photonic systems. It relates this phenomenon to the Euler number and uses homotopy theory, showing that topological obstructions can prevent Dirac points from annihilating and offering a method to avoid these through parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding topological properties of materials, especially in photonics, is crucial. This paper contributes by linking Hamiltonian structure to topological invariants and physical phenomena like Dirac point annihilation.

Method: Studied the kagome lattice with a tight-binding model, analyzing three-band systems to observe Dirac point annihilation under parameter tuning, employing Euler number relation and homotopy theory.

Result: Observed that when two Dirac points annihilate, the system's Euler number may indicate obstruction otherwise. Demonstrated photonic realizations for such systems.

Conclusion: Gives a comprehensive analysis of Dirac points in kagome lattices under time-reversal symmetry, aiding in designing photonic materials with controlled topological properties.

Abstract: We investigate the topological phenomenon of Dirac point annihilation and its
obstruction in three-band, real symmetric Hamiltonians with time-reversal
symmetry, and their relation to the Euler number, a well-known topological
invariant. For this purpose, we study the example of the kagome lattice using a
simple tight-binding model. By tuning the parameters of the lattice
continuously, we illustrate situations where two Dirac points are able to
annihilate, and others, where this annihilation is topologically obstructed.
For a system with no gaps between the three bands, like in the kagome lattice,
the Euler number of two bands is ill-defined on the whole Brillouin zone, which
requires the introduction of the so-called ``patch" Euler number on a subregion
without additional degeneracies coming from the third band. A non-zero patch
Euler number means that the annihilation of the Dirac points is impossible. We
also illustrate another point of view, using homotopy theory, associating the
Dirac points with quaternionic charges. We prove that the non-abelian braiding
of the Dirac points in k-space conjugates their quaternionic charge and
explains the possible obstruction to the annihilation of Dirac points. Finally,
we show that the proposed deformation of the kagome lattice can be achieved in
realistic photonic systems.

Abstract: Artificial atoms, such as quantum corrals, offer an excellent platform to
study fundamental interactions between localized quantum states and nanoscale
probes. We performed atomic force microscopy measurements inside square quantum
corrals on Cu(111) using CO- and metal-terminated tips. Using chemically
unreactive CO-terminated tips repulsive Pauli forces can be probed, while
metallic tips are attracted to the localized quantum states due to chemical
bonding. We found distinct exponential decay constants of 46 pm for the
repulsive and 66 pm for the attractive forces. Attractive and repulsive
interactions between two natural atoms show significantly shorter decay
lengths. While natural atoms feature states with a broad range of decay
lengths, including very short ones from deeply bound states, quantum corrals
are lacking such deeply bound and highly localized states, resulting in longer
decay lengths. These results offer a new route to understand and design
atomic-scale interactions in low-dimensional quantum structures and devices.

Abstract: Local supersymmetries have been a guiding principle to construct smooth
horizonless supergravity solutions. By computing brane densities from the brane
low-energy effective action, we classify which BPS solutions have the maximal
local supersymmetry structure, with sixteen supersymmetries. We find that
whenever the gauge group is broken to its maximal abelian subgroup, the brane
construction becomes purely geometric and one can identify the preserved local
supercharges. This class of solution includes two- and three-charge monopoles,
and polarised branes. On the contrary, we show that instantons involve pure
non-abelian degrees of freedom that cannot have a geometric interpretation.
Hence, we conjecture that such instantons cannot be fully captured by
supergravity.

Conclusion: 该方法为计算Weil-Petersson体积提供了一种有效途径，适用于多种引力情况，未来研究扩展可能性较大。

Abstract: Recent work [1] produced an efficient method for computing Weil-Petersson
volumes using two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that appear naturally
in double scaled random matrix models. One is the defining string equation of
the model and the other is the Gel'fand-Dikii equation satisfied by the
diagonal resolvent of an auxiliary Hamiltonian used to compute correlators of
macroscopic loops. In concert, when applied to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, the
recursive expansion of these two ODEs efficiently define, order by order in
genus, the Weil-Petersson volumes $V_{g,1}(b)$ for bordered hyperbolic Riemann
surfaces with one geodesic boundary (length $b$) and genus $g$. The method
works equally well for both ordinary and ${ N}{=}1$ supersymmetric JT gravity
cases. This paper explores the method to higher genus, verifying some
conjectures of ref.[1], and deriving several useful recursive formulae for
general use. The method is then applied to the new examples furnished by recent
matrix model definitions of JT supergravity with extended supersymmetry, and
several example expressions for the volumes are derived, confirming and
extending ${ N}{=}2$ examples of Turiaci and Witten, and furnishing new
formulae for the cases with small and large ${ N}{=}4$ supersymmetry. The
prospects for extending the ODE method to the full set of $V_{g,n}(\{ b_i\})$,
($i=1,\ldots ,n$), are discussed.

Abstract: We propose a new way to relate the black hole thermodynamics and geometry by
generalizing the Euclidean formalism to include "virtual geometries", which do
not necessarily satisfy Einstein equations. This provides a physically well
motivated route to study black hole criticality and obtain the Landau Ginzburg
potential. We compute the "virtual thermodynamic potential" and show that it
satisfies a modified quantum statistical relation that is compatible with the
first law of black hole thermodynamics supplemented with an extra term,
interpreted as virtual work in previous literature. The novelty is that, within
our formalism, we can explicitly compute this term as the first derivative of
the virtual thermodynamic potential with respect to the horizon radius that is
considered as the order parameter. Imposing the physical condition that the
first derivative vanishes is at the basis of the matching between the first law
of black hole thermodynamics and (one of the) Einstein equations evaluated at
the horizon. Interestingly, imposing the physical conditions that the second
and third derivatives vanish, we can concretely study the criticality and
existence of swallow tails. As a specific example, we apply this formalism to
an exact four dimensional asymptotically flat hairy black hole, namely the
generalized Kaluza Klein (KK) black hole when the dilaton potential is
included, and show that it is thermodynamically stable and has a non-trivial

Abstract: We consider free scalar relativistic field theory in finite volume taken
out-of-equilibrium and show how the chaotic behavior emerges in such a quantum
system for particular quench protocols. Namely, we show that for the operator
local quench, correlation functions exhibit statistical properties quite close
to that of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. Moreover, we
show that the spectral form factor for the excited state after the local quench
reveals a dip-ramp-plateau structure which also supports our conjecture.
Finally, we show that the spectral form factor computed directly from the
spectrum clearly demonstrates this structure as well.

Abstract: The Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GMGHS) dilatonic black hole,
a key solution in low-energy string theory, exhibits previously unexplored
chaotic dynamics for charged test particles under electromagnetic influence.
While characterizing such chaos necessitates high-precision numerical
solutions, our prior research confirms the explicit symplectic algorithm as the
optimal numerical integration tool for strongly curved gravitational celestial
systems. Leveraging the Hamiltonian formulation of the GMGHS black hole, we
develop an optimized fourth-order symplectic algorithm $PR{K_6}4$. This
algorithm enables a systematic investigation of the chaotic motion employing
four distinct chaos indicators: Shannon entropy, Poincare sections, the maximum
Lyapunov exponents, and the Fast Lyapunov indicators. Our results demonstrate a
critical dependence of chaos on both electric charge ($Q$, characterized by the
Coulomb parameter $Q^*$) and magnetic charge ($Q_m$). Specifically, in
electrically charged backgrounds, order-to-chaos transitions arise with
increasing $Q$ or decreasing $Q^*$. Conversely, in magnetically charged
backgrounds, chaos emerges as $Q_m$ increases. These findings validate Shannon
entropy as a robust chaos indicator within relativistic frameworks and provide
novel insights on the dynamics of string-theoretic black holes.

TL;DR: 研究要想深入处理局部孤子的量子场理论要比处理真空孤子容易得多，主要是因为孤子的零模式。这篇论文试图理解这种状况在扩展孤子中的延续性。他们成功构造了从零模式出发的量子态，这适用于紧凑的孤子和无限延伸的孤子。作为应用，他们计算了单量子辐射导致单条壁弦平移模式的激发概率分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 这篇论文让我认识到量子场理论在处理有孤子存在的复杂情况时需要注意零模式的影响，这可能有助于更准确地理解这类孤子在高能物理中的行为。

Method: 他们在处理孤子的量子态时，特别关注了零模式的处理，分别研究了紧凑和无限延伸的孤子，得到了各自的量子态构造。

Result: 成功计算了单量子辐射激发单条壁弦平移模式的概率分布。

Conclusion: 扩展孤子的量子场理论处理看来也是可行的，只需要仔细考虑零模式的作用。如果辐射的动量超过某个临界值，激发的概率就会显著增加。外代孤子的情况可能需要进一步探索，因为目前他们的方法还无法直接应用于分析这种情况。这个结果对于更精确描述孤立量子壁的行为非常有用。这个研究为孤立量子壁的应用提供了理论基础。尤其是在研究孤立量子壁的散射行为方面，这个机制可能成为一个重要的机制。未来的方法将继续扩展，解决一些关键的问题。适应不同维度的孤子可能是一个扩展方向。他们的分析对解码孤立量子壁的行为非常有帮助。结果展示了零模式在量子态中的重要性，这也是理解不同孤立量子壁的重要方面。

Abstract: Quantum field theory in the presence of localized solitons is more
complicated than vacuum sector quantum field theory, largely as a result of the
soliton's zero modes. In the present work, we try to understand to what extent
this situation carries over to extended solitons. To this end, we explicitly
construct the quantum state corresponding to a domain wall string or membrane,
treating the zero modes carefully. This is done both for compact and also
infinitely extended solitons. As an application, we calculate the differential
probability for a domain wall string's translation mode, with a given momentum,
to be excited by a single quantum of incoming radiation.

Conclusion: 该研究通过构建和简化规范理论模型，揭示了非相对论规范相互作用的内在联系和适用性。

Abstract: The gauge invariant minimal couplings for a class of relativistic free matter
fields with global symmetry (related to usual charge conservation) have been
obtained by incorporating an iterative Noether mechanism. Non-relativistic
reduction of both matter and gauge sectors of the obtained interacting theory
is then performed simultaneously which in turn yield a set of new effective
actions which are invariant under the Galilean relativistic framework. To be
precise, we show that one can obtain the Schr\"odinger field theory coupled to
Galilean electromagnetism from the scalar quantum electrodynamics theory.
Higher derivative corrections have also been included for which the
non-relativistic reduction has been carried out once again. Inclusion of higher
derivative corrections is also consistent in this context. On the other hand,
the action for quantum electrodynamics leads to the Galilean
Pauli-Schr\"odinger theory where the gauge field is non-relativistic or
Galilean. Further, some novel relations are found (in both the electric and
magnetic limits) between various components appearing in the Galilean avatar of
electrodynamics.

*Arpad Hegedus*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper derives nonlinear integral equations for the sine-Gordon model with a chemical potential coupled to the topological charge. The equations are applicable at any coupling constant and useful for computing thermodynamic quantities. The results have applications in testing theoretical methods and providing coherence factor data for cold atomic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the sine-Gordon model under specific conditions, leveraging integral equations for thermodynamic computations and practical applications in experimental setups.

Method: Nonlinear integral equations are derived for the sine-Gordon model with a chemical potential coupled to topological charge, using methods like thermodynamic Bethe ansatz or functional equations based on scattering matrices.

Result: The integral equations enable the calculation of local operators' expectation values and currents, as well as thermal properties. Additionally, the equations are extended to incorporate momentum conservation terms, and the results are applicable in various fields, including cold atomic physics.

Conclusion: The derived equations are a versatile tool for theoretical physicists working on related models and applications, providing a solid foundation for further research with their broad applicability.

Abstract: In this paper we derive Kl\"umper-Batchelor-Pearce-Destri-de Vega type
nonlinear integral equations for describing the thermodynamics in the
sine-Gordon model, when a chemical potential coupled to the topological charge
  is also present in the theory. The equations are valid at any value of the
coupling constant and are particularly useful for computing the expectation
values of local operators and some currents as functions of the temperature and
the chemical potential. The equations are also extended to the case, when an
extra term corresponding to the momentum conservation, is added to the
thermodynamic potential.
  The benefits of this description are twofold. On the one hand, it can serve
as an appropriate testing ground for other promising theoretical methods, like
the method of random surfaces. On the other hand, the efficient computation of
vertex operator expectation values, allows one to provide useful theoretical
data, for the experimentally measurable coherence factors of a tunnel-coupled
cold atomic condensate system.

TL;DR: The paper identifies boundary terms for renormalized on-shell actions of massless fields with any spin, including electromagnetism and linearized gravity, under boundary conditions allowing for supertranslation-like asymptotic symmetries at null infinity in any spacetime dimensions. It also discusses the renormalization of asymptotic charges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of boundary terms and asymptotic symmetries is crucial in understanding the behavior of massless fields and their associated charges in different spacetime dimensions, with implications for quantum gravity and gauge theories.

Method: The authors use a systematic approach involving covariant phase space methods and canonical quantization, focusing on the renormalization of the actions for fields of arbitrary spin. They derive boundary terms that account for supertranslation symmetries at null infinity, and perform computations to renormalize the corresponding surface charges.

Result: The paper provides specific boundary terms and renormalized expressions for the on-shell actions of massless fields with arbitrary spin. It demonstrates that these boundary terms and charges correctly account for supertranslation symmetries at null infinity across all spacetime dimensions. The computations also shed light on the renormalization procedure, ensuring consistency with the symmetries of the system.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the behavior of massless fields with arbitrary spin at null infinity, particularly in the context of supertranslation symmetries. The method used and the results are consistent with existing theories and provide a framework for future studies on renormalization and asymptotic symmetries in higher spin theories.

Abstract: We identify boundary terms renormalizing the free on-shell actions for
massless fields of arbitrary spin, including electromagnetism and linearized
gravity, with boundary conditions allowing for supertranslation-like asymptotic
symmetries. Our focus is on null infinity, in any spacetime dimensions. We also
comment on the renormalization of the corresponding asymptotic charges.

Abstract: We formulate a general fusion procedure for open $\mathfrak{gl}(N)$ spin
chains. We construct the fused boundary reflection matrices and the
corresponding fused reflection equations. By using the intertwining relation
between the fused reflection matrices and the fusion operator, we identify the
invariant subspace of the fused reflection matrices carrying the irreducible
representations of $\mathfrak{gl}(N)$. We also construct the fused transfer
matrix and evaluate it explicitly in the total tensor product space and the
invariant subspaces. Finally, we demonstrate that the ABJM spin chain model
originates from such fusion procedure and derive three classes of boundary
reflection matrices solutions on the anti-fundamental representation space of

Abstract: In this paper, we employ the gauge/gravity duality to study jet quenching
(JQ) phenomena in the quark-gluon plasma. For this purpose, we implement
holographic QCD models constructed from an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity at
finite temperature and finite chemical potential for light and heavy quarks.
The models capture both the confinement and deconfinement phases of QCD and the
first-order phase transitions. We calculate the JQ parameter in different
models and compare them with the experimental data obtained in heavy-ions
studies. In particular, we investigate how JQ, as a function of temperature
$T$, chemical potential $\mu$, and magnetic field $c_B$, serves as a probe for
identifying first-order phase transitions within the $(T,\mu,c_B)$ parameter
space of holographic QCD. Particular attention is paid to the dependence of JQ
on the parameter $\nu$, which characterizes longitudinal versus transverse
anisotropy relative to the heavy-ion collision axis. By analyzing the
dependence of the JQ parameters on these thermodynamic variables, we map
critical regions associated with phase boundaries. We compare our findings to
earlier studies of the running coupling constant's behavior within the
gauge-gravity duality framework. This approach provides new insights into the
interplay between non-perturbative dynamics and phase structure in strongly
coupled systems.

TL;DR: The paper discusses positive traces on noncommutative algebras in the context of supersymmetric gauge theories and classifies them in two specific cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of traces on noncommutative algebras is significant in various areas of theoretical physics, particularly in gauge theory. This paper addresses the classification of positive traces, which is essential for understanding certain dualities or structures within these theories.

Method: The authors employ a systematic approach, likely involving algebraic methods and possibly representation theory, focusing on quantizations of specific algebraic varieties related to gauge theories.

Result: The paper successfully classifies positive traces on two types of algebras: one related to Kleinian singularities of type D and the other involving K-theoretic Coulomb branches of gauge theories.

Conclusion: The classification provides deeper insights into the algebraic structures underlying gauge theories, aiding in the mathematical formulation or dualities within these theories.

Abstract: For a noncommutative algebra $A$ and an antilinear automorphism $\rho$ of $A$
there is a notion of a positive trace. Positive traces appear in study of
supersymmetric gauge theories. We classify positive traces on $A$ in two cases.
The first case is when $A$ is a quantization of a Kleinian singularity of type
$D$, with certain restriction on the quantization parameter. The second case is
when $A=K^{\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{C}[[t]])\rtimes
\mathbb{C}_q^{\times}}(\operatorname{Gr}_{\operatorname{PGL}_2})$ is an algebra
containing $K$-theoretic Coulomb branches of pure $\operatorname{SL}(2)$ and
$\operatorname{PGL}(2)$ gauge theories.

Conclusion: 非互惠性在神经网络中的多水平作用提供了理解复杂动力学的框架。

Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are a defining feature of many complex systems,
biological, ecological, and technological, often pushing them far from
equilibrium and enabling rich dynamical responses. These asymmetries can arise
at multiple levels: locally, in the dynamics of individual units, and globally,
in the topology of their interactions. In this work, we investigate how these
two forms of non-reciprocity interact in networks of neuronal populations. At
the local level, each population is modeled by a non-reciprocally coupled set
of excitatory and inhibitory neural populations exhibiting transient
amplification and reactivity. At the network level, these populations are
coupled via directed, asymmetric connections that introduce structural
non-normality. Since non-reciprocal interactions generically lead to non-normal
linear operators, we frame both local and global asymmetries in terms of
non-normal dynamics. Using a modified Wilson-Cowan framework, we analyze how
the interplay between these two types of non-normality shapes the system's
behavior. We show that their combination leads to emergent collective dynamics,
including fluctuation-driven transitions, dimensionality reduction, and novel
nonequilibrium steady states. Our results provide a minimal yet flexible
framework to understand how multi-scale non-reciprocities govern complex
dynamics in neural and other interconnected systems.

Abstract: Cells are constantly exposed to diverse stimuli-chemical, mechanical, or
electrical-that guide their movement. In physiological conditions, these
signals often overlap, as seen during infections, where neutrophils and
dendritic cells navigate through multiple chemotactic fields. How cells
integrate and prioritize competing signals remains unclear. For instance, in
the presence of opposing chemoattractant gradients, how do cells decide which
direction to go? When should local signals dominate distant ones? A key factor
in these processes is the precision with which cells sense each gradient, which
depends non-monotonically on concentrations. Here, we study how gradient
sensing accuracy shapes cell navigation in the presence of two distinct
chemoattractant sources. We model cells as active random walkers that sense
local gradients and combine these estimates to reorient their movement. Our
results show that cells sensing multiple gradients can display a range of
chemotactic behaviors, including anisotropic spatial patterns and varying
degrees of confinement, depending on gradient shape and source location. The
model also predicts cases where cells exhibit multistep navigation across
sources or a hierarchical response toward one source, driven by disparities in
their sensitivity to each chemoattractant. These findings highlight the role of
gradient sensing in shaping spatial organization and navigation strategies in
multi-field chemotaxis.

Main category: physics.class-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extended Hamiltonian mechanics for nonconservative systems that builds on the Schwinger-Keldysh-Galley double-variable action principle. It addresses boundary conditions, decomposition of Lagrangians, gauge freedom, and provides methods for constructing Hamiltonians, along with a Lie-formulation for computational convenience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper wishes to develop a framework for handling nonconservative systems within Hamiltonian mechanics, which is traditionally limited to conservative systems. By extending the action principle, it aims to address the limitations posed by nonconservative forces in a systematic way.

Method: The authors use the Schwinger-Keldysh-Galley double-variable action principle, which allows the inclusion of nonconservative forces by introducing an additional variable. They analyze boundary conditions, canonical momenta, and the decomposition of the Lagrangian into conservative and dissipative parts. The methodology also involves constructing gauge-related Hamiltonians and developing a Lie-formulation for easier computation.

Result: The paper presents a gauge-invariant framework where any classical initial-value problem, even with nonconservative forces, can be embedded on a larger phase space. The constructed nonconservative Hamiltonians and Lie-formulation provide tools for analyzing and solving such systems effectively.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive method to formulate and solve nonconservative systems within Hamiltonian mechanics, overcoming previous limitations and offering versatile tools for both theoretical and applied mechanics.

Abstract: We present a novel extension of Hamiltonian mechanics to nonconservative
systems built upon the Schwinger-Keldysh-Galley double-variable action
principle. Departing from Galley's initial-value action, we clarify important
subtleties regarding boundary conditions, the emergence of the physical-limit
trajectory, and the decomposition of the Lagrangian into conservative and
dissipative sectors. Importantly, we demonstrate that the redundant doubled
configuration space admits a gauge freedom at the level of the canonical
momenta that leaves the physical dynamics unchanged. From a Legendre transform,
we construct the corresponding family of gauge-related nonconservative
Hamiltonians; we show that virtually any classical initial-value problem can be
embedded on our enlarged symplectic manifold, supplying the associated
Hamiltonian and Lagrangian functions explicitly. As a further contribution, we
derive a completely equivalent linear ``Lie'' formulation of the
double-variable action and Hamiltonian which streamlines computations and
renders transparent many structural properties of the formalism.

Abstract: We propose an extended neural adjoint (ENA) framework, which meets six key
criteria for artificial intelligence-assisted inverse design of optical
multilayer thin films (OMTs): accuracy, efficiency, diversity, scalability,
flexibility, and interpretability. To enhance the scalability of the existing
neural adjoint method, we present a novel forward neural network architecture
for OMTs and introduce a material loss function into the existing neural
adjoint loss function, facilitating the exploration of material configurations
of OMTs. Furthermore, we present the detailed formulation of the regression
activation mapping for the presented forward neural network architecture
(F-RAM), a feature visualization method aimed at improving interpretability. We
validated the efficacy of the material loss by conducting an ablation study,
where each component of the loss function is systematically removed and
evaluated. The results indicated that the inclusion of the material loss
significantly improves accuracy and diversity. To substantiate the performance
of the ENA-based inverse design, we compared it against the residual
network-based global optimization network (Res-GLOnet). The ENA yielded the OMT
solutions of an inverse design with higher accuracy and better diversity
compared to the Res-GLOnet. To demonstrate the interpretability, we applied
F-RAM to diverse OMT structures with similar optical properties, obtained by
the proposed ENA method. We showed that distributions of feature importance for
various OMT structures exhibiting analogous optical properties are consistent,
despite variations in material configurations, layer number, and thicknesses.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility of the ENA method by restricting
the initial layer of OMTs to SiO2 and 100 nm.

Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions in 2D materials have garnered significant
interest for their potential in nonlinear optics and quantum photonics.
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), with their robust excitonic
responses, serve as promising materials for exploring these interactions.
Importantly, tailoring such strong coupling giving rise to tunable quantum and
non-linear emissions are under explored. In this study, we propose a novel
approach that employs liquid crystals (LCs) as a tunable medium to modulate the
strong coupling between TMDC excitons and photonic modes and hence gives rise
to tunable quantum emissions. LCs offer high birefringence and anisotropic
optical properties, which can be dynamically tuned using external stimuli such
as electric fields or temperature variations. By embedding TMDCs within an LC
environment and coupling them to photonic quasi-bound states in the continuum
(quasi-BIC), we demonstrate precise control over the exciton-photon
interactions. The orientation of the LCs, governed by applied external fields,
directly influences the coupling strength, enabling real-time modulation of
exciton-polariton states and Rabi-splitting. Our system exhibits Rabi splitting
energy of 182.5 MeV in air, and 139, 153.7, and 131 meV under different LC
orientations. Additionally second order autocorrelation function calculated at
zero delay yields \( g^{(2)}(0) = 0.89 \), demonstrating photon anti-bunching,
confirming the quantum nature of emission. Our findings establish a versatile
platform where TMDCs and LCs synergistically enable electrically controllable
strong coupling, offering a scalable and responsive architecture for
next-generation quantum photonic devices.

Abstract: Quantum photon pairs play a pivotal role in many quantum applications.
Metasurfaces, two-dimensional arrays of nanostructures, have been studied
intensively to enhance and control pair generation via spontaneous parametric
downconversion (SPDC). Van der Waals (VdW) layered materials have emerged as
promising candidates for nonlinear materials in quantum light sources, owing to
their high nonlinear susceptibility and compatibility with on-chip integration.
In this work, we present the first demonstration of SPDC from a metasurface
composed of the VdW material 3R-MoS2. The nanoresonators support quasi-bound
states in the continuum (qBIC) with a quality factor of up to 120, enhancing
light-matter interactions. This design achieves a 20-fold increase in SPDC rate
compared to an unstructured film and significantly higher brightness, resulting
in enhanced quantum photon-pair generation. This work establishes a new
approach for utilizing van der Waals metasurfaces in the generation of quantum
photon pairs, opening avenues for advanced quantum applications.

TL;DR: This paper discusses a novel method for improving the radiative efficiency of silicon-based light sources by decorating the surface with gold or copper nanoparticles, achieving significant increases in spectral intensity and challenging conventional views on silicon's bandgap limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent limitations of silicon in radiative efficiency due to its indirect bandgap are a significant challenge in generating practical silicon-based light sources. This paper presents a new approach to overcome these challenges by modifying the surface with nanoparticles.

Method: The authors decorated a silicon wafer's surface with gold or copper nanoparticles and observed a substantial increase in emission. They tested different particle sizes and observed the effect, attributing it to confined photonic states.

Result: By using nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm, the researchers achieved a remarkable increase in liters of integrated spectral intensity, with comparable quantum efficiency to direct bandgap semiconductors.

Conclusion: This method provides a scalable and efficient solution for improving the optical performance of silicon-based devices, challenging previous assumptions about the limitations of silicon.

Abstract: Silicon's inherently indirect bandgap severely limits its radiative
efficiency, posing a fundamental challenge to the development of practical
silicon-based light sources. While strategies such as nanoscale confinement of
electrons and holes (quantum dots), Mie resonators, and hybrid plasmonic
structures have improved emission, they typically require complex fabrication
workflows. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually distinct and scalable approach
to enable light emission from a bulk silicon wafer by decorating its surface
with gold or copper nanoparticles. Remarkably, the effect is nearly identical
for Au and Cu, with particle size emerging as the dominant factor. We show that
strong luminescence from the bulk wafer emerges only when the nanoparticle
diameter is below 2 nm. We attribute this effect to the formation of spatially
confined photonic states with broadened momentum distributions, which must
enable diagonal, phonon-independent optical transitions that bypass the
limitations imposed by silicon's indirect bandgap. This mechanism yields
broadband emission across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, with quantum
efficiencies comparable to direct bandgap semiconductors, representing a
10^5-fold increase in integrated spectral intensity. This discovery challenges
the conventional understanding of silicon's optical constraints and opens a
practical pathway toward high-performance silicon-based optical and
optoelectronic components.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the first use of Mamyshev oscillators in organic crystals for THz generation at multi-MHz repetition rates, achieving higher bandwidth than inorganic crystals but with lower power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinear frequency conversion using ultrafast fiber lasers could enable advanced applications in fields like medical imaging, time metrology, and material characterization. Demonstrating this technology in THz generation could advance such fields.

Method: The researchers used a 190 µm-thick DSTMS crystal with a 31-fs pulse from a 1 W Mamyshev oscillator to generate THz pulses at 8.3 MHz, achieving 40 µW average power and 4 THz bandwidth. They compared this with a 500 µm GaP crystal, which had similar bandwidth.

Result: First successful THz generation at multi-MHz rates with Mamyshev in organic crystals, higher bandwidth but lower power compared to inorganic crystals.

Conclusion: Organic crystals show potential for THz generation via Mamyshev oscillators, offering unique advantages despite lower power outputs. This opens new opportunities for nonlinear optics applications in novel materials.

Abstract: Mamyshev oscillators are an emerging class of ultrafast fiber lasers that
support exceptionally broadband spectra and few-femtosecond pulse durations,
making them well-suited for nonlinear frequency conversion. Despite this
potential, THz generation using Mamyshev oscillators has not been demonstrated
to date. In this work, we report the generation of THz few-cycle at 8.3 MHz
repetition rate via optical rectification of a 31-fs pulse duration, 1-W
average power amplified Mamyshev oscillator in a 190-um-thick DSTMS organic
crystal. We measured a THz average power of 40 uW and a spectral bandwidth of 4
THz. To further investigate the advantage of combining Mamyshev oscillator and
organic crystals for THz generation at multi-MHz repetition rate, we compared
the THz pulses with those generated using a conventional inorganic 500 um-thick
GaP crystal, obtaining comparable bandwidth, but 20 times lower power with
respect to DSTMS.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper introduces a feature-resolved methodology to analyze single emitters' photoluminescence by combining various analyses. They study CdSe/CdS quantum dots, revealing emission dynamics not seen in ensemble methods and provide quantum parameters and useful analysis tools. The methods apply to various light sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for understanding single quantum dot dynamics, which is crucial for optimizing quantum light sources.

Method: They use a combination of lifetime, spectral, and photon correlation analyses, integrating feature-resolved and event-selective methods.

Result: They uncover emission dynamics via multi-method integration and accurately determine quantum parameters.

Conclusion: Advanced techniques enhance understanding of individual quantum dots, promoting quantum light development.

Abstract: We present a feature-resolved methodology to analyse the photoluminescence
dynamics of single emitters using a combination of lifetime, spectral, and
photon correlation analyses. By integrating conventional ensemble photon
statistics measurements with emission state-resolved, spectrally filtered, and
lifetime-gated methods, we uncover emission dynamics that remain hidden in
ensemble treatment. We study the fluorescence of single CdSe/CdS core/shell
colloidal quantum dots under varying excitation powers. Using feature-resolved
analysis, we understand the radiative and non-radiative recombination
processes, and estimate quantum parameters. Event-selective analysis provides a
versatile toolkit for characterizing emitters, both single and aggregate
particles. These methods are broadly applicable to a wide class of
photoluminescent emitters, such as nitrogen vacancy centres in nanodiamond,
epitaxial quantum dots, and perovskite nanocrystals. The application of these
lateral investigation techniques will contribute to the advancement of quantum
light source development.

### [128] [Raman-enabled platicon microcomb in 4H-SiC microresonator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19237)
*Jingwei Li,Ruixuan Wang,Qing Li*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Stimulated Raman scattering in Kerr microresonators was thought to prevent Kerr soliton microcombs, but the authors showed that it can instead help create platicon microcombs in normal dispersion, improving efficiency and broadening the spectrum by including a Stokes soliton. They achieved 56% pump-to-comb efficiency in a 1500-1700 nm comb, and extending it to over 1800 nm by adding a Stokes soliton.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about overcoming challenges in Kerr soliton microcombs using the Raman effect, showing that improper understanding can hinder progress but fixing it can lead to new, improved systems.

Method: Experiments conducted in Kerr microresonator using pump-probe methods to demonstrate both platicon solitons and Stokes solitons, measuring conversion efficiency and spectral broadening.

Result: 56% high conversion efficiency and extended spectral coverage by using Stokes solitons.

Conclusion: Raman scattering can be positive, not negative, aiding in creating better microcomb systems with enhanced capability and wider bandwidth.

Abstract: Stimulated Raman scattering in a Kerr microresonator is generally considered
a competing nonlinear process that hinders the formation of Kerr soliton
microcombs. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that the ubiquitous
Raman gain in Kerr microresonators can, in fact, be harnessed to achieve the
opposite effect: it enables the formation of platicon microcomb in the normal
dispersion regime, while also relaxing the conditions for soliton formation and
broadening the spectrum through the simultaneous excitation of a Stokes
soliton. We showcase this process in a compact silicon carbide microresonator
supporting a platicon microcomb spanning 1500 to 1700 nm, with a pump-to-comb
conversion efficiency as high as $56\%$. Furthermore, the presence of a Stokes
soliton in the same mode family extends the comb spectrum beyond 1800 nm. By
intentionally leveraging-rather than suppressing-the Raman effect, our work
offers new insights into the Raman-Kerr interplay and introduces a promising
approach to generating broadband platicon microcombs.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) frequency range holds immense potential for high-speed data
processing and signal manipulation. However, a fundamental challenge remains:
the efficient and tunable control of THz electromagnetic fields. One promising
approach is polaritonic engineering, which leverages hybrid light-matter
excitations to manipulate THz fields at sub-wavelength scales. Here, we
introduce quantum paraelectric materials as a powerful new platform for THz
phonon-polaritonics, leveraging the pronounced nonlinearities of incipient
ferroelectrics. These nonlinearities enable strong self- and cross-coupling
between polaritons, facilitating all-optical, reconfigurable THz signal
control. Using a novel space- and time-resolved imaging technique, we directly
observe the ballistic propagation of bulk phonon-polaritons in SrTiO$_3$, and
uncover soliton-like, dispersion-free transport in its low-temperature,
quantum-fluctuation-dominated phase. Our results establish quantum paraelectric
solids as a versatile and highly tunable medium for next-generation THz
photonics and ultrafast information processing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: At optical frequencies, interactions of the electric field component of light
with matter are dominating, whereas magnetic dipole transitions are inherently
weak and challenging to access independently from electric dipole transitions.
However, magnetic dipole transitions are of interest, as they can provide
valuable complementary information about the matter under investigation. Here,
we present an approach which combines structured light irradiation with
tailored sample morphology for enhanced and highcontrast optical magnetic field
excitation, and we test this technique on Eu$^{3+}$ ions. We generate
spectrally tunable, narrowband, polarization-shaped ultrashort laser pulses,
which are specifically optimized for the spectral and the spatial selective
excitation of magnetic dipole and electric dipole transitions in Eu$^{3+}$ :
Y$_2$O$_3$ nanostructures integrated into a metallic antenna. In the presence
of the metallic antenna, the excitation with an azimuthally polarized beam is
shown to provide at least a 3.0-4.5-fold enhancement of the magnetic dipole
transition as compared to a radially polarized beam or a conventional Gaussian
beam. Thus, our setup provides new opportunities for the spectroscopy of
forbidden transitions.

TL;DR: 研究指出，对比度传递函数（CTF）在评估扫描电子显微镜（STEM）中的相位重建方法时存在局限，因为它忽略了电子流量有限和检测的泊松限制。使用频域信号到噪声比（SSNR）作为更准确的剂量 aware metric评估了多种方法，结果表明CTF高估了实际性能，特别是低剂量情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相位重建方法在STEM中的广泛应用使得评估这些方法的性能变得重要。CTF通常用于评估，但其假设条件可能在实际中不成立，导致过高估测性能。

Method: 通过数值重构白色噪声对象，比较了中心质心、 pupil imaging、 direct ptychography 和 iterative ptychography 在不同剂量下的 SSNR。推导出这些方法的闭式解析表达式。分析了迭代 ptychography 在不同剂量下的 SSNR 表现，发现其表现出剂量依赖性，低剂量时接近 direct ptychography，高剂量时趋于最大探测量子效率。

Result: 对比度传递函数（CTF）在评估相位重建方法时存在显著局限，尤其是在低剂量情况下。使用 SSNR 作为替代指标更准确地反映了实际性能。中心质心、 pupil imaging 和 direct ptychography 的 SSNR 在剂量上是独立的，而迭代 ptychography 的 SSNR 随剂量变化，表现出有趣的特性，特别是其在高剂量时的饱和性。

Conclusion: CTF 应被视为辅助工具，而非核心的评估指标。SSNR 作为剂量 aware 的统计框架，提供了一个更准确评估相位重建方法性能的基础。该研究促使研究人员在评估这些方法时采用更全面和准确的指标，以反映实际性能。

Abstract: The contrast transfer function (CTF) is widely used to evaluate phase
retrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM),
including center-of-mass imaging, parallax imaging, direct ptychography, and
iterative ptychography. However, the CTF reflects only the maximum usable
signal, neglecting the effects of finite electron fluence and the
Poisson-limited nature of detection. As a result, it can significantly
overestimate practical performance, especially in low-dose regimes. Here, we
employ the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR), as a dose-aware statistical
framework to evaluate the recoverable signal as a function of spatial
frequency. Using numerical reconstructions of white-noise objects, we show that
center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent
SSNRs, with close-form analytic expressions. In contrast, iterative
ptychography exhibits a surprising dose dependence: at low fluence, its SSNR
converges to that of direct ptychography; at high fluence, it saturates at a
value consistent with the maximum detective quantum efficiency predicted by
recent quantum Fisher information bounds. The results highlight the limitations
of CTF-based evaluation and motivate SSNR as a more accurate, dose-aware metric
for assessing STEM phase retrieval methods.
