In gravitational asymptotically AdS spacetimes, TFT sectors which are putatively decoupled from local metric data are nevertheless non-perturbatively sensitive to Newton's constant via a sum over topologically distinct saddle point configurations. Tracking the fate of this non-decoupling in the boundary dual, we argue that in spite of appearances, this dependence on Newton's constant extends to local metric fluctuations. Said differently, TFTs are in the Swampland. In tandem with earlier results on the absence of global symmetries in theories with subregion-subregion duality, this also establishes that topological operators of boundary systems with a gravity dual are always non-topological in the bulk."}

In the gravitational dual, these bubbles correspond to static, inhomogeneous and unstable black-brane solutions with a localized deformation on the horizon. We construct these solutions across the entire metastable branch and compute the surface tension and the nucleation rate. We then compare these microscopic results with those obtained from a two-derivative effective action for the order parameter in two different scenarios. When the effective action is derived from the microscopic theory via holography, we find remarkable agreement. However, when the effective action is constrained only by the equation of state and dimensional analysis, significant discrepancies emerge. These discrepancies can be resolved if an additional constraint related to the surface tension is imposed."}

We analize properties of three characteristic quantum systems, subject to long-range interactions: (i) ideal Bose gas (ii) interacting Bose gas (iii) ideal Fermi gas. In the absence of short-range interactions, we identify a crossover from a stable, weakly modulated phase realized for repulsive interactions to a delocalized bound state for attractive interactions, marked by clustering, loss of superfluidity, and the absence of a thermodynamic limit. Introducing short-range repulsion, either through contact interactions or fermionic statistics, leads to the formation of a mesoscopic gas-like regime that disappears in the thermodynamic limit. A qualitative phase diagram is proposed to illustrate the combined effects of short- and long-range interactions, highlighting the emergence of distinct regimes with characteristic structural properties."}

Starting from a mechanistic five-channel, density-dependent CTMC (symmetric self-renewal, symmetric differentiation, asymmetric division, dedifferentiation, TD death), we derive its mean-field limit and a functional CLT, obtaining a chemical Langevin diffusion whose explicit state-dependent covariance exactly matches the CTMC's aggregated channel-wise infinitesimal covariances. Within this diffusion approximation we remove the dedifferentiation flux and obtain a sharp dichotomy: in subcritical regimes the stem coordinate becomes extinct asymptotically almost surely, whereas in supercritical regimes polynomial moments diverge exponentially. This identifies, at the diffusion level, a structural failure mode of strictly hierarchical lineages under demographic fluctuations and clarifies how a cyclic return flux can rescue homeostasis. For interpretation we also derive an exact totals ODE backbone from a damage-structured transport model and obtain two steady-state constraints (ratio and equalization laws) linking compartment ratios to turnover and balancing dedifferentiation against fate bias.

Rank-based diagnostics are commonly used in such problems to assess the effective dimensionality accessible to observation, often under the implicit assumption that rank deficiency can be resolved through numerical refinement. Here we examine this assumption by analyzing the rank and nullity of a bilinear observation operator under systematic tolerance variation. Rather than focusing on a specific reconstruction algorithm, we study the operator directly and identify extended rank plateaus that persist across broad tolerance ranges. These plateaus indicate stable dimensional deficits that are not removed by refinement procedures applied within a fixed problem definition. To investigate the origin of this behavior, we resolve the nullspace into algebraic sectors defined by the block structure of the variables. The nullspace exhibits a pronounced but nonexclusive concentration in specific sectors, revealing an organized internal structure rather than uniform dimensional loss. Comparing refinement with explicit modification of the problem formulation further shows that rank recovery in the reported setting requires a change in the structure of the observation problem itself. Here, \"problem modification\" refers to changes that alter the bilinear observation structure (e.g., admissible operator/state families or coupling constraints), in contrast to refinements that preserve the original formulation such as tolerance adjustment and numerical reparameterizations. Together, these results delineate limits of rank recovery in bilinear observation problems and clarify the distinction between numerical refinement and problem modification in accessing effective dimensional structure."}

At its core, the BCJ double copy is directly due to a duality between the algebraic relations of a color root and those of a kinematic root. We generalize this principle beyond the conventional Lie algebra structure of tree-level Yang-Mills theory. By demanding color-kinematics duality for the complete basis of four-point color structures -- including those involving the symmetric $d^{abc}$ constants -- we define the universal double copy. We systematically classify the bases of all such parity-even generalized gauge-theory numerators and, independently, the space of all parity-even four-graviton higher-derivative operators. We demonstrate that our universal double-copy construction precisely spans the entire tower of parity-even four-graviton amplitudes in any dimension, except for the Lovelock $R^3$ contribution in $D >6$ which we can express in terms of a particularly simple universal triple-copy involving gauge theories coupled to scalars. Explicit machine-readable expressions for the complete basis of gauge-theory numerators and fundamental gravitational building blocks are provided in the ancillary files.

The aim is to monitor and detect stable and reliable precursor signals on an adequate time scale, well before an earthquake event, that can play a crucial role in activating alarms for civil protection systems. The precursor signal relies on continuous measurements of the time evolution of tectonic stress, obtained by interrogating underground, with a high energy collimated muon beam, the piezoelectric fabrics present in quartz rich granite like rocks surrounding a known seismogenic fault in the Earth crust. Beam propagation through the rock across the active fault conveys to a detector at the exit of the traversal information on the amplitude of the piezoelectric field, which scales with the tectonic stress applied to quartz crystals embedded in the rock. The system, named ERMES (Earthquake Reconnaissance using Muon beam Evolution in Silicon dioxide), differs from other techniques under study detecting electromagnetic signals generated by piezoelectricity outside the Earth crust, as it probes piezoelectric effects directly inside the source region of the associated electromagnetic field, namely the near field within quartz crystals rather than the far field in open space. We present a focused analysis of muon beam manipulation after rock traversal and before detection using a newly conceived muonic lens, and we explore the maximum rock penetration capability of a high energy muon beam, reaching about 3 km of rock thickness for a 10 TeV beam. Owing to the peculiarity of muon propagation through such kilometer scale targets, we cross checked previous FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations with Geant4 to clarify the secondary muons role generated by primary muon interactions in solid matter over long propagation lengths."}

In particular, criticality-enhanced metrology through time-translation symmetry breaking in many-body systems, a distinct paradigm compared to spatial symmetry breaking, is a field still in its infancy. Here, we have investigated the enhanced sensing at the boundary of a continuous time-crystal (CTC) phase in a driven Rydberg atomic gas. By mapping the full phase diagram, we identify the parameter-dependent phase boundary where the time-translation symmetry is broken. This allows us to use a single setup for measuring multiple parameters, in particular frequency and amplitude of a microwave field. By increasing the microwave field amplitude, we first observe a phase transition from a thermal phase to a CTC phase, followed by a second transition into a distinct CTC state, characterized by a different oscillation frequency. Furthermore, we reveal the precise relationship between the CTC phase boundary and the scanning rate, displaying enhanced precision beyond the Standard Quantum Limit. This work not only provides a promising paradigm rooted in the critical properties of time crystals, but also advances a method for multi-parameter sensing in non-equilibrium quantum phases."}

Here we develop an analytical electromagnetic-thermal coupling model that directly links transfer-matrix-based interference-controlled energy deposition with transient heat conduction in EUV-irradiated multilayers. The model reveals a fundamental trade-off whereby increasing the multilayer period number enhances reflectivity but simultaneously elevates temperature by impeding heat dissipation. Interference-driven volumetric absorption further gives rise to pronounced axial temperature gradients and a post-pulse downward migration of the heat-flux maximum, a delayed-heating effect inaccessible to conventional surface-flux-based models. Systematic analysis establishes scaling laws connecting interfacial thermal resistance, beam size, and incident energy density to thermal confinement and temperature rise. By incorporating interfacial compaction kinetics, the model enables a quantitative assessment of mirror lifetime. This work offers a theoretical tool for thermal-optical co-design of multilayer nanostructures including EUV mirrors under pulsed irradiation across a wide spectral range."}

Recent experiments and numerics indicate that an anomalous composite Fermi liquid (ACFL) can also arise at half filling of a Chern band without any external magnetic field, opening new possibilities for paired states of composite fermions beyond the fully gapped Pfaffian phase. We argue that in inversion-asymmetric Chern bands with lattice rotational symmetry reduced to $C_3$, as realized in experimental platforms where signatures of the ACFL have been observed, composite fermions can form a superconductor with neutral gapless Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. We term the resulting electronic state {\\it the composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid (CBFL)}. This phase has a number of remarkable properties that make it distinct from both the ACFL and the fully gapped Pfaffian. For instance, it is incompressible, has quantized Hall conductance, shows no quantum oscillations as a function of magnetic field or doping, and has topological ground state degeneracy on a torus despite the presence of gapless quasiparticles. At the same time, the neutral Bogoliubov Fermi surface yields metallic $T$-linear specific heat, non-quantized thermal conductance, Landau damping of density fluctuations, and a non-analytic $|\\mathbf{q}|^3$ contribution to the equal-time structure factor $S(\\mathbf{q})$. We also briefly discuss vortex physics and possible fractionalized daughter states induced by doping or external magnetic fields. Our results pave the way for a broader understanding of gapless topological phases arising from paired composite fermions in Chern bands that go beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm."}

We concentrate on modeling the BH as a single mode squeezed state successively interacting, by means of beam splitters and squeezers, with vacuum modes near the horizon, giving rise to entangled pairs representing the external Hawking radiation and its partner particle inside the horizon. Since all states and operations are Gaussian throughout, we use a symplectic formalism to track the evolution of the composite system through the evolving means and variances of their quadrature operators. This allows us to easily compute correlations and entanglement between the BH and the HR, as well as calculate correlations between the BH at early and late times."}

Earlier experimental and simulation findings suggest that these reduced-pitch GEMs can outperform the standard configuration in terms of effective gain, collection efficiency, and position resolution. However, a noticeable fraction of avalanche electrons is lost within the GEM systems, resulting in a degradation of charge collection efficiency. Therefore, a comprehensive simulation-based study is essential to provide deeper insights into the extent of degradation and its contributing factors. In this context, we employ ANSYS and Garfield++ to model the Triple GEM detectors with reduced pitch sizes of 90 and 60 $μ$m, and perform a comparative performance analysis with the standard configuration (pitch size: 140 $μ$m). At first, the simulation framework is validated by comparing the results of the standard configuration with available experimental data and previously reported simulation outcomes. Despite the characteristic gain offset, the framework remains physically consistent and reliable in capturing microscopic avalanche dynamics, reproducing the experimental trend. Following validation, we investigate electron losses at the metal electrodes and within the Kapton holes, electron transmission through the transfer and induction regions, electron diffusion on the induction electrode, and the overall collection efficiency. These parameters are analyzed as functions of GEM potential, outer hole diameter, inner hole diameter, Kapton thickness, metal thickness, and gas composition, thereby offering insights for designing efficient GEM detectors."}

In particular, criticality-enhanced metrology through time-translation symmetry breaking in many-body systems, a distinct paradigm compared to spatial symmetry breaking, is a field still in its infancy. Here, we have investigated the enhanced sensing at the boundary of a continuous time-crystal (CTC) phase in a driven Rydberg atomic gas. By mapping the full phase diagram, we identify the parameter-dependent phase boundary where the time-translation symmetry is broken. This allows us to use a single setup for measuring multiple parameters, in particular frequency and amplitude of a microwave field. By increasing the microwave field amplitude, we first observe a phase transition from a thermal phase to a CTC phase, followed by a second transition into a distinct CTC state, characterized by a different oscillation frequency. Furthermore, we reveal the precise relationship between the CTC phase boundary and the scanning rate, displaying enhanced precision beyond the Standard Quantum Limit. This work not only provides a promising paradigm rooted in the critical properties of time crystals, but also advances a method for multi-parameter sensing in non-equilibrium quantum phases."}

We present here the first example of on-chip synthesis and characterization of two-mode optical fields in an integrated on-chip hexagonal mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Starting with incoherent two-mode light, we adjust the degree of coherence on the chip with non-unitary transformations, construct $2\\times2$ unitary transformations to synthesize prescribed coherence matrices, and reconstruct the coherence matrices via measurements of the spatial Stokes parameters. These results indicate the possibility of deploying programmable photonics for producing large-dimensional structured partially coherent light for applications in communications, cryptography, sensing, and spectroscopy."}

We identify distinct phases of collective organization, ranging from disordered gas-like states to polar traveling waves and nematic independent clusters, depending on the interplay between chemotactic sensitivity and angular noise. The system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking and density waves driven purely by the coupling between population dynamics (birth-death processes) and environmental feedback.

While there are many different methods of measuring the emittance, this paper focuses on quantifying the systematic errors present in transverse phase space measurements taken with slit-profiler methods, i.e. scanning a narrow slit over the beam and continually measuring the passed beamlets' divergence with a downstream profiler. The measurement errors include effects of the slit size, beamlet imaging, and residual space charge. While these effects are generally small, they can have significant impact on the measured emittance when the 2D phase space is strongly coupled.

In the extended phase, we uncover a universal subdiffusive transport when the bath chemical potential aligns with the band edges.

We analyze the behavior of charged particles in this geometry and find that the spacetime structure itself responds non-monotonically to the background magnetic field $B$. Specifically, both the event horizon and the static limit surface first expand as $B$ increases, reach a maximum size at an intermediate field strength, and then contract toward the extremal limit. Although the ergoregion itself shrinks monotonically with $B$, this structural feature gives rise to a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of the energy extraction efficiency on the magnetic field $B$, i.e., the efficiency initially rises, attains a maximum value, and subsequently falls as the extremal condition is approached. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic trends usually associated with magnetic enhancements in the Kerr geometry. We further explore an astrophysical application of the MPP by estimating the maximum energy of electrons escaping from the ergoregion of the KBR BH. Modeling neutron beta decay occurring near the event horizon, we derive an analytical expression for the energy gained by electrons accelerated by the magnetic field. Applying our results to the supermassive BH at the Galactic center, $\\mathrm{SgrA}^*$, we find that electrons can be accelerated up to energies of $\\sim 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ for realistic values of the spin and magnetic field.

At the exactly solvable WZW point these coincide with the conformal D-branes, providing a natural link to conformal perturbation theory."}

However, the opening process depends on many electrical parameters of the plant, and it re-quires determining their joint and individual effect on its dynamics. The purpose of this research is to study and determine the effects of electrical parameters, including those of the discharge voltages of the entire electrical circuit of the accelerator on the dynamics of the plasma opening switch, in particular opening speed, current amplitudes, and opening time, as well as to give recommendations on optimizing the operation of accelerators of this type and highlight possible ways to increase the voltage multiplication factor. Methodology. A method for determining the induced voltage according to experimental current oscillograms has been proposed. The methodology was verified by the coincidence of its data with the results of measurements by a capacitive voltage divider with the data spread of less than 20%. Scientific novelty. The rates of change in the current at the plasma switch opening stage were determined depending on the main electrical parameters of the DIN-2K accelerator. The diagnostics of the voltage induced during the POS opening were provided using no capacitive voltage divider in the internal volume of the accelerator, which enabled the removal of some diagnostic tools from the working volume of the chamber. Practical significance."}

Classical configuration-interaction methods, while rigorous, suffer from exponential scaling, rendering them impractical for large or strongly correlated systems. Overcoming this limitation is central to realizing the promise of quantum computing in chemistry. Here, we investigate the pyridine-Li ion complex using three quantum algorithms: the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the subspace quantum diagonalization (SQD) method, and the recently introduced handover iterative VQE (HI-VQE). Our results demonstrate how new generations of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks overcome the scalability and noise sensitivity that constrain conventional VQE approaches. SQD and HI-VQE achieve ground-state energy calculations for problem sizes inaccessible to classical computation, marking a clear advance toward quantum advantage. In particular, HI-VQE enables calculations within active spaces as large as (24e,22o), requiring 44 qubits-well beyond the reach of classical CASCI and VQE. This capability provides a systematic pathway for incorporating increasing numbers of electrons into quantum treatment, thereby approaching exact molecular energies. Importantly, both SQD and HI-VQE exhibit robustness against hardware noise, a critical improvement over earlier approaches. By enabling quantum simulations of molecular systems previously deemed intractable, SQD and HI-VQE offer a realistic route toward practical quantum advantage in computational chemistry. The comparison between HI-VQE and SQD shows that optimizing circuit parameters is crucial for accurate simulation."}

Although this dependence is central to Lifshitz theory of the Casimir effect, the formulation of the force in terms of dielectric functions evaluated at imaginary frequencies has largely obscured its connection to real-frequency optical properties, limiting the use of Casimir interactions as a probe of materials. Here we demonstrate that Casimir force measurements encode sufficient information to reconstruct a material's broadband optical response. Using supervised machine learning to invert Lifshitz theory, we determine the complex permittivity of a material over more than seven orders of magnitude in frequency from a single force-distance curve. We show that measurements at different separations selectively constrain distinct frequency ranges of the dielectric response, providing direct physical insight into how quantum fluctuations sample the electromagnetic spectrum. These results establish Casimir interactions as a physically constrained, broadband spectroscopic tool and open new opportunities for optical characterization in regimes inaccessible to conventional techniques."}

The EL spectra reveal both the heavy-hole neutral free exciton (X$^0$) and the high-energy free exciton of the H band (HE). A combination of transition energies, lifetimes, spatial emission profiles, and temperature dependences points to a predominantly two-dimensional character for these excitons at the SH. For X$^0$, the EL peak energies (1515.5-1515.7 meV) lie slightly above the corresponding bulk GaAs photoluminescence (PL) line at 1515.3 meV, while time-resolved measurements yield markedly shorter lifetimes for EL than for PL (337 ps vs. 1610 ps), consistent with recombination in a confined interfacial layer. The HE exciton exhibits a Stark blueshift under forward bias below threshold, and its energies and lifetimes (down to 575 ps) are tuned by the topgate voltage; above threshold, HE emission is quenched in favor of X$^0$. Finally, the tidal effect $-$ a form of pulsed EL generated by swapping the topgate voltage polarity in ambipolar field-effect transistors $-$ produces an X$^0$ line at the same energy as in the lateral p-n junction and reproduces the characteristic nonmonotonic frequency dependence of the brightness previously observed in quantum-well heterostructures, again indicating a 2D-like origin. Taken together, these results show electrically generated and controllable 2D-like excitons (HE and X$^0$), thereby bridging 2D exciton physics and 2DEG/2DHG platforms in dopant-free GaAs/AlGaAs SH devices."}

Key to this is the identification of ramps in which both coherent and incoherent parts of the open-system dynamics affect the excitation density in a non-negligible way. We also identify the specific ramps for which subleading corrections to the asymptotic scaling laws are suppressed, which serves as a guide to dynamically probing quantum critical exponents in experimentally realistic finite-temperature situations."}

Here, we demonstrate that a time-independent coupled system of discrete and continuous time crystals induces a simultaneous two-fold temporal symmetry breaking, resulting in a hierarchical time crystal phase. Interestingly, one of the subsystems breaks an emergent discrete temporal symmetry that does not exist in the dynamical generator but rather emerges dynamically, leading to a convoluted non-equilibrium phase. We demonstrate that hierarchical time crystals are robust, emerging for fundamentally different coupling schemes and persisting across wide ranges of system parameters."}

Here, we use ultrafast coherent vibrational spectroscopy with 10-fs time resolution in the 450-nm spectral range to study their excited state coherent vibrational dynamics. We observe that coherent wavepacket motion along high-frequency C-C stretching modes with ~ 20-fs period is rapidly damped on a 20-fs timescale. In contrast, coherent motion along several low-frequency modes persists much longer. We attribute this to a mode-selective intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution driven by nonadiabatic couplings between the optical bright state and a close-lying dark electronic state, in accordance with model calculations. Our results may be of relevance for the formation of long-lived radical pair states in magnetic-field sensitive proteins."}

Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin-squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semi-classical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment.

To deal with the necessary resorts of the ordering of the two-electron integrals and amplitudes, spin-adaptation, and the O(M$^5$) contractions (with M as the number of basis functions) of a CC calculation, we suggest a strategy that uses both the reduced and non-reduced representation of the corresponding quantities and switches back and forth between them.

Each of these interconnects is represented by a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, which can reside in either a trivial or a topological phase. Using a tight-binding approach, we show that such a system can transit from an insulating phase to a robust metallic phase as the interconnects undergo a transition from a trivial to a topological phase. In the latter, despite the random interconnectedness, the metal evades Anderson localization and exhibits a ballistic conductance that scales linearly with the number of wires. We show that this behavior originates from hopping renormalization in the wire network. The zero-energy modes of the topological interconnects act as effective random dimers, giving rise to an energy-dependent localization length that diverges as $\\sim 1/E^2$.

We first develop a self-consistent electrostatic theory for layer charge densities incorporating charge transfer, which reproduces the experimentally observed broadened and bent charge neutrality region. When the substrate's band edge has a much larger effective mass than RMG, its carriers can form a Wigner crystal at low densities. This creates a quantum superlattice that induces topological flat bands in the RMG layer, which may lead to Chern insulators driven by intralayer Coulomb interactions. Conversely, with comparable effective masses, we find an interlayer excitonic insulator state at charge neutrality stabilized by interlayer Coulomb coupling. Our work establishes these charge-transfer heterostructures as a rich platform for topological and excitonic correlated states, opening an avenue for ``charge-transferonics''."}

Our results indicate that EOFC Doppler thermometry is a promising approach to realizing a primary thermometer with size and measurement rate sufficient for applications including pharmaceutical manufacturing and nuclear waste monitoring."}

However, the electrodynamics underlying this emergent field remains poorly understood. In this context, magnetic domain walls - one dimensional topological defects with two collective modes, sliding and spin tilt - offer a promising platform for exploration. Here, we demonstrate that the dissipative motion of domain walls under oscillatory current excitation generates an emergent electric field. We image domain patterns and quantify domain wall length under applied magnetic fields in mesoscopic devices based on the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. These devices exhibit exceptionally strong domain wall scattering and a pronounced emergent electric field, observed in the imaginary component of the complex impedance. Spin dynamics simulations reveal that domain wall sliding dominates over spin tilting, where the phase delay of the domain wall motion with respect to the driving force impacts the emergent electric field. Our findings establish domain-wall dynamics as a platform for studying emergent electromagnetic fields and motivate further investigations on the coupled motion of magnetic solitons and conduction electrons."}

For superconductors, CH acts as a driving mechanism for the phase transition and modifies the spectral properties of the system. We present the evolution of the spectral function as the system approaches the Mott-type transition under varying model parameters. In quantum-dot-based devices, CH influences the tunneling amplitude between the dot and metallic leads. We demonstrate that the characteristic changes in the conductance of a normal metal-quantum dot-normal metal structure provide a clear signature of the presence and sign of CH interaction."}

Their physics can be captured by a minimal model of a delta potential lattice within a single LL, realizing exact zero energy Chern bands (denoted as decorated Landau levels or dLL) gapped from dispersive bands with rich geometric properties. With $p/q$ magnetic fluxes per unit cell, there are $q$ dispersive bands and $p-q$ zero energy bands forming the dLL. When the one-body potential strength dominates the electron-electron interaction, band mixing is suppressed and the dispersion bands consist of ``localized states\" with vanishing total Chern number. Nevertheless these dispersive bands can have highly nontrivial Berry curvature distribution, and even non-zero Chern numbers when $q>1$. Interestingly even in the limit of large short range interaction, band mixing between dLL and dispersion bands can be strongly suppressed at low filling factor, leading to robust topological phases within the dLL stabilized by the one-body potential. The dLL and the associated dispersive bands can serve as minimal theoretical models for correlated physics in lattice or moire systems; they are also highly tunable experimental platforms for realizing rich phase diagrams of exotic 2D quantum fluids."}

Recent theoretical developments have established shift automorphisms as a fundamental building block for completing the universal set of logical gates for qLDPC codes. However, practical challenges remain because the existing SWAP-based shift automorphism yields logical error rates that are orders of magnitude higher than those for fault-tolerant idle operations. In this work, we address this issue by dynamically varying the syndrome measurement circuits to implement the shift automorphisms without reducing the circuit distance. We benchmark our approach on both twisted and untwisted weight-6 generalized toric codes, including the gross code family. Our time-dynamic circuits for shift automorphisms achieve performance comparable to the idle operations under the circuit-level noise model (SI1000). Specifically, the dynamic circuits achieve more than an order of magnitude reduction in logical error rates relative to the SWAP-based scheme for the gross code at a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, employing the BP-OSD decoder. Our findings improve both the error resilience and the time overhead of the shift automorphisms in qLDPC codes. Furthermore, our work can lead to alternative syndrome extraction circuit designs, such as leakage removal protocols, providing a practical pathway to utilizing dynamic circuits that extend beyond surface codes towards qLDPC codes."}

To this effect, we analyze the model of Berkooz, Brukner, Jia and Mamroud that interpolates between the double-scaled SYK model and an integrable chord Hamiltonian. This model displays a first-order phase transition given by a kink in the free energy. We map out the dynamical behaviour, as characterized by chord number, Krylov complexity, and operator size, of the model across the phase diagram. We observe a jump in the chord numbers at the transition point, in agreement with the first-order transition. We further determine how scrambling measures, i.e.~the growth of the Lanczos coefficients and the time dependence of the operator size, change across the phase diagram. Deep inside the two phases, these measures indeed display integrable and chaotic behaviour, respectively. Across the transition however, we observe no qualitative change in these measures. This means that the thermodynamical transition does not imply a sharp transition in the growth exponent characterizing the dynamical chaotic behaviour. We also discuss a possible holographic interpretation of the model."}

We extend the pseudospectral code ROXAS (Relativistic Oscillations of non-aXisymmetric neutron stArS) to enable the dynamical evolution of oscillating, differentially rotating neutron stars. Using the updated code, we aim to study the star's oscillation frequencies. We extend the previous formalism, based on primitive variables and the conformal flatness approximation, to differential rotation. Within this framework, we run a series of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric simulations of perturbed, differentially rotating neutron stars with different rotation rates, and extract their oscillation frequencies. Axisymmetric modes, as well as those under the Cowling approximation, show excellent agreement with published results. We show that the secondary fundamental mode in the Cowling approximation is an artifact that does not appear in dynamical spacetimes. In addition, we provide, for the first time, frequency values for non-axisymmetric modes in differentially rotating configurations evolved in conformal flatness. This extension broadens the range of physical scenarios that can be studied with ROXAS, and represents a step toward more realistic modeling of post-merger remnants and their gravitational-wave emission."}

Neural network decoders like AlphaQubit have demonstrated potential, achieving higher accuracy than traditional human-designed decoding algorithms. However, existing implementations of neural network decoders lack the parallelism required to decode the syndrome stream generated by a superconducting logical qubit in real time. Moreover, integrating AlphaQubit with sliding window-based parallel decoding schemes presents non-trivial challenges: AlphaQubit is trained solely to output a single bit corresponding to the global logical correction for an entire memory experiment, rather than local physical corrections that can be easily integrated. We address this issue by training a recurrent, transformer-based neural network specifically tailored for parallel window decoding. While it still outputs a single bit, we derive training labels from a consistent set of local corrections and train on various types of decoding windows simultaneously. This approach enables the network to self-coordinate across neighboring windows, facilitating high-accuracy parallel decoding of arbitrarily long memory experiments.\n  As a result, we overcome the throughput bottleneck that previously precluded the use of AlphaQubit-type decoders in FTQC.

Most remarkably, in 4D we discover \\textit{fragmented topological excitations}: while such excitations manifest as discrete, isolated points in real space, their projections onto lower-dimensional subsystems form connected objects such as loops, revealing the intrinsic topological nature of these excitations. Therefore, fragmented excitations constitute an intriguing intermediate class between point-like and spatially extended topological excitations.

The amplification arises from a monopole induced reduction of the centrifugal barrier. This shift deepens the gravitational bound-state potential well and produces a parametrically larger instability growth rate. This resulting rapid growth yields a macroscopic boson cloud that acts as a coherent source of near monochromatic continuous gravitational waves (GWs). We find an enhanced GW power. Monopole harmonic selection rules restrict the emission from the north (south) clouds corresponding to opposite helicities. Their superposition generates an (approximately) circularly polarized continuous GWs at a fixed sky location within even parity general relativity, distinct from the generic elliptical polarization of the Kerr case. In light of these new findings, we propose a potential smoking-gun search strategy for magnetic monopole and ultralight boson: the rapid post-merger follow-up GW signals from binary-black-hole merger remnants through ground-based and space-based GW experiments. In contrast to the Kerr case, where the signal turn-on can be delayed to decades-centuries, a magnetic remnant can form a cloud and emit a stronger, circularly polarized continuous GWs within weeks to months. Taking the magnetic supermassive remnants as an example, we demonstrate that the rapid follow-up GW signal in the mHz band appears just in few weeks after binary black hole mergers. Moreover, future polarization (ellipticity) measurements can distinguish the magnetic scenario from Kerr while providing a parity-even mechanism for circularly polarized GWs in general relativity."}

We establish that for a simple U-shaped string with only radial dependence on the space string coordinate, $x_r'(σ) \\neq 0$, the string is generally not symmetric about its turning point, and the symmetry restores only for backgrounds with $h_{pr} = G_{00} G_{pr} - G_{0p} G_{0r} = 0$. Consequently, such asymmetric strings directly probe a possibility of the parity violation in the quark-antiquark interaction. Nevertheless, we identify a wide family of metrics for which the symmetry is preserved, enabling a direct isolation of the linear-in-distance term in the static interquark potential for simple symmetric string configurations, even in non-diagonal backgrounds. Applying the holographic framework, we further study the Rindler-AdS spacetime dual to an accelerated $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills plasma. We show that the distance between quarks decreases, the static potential between them increases, and the deconfinement phase transition temperature, $T_{\\rm dec} = (π/3) T_H = a_c/6$, increases with an acceleration. However, we observe that an acceleration-scaled potential as a function of the acceleration-scaled distance does not depend on the certain value of the acceleration This result, reflecting the scale invariance and self-similarity of the holographic setup, can be also obtained in the dimensionless metric after scaling of the coordinates onto the acceleration, $\\tilde{x}_i = a_c x_i$, for which one obtains an universal value of the phase transition temperature, $\\tilde{T}_{\\rm dec} = (π/3) \\tilde{T}_H = 1/6$."}

The battery consists of a single-mode electromagnetic cavity sequentially interacting, via the Rabi Hamiltonian, with a stream of qubits acting as chargers. Dissipative effects arise from the weak coupling of the qubit-cavity system to a thermal bath. Non-negligible in the USC regime, the counter-rotating terms substantially improve the charging speed, but also lead, in the absence of dissipation, to unbounded energy growth and highly mixed cavity states. Dissipation during each qubit-cavity interaction mitigates these detrimental effects, yielding steady-state of finite energy and ergotropy. Optimal control on qubit preparation and interaction times enhances battery's performance in: (i) Maximizing the stored ergotropy trhough an optimized charging protocol; (ii) Stabilizing the stored ergotropy against dissipative losses through an optimized measurement-based passive-feedback strategy. Overall, our numerical results demonstrate that the interplay of ultrastrong light-matter coupling, controlled dissipation, and optimized control strategies enables micromaser quantum batteries to achieve both enhanced charging performance and long-term stability under realistic conditions."}

As a consequence, no quantum correlations between photons and spins are needed to understand the quantum phase diagram. This enables us to determine the quantum phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit using numerical linked-cluster expansions combined with density matrix renormalization group calculations (NLCE+DMRG) to solve the resulting self-consistent matter Hamiltonian. This includes magnetically ordered phases with significantly improved accuracy compared to previous estimates. For ferromagnetic Ising couplings, we refine the location of the multicritical point governing the change in the order of the superradiant phase transition, reaching a relative accuracy of $10^{-4}$. For antiferromagnetic Ising couplings, we confirm the existence of the narrow antiferromagnetic superradiant phase in the thermodynamic limit. The effective matter Hamiltonian framework identifies the antiferromagnetic superradiant phase as the many-body ground state of an antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with longitudinal field. This phase emerges through continuous Dicke-type polariton condensation from the antiferromagnetic normal phase, followed by a first-order transition to the paramagnetic superradiant phase. Thus, NLCE+DMRG provides a precise determination of the Dicke-Ising phase diagram in one dimension by solving the self-consistent effective matter Hamiltonian."}

The modified Friedmann equations are derived for a barotropic cosmic fluid, and an analytical solution for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is obtained. Using the latest DESI DR2 BAO data, previous BAO compilations (P-BAO), and cosmic chronometer (CC) datasets, we constrain the model parameters through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. Our results show that the model successfully describes the observed late-time cosmic acceleration with slightly tighter constraints from the inclusion of DESI dataset. The present-day Hubble constant is determined as $H_0 \\simeq 69.5\\ \\mathrm{km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}}$, while the deceleration parameter confirms accelerated expansion with $q_0 \\simeq -0.57$. The transition redshift, where the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration, occurs in the range $z_{\\rm tr} \\sim 0.56 - 0.77$. Similarly, a smooth and physically consistent transition from a matter-dominated decelerated period at high redshifts to an accelerated phase at late times is revealed by the evolution of $ω_{eff}(z)$.

In quantum bianisotropy, magnetoelectric (ME) energy plays a critical role in mediating and enhancing light matter interactions. This concept is essential for bridging the gap between classical electromagnetics (where bianisotropy often involves field nonlocality) and quantum mechanics in metamaterials. The precise manipulation of a quantum emitter's properties at a subwavelength scale is due to near fields, which effectively function as a tunable environment. We show that the ME near field, interpreted as a structure combining the effect of bianisotropy (chirality) with a quantum atmosphere, is a nonMaxwellian field with spacetime symmetry breaking. Quantum ME fields arise from the dynamic modulation and topological coupling of magnetization and electric polarization within ME meta atoms, specific subwavelength structural elements with magnetic and dielectric subsystems in magnetic insulators."}

Our proposal introduces a generating system for higher-spin vertices at the level of classical equations, which we refer to as irregular, in contrast to the regular case described by Vasiliev. This system extends the recently proposed equations for (anti)holomorphic interactions by incorporating the mixed sector. Its perturbative series encompasses the entire (anti)holomorphic sector in the leading order, with vertices related to powers of the complex parity-breaking parameter $η$ or $\\barη$. The subsequent corrections facilitate the mixing of the two sectors, with vertices carrying mixed powers of $η$ and $\\barη$. The consistency relies on the nonlinear algebraic constraint, which is shown to be satisfied at least in the quadratic and cubic approximations. As a result, the previously discussed (anti)holomorphic interactions in the literature can be systematically extended to generate vertices of the form $η^N \\barη^k$ and their conjugate, at least for $k \\leq 2$ and any $N$.

Here, we demonstrate that the dissipative motion of domain walls under oscillatory current excitation generates an emergent electric field. We image domain patterns and quantify domain wall length under applied magnetic fields in mesoscopic devices based on the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi.

For the latter, Wu. et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin-squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semi-classical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable.

With $p/q$ magnetic fluxes per unit cell, there are $q$ dispersive bands and $p-q$ zero energy bands forming the dLL.

We generalize this principle beyond the conventional Lie algebra structure of tree-level Yang-Mills theory. By demanding color-kinematics duality for the complete basis of four-point color structures -- including those involving the symmetric $d^{abc}$ constants -- we define the universal double copy. We systematically classify the bases of all such parity-even generalized gauge-theory numerators and, independently, the space of all parity-even four-graviton higher-derivative operators. We demonstrate that our universal double-copy construction precisely spans the entire tower of parity-even four-graviton amplitudes in any dimension, except for the Lovelock $R^3$ contribution in $D >6$ which we can express in terms of a particularly simple universal triple-copy involving gauge theories coupled to scalars.

By developing a quantum extension of the Tug-of-War (TOW) model, we show that conservation-based internal state updates and measurement-induced disturbance preclude any non-contextual classical description with a single, unified internal state. Contextuality therefore emerges as a structural consequence of adaptive learning dynamics. We further show that the resulting measurement structure admits Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky (KCBS)-type contextuality witnesses in a minimal single-system setting. These results indicate that quantum probability is not merely a descriptive convenience, but an unavoidable effective theory for adaptive decision dynamics."}

Our key result demonstrates that the sequence length can be reduced to exactly $2r+1$-only one additional measurement beyond the original non-fault-tolerant sequence, establishing a tight lower bound. The proposed method leverages cyclic matrix transformations to systematically combine rows of the initial stabilizer matrix and preserving a self-dual CSS-like symmetry analogous to that of the original quantum Hamming codes. This induced symmetry enables hardware-efficient circuit reuse: the measurement circuits for the first $r$ stabilizers are transformed into circuits for the remaining $r$ stabilizers simply by toggling boundary Hadamard gates, eliminating redundant hardware. For distance-3 fault-tolerant error correction, our approach simultaneously reduces the time overhead via shorting the FTMS length and the hardware overhead through symmetry-enabled circuit multiplexing.

Although this dependence is central to Lifshitz theory of the Casimir effect, the formulation of the force in terms of dielectric functions evaluated at imaginary frequencies has largely obscured its connection to real-frequency optical properties, limiting the use of Casimir interactions as a probe of materials. Here we demonstrate that Casimir force measurements encode sufficient information to reconstruct a material's broadband optical response. Using supervised machine learning to invert Lifshitz theory, we determine the complex permittivity of a material over more than seven orders of magnitude in frequency from a single force-distance curve. We show that measurements at different separations selectively constrain distinct frequency ranges of the dielectric response, providing direct physical insight into how quantum fluctuations sample the electromagnetic spectrum. These results establish Casimir interactions as a physically constrained, broadband spectroscopic tool and open new opportunities for optical characterization in regimes inaccessible to conventional techniques."}

In this work, we propose a strategic approach to Heterogeneous Quantum Architectures (HQA) that synthesizes the distinct advantages of the superconducting (SC) and neutral atom (NA) platforms. We explore two architectural role assignment strategies based on hardware characteristics: (1) We offload the latency-critical Magic State Factory (MSF) to fast SC devices while performing computation on scalable NA arrays, a design we term MagicAcc, which effectively mitigates the resource-preparation bottleneck. (2) We explore a Memory-Compute Separation (MCSep) paradigm that utilizes NA arrays for high-density qLDPC memory storage and SC devices for fast surface-code processing. Our evaluation, based on a comprehensive end-to-end cost model, demonstrates that principled heterogeneity yields significant performance gains. Specifically, our designs achieve $752\\times$ speedup over NA-only baselines on average and reduce the physical qubit footprint by over $10\\times$ compared to SC-only systems. These results chart a clear pathway for leveraging cross-modality interconnects to optimize the space-time efficiency of future fault-tolerant quantum computers."}

However, the inherent sensitivity of chaos to initial conditions implies that even minute fluctuations can be amplified, thereby questioning the applicability of this approximation. Here, we analyze these chaotic effects using stochastic Langevin equations or the Lindblad master equation. For systems operating at frequencies of $10^5$ to $10^7$ Hz, we demonstrate that room-temperature thermal fluctuations are sufficient to suppress chaos at the level of expectation values, even under weak nonlinearity. Furthermore, nonlinearity induces deviations from Gaussian phase-space distributions of the quantum state, revealing attractor-like features in the Wigner function. With increasing nonlinearity, the noise threshold for chaos suppression decreases, approaching the scale of vacuum fluctuations. These results provide a bidirectional validation of the quantum mechanical suppression of chaos."}

In this paper, we study the reliability function of entanglement distillation, which specifies the optimal exponent of the decay of the distillation error when the distillation rate is below the distillable entanglement. Furthermore, to capture greater operational significance, we extend the framework from the standard setting of known states to a black-box setting, where distillation is performed from a set of possible states. We establish an exact finite blocklength result connecting to composite correlated hypothesis testing without any redundant correction terms. Based on this, the reliability function of entanglement distillation is characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence. In the special case of a pure initial state, our result reduces to the error exponent for entanglement concentration derived by Hayashi et al. in 2003. Given full prior knowledge of the state, we construct a concrete optimal distillation protocol. Additionally, we analyze the strong converse exponent of entanglement distillation. While all the above results assume the free operations to be non-entangling, we also investigate other free operation classes, including PPT-preserving, dually non-entangling, and dually PPT-preserving operations."}

By combining in-context learning with curated documentation and multi-agent decomposition, we create autonomous AI agents that can be trained in specialized computational domains within minutes. We benchmark three configurations (baseline, single-agent with in-context learning, and multi-agent with in-context learning) on problems spanning quantum phase transitions, open quantum system dynamics, and photochemical reactions. Systematic evaluation using DeepSeek-V3.2, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.5 demonstrates that both in-context learning and multi-agent architecture are essential.

This finding complements analogous recent results for states sampled from the classical compact groups. On the technical side, we employ a somewhat unconventional approach to integrating over the compact groups which may be of some independent interest.

We establish that the widely-used Snake optimizer is mathematically equivalent to Block Coordinate Descent (BCD), providing a rigorous theoretical foundation for this calibration strategy. Building on this formalization, we present a topology-aware block ordering obtained by casting order selection as a Sequence-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem (SD-TSP) and solving it efficiently with a nearest-neighbor heuristic. The SD-TSP cost reflects how a given block choice expands the reduced-circuit footprint required to evaluate the block-local objective, enabling orders that minimize per-epoch evaluation time. Under local crosstalk/bounded-degree assumptions, the method achieves linear complexity in qubit count per epoch, while retaining calibration quality. We formalize the calibration objective, clarify when reduced experiments are equivalent or approximate to the full objective, and analyze convergence of the resulting inexact BCD with noisy measurements. Simulations on multi-qubit models show that the proposed BCD-NNA ordering attains the same optimization accuracy at markedly lower runtime than graph-based heuristics (BFS, DFS) and random orders, and is robust to measurement noise and tolerant to moderate non-local crosstalk. These results provide a scalable, implementation-ready workflow for frequency calibration on NISQ-era processors."}

Instead of abstract quantum channels, we consider multi-qubit registers coupled to bosonic thermal environments, derive a second-order master equation for the reduced dynamics, and use it to benchmark the five-qubit, Steane, and toric codes under local and collective noise. We compute state fidelities for logical qubits as functions of coupling strength, bath temperature, and the number of correction cycles. In the low-temperature regime, we find that repeated error-correction with the five-qubit code strongly suppresses decoherence and relaxation, while in the high-temperature regime, thermal excitations dominate the dynamics and reduce the benefit of all codes, though the five-qubit code still outperforms the Steane and toric codes. For two-qubit Werner states, we identify a critical evolution time before which QEC does not improve fidelity, and this time increases as entanglement grows. After this critical time, QEC does improve fidelity. Comparative analysis further reveals that the five-qubit code (the smallest perfect code) offers consistently higher fidelities than topological and concatenated architectures in these open-system settings. These findings establish a quantitative framework for evaluating QEC under realistic noise environments and provide guidance for developing noise-resilient quantum architectures in near-term quantum technologies."}

Using numerical simulations, we examine how relaxation and dephasing rates depend on external flux and circuit parameters, and we identify the best compromise for maximum coherence. With currently existing circuit parameters, the qubit lifetime $T_1$ can exceed milliseconds while the dephasing time $T_\\varphi$ remains limited to only a few microseconds due to either flux or charge noise.

As a consequence, no quantum correlations between photons and spins are needed to understand the quantum phase diagram. This enables us to determine the quantum phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit using numerical linked-cluster expansions combined with density matrix renormalization group calculations (NLCE+DMRG) to solve the resulting self-consistent matter Hamiltonian. This includes magnetically ordered phases with significantly improved accuracy compared to previous estimates. For ferromagnetic Ising couplings, we refine the location of the multicritical point governing the change in the order of the superradiant phase transition, reaching a relative accuracy of $10^{-4}$. For antiferromagnetic Ising couplings, we confirm the existence of the narrow antiferromagnetic superradiant phase in the thermodynamic limit. The effective matter Hamiltonian framework identifies the antiferromagnetic superradiant phase as the many-body ground state of an antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with longitudinal field. This phase emerges through continuous Dicke-type polariton condensation from the antiferromagnetic normal phase, followed by a first-order transition to the paramagnetic superradiant phase. Thus, NLCE+DMRG provides a precise determination of the Dicke-Ising phase diagram in one dimension by solving the self-consistent effective matter Hamiltonian."}

Unlike conventional channel discrimination, we consider a framework where the sender, Alice, selects the channel input adversarially to minimize Bob's distinguishability. We analyze this problem across four settings based on whether Alice employs i.i.d. or general inputs and whether the receiver, Bob, is informed of the specific input choice (allowing his measurement to depend on the input). We characterize the Stein exponents for each setting and reveal a striking distinction in behavior: for QQ channels with i.i.d. inputs, Bob's knowledge of the input significantly enhances distinguishability, yet this advantage vanishes when general inputs are permitted. In contrast, for CQ channels, Bob being informed provides a consistent advantage over the corresponding entanglement-breaking channels for both i.i.d. and general inputs. These results demonstrate a unique phenomenon in adversarial hypothesis testing where the CQ channel does not merely behave as a special case of the QQ channel."}

The battery consists of a single-mode electromagnetic cavity sequentially interacting, via the Rabi Hamiltonian, with a stream of qubits acting as chargers. Dissipative effects arise from the weak coupling of the qubit-cavity system to a thermal bath. Non-negligible in the USC regime, the counter-rotating terms substantially improve the charging speed, but also lead, in the absence of dissipation, to unbounded energy growth and highly mixed cavity states. Dissipation during each qubit-cavity interaction mitigates these detrimental effects, yielding steady-state of finite energy and ergotropy. Optimal control on qubit preparation and interaction times enhances battery's performance in: (i) Maximizing the stored ergotropy trhough an optimized charging protocol; (ii) Stabilizing the stored ergotropy against dissipative losses through an optimized measurement-based passive-feedback strategy. Overall, our numerical results demonstrate that the interplay of ultrastrong light-matter coupling, controlled dissipation, and optimized control strategies enables micromaser quantum batteries to achieve both enhanced charging performance and long-term stability under realistic conditions."}

Benchmarking the level of indistinguishability of these photons is essential for scalability. The Hong-Ou-Mandel dip provides a benchmark for the indistinguishability between two photons, and extending this test to the multi-photon setting has so far resulted in a protocol that computes the genuine n-photon indistinguishability (GI). However, this protocol has a sample complexity that increases exponentially with the number of input photons for an estimation of GI up to a given additive error. To address this problem, we introduce new theorems that strengthen our understanding of the relationship between distinguishability and the suppression laws of the quantum Fourier transform interferometer (QFT). Building on this, we propose a protocol using the QFT for benchmarking GI that achieves constant sample complexity for the estimation of GI up to a given additive error for prime photon numbers, and sub-polynomial scaling otherwise, representing an exponential improvement over the state of the art. We prove the optimality of our protocol in many relevant scenarios and validate our approach experimentally on Quandela's reconfigurable photonic quantum processor, where we observe a clear advantage in runtime and precision over the state of the art. We therefore establish the first scalable method for computing multi-photon indistinguishability, which applies naturally to current and near-term photonic quantum hardware."}

It is shown that, in addition to the conventional dynamic Stark shift, an extra shift arises due to the distortion of the resonance line shape when bichromatic laser radiation interacts with off-resonant atomic transitions. An analytical expression for this additional shift is derived in the weak-coupling limit, and its significant impact on the resonance shape and sensitivity to the intensities of the laser field components is demonstrated. It is found that under strong coupling conditions, the additional shift can deviate substantially from a linear dependence on light intensity, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light shifts in precision atomic devices such as quantum frequency standards."}

We present a protocol that learns a quantum Hamiltonian with the optimal Heisenberg-limited scaling using only single-qubit control in the form of static fields with strengths that are independent of the target precision. Our protocol is robust against the state preparation and measurement (SPAM) error. By overcoming these limitations, our protocol provides new tools for device characterization and quantum sensing.

Existing approaches either rely on weak intermode cross-Kerr conversion or on measurement-based sequences with substantial latency. Here we demonstrate a hardware-efficient Rabi-Driven Reset (RDR) that implements continuous, measurement-free cooling of a superconducting cavity mode. A strong resonant Rabi drive on a transmon, together with sideband drives on the memory and readout modes detuned by the Rabi frequency, converts the dispersive interaction into an effective Jaynes-Cummings coupling between the qubit dressed states and each mode. This realizes a tunable dissipation channel from the memory to the cold readout bath. Crucially, the engineered coupling scales with the qubit-mode dispersive interaction and the drive amplitude, rather than with the intermode cross-Kerr, enabling fast cooling even in very weakly coupled architectures that deliberately suppress direct mode-mode coupling. We demonstrate RDR of a single photon with a decay time of $1.2 μs$, more than two orders of magnitude faster than the intrinsic lifetime.

In this work, we explore the potential for unifying the dynamics of classical and quantum physics. This discussion does not suggest that classical behavior emerges from quantum mechanics; rather, it demonstrates the exact equivalence between the dynamics of quantum observables and their classical counterparts. It is shown that the Heisenberg equations of motion can be cast in a form that is identical to Newton's equations of motion, with $\\hbar$ being absent from the formulation.

Quantum violations of the classical TUR reveal genuinely quantum thermodynamic effects, which are essential for improving performance and enabling optimization in quantum technologies. In this work, we analyze the TUR in a class of paradigmatic quantum thermal-machine models whose operation is enabled by coherent coupling between two energy levels forming a virtual qubit. Steady-state coherences are confined to this virtual-qubit subspace, while in the absence of coherent coupling the system satisfies detailed balance with the thermal reservoirs and supports no steady-state heat currents. We show that the steady-state currents and entropy production can be fully reproduced by an effective classical Markov process, whereas current fluctuations acquire an additional purely quantum correction originating from coherence. As a result, the thermodynamic uncertainty naturally decomposes into a classical (diagonal) contribution and a coherent contribution. The latter becomes negative under resonant conditions and reaches its minimum at the coupling strength that maximizes steady-state coherence. We further identify the optimization conditions and the criteria for surpassing the classical TUR bound in the vicinity of the reversible limit."}

Deviations from time-optimality for unitary evolutions between orthogonal states can only occur with time-dependent Hamiltonian evolutions or, alternatively, with constant Hamiltonian evolutions in higher-dimensional subspaces of the entire Hilbert space.

Overall, our findings indicate that time-optimal evolution trajectories are marked by high geodesic efficiency, with no energy resource wastage, no curvature (i.e., zero bending), and an average path entanglement that is less than that observed in time-suboptimal evolutions. Additionally, when analyzing separable-to-maximally entangled evolutions between nonorthogonal states, time-optimal evolutions demonstrate a greater short-time degree of nonlocality compared to time-suboptimal evolutions between the same initial and final states. Interestingly, the reverse is generally true for separable-to-maximally entangled evolutions involving orthogonal states. Our investigation suggests that this phenomenon arises because suboptimal trajectories between orthogonal states are characterized by longer path lengths with smaller curvature, which are traversed with a higher energy resource wastage compared to suboptimal trajectories between nonorthogonal states.

To enhance our understanding of the physical implications of the curvature coefficient, we analyze the curvature behavior in relation to geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and the complexity of the quantum evolution (as described by the ratio of the difference between accessible and accessed Bloch-sphere volumes for the evolution from initial to final state to the accessible volume for the given quantum evolution). Our findings indicate that, generally, efficient quantum evolutions exhibit lower complexity compared to inefficient ones. However, we also note that complexity transcends mere length.

For the latter, Wu. et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin-squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semi-classical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment. Our work illustrates the maximum disorder allowed for realizing scalable spin squeezing in a host of quantum simulators, highlights a regime with substantial tolerance to disorder, and identifies controlled defect creation as a promising route for scalable squeezing in solid-state systems."}

To this effect, we analyze the model of Berkooz, Brukner, Jia and Mamroud that interpolates between the double-scaled SYK model and an integrable chord Hamiltonian. This model displays a first-order phase transition given by a kink in the free energy. We map out the dynamical behaviour, as characterized by chord number, Krylov complexity, and operator size, of the model across the phase diagram. We observe a jump in the chord numbers at the transition point, in agreement with the first-order transition. We further determine how scrambling measures, i.e.~the growth of the Lanczos coefficients and the time dependence of the operator size, change across the phase diagram. Deep inside the two phases, these measures indeed display integrable and chaotic behaviour, respectively. Across the transition however, we observe no qualitative change in these measures. This means that the thermodynamical transition does not imply a sharp transition in the growth exponent characterizing the dynamical chaotic behaviour. We also discuss a possible holographic interpretation of the model."}

The goal of these models are (i) to be operationally simple, (ii) approximately preserve the thermal nature of the emitted Hawking Radiation (HR), and (iii) attempt to reproduce the Page Curve that purports that information flows forth from the BH when it has evaporated to approximately half its initial mass. We concentrate on modeling the BH as a single mode squeezed state successively interacting, by means of beam splitters and squeezers, with vacuum modes near the horizon, giving rise to entangled pairs representing the external Hawking radiation and its partner particle inside the horizon. Since all states and operations are Gaussian throughout, we use a symplectic formalism to track the evolution of the composite system through the evolving means and variances of their quadrature operators. This allows us to easily compute correlations and entanglement between the BH and the HR, as well as calculate correlations between the BH at early and late times."}

The superconducting output drivers are explored, which are capable of converting and amplifying, e.g., single flux quantum (SFQ) voltage pulses, to voltage levels that semiconductor circuits can process. Several trade-offs between circuit- and system-level design parameters are examined.

We thereby resolve all the conjectures presented in [arXiv:2508.21823], proving two of them and disproving the other two.

This finding adds evidence that the same inequalities also constrain the entropies under time-dependent conditions because it preempts a large class of potential counterexamples.

Classical configuration-interaction methods, while rigorous, suffer from exponential scaling, rendering them impractical for large or strongly correlated systems. Overcoming this limitation is central to realizing the promise of quantum computing in chemistry. Here, we investigate the pyridine-Li ion complex using three quantum algorithms: the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the subspace quantum diagonalization (SQD) method, and the recently introduced handover iterative VQE (HI-VQE). Our results demonstrate how new generations of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks overcome the scalability and noise sensitivity that constrain conventional VQE approaches. SQD and HI-VQE achieve ground-state energy calculations for problem sizes inaccessible to classical computation, marking a clear advance toward quantum advantage. In particular, HI-VQE enables calculations within active spaces as large as (24e,22o), requiring 44 qubits-well beyond the reach of classical CASCI and VQE. This capability provides a systematic pathway for incorporating increasing numbers of electrons into quantum treatment, thereby approaching exact molecular energies. Importantly, both SQD and HI-VQE exhibit robustness against hardware noise, a critical improvement over earlier approaches. By enabling quantum simulations of molecular systems previously deemed intractable, SQD and HI-VQE offer a realistic route toward practical quantum advantage in computational chemistry. The comparison between HI-VQE and SQD shows that optimizing circuit parameters is crucial for accurate simulation."}

In this work, we study quantum transport in the Aubry-André-Harper lattice in a two-terminal setup coupled to zero-temperature reservoirs, where the conductance is evaluated via the nonequilibrium Green's function method. In the extended phase, we uncover a universal subdiffusive transport when the bath chemical potential aligns with the band edges. Specifically, the typical conductance displays a scaling of $\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{typ}}\\sim L^{-2}$ with system size $L$. We attribute this behavior to the emergence of an exceptional point (Jordan normal form) in the transfer matrix in the thermodynamic limit. In the localized phase, the conductance shows exponential decay governed by the Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, in the critical phase, we identify pronounced log-periodic oscillations of the conductance as a function of system size, arising from the discrete scale invariance inherent to the singular-continuous spectrum. We further extend our analysis to the generalized Aubry-André-Harper model and provide numerical evidence suggesting that the exact mobility edge resides within a finite spectral gap. This results in a counter-intuitive exponential suppression of conductance precisely at the mobility edge. Our work highlights the distinct transport behaviors in quasiperiodic systems and elucidates how they are rigorously dictated by the underlying local spectral structure."}

This paper systematically examines the effect of repulsive interactions between the condensed and thermal atoms in partially condensed clouds on the expansion profile of the thermal cloud. An analytical expression for the expansion can be obtained only if the interactions between the Bose-Einstein condensate and thermal atoms are neglected, resulting in a Bose-enhanced distribution for the thermal component. Here, the deformation of the cloud due to interactions and the effects on estimated parameters are investigated by simulating the expansion using a ballistic approximation. By fitting the simulated expansion profiles with a Bose-enhanced distribution, the errors of using such a fit are estimated, and the results are explained phenomenologically. The simulation was also used as a fitting function for experimental data, showing better agreement of the extracted condensed fraction with the semi-ideal model than results from a Bose-enhanced fit."}

Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves."}

Our results indicate that EOFC Doppler thermometry is a promising approach to realizing a primary thermometer with size and measurement rate sufficient for applications including pharmaceutical manufacturing and nuclear waste monitoring."}
