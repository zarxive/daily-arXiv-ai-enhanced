While the scattering rate is only moderately anisotropic at zero strain, we find that it becomes strongly anisotropic at the Lifshitz point. At the lowest energies, we recover the expected universal behavior: the scattering rate varies (ignoring logarithmic corrections) as $\u03c4^{-1}\\sim \u03c9$ at the Van Hove point and as $\u03c4^{-1}\\sim \u03c9^{3/2}$ away from it. At higher energies, however, corrections of order $\u03c9^2$ become important in both regimes. We show that the experimentally observed behavior $\u03c4^{-1} \\sim \u03c9^\u03b1$ with $\u03b1\\approx 1.4(2)$ at the Van Hove point can be quantitatively explained by a superposition of linear and quadratic contributions to the scattering rate, which are comparable in magnitude at the intermediate energies probed by experiment, rather than in terms of a new universal power law.

The resulting planar energy functional yields compact governing equations in which the contributions of individual load types remain clearly separated. We demonstrate that the framework reproduces the classical heavy elastica equations exactly and naturally accommodates magnetic energy terms commonly used in hard magnetic rod models.

Here, we report a surfactant-free, solvent-directed laser synthesis strategy to engineer the phase and optoelectronic properties of Cadmium Phosphorus Trisulfide (CdPS3). By exploiting the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of femtosecond pulsed laser ablation in liquid (fs-PLAL), we demonstrate a tunable transition from the stoichiometric ternary phase to a highly active binary-rich heterostructure. While ablation in water preserves the monoclinic CdPS3 lattice, the reducing environment of isopropanol triggers the formation of CdS quantum dots and metallic cadmium defect sites. This solvent-induced phase engineering transforms the ultraviolet-active host into a robust visible-light photocatalyst. The resulting hybrid CdPS3/CdS nanocolloids exhibit superior charge separation efficiency, driven by Schottky-like metal-semiconductor junctions, achieving ~ 90% degradation of Methylene Blue under 532 nm irradiation within 30 minutes.

However, at not-so-high bias voltage values, the predictions of the conventional point QPC model often deviate from the experimental data both in the integer and (more prominently) in the fractional quantum Hall regime. One of the possible explanations for such behaviors is the dependence of the tunneling between the edges on energy, an effect not present in the conventional model. Here we introduce two models that take QPC spatial extension into account: wide-QPC model that accounts for the distance along which the edges are in contact; long-QPC model accounts for the fact that the tunneling amplitude originates from a finite bulk gap and a finite distance between the two edges. We investigate the predictions of these two models in the integer quantum Hall regime for the energy dependence of the tunneling amplitude. We find that these two models predict opposite dependences: the amplitude decreasing or increasing away from the Fermi level. We thus elucidate the effect of the QPC geometry on the energy dependence of the tunneling amplitude and investigate its implications for transport observables.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, as the number of comb modes is very large and the optical energy is dispersed over them, the optical energy per each comb mode is ultrasmall, limiting the sensitivity of highly sensitive spectroscopy. If we can concentrate the optical energy into the comb modes that only overlap with the absorption spectra, we can demonstrate drastic improvements in its measurement sensitivity. In this study, we developed a freely controllable optical frequency comb source based on the spectral peak phenomenon. The comb modes overlapping the CH4 absorption spectra were transformed into background-suppressed spectral peaks at the nonlinear loop mirror using a CH4 gas cell. Coherence-preserving power scaling of the generated comb was demonstrated using a fiber Raman amplifier. Subsequently, only the single-comb mode was filtered using a newly developed spectral filter with an ultrahigh resolution. The maximum optical power of a single comb was estimated to be more than 10 mW. The ring-down decay signal from the high-finesse optical cavity was measured using a single selected mode of the generated controllable comb. As a demonstration, the 2v_3 bands of the CH4 absorption spectra were accurately measured by comb-mode-resolved, cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) with high sensitivity up to 4.2 x 10^(-11) cm^(-1).

We begin with a general metric-affine scalar-tensor action that is linear in curvature and contains all operators that are at most quadratic in the covariant second derivatives of the scalar field, ensuring that the connection enters only through curvature and through these second derivatives. Solving the connection equation by performing a full decomposition of the distortion tensor gives a closed-form effective metric theory. Imposing the standard metric DHOST degeneracy conditions then selects a Palatini Class Ia branch that is fully determined by two free functions in the original action. Analyzing the tensor sector shows that requiring gravitational waves to propagate at the speed of light further restricts the theory to a one-function family. These results provide a detailed and self-contained characterization of the quadratic metric-affine Class Ia sector within this operator basis and identify the theoretical conditions implied by gravitational wave observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5ea6\u91cf affine \u7c7b\u6bd4\u4e8e\u4e8c\u6b21\u9000\u5316\u9ad8\u9636\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\uff08DHOST\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8e\u66f2\u7387\u4e14\u5305\u542b\u6240\u6709\u6700\u591a\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e8e\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u534f\u53d8\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u4f5c\u7528\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u8fde\u63a5\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e8c\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u8fde\u63a5\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ed\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5ea6\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u65bd\u52a0\u6807\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf DHOST\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a Palatini \u7c7b Ia \u5206\u652f\uff0c\u8be5\u5206\u652f\u7531\u539f\u4f5c\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u81ea\u7531\u51fd\u6570\u5b8c\u5168\u786e\u5b9a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684tensor\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8981\u6c42\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u901f\u5ea6\u7b49\u4e8e\u5149\u901f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u7531\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u679c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5ea6\u91cf affine \u7c7b Ia \u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u81ea\u6d3d\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u7531\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u6697\u793a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8bd5\u56fe\u6269\u5c55 DHOST \u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u5ea6\u91cf affine \u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u9ad8\u9636\u7279\u6027\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u9650\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4ece\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf affine \u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u4f5c\u7528\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6700\u591a\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e8e\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u4e14\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8e\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u8fde\u63a5\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u4e86\u5931\u8861\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u95ed\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5ea6\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u65bd\u52a0\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a Palatini \u7c7b Ia \u5206\u652f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5ea6\u91cf affine \u7c7b\u6bd4\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u9000\u5316\u9ad8\u9636\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u81ea\u7531\u51fd\u6570\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d7\u5230\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5ea6\u91cf affine \u7c7b Ia \u533a\u57df\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u6765\u9650\u5236\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c observational \u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Second, we discover that increasing dissociation rates accelerate decatenation while slowing down relaxation catalytic activities. Finally, by using molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover that this opposite behaviour is due to a trade-off between search of target through facilitated diffusion and processivity of the enzyme in catenated versus supercoiled DNA. Thus, our findings reveal that a modulation of topo II binding kinetics can oppositely regulate its topological simplification activity, and in turn can have a significant impact in vivo.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e8c\u4ef7\u79bb\u5b50\u6d53\u5ea6\u5bf9\u2161\u578bDNA\u5207\u9664\u9176\u7684\u89e3\u626d\u6d3b\u6027\u6709\u76f8\u53cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9ad8\u6d53\u5ea6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u89e3\u626d\uff0c\u4f4e\u6d53\u5ea6\u6291\u5236\u89e3\u626d\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u5185\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u7ec6\u80de\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u2161\u578bDNA\u5207\u9664\u9176\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7ec6\u80deDNA\u62d3\u6251\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u5185\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u5206\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u4ef7\u79bb\u5b50\u6d53\u5ea6\u5bf9\u2161\u578bDNA\u5207\u9664\u9176\u89e3\u626d\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4e8c\u4ef7\u79bb\u5b50\u6d53\u5ea6\u5347\u9ad8\u52a0\u901f\u89e3\u626d\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6291\u5236\u89e3\u626d\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u626d\u4e0e\u8d85\u7ea7\u87ba\u65cbDNA\u5f62\u6001\u6709\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u2161\u578bDNA\u5207\u9664\u9176\u7684\u89e3\u626d\u6d3b\u6027\u53d7\u4e8c\u4ef7\u79bb\u5b50\u6d53\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u5185\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u63a7\u5176\u6d53\u5ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u7ec6\u80de\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Above this threshold, superfluidity breaks down, and the internal energy is redistributed into incoherent excitations such as vortices. We demonstrate that a finite-mass, mobile impurity immersed in a flowing two-dimensional paraxial superfluid of light can \\textit{swim} against the superfluid current when this critical velocity is exceeded. This self-propulsion is achieved by the periodic emission of quantized vortex-antivortex pairs downstream, which impart an upstream recoil momentum that results in a net propulsive force. Analogous to biological systems that minimize effort by exploiting wake turbulence, the impurity harnesses this vortex backreaction as a passive mechanism of locomotion. Reducing the impurity dynamics to the motion of its center of mass and using a point-vortex model, we quantitatively describe how this mechanism depends on the impurity geometry and the surrounding flow velocity.

Here we present a machine learning based upgrade for the BEGe detector using an event selection strategy aimed at improving the efficiency in detecting low energy events down to 10 keV. The method employs a denoising autoencoder to suppress electronic and microphonic noises and to reconstruct pulse shapes, followed by a convolutional neural network that classifies waveforms as normal single site or events with anomalies. The workflow was validated on a dataset comprising more than 20000 waveforms recorded in 2021. The classifier achieves a receiver operating characteristic curve with an area under the curve of 0.99 and an accuracy of 95 percent. Applying this procedure lowers the minimum detectable energy of the final spectrum to approximately 10 keV. It also yields a measurable enhancement in spectral quality, including an improvement of about 14 percent in the signal to background ratio and a reduction of the energy resolution for the characteristic Pb and Bi gamma lines. These developments enhance the sensitivity of the BEGe detector to rare low energy signals and provide a scalable framework for future precision tests of quantum foundations in low background environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86Broad Energy Germanium\uff08BEGe\uff09\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5347\u7ea7\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u57fa\u7840\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684Pauli Pauli\u539f\u7406\u7684\u8fdd\u53cd\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f18\u5316BEGe\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6b64\u7c7b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u53bb\u9664\u81ea\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8e10 keV\u4ee5\u4e0b\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d85\u8fc720000\u4e2a\u6ce2\u5f62\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5176\u63a5\u6536\u64cd\u4f5c\u7279\u5f81\u66f2\u7ebf\uff08ROC\uff09\u9762\u79ef\u4e3a0.99\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523095%\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u91cf\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u7ea610 keV\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e backgrounds\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u80fd resolution\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u57fa\u7840\u7269\u7406\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Among them, Bell nonlocality is a central example. For bipartite Bell inequalities, nonlocal correlations obey strict monogamy: a violation of one inequality precludes violations of other inequalities on the overlapping subsystems. In the multipartite setting, however, Bell nonlocality becomes inherently polygamous. This was previously shown for subsystems obtained by removing a single particle from an $N$-partite system. Here, we generalize this result to arbitrary $(N-k)$-partite subsystems with $k>0$. We demonstrate that a single $N$-qubit state can violate all $\\binom{N}{k}$ relevant Bell inequalities simultaneously. We further construct an $N$-qubit Bell inequality, obtained by symmetrizing the $(N-k)$-qubit ones, that is maximally violated by states exhibiting this generalized polygamy. We compare these violations with those achievable by GHZ states and show that polygamy offers an advantage in multipartite scenarios, providing new insights into scalable certification of non-classicality in quantum devices. Our analysis relies on symmetry properties of the MABK inequalities. Finally, we show that this behavior can occur across multiple subsystem sizes, a phenomenon we call hyper-polygamy.

The FinFET architecture enables strong gate modulation, achieving a high Ion/Ioff ratio between 10^8 and 10^9. A low contact resistance of 0.42 ohm.mm was achieved to the Si delta-doped channel using MOCVD contact regrowth. Small-signal RF characterization revealed a current-gain cutoff frequency (fT) of 3.8 GHz and a maximum oscillation frequency (fMAX) of 2.1 GHz for a 0.8-micrometer gate length.

Here, we identify a second building block for quantum geometry: a band-resolved adiabatic connection operator that captures the noncommutativity between band projectors and their momentum derivatives. The band-resolved adiabatic connection operator, first introduced in the theory of adiabatic driving, serves as a generalized angular momentum within the state manifold of single bands, and we employ it to reformulate expressions for the band-resolved orbital magnetic moment. This form provides a complementary geometric interpretation alongside the multiband separation between energetic- and quantum-state properties by the two-state Berry curvature. Our formalism allows us to present formulas valid for both nondegenerate and degenerate bands, thereby removing the limitations of the common Bloch-state formula.

While previous studies explored FHN networks subjected to homogeneous noise, revealing behaviors such as noise-induced synchronization, stochastic resonance, and coherence resonance, the impact of noise heterogeneity remains poorly understood. Moreover, the emergence of EE under heterogeneous stochastic excitation has largely been overlooked. To address these gaps, we capture the natural variability in neuronal responses to external stimuli by introducing nonidentical noise sources, thereby reflecting diversity across the network. Our results reveal that EE can arise both globally, where large excursions occur collectively across the entire network, and partially, where only a subset of oscillators exhibits extreme activity depending on the interplay between noise intensity and coupling strength. We further identify three distinct classes of EE that enrich the system's dynamical repertoire and propose a quantitative metric capable of distinguishing between global and local occurrences. Remarkably, we demonstrate that even under heterogeneous noise inputs, noise can synchronize EE across the network, underscoring the robustness of collective dynamics in stochastic regimes.

However, a theoretical description of these dynamics beyond 1D remains a significant challenge for conventional methods. Here, we address this challenge by means of neural quantum states to simulate global quenches from the fully polarized ferromagnetic state in the 2D quantum Ising model with power-law decaying interactions. From these numerically exact simulations, we find that the dynamics exhibit slow relaxation with long-lived oscillations. We explain this behavior through a theory for the formation of magnon bound states, which are generated, as we show, through effective attractive interactions between magnons that persist over several lattice sites due to the power-law nature of the interactions.

SSPP waveguides provide strong slow-wave enhancement, enabling efficient magnon readout in this challenging regime. Systematic measurements reveal the dependence of coupling strength on YIG thickness and phonon wavelength matching, achieving cooperativity C = 1 for a 3 $\u03bc$m film at 2 GHz. Angle-dependent studies uncover coupling to both transverse and longitudinal phonon modes. Further investigation shows that thicker films exhibit rich multimode dynamics between high-order magnons and HBAR phonons.

Despite the $\\overline{T}_d$ symmetry relaxing spherical selection rules, the near-band-edge excitonic spectrum is reminiscent of that obtained for spherical nanocrystals. Exceptions appear in large (red-emitting) QDs, where transitions violating the (quasi-)angular momentum selection rule ($\u0394L=0,\\pm 2$) are observed, and the ground state does not become dark ($P_{3/2}$-like). Valence band coupling is important in determining the symmetry, degeneracy and energy of hole states, with split-off holes playing a greater role than in CdSe QDs. The ($1S_e$-like) electron ground state exhibits moderate delocalization into the ZnSe shell. The confinement regime is then strong even for thick shells, which results in Coulomb interactions being mostly perturbative. Electrons remain largely localized in the InP core even in negative trions, despite electron-electron repulsions. At the same time, the asymmetry between Coulomb attractions and repulsions leads to negative (positive) trions being bound (antibound) by tens of meV.

Plus 140, 1133 (2025)", "summary": "Many natural and physical processes can be understood by analyzing multiple system variables evolving, forming a multivariate time series. Predicting such time series is challenging due to the inherent noise and interdependencies among variables. Echo state networks (ESNs), a class of Reservoir Computing (RC) models, offer an efficient alternative to conventional recurrent neural networks by training only the output weights while keeping the reservoir dynamics fixed, reducing computational complexity. We propose a clustered ESNs (CESNs) that enhances the ability to model and predict multivariate time series by organizing the reservoir nodes into clusters, each corresponding to a distinct input variable. Input signals are directly mapped to their associated clusters, and intra-cluster connections remain dense while inter-cluster connections are sparse, mimicking the modular architecture of biological neural networks. This architecture improves information processing by limiting cross-variable interference and enhances computational efficiency through independent cluster-wise training via ridge regression. We further explore different reservoir topologies, including ring, Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi (ER), and scale-free (SF) networks, to evaluate their impact predictive performance. Our algorithm works well across diverse real-world datasets such as the stock market, solar wind, and chaotic R\u00f6ssler system, demonstrating that CESNs consistently outperform conventional ESNs in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness to noise, particularly when using ER and SF topologies. These findings highlight the adaptability of CESNs for complex, multivariate time series forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u57c3\u01a1\u56de repo \u7f51\u7edc (CESNs) \u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u566a\u58f0\u9ad8\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 clustered echo state networks (CESNs)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06 reservoir \u8282\u70b9\u5206\u4e3a\u82e5\u5e72\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u96c6\u7fa4\u8d1f\u8d23\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u8f93\u5165\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u96c6\u7fa4\u5185\u90e8\u8fde\u63a5\u7a20\u5bc6\uff0c\u96c6\u7fa4\u95f4\u8fde\u63a5\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u6a21\u4eff\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u3001\u592a\u9633\u98ce\u548c\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u591a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf ESN \u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 CESNs \u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u57c3\u01a1\u56de repo \u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that their collective optical response yields sharp, narrow features in the transmittance spectrum, which can be used to enhance sensitivity to external perturbations.

This naturally leads to the existence of 3 right-handed neutrinos propagating in the dark dimension.

Pressure control is typically managed through pressure reducing valves with electrically controlled actuators based on predefined tables according to the pressure at the critical point control. This openloop control method lacks direct feedback between the PRV and CPC, making it challenging to distinguish whether pressure variations originate from normal head losses or abnormal network conditions. Unlike traditional applications of ARIMA focused on water demand forecasting, this study explores its novel use in pressure management within distribution networks, aiming to predict P3 pressure based on head losses across a defined hydraulic sector. To achieve this objective, a predictive model based on the Box-Jenkins methodology and its variations is implemented to analyse time series data. An action path is established to determine the optimal model ARIMA, ARMA, ARMAX, etc. which is subsequently validated using real operational data from Noja, a coastal town in northern Spain characterized by significant seasonal population fluctuations.

The magnitude of MER exhibits a steep increase at low magnetic fields, reaches a peak, and then gradually decreases at higher fields. By decomposing the strain response into symmetric and antisymmetric symmetry channels, we reveal contrasting magnetic field dependencies. Despite the overall non-monotonic field dependence of the MER, the symmetric component remains nearly constant under magnetic fields, suggesting that the valleys in bismuth preserve a rigid-band nature against strain even in the presence of a magnetic field. In contrast, the antisymmetric component, associated with mobility anisotropy, dominates the MER response in a magnetic field. At low magnetic fields, the applied field effectively modifies the apparent mobility of each valley, leading to an enhancement in the magnitude of the antisymmetric MER. At higher fields, field-induced valley polarization further modifies this mobility anisotropy by altering the contributions from each valley's mobility, accounting for the moderate suppression of the MER. These findings demonstrate that symmetry-resolved MER serves as a powerful probe of valley-dependent electronic states and provides a fundamental platform for understanding the interplay between magnetic field, strain, and charge transport.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We unambiguously assign its charge-transfer character and reveal the precise trapping mechanism through high-level ab initio calculations.

Hole-doped kagome compounds exhibit puzzling double-dome superconductivity and, as chemical substitution inevitably introduces quenched disorder, their properties remain poorly understood. Here, by leveraging the sensitivity of nuclear quadrupole resonance to local and static orderings, we uncover new features, primarily the incipient and fragmented CDW phases, in the charge landscape of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. Static CDW puddles are observed well above the transition temperature, a hallmark of pinning by defects. Their doping and temperature evolution indicate that, in the absence of disorder, the inverse Star-of-David $\u03c0$-shifted (ISD-$\u03c0$) CDW order would vanish near $x=0.12$, between the two superconducting domes. This critical doping represents a hidden quantum critical point. Nevertheless, the ISD-$\u03c0$ pattern persists well beyond previous reports, although its volume fraction is progressively reduced up to the critical doping at which it saturates. We establish that carrier doping promotes fragmentation of the ISD-$\u03c0$ order, whereas randomness preserves the ISD-$\u03c0$ patches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cKagome\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u4ea7\u7269\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8c03\u63a7\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u548c\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u548c\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u63ba\u6742\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u56db\u9762\u4f53\u5171\u632f spectroscopy\u6765\u89c2\u5bdf\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u63ba\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6750\u6599\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u63ba\u6742\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6750\u6599\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53cc\u5cf0\u578b\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u63ba\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6750\u6599\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u78c1\u5b66\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u56db\u9762\u4f53\u5171\u632f\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u63ba\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u5b66\u548c\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

In this construction, the $d$-stack of D6-branes is introduced besides the standard $a,~b,~c$-stacks. More intersections from the extra stacks of D6-branes appear, and thus Higgs/Higgs-like particles arise from more origins. Among these models, we find eight new classes of ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\\times SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_{R_1}\\times SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(4)_C\\times SU(2)_{L_1}\\times SU(2)_{R}\\times SU(2)_{L_2}$, where $d$-stack of D6-branes carries the gauge symmetries $SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(2)_{L_2}$, respectively. The $SU(2)_{L_1/R_1} \\times SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ can be broken down to the diagonal $SU(2)_{L/R}$ gauge symmetry via bifundamental Higgs fields. In such a way, we for the first time successfully constructed three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from non-rigid D6-branes with extra $d$-stacks of D6-branes as visible sectors. Interestingly, by introducing extra stack of D6-branes to the standard supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, the number of filler brane reduces in general, and eventually the models without any $USp(N)$ gauge symmetry present. This reduces the exotic particles from filler brane intersection yet provides more vector-like particles from ${\\cal N}=2$ subsector that are useful in renormalization group equation evolution as an advantage.

Pre-irradiation, the n-type InAs absorbing region exhibits a steadily increasing minority carrier lifetime with increasing temperature, providing evidence that excited minority carriers may be recombining via shallow defect levels. From deep-level transient spectroscopy, two features are found between 10 K and 275 K: a low temperature broad shoulder, which suggests emission from multiple shallow electron defect levels with energies < 29 meV, and a high temperature minimum occurring at approximately 230 K with an activation energy of 539 meV, which suggests a defect in the barrier layer in the device. Two similar nBn detectors are then subjected to 63 MeV proton irradiation in step doses and measured between steps. One experiment is performed in-situ with an nBn held at approximately 10 K during dosing, and the other experiment is performed ex-situ with a similar nBn held at room temperature for dosing. The ex-situ dosing results in an evaluation of the defect introduction rate that is 3-4x lower than in-situ due to partial annealing of the proton-induced displacement damage at room temperature. The results for these two experiments are then compared with the dose-dependent recombination rate analysis, resulting in an estimated recombination defect cross-section of 1.6x10^(-14) cm^2 for the shallow shoulder defect.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates the generation and recombination dynamics of an InAs nBn photodetector under proton irradiation using DTS and PTL measurements.

The in-situ irradiation showed a faster recombination due to faster annealing, while the ex-situ irradiation revealed slightly slower recombination with both generation and recombination occurring near 275 meV. The analysis suggests additional recombination occurs via a defect below 100 meV, which likely contributes to the overall recombination process.", "motivation": "Photodetectors are vital in various fields such as quantum computing, optical sensing, and photovoltaics.

The analysis further provides an estimate of the recombination cross-section for these defects, which is critical for modeling and optimizing the photodetector's performance under irradiation.", "conclusion": "This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the generation and recombination mechanisms in InAs nBn photodetectors under proton irradiation.

The most realistic model would be a hot magnetized plasma. In such a medium, however, an analytical description of light rays is very difficult. Therefore, usually an isotropic dispersive medium is assumed in analytical calculations. While it is possible to formulate equations for a general refractive index, which some studies do, most attention in the literature is given to the particular case of a cold, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma. Whereas this model covers many astrophysically relevant situations, there are indications that in some cases the plasma temperature is so high that the approximation of a cold plasma is no longer valid. For this reason, we consider in this paper a warm, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma, where the temperature is not set equal to zero but assumed to be small enough, such that relevant equations can be linearized with respect to it. After discussing the general equations for light rays in such a medium on a general-relativistic spacetime, we specify to the axially symmetric and stationary case which includes the spherically symmetric and static case. In particular, we calculate the influence of a warm plasma on the bending angle. In the spherically symmetric and static case, we also calculate the shadow in a warm plasma.

Such contributions characterize different portions of the HHG spectrum, indicating that the orbital decomposition encodes nontrivial information on the modulation of the strong-field dynamics.

For fundamental device applications, the ability to electrically manipulate individual solitons is crucial. However, electrical manipulation of single antiskyrmions has been rarely demonstrated. In this work, we present current-controlled manipulations, encompassing the creation, deletion, and topological transformation of a single antiskyrmion within FeNiPdP nanostructured cells at room temperature. This nanostructure is uniquely designed with dimensions of about 400 nm in width and length, enabling the stabilization of a single antiskyrmion. By simply adjusting the density of nanosecond single-pulsed currents, we achieve the reversible creation and deletion of single antiskyrmions.

The device realizes a non-Hermitian extension of the Rice-Mele model, featuring alternating coupling strengths and imaginary on-site detunings. This configuration supports a symmetry-protected zero mode stabilized by non-Hermitian particle-hole symmetry, which enforces a uniform $\u03c0/2$ phase shift between adjacent nanolasers, establishing a coherent phase winding around the array. By adjusting the gain/loss contrast in a parity-time (PT)-like pumping scheme, the system can be tuned to a chiral exceptional point, where energy flows unidirectionally between nanocavities despite their reciprocal coupling. This symmetry-enforced, directional tunneling leads to far-field emission carrying non-zero OAM, providing a direct signature of the phase-structured lasing mode.

The polarization propagator provides a rigorous framework for evaluating these properties, but its construction is computationally demanding. Challenges arise from the level of electron correlation, the size of the excitonic basis, and the cost of evaluating two-electron integrals. This work addresses these difficulties by developing first- and second-order frequency-dependent polarization propagator calculations for PbS and CdS quantum dots. The propagator is formulated using the electron propagator approach and expressed as the resolvent of the Hamiltonian superoperator. Light-matter interaction is treated using the dipole approximation and represented in a particle-hole excitation operator basis. The correlated ground state is treated at the MP2 level, and all response-matrix terms up to second order in the fluctuating potential are included. A frequency-dependent inverse Krylov subspace method is derived and combined with the folded-spectrum technique to isolate excitation energies within a chosen frequency window. This strategy avoids full diagonalization of the response matrix and significantly reduces computational cost for large systems. The method is implemented in a matrix-free manner in which no explicit response matrix is assembled, and all operations rely on matrix-vector products. UV-VIS excitation spectra of PbS and CdS quantum dots were computed, demonstrating that the inverse Krylov subspace projection approach provides an efficient and accurate approximation for excitation spectra when full diagonalization is computationally prohibitive.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006Krylov\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6298\u53e0\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56e0\u5927\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5168\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u5b66\u548c nonlinear \u5149\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u5176\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6781\u5316\u4f20\u64ad\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u4f20\u64ad\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c Hilbert \u8d85\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u9006\u89e3\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 MP2 \u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6298\u7ebf\u8c31\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u77e9\u9635\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86 PbS \u548c CdS \u7684 UV-VIS \u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5168\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6781\u5316\u4f20\u64ad\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The spin of a black hole can be measured using various methods for an accreting black hole in an X-ray binary system. Accretion disks around black holes have an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) whose location is directly dependent on spin and mass of the black hole. The orbit's location changes as the black hole's spin changes and hence can be a method to detect the presence of cosmic strings. This study investigates this change and suggests the ejection of accretion material as black hole spin approaches maximum for prograde motion and material falling into the black hole for retrograde motion, regardless of the presence of cosmic string. However, in the presence of cosmic string, the spin-up process due to accretion is found out to be slower, even with high accretion rates and is detectable. There is a transition phase that occurs as the black hole approaches maximum spin, where even small changes in spin result in significant changes in the ISCO's position. Accreting black holes attached to a large string never reach this transition phase and this absence serves as potential evidence for the existence of a cosmic string.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e26\u6709\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5438\u79ef\u7269\u8d28\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u4e8c\u5143\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7684\u5185\u4fa7\u7a33\u5b9a\u5706\u5f62\u8f68\u9053\uff08ISCO\uff09\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5f53\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\u81ea\u65cb\u5bfc\u81f4ISCO\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53d8\u5316\u5f02\u5e38\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4e0b\uff0c\u5438\u79ef\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u589e\u52a0\u901f\u7387\u51cf\u6162\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc1\u636e\u6765\u5224\u65ad\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5438\u79ef\u7269\u8d28\u65f6\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u6362\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5438\u79ef\u7269\u8d28\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u53d8\u5316\u7387\uff0c\u5f97\u51faISCO\u4f4d\u7f6e\u968f\u81ea\u65cb\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e26\u6709\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5438\u79ef\u7269\u8d28\u65f6\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u589e\u52a0\u901f\u7387\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u6162\u3002\u5f53\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\u81ea\u65cb\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4ISCO\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53d1\u751f\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5224\u5b9a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5224\u65ad\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u4eca\u540e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u5438\u79ef\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u53d8\u5316\u901f\u7387\u548cISCO\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

Invoking Zeilinger's Foundational Principle, we argue that while the local flow of time, operationally defined as a sequence of detector ``ticks,'' is irreducibly random (one bit per elementary system), the synchronized flow between spatially separated observers depends on their measurement geometry. Comparing the quantum prediction for the coincidence rate with Peres' classical ``bomb fragment'' model, we find that at obtuse relative angles the entangled clock exhibits a 13 percent higher synchronized tick rate than this linear classical benchmark. This ``temporal acceleration'' is linked to contextuality: following Peres, ``unperformed experiments have no results,'' and quantum systems are not constrained to maintain consistency with all counterfactual measurement settings. We stress, however, that for any single measurement angle a suitably tailored classical model can reproduce the quantum rate. The genuinely nonclassical character of the entangled clock emerges only when correlations at several angles are considered simultaneously and are shown to violate Bell-type inequalities. In this sense, the violation of Bell-type bounds serves as a certification that the shared time standard is genuinely quantum.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Shepherd", "Daniel J. Blumenthal", "Ryan O.

While Brillouin lasers routinely achieve sub-Hz instantaneous linewidths, many of these applications also require exceptional frequency stability and high-power single-mode emission. A recent demonstration showed that extending the resonator length increases the laser power while also improving the frequency stability through suppression of thermorefractive noise. However, as the resonator scales to larger lengths, multiple optical resonances can be found within the Brillouin gain bandwidth, greatly complicating the laser dynamics compared to existing coupled-mode Brillouin laser models. Given the potential to scale lasers of this type to watt-level output powers at sub-mHz linewidths, a theoretical model describing this physics is needed to provide key insights into their performance. Here, we develop a coupled-mode theory of integrated large mode volume Brillouin lasers, accounting for multiple cavity modes with potential to lase within the gain bandwidth. We obtain expressions for the steady-state dynamics, spontaneous spectrum, relative intensity noise, and frequency noise. Our analysis reveals that the broad gain bandwidth results in atypical Brillouin dynamics, giving rise to distinct features in the noise spectra, and consequently modifications of the standard, single-mode fundamental linewidth of Brillouin lasers. Additionally, these features may be used for a variety of tangential applications, such as phonon spectroscopy or quality factor enhancement. Furthermore, we find that the linewidth can be significantly impacted by transferred RIN from the external pump in Brillouin lasers that lack ideal phase matching.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5149\u96c6\u6210\u5e03\u91ccouain\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u5c55\u8c10\u632f\u5668\u957f\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6fc0\u5149\u529f\u7387\u548c\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5728\u5e03\u91cc\u5965\u56e0 Gain\u5e26\u5bbd\u5185\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4e2a\u5149\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u8fd9\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u632f\u8361\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u7a33\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u76f8\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u9891\u7387\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bbd Gain\u5e26\u5bbd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5e03\u91cc\u5965\u56e0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u566a\u58f0\u8c31\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5355\u6a21\u5e03\u91cc\u5965\u56e0\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u7684\u56fa\u6709 linewidth\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u8f85\u52a9\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u58f0\u5b50\u5149\u8c31\u5b66\u6216\u8c10\u632f\u5b50\u8d28\u91cf\u56e0\u6570\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5916\u6765\u6cf5\u6d66\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u7684 linewidth\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5149\u96c6\u6210\u5e03\u91cc\u5965\u56e0\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u5728\u539f\u5b50\u65f6\u949f\u3001\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u5fae\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5149\u7ea4\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u611f\u77e5\u4ee5\u53ca ultra-high capacity coherent communications \u7b49\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u5355\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d1\u5c04\u548c\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8ffd\u6c42\u4e5f\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u7d27\u8feb\u3002", "method": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8c10\u632f\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u7a33\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u76f8\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u9891\u7387\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5e03\u91cc\u5965\u56e0\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5149\u96c6\u6210\u5e03\u91cc\u5965\u56e0\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Carmina Monreal"], "title": "Modeling the dynamics of trapped electrons in quantum dots", "comment": "38 pages, 15 figures", "summary": "We analyze the effects of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the dynamics of a system of two or three electrons that can be trapped to a localized state and detrapped to ab extended band states of a quantum dot using a simple model. In spite of its simplicity the time dependent problem has no analytical solution but a numerically exact one can be found at a relatively low computational cost. Within this model, we study the time evolution of the electron occupancies of conduction and valence bands and the trap state, as well as the statistical factors influencing light emission of different energies. In most of the analyzed cases, the system dynamics has a very short transient determined by the hopping parameters, that can be of tens of femptoseconds,followed by a quasi-stationary regime in which the electron occupancies either oscillate periodically around their time-averaged values or remain nearly constant. We find signatures of strong electronic correlations in the electronic motion for negative values of the effective electron-electron Coulomb interaction that are not translated to the statistical factors for light emission. Our calculations show that light emission of different energies is always possible except in the especial cases in which the valence band is initially filled with two electrons. In these cases the valence band can lose and recover electrons periodically but exciton emission is negligible at any time. We use this fact to attempt to give a possible explanation for the increase in the intensity of exciton emission with the concomitant decrease in the intensity of the green emission lines upon continuous illumination with ultraviolet radiation, experimentally observed for ZnO nanoparticles suspended in an alcohol.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7b80\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u4e2d\u7535\u5b50\u95f4\u548c\u7535\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u627e\u5230\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u77ac\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u8fdb\u5165\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u7535\u5b50\u5360\u636e\u548c\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u7535\u5b50\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u6027\u4ec5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u91caZnO\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\u5728\u7d2b\u5916\u6301\u7eed\u5149\u7167\u4e0b\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u5f3a\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u4e2d\u7535\u5b50\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u58f0\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5173\u6ce8\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5149\u5f3a\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u79cd\u6240\u8ff0\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u5360\u636e\u548c\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u6982\u7387\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5230\u590d\u6742\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u77ac\u6001\u548c\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\u5305\u62ec\uff1aWhile\u7535\u5b50\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u77ac\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5f3a\u5f31\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728valence\u5e26\u6700\u521d\u88ab\u4e24\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u5360\u636e\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u4e2d\u7684\u65a5\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5149\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u63a7\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u7684\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, previous theories commonly concentrate on the configurations of the bare waveguide, lacking full consideration of structure-assisted couplings. Here, a power-in-bucket (PIB) model is introduced to explore the coupling behavior of structure-modified waveguides. The analytical model investigates two representative coupling scenarios,including Gaussian beam and plane wave excitation. The PIB-computed coefficient \u03b7 enhancements agree well with the experimental values, especially for the multiple-mode fibers under large-angle illuminations. Using PIB to optimize the beam-fiber parameters, we show that at the incidence angle of 37 degree, \u03b7 could increase from 0.3320 to 0.5102 by the identical ring gratings. Overall, the proposed model provides a useful account of the mechanism of grating-aided light couplings.

A common remedy assumes that $M_0$ coincides with the actual mass of the star $M_S$; however, this approximation is only adequate for very slow rotation (when the dimensionless spin parameter is $\u03c7_S<0.1$).

In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These non-Hermitian descriptions are, however, not capable of describing empirical processes of more general nature, including but not limited to a variety of pumping processes. We extend the state-to-state analysis to account for Lindbladian descriptions of generic dissipative, pumping and decohering processes acting on a system which is exchanging energy with a thermal bath. This Lindblad state-to-state method can elucidate routes of transport in systems coupled to a bath and additionally acted upon by Lindblad jump operators. The method is demonstrated using examples of excitonic aggregates subject to incoherent pumping and draining processes. Using this new state-to-state formalism, we demonstrate the establishment of steady-state excitonic currents across molecular aggregates, yielding a different first-principles approach to quantifying the same.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Weak anomalies near 4 K are observed in both magnetization and specific heat, indicating the onset of a magnetic transition.The formation of a long-range antiferromagnetic state below 4.5 K is further confirmed by $^{35}$Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. Magnetic susceptibility data reveal nearly isotropic Curie-Weiss temperatures ($\\sim-145$ K) and $g$-factors ($\\sim2.4$) for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. Moreover, we observe two successive ferroelectric transitions at $T_\\mathrm{FE1}\\sim30$ K and $T_\\mathrm{FE2}\\sim27$ K, driven by inversion-symmetry breaking, most likely associated with distortions in the Cu2O$_4$Cl$_1$ pyramids and the adjacent SO$_4$ tetrahedra. These results suggest that a three-dimensional model incorporating interlayer couplings via decorating sites is essential for capturing the magnetic and electric behaviors in KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5e73\u65b9\u51ef\u5e93\u6469\u5c14\u6676\u683c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u53d7 frustrating\u78c1\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ecd\u7f55\u89c1\u3002\u62a5\u9053\u4e86KCu7TeO4(SO4)5Cl\u8fd9\u79cd nabokoite \u578b\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3a\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u3001\u88ab\u88c5\u9970\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u51ef\u5e93\u6469\u5c14\u6676\u683c\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u78c1\u5316\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u70ed\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u78c1\u6001\u5f00\u59cb\u3002\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u957f\u671f\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u72b6\u6001\u88ab\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u3002\u78c1 Susceptibility \u8868\u660e\u8fd1\u4e8e\u65e0\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027 Curie-Weiss\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c g \u56e0\u5b50\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u7535\u8377\u6709\u5e8f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5f62\u6709\u5173\u3002\u4e09 \u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u88c5\u9970\u8fde\u63a5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u6750\u6599\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d7 frustrating\u78c1\u6027\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u5176\u5728nabokoite\u578b\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u662f\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u7269\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6676\u4f53\u751f\u957f\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u78c1\u6027\u548c\u7535\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u78c1 susceptibility\u6d4b\u5b9a\u3001NMR\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5f31\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u78c1\u6001\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u957f\u671f\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u72b6\u6001\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u3002\u78c1\u7279\u6027\u8868\u660e\u8fd1\u65e0\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u78c1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 Insulator \u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u6750\u6599\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7535\u5e8f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5f62\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u4e09 \u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u6750\u6599\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u53d7 frustrating\u78c1\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u548c\u7535\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4e8c\u7ef4\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u6b64\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u578b\u53d7 frustrated\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6750\u6599\u5019\u9009\u3002"}}

We extend prior results to resummation over all partial waves, restoring contributions from transverse separation and correctly taking into account the particle masses in the pole structure. We consider leading order interactions mediated by scalar-scalar-graviton vertices and scalar electrodynamics. We perform our calculations in the black hole eikonal phase. The $2\\to 2$ eikonal amplitude is measured by the transverse Green's function $(-\u0394_\u03a9+a)G(\u03a9,\u03a9')=\u03b4^{(2)}(\u03a9-\u03a9')$. As a consistency check, we use our formalism in flat space to find an exact match with the known flat space eikonal $2\\to 2$ amplitude in literature. We then extend the eikonal amplitude to arbitrarily many particles for the first time in both flat space and on the black hole background. We show that the black hole amplitude matches the black hole S-matrix as derived by 't Hooft. We conclude that this amplitude provides the most general elastic contribution one can achieve in the eikonal phase.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Such ``IsoI\" represent a new scenario for Hamiltonian systems implying so-called ``chaos\". Criteria was derived for, and shown to be fulfilled in, some finite-dimensional (multi-qubit) models, and generalized in the second paper to continuum models. But the only example produced of the latter was a model whose linear Schrodinger equation was exactly-solvable.

We integrate analytical modeling, micromagnetic simulations, and \\textit{in situ} Lorentz transmission electron microscopy experiments to demonstrate that externally applied strain is a powerful stimuli for manipulating three-dimensional magnetic skyrmion strings. Analytical models predict that strain induces both elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings in bulk systems, a finding corroborated by numerical simulations. These simulations further reveal that strain drives the system from fragmented multi-domain states toward unified single-domain configurations and facilitates skyrmion string rupture via bobber formation at critical strain levels. The collapse of the skyrmion lattice exhibits a temperature-dependent character, shifting from first-order to second-order behavior near the critical temperature $T_c$. Reducing sample thickness significantly increases the critical strain required for annihilation due to the suppression of tilting. Experimental validation on a $\\text{Co}_8\\text{Zn}_{8.5}\\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirms strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase via anti-cluster formation, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary mechanism in this system, over magnetocrystalline anisotropy.

Using EEH geometry, we compute the structure of circular motion, the effective potential and force, and we evaluate the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies together with the Lense-Thirring and periastron precession rates. Our calculations show that, compared to the Kerr model, the charge parameter $Q$ and the spin parameter $a$ significantly modify the strong gravitational field and shift the characteristic frequencies. We then model the dynamical structure formed by matter accreting toward the EEH black hole through the BHL mechanism, finding that the parameter $Q$ increases the amount of infalling matter and strengthens shock-cone instabilities near the horizon, while farther from the black hole it suppresses accretion and reduces turbulence. Time-series analysis of the accretion rate reveals robust QPOs, whose low-frequency components arise from the precession of the shock cone, while high-frequency components appear as a consequence of strong-field instabilities modified by $Q$ and $a$. A systematic parameter-space exploration identifies the regions where EEH corrections maximize QPO activity, indicating that nonlinear electrodynamics can leave observable imprints on accretion flows and may be testable with QPO and horizon-scale observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u5176\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0b\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u632f\u8361\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5e93\u5c14\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u7535\u8377\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570Q\u548ca\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u548c\u9891\u7387\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7BHL\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\uff0cQ\u589e\u52a0\u5438\u79ef\u6d41\u91cf\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u63a5\u8fd1\u89c6\u754c\u5c42\u7684\u51b2\u51fb\u6ce2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u8fdc\u5904\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u548c\u6d88\u51cf\u6e4d\u6d41\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5176\u4f4e\u9891\u5206\u91cf\u6765\u81ea\u51b2\u51fb\u6ce2\u7684\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u9ad8\u9891\u5206\u91cf\u6e90\u81ea\u5f3a\u573a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cEEH\u4fee\u6b63\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aQPO\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f71\u54cd\u5438\u79ef\u6d41\u5e76\u88ab\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5438\u79ef\u6d41\u548c\u632f\u8361\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u548c\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6d4b\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e76\u6c42\u89e3\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728EEH\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5468\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u548c\u529b\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f68\u9053\u3001\u5f84\u5411\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u7684epicyclic\u9891\u7387\uff0cLense-Thirring\u8fdb\u52a8\u7387\u548cperiastron\u8fdb\u52a8\u7387\u3002", "result": "Q\u548ca\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u548c\u9891\u7387\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5728\u89c6\u754c\u5c42\u9644\u8fd1\uff0cQ\u589e\u52a0\u5438\u79ef\u6d41\u91cf\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u51b2\u51fb\u6ce2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u8fdc\u5904\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u548c\u6d88\u51cf\u6e4d\u6d41\uff1b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\uff1b\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u63ed\u793aEEH\u4fee\u6b63\u589e\u5f3aQPO\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0b\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5e93\u5c14\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Because of the strong magnetoelastic coupling, we could extract a refined magnetic (H, T) phase diagram for MnSc_2S_4 from ultrasound and dilatometry measurements. We found a variety of magnetic phases, including the skyrmion phase, which is stable down to lowest temperatures. In comparison, we investigated MnSc_2Se_4 , having a larger distance between the magnetic Mn^3+ ions using the same methods. Unlike in MnSc_2S_4 , we found no skyrmion phase and overall a lack of sharp anomalies indicative of phase transitions, neither in dilatometry nor ultrasound nor in specific heat and ac-susceptibility data. Motivated by our findings, we performed model calculations, which reproduced the experimentally observed magnetostriction and specific-heat results reasonably well.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates the magnetic properties of spinel compounds MnSc\u2082X\u2084 with X=S and Se, and discovers that MnS can exhibit Skyrmion magnetic states, which are absent in MnSe.

The phase diagrams, characterized by thermal and mechanical measurements, reveal distinct magnetic behaviors between MnS and MnSe, suggesting that the ligand's electronic and structural properties significantly influence Skyrmion formation and magnetic ordering.", "motivation": "The investigation into Skyrmion magnetic states in ion-rich spinel compounds, such as MnSc\u2082S\u2084 and MnSc\u2082Se\u2084, is driven by the potential for developing novel magnetic materials for spintronics applications. The presence of Skyrmion states in MnS suggests their existence in strongly frustrated magnetic systems, which have garnered considerable interest due to their potential for exotic quantum phenomena and applications in data storage and quantum computation. The uncertainty regarding MnSe's magnetic behavior poses a key focus, and the motivation is to unravel the conditions necessary for Skyrmion formation and stabilize them thermally in these materials", "method": "The study employs synchrotron-based techniques, including synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction, time-resolved X-ray diffraction, and neutron scattering. Ultrasound and dilatometry measurements are used to extract a phase diagram, including magnetic transitions at different temperatures. A model based on spin-wave approximation and Monte Carlo simulations is developed to explain the experimental observations. In-situ measurements of specific heat, ac-susceptibility, and magnetostriction are also performed to characterize the magnetic and thermal properties of the materials.", "result": "The key results include the observation of Skyrmion magnetic states in MnS, which are absent in MnSe. MnS exhibits Skyrmion phases at low temperatures, alongside antiferromagnetic ordering at high temperatures, and shows magnetoelastic coupling. MnSe, on the other hand, lacks the Skyrmion phase and exhibits minimal magnetoelastic coupling, with no clear phase transitions observed in thermal or mechanical measurements. Additionally, the model successfully predicts the experimental magnetostriction and specific-heat behaviors of both materials, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding their distinct magnetic properties", "conclusion": "This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the magnetic properties of MnSc\u2082S\u2084 and MnSc\u2082Se\u2084. The discovery of Skyrmion states in MnS and the lack thereof in MnSe is a significant finding that could guide the development of new Skyrmion-based materials.

In the non-extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons follow the Page curve due to the emergence of islands, and it is approximately proportional to the area of the acoustic horizon at late time. While in the extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons diverges, leading to an ill-defined Page time.

This version summarizes ongoing research; an updated manuscript with extended results will follow. Feedback from colleagues is welcome", "summary": "Spin squeezing is a powerful resource for quantum metrology, and recent hardware platforms based on interacting qubits provide multiple possible architectures to generate and reverse squeezing during a sensing protocol. In this work, we compare the sensing performance of three such architectures: quantum reservoir computers (QRCs), quantum perceptrons, and multi-layer quantum neural networks (QNNs), when used as squeezing-based field sensors. For all models, we consider a standard metrological sequence consisting of coherent-spin preparation, one-axis-twisting dynamics, field encoding via a weak rotation, time-reversal, and collective readout. We show that a single quantum perceptron generates the same optimal sensitivity as a QRC, but in the perturbative regime it benefits from accelerated squeezing due to steering by the output qubit. Stacking perceptrons into a QNN further amplifies this effect: in a 2-layer QNN with N_in input and N_out output qubits, the optimal squeezing time is reduced by a factor of N_out, while the achievable phase sensitivity remains Heisenberg-limited, Delta phi ~ 1/(N_in + N_out). Moreover, if the layers are used sequentially, first using the outputs to squeeze the inputs and then the inputs to squeeze the outputs, the two contributions to the response add constructively. This yields a sqrt(2) enhancement in sensitivity over a QRC when N_in = N_out and requires shorter total squeezing time. Generalizing to L layers, we show that the metrological gain scales as sqrt(L) while the required squeezing time decreases as 1/N_l, where N_l is the number of qubits per layer. Our results demonstrate that the structure of quantum neural networks can be exploited not only for computation, but also to engineer faster and more sensitive squeezing-based quantum sensors.", "AI": {"tldr": "QNNs enhance squeezing-based quantum sensors' speed and sensitivity by engineering multiple layers and utilizing output qubits for feedback, leveraging quantum computing principles for metrology.", "motivation": "Sensors are crucial for varied applications, so enhancing their performance using quantum resources is vital.", "method": "Compared three quantum architectures (QRCs, QPerc, QNNs) under a standard sensing sequence.", "result": "QNNs can boost sensitivity and shorten needed squeezing times, especially with feedback mechanisms.", "conclusion": "Quantum neural networks offer a promising approach for advancing quantum metrology through enhanced squeezing-based sensors."}}

We assume a polytropic equation of state, $p \\propto \u03c1^\u0393$, and a power law charge distribution, $q\\propto r^n$. Using this, we convert the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation into a differential equation for the mass profile. By solving this equation numerically, we analyse both physical and geometric properties of these charged fluid spheres for different values of $n$ and $\u0393$. By imposing subluminal sound speeds and energy conditions, we restrict ourselves to configurations that are physically acceptable. Then, within these physical models, we study internal trapping of circular geodesics and find the trapping regions in the $n$-$\u0393$ parameter space. Going beyond the traditionally studied case of null geodesics, we consider orbits of charged and/or massive particles. We show that for neutral null particles (and only for them), their trapping depends purely on the properties of the space-time. In the other three cases, properties such as the particle's own charge and/or energy also play a role. In general, we find that trapping of all types of particles is allowed for a broad range of $n$ and $\u0393$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u7535\u9759\u6b62\u6d41\u4f53\u7403\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5e38\u6570\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7535\u8377\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u7269\u8d28\u6355\u83b7\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5149\u7c92\u5b50\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u5e26\u7535\u548c/\u6216\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u7eaf\u5149\u7c92\u5b50\u5916\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u6355\u83b7\u4e5f\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u81ea\u8eab\u7535\u8377\u548c/\u6216\u80fd\u91cf\u3002\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5728$n$\u548c$\u0393$\u7684\u8f83\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u5404\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u88ab\u6355\u83b7\u662f\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5982\u6052\u661f\u6216\u9897\u661f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u5e26\u7535\u6d41\u4f53\u7403\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff\u65b9\u7a0b\u5e76\u4ee3\u5165\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u7535\u8377\u5206\u6b65\uff0c\u5c06\u65b9\u7a0b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6e\u5ed3\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u6765\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c$n$\u548c$\u0393$\u503c\u4e0b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7535\u8377\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5b50\u5149\u901f\u58f0\u901f\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u533a\u57df\u3002\u6839\u636e\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u7269\u8d28\u6355\u83b7\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5728$\u0393$\u548c$n$\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u5404\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u88ab\u6355\u83b7\u662f\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u548c/\u6216\u8d28\u91cf\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u8f68\u9053\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53ea\u6709\u7eaf\u5149\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u6355\u83b7\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e5f\u6d89\u53ca\u7c92\u5b50\u81ea\u8eab\u7535\u8377\u548c/\u6216\u80fd\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c$n$\u548c$\u0393$\u4e0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7269\u8d28\u6355\u83b7\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e26\u7535\u6d41\u4f53\u7403\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u4ee4\u4eba\u4fe1\u670d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u5149\u548c\u5e26\u7535\u7c92\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u540e\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5929\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u7c92\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5373\u4f7f\u52a0\u5165\u66f4\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u67d0\u4e9b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u201dHashSet("}}

Here we consider both the massless and the massive fermionic spinor fields. The qubit-field interaction occurs over a finite time and was evolved via perturbation theory. This approach yields the transition probability rates, from which we subsequently evaluate the quantum coherence of an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector initially prepared in a qubit state. Our findings reveal that the UDW detector responds more when coupled with the fermionic field, and consequently, quantum coherence (for the fermionic case) degrades much more rapidly when compared to the case of the qubit linearly coupled with the scalar field. Moreover, the analysis suggests that particle mass plays a protective role against Unruh-induced decoherence as the rest mass energy becomes comparable to the detector's energy-level spacing, the detector's excitation probability and response decreases, which leads to the mitigation of quantum coherence degradation in accelerated quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u4e2a\u5300\u52a0\u901f\u5355\u91cf\u5b50ubit\u4e0e\u8d39\u7c73\u65cb\u91cf\u573a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u96f6\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u65cb\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5728\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\u7387\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86Unruh-DeWitt\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u66f4\u5f3a\u70c8\u5730\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u8d39\u7c73\u5b57\u6bb5\u8026\u5408\u800c\u975e\u4e0e\u6807\u91cf\u5b57\u6bb5\u8026\u5408\u3002\u6b64\u6b21\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u7ea7\u95f4\u8ddd\u4e0e\u7c92\u5b50\u9759\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u80fd\u7ea7\u76f8\u5f53\u65f6\uff0c\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8d77\u5230\u4fdd\u62a4\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u901f\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e4e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6d89\u53caUnruh\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u573a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d89\u53ca\u5355\u91cf\u5b50ubit\u4e0e\u975e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u8d39\u7c73\u65cb\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5728\u6210\u5bf9\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8d39\u66fc\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u6c42\u51fa\u5bf9\u5e94\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u4e0e\u8d39\u7c73\u573a\u8026\u5408\u65f6\u6bd4\u4e0e\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u8026\u5408\u65f6\u66f4\u654f\u9510\u5730\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u7ea7\u95f4\u8ddd\u4e0e\u573a\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u9759\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5f53\u65f6\uff0c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u968f\u52a0\u901f\u7ecf\u5386\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u6548\u5e94\u800c\u8fc5\u901f\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5ef6\u7f13\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u9000\u5316\u3002\u4e0a\u8ff0\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e3a\u52a0\u901f\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4fdd\u62a4\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5300\u52a0\u901f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\uff0c\u82e5\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e\u8d39\u7c73\u573a\u8026\u5408\u800c\u975e\u6807\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9002\u5f53\u8c03\u8282\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u534f\u8bae\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u3002"}}

In view of these observations and the future expectations of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) on which the EHT observations are based, an intensive research work has been carried out in the literature to simulating light trajectories and reconstructing the corresponding optical appearance for a wide array of modified black holes and ultra-compact objects. The corresponding images are directly affected not only by the background space-time geometry but also by the physics of the accretion disk, whose combination yields a characteristic fingerprint. In this paper, we consider such a fingerprint for objects which are not asymptotically flat but instead approach a Anti-de Sitter space-time. This assumption significantly influences light trajectories and, consequently, the corresponding images of the objects as seen by an observer at some distance, which can be used in future VLBI observations for testing alternatives of this kind to the Kerr paradigm.

Physically accurate noise simulation is needed to train decoders and understand the noise suppression capabilities of quantum error correction codes. In this work, we develop an exact and stabilizer-compatible model of qubit thermal relaxation noise and show that the combined amplitude damping and dephasing channel admits a fully positive probability decomposition into Clifford operations and reset whenever $T_2 \\leqslant T_1$. For $T_2 > T_1$, the resulting decomposition is negative, but allows a smaller sampling overhead versus independent channels. We further introduce an approximated error channel with reset that removes the negativity of the decomposition while achieving higher channel fidelity to the true thermal relaxation than PTA, and extend our construction to finite temperature relaxation. We apply the exact combined model to investigate large surface codes and bivariate bicycle codes on superconducting platforms with realistic thermal relaxation error. The differing logical performances across code states further indicate that noise-model-informed decoders will be essential for accurately capturing thermal-noise structure in future fault-tolerant architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53d1\u6740\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u826f\u597d\u7684\u603b\u7ed3", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea0\u6b63\u7801\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0,\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684qubit\u70edRelaxation \u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b,\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Clifford\u8fd0\u7b97\u548c\u91cd\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e$T_2 \boldsymbol{\textless} T_1$\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u901a\u9053", "result": "\u7cbe\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u8868\u9762\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u5bfc\u5e73\u53f0,\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u70edRelaxation\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981"}}

This conclusion stems from the conservative treatment, but so far, it has not been extended to a non-Hermitian framework. Recently, driven-dissipative bosonic condensation of Dirac exciton-polaritons was demonstrated in metasurface waveguides. Here, we report an experimental observation of spatial binding and energy quantization of Dirac exciton-polaritons in a halide perovskite metasurface. A combination of spatially profiled nonresonant optical excitation and exciton-polariton interaction forms an effective non-Hermitian complex potential responsible for the observed effect. In the case of tightly focused pump spots spanning from 9 to 17~$\u03bc$m, several bound states simultaneously achieve macroscopic occupation, constituting a multi-mode bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons.

In our work, we show that introducing a domain wall into a chain with anisotropic superconducting correlations provides a powerful way to control both the number and the nature of these boundary modes. The defect acts as a digital knob: its presence or absence flips the parity of zero modes and thus decides whether an isolated Majorana exists at the chain ends. This on/off mechanism is significantly more robust and simpler than fine-tuning global parameters such as chemical potential or hopping amplitudes. Moreover, anisotropy provides an additional lever to calibrate the effect of the defect, opening a pathway to architectures where topological qubits can be locally addressed by domain walls. This proposal reframes defects not as imperfections, but as useful resources for quantum information and computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The protocol consists of a joint time evolution of the system-auxiliary duo under a specially engineered interaction Hamiltonian, followed by a single measurement of the auxiliary in its energy eigenbasis and a subsequent post-selection of one of the measurement outcomes. We show that the resulting purified state always achieves unit fidelity, while the probability of obtaining any energy of the auxiliary other than its ground state energy yields the success rate of the protocol. We demonstrate the power of this proposed method for several low-distance quantum codes, including the three-, four-, and five-qubit codes, and for the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, subjected to bit-flip, phase-flip, and amplitude-damping noises acting on all qubits. Notably, the protocol expands the class of correctable errors for a given code, particularly in the presence of amplitude-damping noise. We further analyze the impact of replacing the auxiliary qudit with a single auxiliary qubit, and the changes in the performance of the protocol under the realistic scenario where noise remains active during the correction cycle.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{i\u03b2} = e^{i\u03b2\\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates showing that oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $O(1/|\u03b2|)$. The Born rule and the Hilbert-space inner product remain unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical.\n  The physical motivation for the deformation arises from clock imperfections, renormalization-group and effective-action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical quantum-gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{i\u03b2}$. Examples including FRW minisuperspace, quartic potentials, curved-background Hamiltonians, and a Schwarzschild interior-type model illustrate how the mechanism yields explicit decoherence rates. The parameter $\u03b2$ may be experimentally constrained through precision coherence measurements in low-noise quantum platforms. The mechanism contrasts with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Diosi-Penrose gravitational collapse, and real-order fractional dynamics in that it acts purely through deterministic spectral phases of a single Hamiltonian.

Singha Deo"], "title": "Reinterpreting Landauer conductance, solving the quantum measurement problem, grand unification", "comment": null, "summary": "In a series of recent papers we have proved rigorously that time travel is a reality and very much feasible by using quantum mechanical processes. There are plenty of indirect experimental support untill a direct experiment is conducted. The process crucially depend on the reality of a local time as well as a local partial density of states (LPDOS) that can become negative very easily in the quantum regime of mesoscopic systems. Mesoscopic systems are small enough to allow us to experimentally access the intemediate regime between the classical and quantum worlds. This LPDOS is in every sense a hidden variable in quantum mechanics that does not show up in the axiomatic framework of quantum mechanics. It can be infered through physical clocks obeying quantum dynamics and can be rigorously justified from the properties of the Hilbert space that is uniquely isomorphic to the complex plane. Therefore one can naturally guess that LPDOS will have something important to say about quantum measurement as well as the unification of classical and quantum laws. We therefore undertake the exercise to show that LPDOS can very much allow us to re-interpret the enormously successful phenomenological Landauer-Buttiker formalism for mesoscopic systems and put it on firm theoretical ground as a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics, thereby unifying them. Essentialy the local time calculated quantum mechanically can dialate exactly like the proper time of relativity and be consistent with the coordinate time of relativity. Also the measured conductance of mesoscopic samples is a deterministic quantum measurement outcome from a linear superposition of states, essentially because of LPDOS, which solves the quantum measurement problem. For this we analyze the three probe conductance formula in details and give our arguements for the general case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587 bpmian \u660e\u786e\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u6001\u65c5\u884c\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5c40\u57df\u65f6\u95f4\u53ca\u5c40\u57df\u90e8\u5206\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08LPDOS\uff09\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fLPDOS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u63d0 coun\u2122\u51fa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u867d\u4e3a\u95f4\u63a5\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u57df\u65f6\u949f\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548cHilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u6027\u8d28\uff0cLPDOS\u53ef\u88ab\u4e25\u683c\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91caLandauer-Buttiker\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5c40\u57df\u65f6\u949f\uff0c\u5c06\u5c40\u57df\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u65f6\u95f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u5c40\u57df\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u5c40\u57df\u90e8\u5206\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08LPDOS\uff09\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u8ba8\u5c40\u57df\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caLPDOS\u5982\u4f55\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u89e3\u91ca\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5c40\u57df\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Hilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u5c40\u57df\u90e8\u5206\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08LPDOS\uff09\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c40\u57df\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7c7b\u6bd4\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e09\u7aef\u63a2\u9488\u5bfc\u7eb3\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LPDOS\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u6210\u529f\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LPDOS\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u57df\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5bfc\u7eb3\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u65f6\u6001\u65c5\u884c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u7ecf\u5178-\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u65f6\u6001\u65c5\u884c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c40\u57df\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u5c40\u57df\u90e8\u5206\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08LPDOS\uff09\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5bfc\u7eb3\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LPDOS\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Operating at ultra-low temperature, density fluctuations of the dipolar BEC emulate a vacuum field with Lorentz-violating dispersion, while the two impurities function as Unruh-DeWitt detectors for the BEC quasiparticles. We study the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum of this analogue Lorentz-violating quantum field by spatially separated Unruh-DeWitt detectors. Our analysis reveals key parameter dependencies that optimize the harvesting of entanglement. In particular, unlike the Lorentz-invariant case, smoother detector switchings does not enhance the entanglement harvesting efficiency from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum. Moreover, the strength of the Lorentz-invariant violation can shift the optimal energy structure of the detectors for harvesting entanglement from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum-a clear deviation from the Lorentz-invariant scenario. As a fundamental quantum mechanical setup, our quantum fluid platform provides an experimentally realizable testbed for examining the entanglement harvesting protocol from an effective Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum using a pair of impurity probers, which may also has potential implications for exploring the Lorentz-invariant violation in quantum field theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4ece\u4e00\u7c7b\u73bb\u8272\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\uff08BEC\uff09\u7684\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u5173\u8054\u5230\u4e24\u7ec4\u6742\u8d28\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0cBEC\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u632f\u8361\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u96f6\u70b9\u573a\uff08quantum vacuum\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4e24\u7ec4\u6742\u8d28\u5219\u4f5c\u4e3aUnruh-DeWitt\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u63a2\u6d4bBEC\u4e2d\u7684\u5938\u514b\u7c92\u5b50\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u7684Unruh-DeWitt\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u8be5\u96f6\u70b9\u573a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002\u4e0e\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u4e0d\u53d8\u60c5\u51b5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u80cc\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u96f6\u70b9\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5207\u6362\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u4e0d\u8fdd\u53cd\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u53d8\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4ece\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u80cc\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u96f6\u70b9\u573a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u80fd\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u660e\u663e\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u8be5\u91cf\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u53d6\u534f\u8bae\u548cLocale\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u80cc\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u96f6\u70b9\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u4e0d\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u4e0d\u8fdd\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u73bb\u8272\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\uff08BEC\uff09\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u632f\u8361\u6a21\u62df\u65f6\u7a7a\u96f6\u70b9\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Unruh-DeWitt\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u5219\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1) \u5728\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u80cc\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u53d7\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5207\u6362\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff1b2) \u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u80cc\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u53d6\uff1b3) \u8be5\u91cf\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u73bb\u8272\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u7ec4Impurity\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u80cc\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u96f6\u70b9\u573a\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u4e0d\u53d8\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u80cc\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5207\u6362\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f9d\u636e\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e0e\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u80cc\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Trap-assisted two-photon absorption enables sustained strong coupling even under sub-bandgap excitation. The polariton dispersion yields ultrafast group velocities (~65 \u03bcm/ps), extending exciton diffusion lengths from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers.

Various system-specific theories have been proposed to explain this anomalous behavior in driven systems, though the fundamental mechanism of MpE in undriven systems, where MpE was first observed, remains unresolved. This paper provides a generic model of MpE for a quantum system following Markovian relaxation dynamics, regardless of system structure or environment. The key lies in the overlap of initial states with the fast relaxation mode; here, the constituents create a fast decay mode via interaction through the shared environment to show MpE, indicating MpE happens due to the collective behavior of the system.

Here, we propose a hybrid quantum architecture comprising a magnonic mode (in a YIG sphere), an Andreev spin qubit (ASQ), and a superconducting qubit (SCQ), to realize a strong three-body interaction at the single-quantum level. Leveraging the spin-dependent supercurrent and circuit-integration flexibility of the ASQ, it is possible to engineer a strong tripartite coupling that jointly excites both qubits upon magnon annihilation (or excites magnons and SCQs upon ASQ deexcitation). Through analytical and numerical studies, we demonstrate that this interaction induces synchronized collapse and revival in qubit populations when the magnon is initially prepared in a coherent state. Notably, during the collapse region -- where populations remain static -- the entanglement structure undergoes a dramatic and continuous reorganization. We show that the genuine tripartite entanglement is redistributed into bipartite entanglement between the two qubits, and vice versa, with the total entanglement conserved.

However, its broader implementation has been hindered by the instability and ill-posedness of its reconstruction process, known as phase retrieval, which relies heavily on handcrafted, object-specific constraints. To overcome the key limitations, we propose CDIP, a robust phase-retrieval framework that eliminates the need for such constraints by combining untrained coordinate-based neural fields for static and dynamic reconstructions and a physics-consistent forward model. We evaluate CDIP on simulated and experimental datasets that involve both static samples and dynamic processes, demonstrating that it substantially outperforms classical iterative algorithms and deep-learning baselines in terms of fidelity and stability. These results highlight a paradigm shift in both static and time-resolved CDI reconstruction, providing a broadly applicable framework for coherent imaging modalities such as ptychography and holography, across X-ray, electron, and optical probes.", "AI": {"tldr": "CDI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6676\u683c\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u663e\u5fae\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u6b20\u5b9a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51faCDIP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5750\u6807\u57fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u524d\u5411\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "CDI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u663e\u5fae\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCDIP\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "CDIP\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u672a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5750\u6807\u57fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u524d\u5411\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "CDIP\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CDIP\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u548c\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u663e\u5fae\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5149\u6805\u3001\u7535\u955c\u548cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Experiments on quantum classification (MNIST, FashionMNIST), quantum generative modeling (Bars-and-Stripes), and quantum chemistry (LiH VQE) show that LiePrune achieves over $10\\times$ compression with negligible or even improved task performance, while providing provable guarantees on redundancy detection, functional approximation, and computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a LiePrune \u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc (QNNs)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u674e\u7fa4\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd8\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u674e\u7fa4\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u53cc\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u95e8\u4ef6\u540c\u65f6\u8868\u793a\u5728\u674e\u7fa4\u548c\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5197\u4f59\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLiePrune \u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc710\u500d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We prove that these representations are unitarily equivalent to entangled states of two qubits. This provides a geometric origin of quantum entanglement for photons in the framework of quantum field theory: photons appear as superpositions of backward and forward propagating electromagnetic waves depending on a two valued parameter and this dependency gives rise to correlations between the values of local observables identical to those experienced with an entangled state of two qubits.

Conventional quantum linear solvers, such as the quantum matrix inverse algorithm (QMIA), focus on approximating the matrix inverse through quantum signal processing (QSP). However, QMIA suffers from a crucial drawback: its computational efficiency deteriorates as the condition number increases. In contrast, classical SPD linear solvers, such as the steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods, are known for their fast convergence, which stems from the variational optimization principle of SPD systems. Inspired by this, we develop QGFA, which obtains the solution vector through the gradient-flow process of the corresponding quadratic energy functional. To validate the proposed method, we apply QGFA to the displacement-based finite element method (FEM) for two-dimensional linear elastic problems under plane stress conditions. The algorithm demonstrates accurate convergence toward classical FEM solutions even with a moderate number of QSP phase factors. Compared with QMIA, QGFA achieves lower relative errors and faster convergence when initialized with suitable initial states, demonstrating its potential as an efficient preconditioned quantum linear solver. The proposed framework provides a physically interpretable connection between classical iterative solvers and quantum computational paradigms.

Comments and feedback are welcome", "summary": "The fundamental question of when a static or dynamic system should be deemed intrinsically quantum remains a challenge to address in absolute terms. A rigorous criterion, however, can be established by focusing on the measurable or reconstructible features of the system. This determination transcends mere issues of a system's classical simulability or computational complexity. Instead, the critical requirement lies in the certification (ideally, in real-time) of the emergence and persistence of genuine quantum features, principally entanglement and quantum superposition. Quantum Non-Demolition Measurements (QNDM) serve as the appropriate instrument for this certification, both from a theoretical and experimental standpoint. In this review paper, we demonstrate, with accessible clarity, how the implementation of QNDM can be directly linked to a necessary and sufficient condition for the violation of macrorealism in finite-dimensional systems, establishing a conceptual parallel with Leggett-Garg inequalities. Using concrete examples that detail the detection of negative terms in the quasi-probability density function resulting from QNDM, we introduce the core concepts for certifying genuinely quantum features. As specific examples, we discuss an application where the quantum-to-classical transition due to the interaction with an environment can be tracked by QNDM. Moreover, we argue about the robustness of QNDM protocols in the presence of noise sources and their advantages with respect to the Leggett-Garg inequalities.

Given oracle access to $e^{-itH}$ for an unknown $k$-local Hamiltonian $H$ and a fully specified target Hamiltonian $H_0$, the goal is to decide whether $H$ is exactly equal to $H_0$ or differs from $H_0$ by at least $\\varepsilon$ in normalized Frobenius norm, while minimizing the total evolution time. We introduce the first intolerant Hamiltonian certification protocol that achieves optimal performance for all constant-locality Hamiltonians. For general $n$-qubit, $k$-local, traceless Hamiltonians, our procedure uses $O(c^k/\\varepsilon)$ total evolution time for a universal constant $c$, and succeeds with high probability. In particular, for $O(1)$-local Hamiltonians, the total evolution time becomes $\u0398(1/\\varepsilon)$, matching the known $\u03a9(1/\\varepsilon)$ lower bounds and achieving the gold-standard Heisenberg-limit scaling. Prior certification methods either relied on implementing inverse evolution of $H$, required controlled access to $e^{-itH}$, or achieved near-optimal guarantees only in restricted settings such as the Ising case ($k=2$). In contrast, our algorithm requires neither inverse evolution nor controlled operations: it uses only forward real-time dynamics and achieves optimal intolerant certification for all constant-locality Hamiltonians.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u786e\u8ba4\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u672a\u77e5k\u5c40\u90e8\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fH\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fH0\u76f8\u7b49\uff0c\u5dee\u81f3\u5c11\u4e3a\u03b5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c3d\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u603b\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u5e38\u6570\u5c40\u90e8\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4ec5\u9700\u4f7f\u7528O(c^k/\u03b5)\u7684\u603b\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dc\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u5e38\u6570\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8eO(1)\u5c40\u90e8\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\uff0c\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230Heisenberg\u9650\u754c\u7684\u6700\u4f18O(1/\u03b5)\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u9ad8\u3002\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u9006\u6f14\u5316\u6216\u53d7\u63a7\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u5411\u5b9e\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5e38\u6570\u5c40\u90e8\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u9c81\u68d2\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5426\u504f\u79bb\u9884\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u9006\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u6d4b\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u786e\u8ba4\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u5411\u6f14\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u786e\u8ba4\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5e38\u6570\u5c40\u90e8\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6982\u7387\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86Heisenberg\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5e38\u6570\u5c40\u90e8\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u9c81\u68d2\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(c^k/\u03b5)\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728O(1)\u5c40\u90e8\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u4e0a\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u4f18O(1/\u03b5)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u786e\u8ba4\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u6700\u5c0f\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

To appear at the 32nd IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2026)", "summary": "Scaling fault tolerant quantum computers, especially cryogenic systems, to millions of qubits is challenging due to poorly-scaling data processing and power consumption overheads. One key challenge is the design of decoders for real-time quantum error correction (QEC), which demands high data rates for error processing; this is particularly apparent in systems with cryogenic qubits and room temperature (RT) decoders. In response, cryogenic predecoding using lightweight logic has been proposed to handle common, sparse errors in the cryogenic domain. However, prior work only accounts for a subset of error sources present in real-world quantum systems with limited accuracy, often degrading performance below a useful level in practical scenarios. Furthermore, prior reliance on SFQ logic precludes detailed architecture-technology co-optimization.\n  To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces Pinball, a comprehensive design in cryogenic CMOS of a QEC predecoder tailored to realistic, circuit-level noise. By accounting for error generation and propagation through QEC circuits, our design achieves higher predecoding accuracy, outperforming logical error rates (LER) of the current state-of-the-art cryogenic predecoder by nearly six orders of magnitude. Remarkably, despite operating under much stricter power and area constraints, Pinball also reduces LER by 32.58x and 5x, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art RT predecoder and RT ensemble configurations. By increasing cryogenic coverage, we also reduce syndrome bandwidth up to 3780.72x. Through co-design with 4 K-characterized 22 nm FDSOI technology, we achieve a peak power consumption under 0.56 mW. Voltage/frequency scaling and body biasing enable 22.2x lower typical power consumption, yielding up to 67.4x total energy savings. Assuming a 4 K power budget of 1.5 W, our predecoder supports up to 2,668 logical qubits at d=21.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces Pinball, a low-power, high-accuracy cryogenic error correction predecoder for quantum computers, achieving significant energy and performance improvements over existing solutions.", "motivation": "The increasing complexity of quantum computers, particularly those using cryogenic systems, presents significant challenges in terms of scalability, power consumption, and maintaining qubit integrity.

It is also the first study to utilize the IQM superconducting architecture. Since Odra 5 is available on-premises it allows for much more comprehensive study of various TRNG circuits. In particular, we consider 5 types of TRNG circuits with 105 circuit subvariants in total. Each circuit is used to generate 1 million bits.

In this work, we challenge this conventional wisdom by showing that QEM can continue to provide substantial benefits in the era of quantum error correction (QEC), and in an even more efficient manner than it does on current devices. We introduce a framework for logical-level QEM that leverages soft information naturally produced by QEC decoders, requiring no additional data, hardware modifications, or runtime overhead beyond what QEC protocols already provide. Within this framework, we develop and analyze three logical-level QEM techniques: post-selection and runtime abort policies, probabilistic error cancellation, and zero-noise extrapolation. Our techniques reduce logical error rates by more than 100x while discarding fewer than 0.1% of shots; they also provide in situ characterization of logical channels for QEM protocols. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our approach using a surface-code architecture and two state-of-the-art decoders based on tensor-network contraction and minimum-weight perfect matching. We evaluate logical-level QEM on random Clifford circuits and molecular simulation algorithms and find that, compared to previous approaches relying on QEC only or QEC combined with QEM, we can achieve up to 87.4% spacetime overhead savings. Our results demonstrate that logical-level QEM with QEC decoder soft information can reliably improve logical performance, underscoring the efficiency and usefulness of QEM techniques for fault-tolerant quantum computers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
