We present a spectroscopic study on neutral barium atoms embedded in a neon cryogenic crystal at 6.8 K, extending previous investigations performed in other noble gas hosts. The visible and near-infrared emission spectra were recorded under two different laser excitation schemes. First, 10-ns laser pulses at 355 nm were used to directly excite high-lying energy levels of barium, enabling the observation of fluorescence cascades. Second, a tunable continuous-wave laser operating between 700 nm and 900 nm allowed us to determine the matrix-induced shifts of barium energy levels relative to their vacuum values, as well as the inhomogeneous linewidths of the observed transitions and to perform lifetime measurements. Our results confirm multiple radiative pathways and matrix-induced relaxation channels affecting the 5d6s and 6s6p barium manifolds. Furthermore, we present the first lifetime measurement of the barium 5d6s 3D1 state in a neon crystal, yielding 0.39 \\pm 0.02 s, with a predicted increase of about 10% at 2 K.

The magnetic field induces a linear phase gradient across the junction, generating Josephson vortices that can host low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs). We show that, in certain parameter regimes, the combined effect of the phase gradient and spin-orbit coupling stabilizes an odd-fermion parity ground state, where a single Josephson vortex binds a spinful low-energy degree of freedom that is energetically separated from the other ABSs. This low-energy degree of freedom can be exploited to define a special type of ASQ, which we dub the vortex spin qubit (VSQ). We show that single-qubit gates for VSQs can be performed via flux driving, while readout can be achieved by adapting standard circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques developed for conventional ASQs. We further outline how an entangling two-qubit gate can be performed using an ac current drive. We argue that VSQs offer prospects for a substantial reduction in device complexity and hardware overhead compared to conventional ASQ implementations, while preserving key advantages such as supercurrent-based readout, single-qubit gates, and long-range two-qubit gates.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

At high temperatures this process is governed by the weak breaking of conformal symmetry, and so in this limit many features of the hydrodynamic theory that emerges have been argued to be universal. In this paper we study aspects of the stress tensor thermal two-point function in holographic QFTs of this kind and show that they are consistent with the universal hydrodynamic theory proposed to apply at late times. Specifically, we identify the locations of the `pole skipping' points in momentum space at which there is an intersection of poles and zeroes of this two-point function in holographic QFTs. Although these points lie outside the regime where the hydrodynamic theory is controlled, we show that their locations are consistent with those found by resumming the hydrodynamic derivative expansion near the lightcone.

However, while the increasing sensitivity of a critical oscillator upon decreasing the stimulus magnitude comes with proportionally sharper frequency tuning and slower responsiveness -- critical slowing down, the observed bandwidth of cochlear frequency tuning and the cochlear response time vary little with sound level. Because the cochlea operates as a distributed system rather than a single critical oscillator, it remains unclear whether criticality can serve as a fundamental principle for cochlear amplification. Here we tackle this challenge by integrating tonopically distributed critical oscillators in a traveling-wave model of the cochlea. Importantly, critical oscillators generically provide spatial buildup of energy gain from energy pumping into the waves and a key nonlinearity. In addition, our nonlinear model accounts for viscoelastic coupling between the oscillators. The model produces, with a single set of parameters, a family of cochlear tuning curves that quantitatively describe experimental data over a broad range of input levels. Overall, the interplay between generic nonlinear properties of local critical oscillators and distributed effects from traveling waves gives rise to a collective nonlinear response that preserves the power-law responsiveness afforded by criticality, but without paying the price of critical slowing down.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study investigates the role of critical oscillators in the cochlea, suggesting a mechanism where distributed systems can achieve amplification without critical slowing down by balancing nonlinear gain and frequency tuning across different stimulus levels.", "motivation": "Understanding how the cochlea processes sound across various intensities is crucial, especially considering the trade-offs between sensitivity, frequency tuning, and response time as sound levels change.", "method": "The study integrates tonopically distributed critical oscillators in a traveling-wave model of the cochlea, incorporating energy pumping and nonlinear gain, and uses this model to quantitatively describe experimental data.", "result": "The model, with a single set of parameters, successfully predicts a range of experimental data, demonstrating that distributed nonlinear systems can achieve reliable sound processing without the associated downsizing effects of critical slowing.", "conclusion": "This finding contributes to the understanding of how the cochlea maintains responsiveness across varying sound levels while mitigating the drawbacks of criticality in biological systems."}}

It also produces clear windows where the eigenstates become strongly multifractal. This shows that quasiperiodicity and geometry do not act independently rather, they reinforce one another in shaping the wavefunctions.

Here we perform a systematic study by doping non-magnetic Mg2+ into a magnetically complicated system, Co10Ge3O16, which contains three frustrated sublattices of Co2+, e.g., triangular Co1, Kagome Co2 and Co3 sublattices. By growing crystals for (Co1-xMgx)10Ge3O16 (0 < x <= 30%), we observed obvious site preference of Mg2+ on Co1 and Co3 sites over the Co2 site. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirm the high purity of the samples and indicate systematic peak shift, consistent with the loading compositions. Although previously investigated, the magnetic structure and expected magnetic frustration in this system are not fully uncovered. Our temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest that the high-temperature magnetostructural phase transition with antiferromagnetic ordering and a low-temperature broad peak are suppressed with Mg2+ doping, while two new magnetic features emerge at high Mg2+ level. Moreover, the structural phase transition from high-temperature R-3m to low-temperature C2/m space group is absent at the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature, as confirmed by single-crystal XRD. By analyzing the heat capacity and neutron powder diffraction results of the highest doped sample, (Co0.7Mg0.3)10Ge3O16, we speculate that the Co1 site is responsible for the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering, while the other two sites are short-range correlated in addition to a Mg2+-induced spin-glass state.

From this we obtained the expression for the scalar field, the potential, and the associated electromagnetic functions for any values of the parameter $m\\geq{2}$. In the second and third models, we consider the scenario of two wormholes that are structured according to the adjustment of the parameters that define their area function $\u03a3^2$, and in both cases we adopt $n=1/2$.

Although Shor's algorithm theoretically enables polynomial-time integer factorization, its real-world performance heavily depends on stringent conditions related to the period obtained via quantum phase estimation. Our generalized decomposition method relaxes these conditions by systematically exploiting arbitrary divisors of the obtained period, effectively broadening the applicability of each quantum execution. Extensive classical simulations were performed to empirically validate our approach, involving over one million test cases across integers ranging from 2 to 8 digits. The proposed method achieved near-perfect success rates, exceeding 99.998% for 7-digit numbers and 99.999% for 8-digit numbers, significantly surpassing traditional and recently improved variants of Shor's algorithm. Crucially, this improvement is achieved without compromising the algorithm's polynomial-time complexity and integrates seamlessly with existing quantum computational frameworks. Moreover, our method enhances the efficiency of quantum resource usage by minimizing unnecessary repetitions, making it particularly relevant for quantum cryptanalysis with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

Merging these, we generalize the notion of ideal Chern bands to the non-Hermitian realm and uncover several striking consequences both on the level of band theory and in the strongly interacting regime. Specifically, we show that the lowest band of a Kapit--Mueller lattice model with an imaginary gauge potential satisfies a generalized ideal condition with complex Berry curvature in sync with a complex quantum metric. The ideal band remains purely real and exactly flat yet all right and left eigenstates accumulate at the boundaries on a cylinder, implying a non-Hermitian skin effect without an accompanying spectral winding. The skin effect is inherited by the many-body zero modes, yielding skin-Laughlin states with an exponential profile on the lattice. Moreover, at a critical strength of non-Hermiticity there is an unconventional phase transition on the torus, which is absent on the cylinder.

As a fully unitary theory, there is no information loss in a UV complete quantum gravity theory. We see both these concepts reflected in the AdS/CFT correspondence, which tells us that dynamical processes in AdS are fully captured by a manifestly unitary CFT with no information loss. Furthermore, global symmetries of the CFT are dual to gauge symmetries in the AdS, which implies no global symmetry in the AdS. In this work, we provide concrete evidence for the connection between the non-existence of global symmetries and the absence of information loss in quantum gravity. We study the $\\textit{island setups}$ in which a gravitational AdS is coupled with a nongravitational bath on its boundary. In such theories, the information in the AdS can be lost to the bath. We provide concrete examples with global symmetries in the island setup, from both the bottom-up and the top-down perspectives. We argue that these global symmetries are consistent due to $\\textit{entanglement islands}$, in which holography is realized in a novel fashion. The global symmetries we construct are all mixed with spontaneously broken gauge symmetries. We will show that this fact has two implications: $\\textbf{1)}$ The black hole hair is detectable in the bath (``wet hair\"); $\\textbf{2)}$ a resolution of a puzzle proposed by Harlow and Shagoulian.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper argues that global symmetries are absent in quantum gravity due to information loss, supported by island setups where symmetry is broken and holography is realized differently.", "motivation": "Exploring the nature of global symmetries and information loss in quantum gravity, particularly through AdS/CFT correspondence and island models.", "method": "Analyzes AdS/CFT setups, constructs island models with global symmetries, examines symmetry breaking via entanglement islands.", "result": "Global symmetries are tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking, leading to detectable black hole hair (wet hair) and resolving the Harlow-Shagoulian puzzle through holographic anomaly cancellation.", "conclusion": "Quantum gravity lacks global symmetries because information is lost to the bath, and island setups provide a consistent framework to explain these phenomena."}}

In recent years, methodological advancements led to the multiloop extension of the fRG, which systematically includes loop corrections beyond the conventional one-loop truncation and yields a quantitatively accurate description of two-dimensional lattice systems. At the same time, the single-boson exchange (SBE) decomposition of the two-particle vertex has been shown to offer both computational and interpretative advantages paving the way to more affordable approximation schemes. We here apply their combination coined as multiloop SBE fRG to the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling.

The differential specific on-resistance of Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs was 12.01 m\u03a9*cm^2 and 12.05 m\u03a9*cm^2, respectively. Breakdown voltages of Cr2O3 HJDs ranged from 1.4-1.9 kV and 1.5-2.3 kV for NiOx HJDs. Theoretical band alignment between Cr2O3 and \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 was calculated from first principles. The ambient exposed NiOx/HVPE \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs forward current density degraded after 10 days while that of Cr2O3/HVPE \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs remained nearly unchanged after the same amount of time. It was later confirmed that the ambient exposed sputtered NiOx sheet resistance (Rsh) degradation gave rise to the reduction of the forward current density of the NiOx based HJDs, and water (H2O) was qualitatively determined to be the agent attributed to the forward conduction degradation by measuring the Rsh of NiOx-on-sapphire reference wafer after exposing it to different environments. The Cr2O3/HVPE \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJD also exhibited enhanced thermal stability compared to the NiOx/\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterostructures at elevated temperatures. Interfacial nickel gallate (Ga2NiO4) phase formation expected from phase diagrams can explain the reduced thermal stability of NiOx/\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs.

As a concrete setting, we study pure $\\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Yang-Mills theory along its quantum moduli space using Seiberg-Witten elliptic curves. We argue that the complexity computation should be organized in terms of local cells that cover the near-boundary regions where additional states become light, each associated with an appropriate duality frame. These duality frames are crucial for keeping the global complexity finite: insisting on a single frame extending across all such limits would yield a divergent complexity measure. This case study illustrates how tame geometry uses dualities to yield finite-complexity descriptions of effective theories and points towards a general framework for quantifying the complexity of the space of effective field theories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6709\u6548\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u53ca\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u6709\u9650\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u6709\u6548\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u5bf9\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86o-minimal\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Seiberg-Witten\u692d\u5706\u66f2\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7eafSU(N) \rp\bf{N}=2\u8d85 Yang-Mills \u7406\u8bba\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5355\u5143\u8986\u76d6\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u9650\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u9650\u5316\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, bridging these models to broader physical regimes like superfluid helium requires precise understanding of short-range interatomic interactions. Here, we investigate how finite-range interactions--next-order corrections to zero-range potentials--significantly alter QDs mechanics. Using a consistent effective theory, we derive an analytical equation of state (EOS) for three-dimensional bosonic mixtures under finite-range interactions at zero temperature. Leveraging the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, we demonstrate that interspecies attraction facilitates bosonic pairing across components characterized by the non-perturbative parameter of $\u0394$, leading to nonuniversal LHY terms that encode short-range interaction details while recovering previous universal QDs EOS in the zero-range limit. Extending superfluid hydrodynamic equations for two-component systems, we predict fractional frequency shifts in breathing modes induced by these nonuniversal terms.

Using long-term, numerical relativity simulations in spherical symmetry, we extract and analyze the frequency spectra of the radial oscillation modes of fermion-boson stars. Our simulations reveal that the fermionic and bosonic components synchronize through gravitational coupling, enriching their oscillation spectrum.

However, achieving high-efficiency and scattering-free performance with complex functionalities remains a fundamental challenge. While conventional Generalized Snell's Law (GSL) designs suffer from inherent inefficiencies and parasitic scattering, recent alternatives--including impedance-matching methods and diffraction-grating-based metagratings--have sought to overcome these drawbacks. While efficiency improvement has been demonstrated, both methods are limited in generating complex wavefields such as focusing. Here, we propose a direct wave-shaping (DWS) topology optimization framework that bypasses these intermediate concepts and automates the design of high-performance, monolithic elastic metasurfaces. To mitigate the high computational expense, we parameterize the geometry with movable, deformable and interactable elliptical voids, thereby drastically reducing the design variables while enabling holistic optimization that inherently accounts for nonlocal inter-cell couplings. We demonstrate the framework by designing metasurfaces for challenging tasks including high-efficiency longitudinal-to-transverse wave conversion with large-angle beam steering, wavelength-multiplexed beam steering, and both reflective and transmissive metalenses with numerical apertures exceeding 0.99.

However, owing to their broad and polarization-insensitive spectral features, the nanostructures reported so far displayed a limited color tunability and were unsuitable for other applications such as sensing. Herein, we report bismuth nanogratings with polarization-sensitive and narrow plasmon resonances (Q > 10). They were fabricated on the $cm^2$ scale following a lithography-free approach: conformal pulsed laser deposition of bismuth onto the reflective and transparent nanostructured layers of DVDs. We characterized their specular reflectance for different orientations of the plane of incidence, angles of incidence, and polarizations of light. When light is polarized in the plane perpendicular to the lines, plasmon resonances occur and shift across the visible-to-near infrared upon changing the angle of incidence. In contrast, no such resonances occur when light is polarized in the plane parallel to the lines. This results in well-contrasted, polarization-sensitive colors, which are iridescent for the former orientation of polarization, and not for the latter. Resonances strongly shift upon changing the refractive index of the surrounding medium (> 500 nm/RIU), resulting in a marked change in the plasmonic color, e.g., from green in air to red in water. This showcases the potential of these nanogratings for dynamic polarized color generation and colorimetric sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This network can be used as a generator solely or with a Generative Adversarial Network; however, KAN has a slower speed of learning than neural networks for the number of parameters.

We use Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic waves, while the electrons are described within the hydrodynamic approximation using Euler's equations and neglecting electromagnetic retardation effects. The incident electromagnetic wave excites magnetoplasmons in the strip. The fully screened limit is considered when all characteristic dimensions of the system, including the plasmon wavelengths, are much larger than the distance to the gate. This limit allows the linear response to be determined fully analytically. Due to the nonlinear hydrodynamic (convective) term, the excited magnetoplasmon oscillations give rise to a DC current along the strip and a voltage across it.

We introduce the concept of a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) scar subspace -- a Hilbert subspace stabilized by a restricted spectrum-generating algebra (rSGA) while being protected by on-site, inversion, and time-reversal symmetries. QMBS often admit a non-interacting quasiparticle description, which enables matrix-product representations with small bond dimension. Although individual QMBS do not necessarily retain the protecting symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we show that the subspace formed by the symmetry-connected QMBS does retain them, giving rise to consistently emerging topological properties across the entire scar subspace. Using the spin-$1$ Affleck--Kennedy--Lieb--Tasaki (AKLT) model, we demonstrate that its bimagnon scar subspace reflects the topological properties of the SPT ground state, as evidenced by the appropriate bond-space symmetry representations, the expected topological response, and the numerically verified long-range string order.

The decay of photocurrent with modulation frequency governs the response time. We find that the maximum modulation frequency is largely determined by the position of light-sensitive junction with respect to the middle of the channel. Largest modulation frequency is achieved for junctions in immediate vicinity of either source or drain contacts, while fast roll-off of the modulation characteristic is observed for junction in the middle of the channel.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This is achieved by replacing the central airhole of the hollow nanowire with a cluster of 6 overlapping circular air holes with rotational offset relative to the hexagonal cross-sectional profile of the nanowire. The design parameters were then further optimized in Finite Element Method using an inverse design method to maximize the normalized OAM order |l|.

In this work, we introduce the Choi echo, which provides an operational interpretation of the purity of the Choi state, the state representation of a quantum channel, as a quantifier of the robustness of quantum correlations against local information erasure. We employ this framework to analyze the reduced dynamics of a subsystem and to test whether local decoherence probes quantum chaos in many-body systems. Across paradigmatic spin chain models, we show that while the Choi echo captures key dynamical features, it also exhibits intrinsic limitations that, in certain regions of parameter space, restrict its ability to resolve the integrable-to-chaos transition at the level of spectral correlations. In particular, we demonstrate that local decoherence can spuriously signal quantum chaos in integrable regimes, tracing them to the inability of a strictly local probe to distinguish efficient coherent transport from genuinely scrambling dynamics. Our results show that local decoherence signals are controlled by the entanglement generated between the probe and its environment during the dynamics, rather than by spectral correlations, clarifying the practical scope of local dynamical diagnostics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Choi\u56de\u58f0\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u7eaf\u5ea6\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7f29\u51cf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5c40\u90e8\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u8bd5\u63a2\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u5178\u578b\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0Choi\u56de\u58f0\u6355\u83b7\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5b83\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u79ef\u5230\u6df7\u6c8c\u8fc7\u6e21\u5728\u80fd\u7ea7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5c42\u9762\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u53d1\u5730\u5728\u53ef\u79ef\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u8d77\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u5c40\u90e8\u63a2\u9488\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u9ad8\u6548\u76f8\u5e72\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0e\u771f\u6b63\u6df7\u4e71\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u4fe1\u53f7\u7531\u63a2\u9488\u4e0e\u5176\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u6240\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7531\u80fd\u7ea7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6240\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u635f\u5931\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u7d27\u5bc6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Choi\u56de\u58f0\u8fd9\u4e00\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5730\u89e3\u91caChoi\u6001\u7684\u7eaf\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u9c81\u68d2\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u6297\u5c40\u90e8\u5206\u6790\u7684\u91cf\u5ea6\uff0c\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7f29\u51cf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5178\u578b\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u8bd5\u63a2\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\uff0cChoi\u56de\u58f0\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b83\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u79ef\u5230\u6df7\u6c8c\u8fc7\u6e21\u5728\u80fd\u7ea7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5c42\u9762\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5730\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u53d1\u5730\u5728\u53ef\u79ef\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u8d77\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u5c40\u90e8\u63a2\u9488\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u9ad8\u6548\u76f8\u5e72\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0e\u771f\u6b63\u6df7\u4e71\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5730\u5f15\u5165Choi\u56de\u58f0\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5c40\u90e8\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002"}}

Herein, we constructed a family of Bi-modified Pt3M intermetallic catalysts (Bi-Pt3M/C, M=Cr, Mn, Co, Zn, In, Ga, and Sn) that follow CO-free dominated pathway and exhibit exceptional catalytic activity. More significantly, leveraging this platform, we have identified the pivotal factor governing the reaction kinetics in CO-free pathway, namely OH binding energy (OHBE). This arises because the rate-determining step (RDS) encompasses both C-H bond activation and water dissociation, whose respective barriers can be reflected by the OHBE. Accordingly, OHBE can act as an activity descriptor. Specifically, Bi-Pt3In/C stands out from other Bi-Pt3M/C and delivers the unprecedented mass activity of 36.7 A mgPt-1 at peak potential, far exceeding state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts reported to date. Taking Bi-Pt3In/C as a proof of concept, we clearly elucidate the origin of enhanced MOR activity by combining theoretical calculations, kinetic isotope effects, and formaldehyde electrooxidation. Moreover, there exhibits a volcano-type trend between OHBE and the activity of Bi-Pt3M/C. Beyond the discovery of ultrahigh-performance catalysts, these findings provide a detailed mechanistic picture of RDS and offer an innovative design principle for advanced catalysts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here we present the performance of the CRYO ASIC mounted on an auxiliary printed circuit board and evaluated both in a cryogenic environmental chamber and in a dedicated LXe test stand. We demonstrate that the ASICs achieve the desired performance at liquid xenon temperatures, showing a gain stability better than 0.2% over 24-hour operation and reliable in-situ calibration using an on-chip pulser. In the LXe test stand, we show that boiling caused by the chip heat dissipation can be mitigated by operating the system above ~0.1 MPa.

In addition, stacking faults can be created by the application of mechanic, electric or magnetic fields. Charge and spin transport then occur in relation to the existing twist-angle pattern. In two dimensions, a saddle point in the electronic band structure leads to divergence in the density of states, known as van Hove singularities (vHs). The energy difference between vHs for the conduction and valence bands was found to increase with the twist angle between neighboring graphite domains with respect to the c axis (perpendicular to the graphite planes). In this work, we estimate for the superconducting (SC)-like nano-size multi-layer granular domain in hydrogenated graphitic fibers [1]. We show that this value for and the values found by others for few-layer graphene might actually form the Fibonacci mathematical sequence.

However, the effects of these non-local operators on loop corrections to cosmological correlators remain largely unexplored. Extending the analysis of arXiv:2503.21880 , in this work we compute the $1$-loop bispectrum during slow-roll inflation, including the inverse-Laplacian operators present at cubic and quartic order in the ADM action (in the spatially flat gauge). These non-local vertices introduce non-trivial angular dependencies that significantly complicate the evaluation of loop integrals. We find that the diagrammatic rules of arXiv:2503.21880 for identifying poles and branch cuts in correlators without explicit integration remain valid even in the presence of such non-local interactions.

When composed of a nonlinear material, such arrays can also directly generate quantum states of light within the circuit. To clarify the similarities and distinctions between these two approaches of quantum walks, we conduct here a systematic comparison between linear waveguide arrays, injected with photons produced externally, and nonlinear arrays, where photon pairs are continuously generated via parametric down-conversion. We experimentally validate these predictions using III-V semiconductor nonlinear waveguide lattices with varied geometries, enabling us to tune the depth of the quantum walks over an order of magnitude and reveal the gradual emergence of non-classicality in the output state. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse-design approach to engineer \\textit{aperiodic} waveguide arrays, whose optimized coupling profiles generate maximally entangled states such as the biphoton W-state.

However, this conclusion has mainly relied on finite-size scaling of the entanglement entropy, lacking direct evidence from physical observables.} Here, we investigate the dynamical spectra of spin and bond operators at the deconfined critical point of the $J$-$Q_3$ model using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and contrasting them with the well-established $\\mathrm{O(3)}$ Wilson-Fisher criticality in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. Although both models exhibit two gapless magnon modes in the N\u00e9el phase, their critical behaviors diverge strikingly. At the $J_1$-$J_2$ critical point, the Higgs mode becomes gapless, yielding three gapless modes that reflect the full restoration of the $\\mathrm{O(3)}$ symmetry. {In the $J$-$Q_3$ model, we instead observe four gapless transverse modes at the either side of the transition.

Their incorporation into thermochemical conversion routes aligns with circular economy strategies, offering opportunities for renewable energy generation, waste minimization, and the development of value-added bioenergy products. The objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive thermochemical, elemental, and structural assessment of ASW to determine their suitability for solid biofuel production (pellets, briquettes), pyrolysis for bio-oil generation, and biochar applications.

We introduce a generalized SP effect relying on finite periodic arrays whose elements possess individually tunable polarizabilities, allowing us to explore higher-order SP radiation. By controlling the amplitude and phase of each of the elements, we show through rigorous theory the ability to create an SP steering device. In particular, we explore the active tuning capabilities of doped graphene, and thermally driven phase-change materials, which we compare with standard passive plasmonic structures made of gold and silver.

Two complementary measures are introduced: the mutual information energy, a state-independent quantity inspired by Onicescu's information energy that captures the geometric overlap between joint eigenspaces within a context; and an operational measure based on commutator expectation values that reflects contextual behavior at the level of measurement outcomes. We establish a hierarchy of bounds connecting these measures to the Robertson uncertainty relation, including spectral, purity-corrected, and operator norm estimates. The framework is applied to the Klyachko-Can-Binicio\u011flu-Shumovsky (KCBS) scenario for spin-1 systems, where all quantities admit closed-form expressions. The Majorana-stellar representation furnishes a common geometric platform on which both the operational measure and the uncertainty products can be analyzed. For spin-1, this representation yields a three-dimensional Euclidean-like visualization of the Hilbert space in which, states lying on a plane exhibit maximum uncertainty for the observable along the perpendicular direction; simultaneous optimization across all KCBS contexts singles out a unique state on the symmetry axis. Notably, states achieving the optimal sum of uncertainty products exhibit vanishing operational contextuality, while states with substantial operational contextuality satisfy a nontrivial Robertson bound -- the two extremes are achieved by distinct quantum states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u67ef\u6069-\u65bd\u4f69\u514b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1a\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8fd0\u7b97\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u7f57\u4f2f\u7279\u68ee\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8c31\u3001\u7eaf\u5ea6\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u8303\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eKlyachko-Can-Binicio\u011flu-Shumovsky\uff08KCBS\uff09\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u91cf\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u5229\u7528Majorana\u661f\u5c04\u5f71\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u8fd0\u7b97\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u91cf\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8espin-1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5141\u8bb8\u6211\u4eec\u57283D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4ee5\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u3002\u5728KCBS\u5404\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u540e\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u8f74\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6700\u4f73\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u3002\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u603b\u548c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u8fd0\u7b97\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8fd0\u7b97\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u6001\u5374\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u975e\u96f6\u7f57\u4f2f\u7279\u68ee\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u539f\u7406\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53d8\u5f97\u6108\u53d1\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u67ef\u6069-\u65bd\u4f69\u514b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408KCBS\u573a\u666f\u548cMajorana\u661f\u5c04\u5f71\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1a\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u8fd0\u7b97\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ea6\u91cf\u5982\u4f55\u5173\u8054\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u539f\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7KCBS\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Majorana\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u67ef\u6069-\u65bd\u4f69\u514b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u539f\u7406\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Assessing both full-model and readout-only finetuning across chemically diverse test sets, we find that pretraining improves accuracy, reduces reliance on costly qs$GW$ data, and mitigates large predictive outliers even for molecules larger or chemically distinct from those seen during finetuning.

These detectors use strong electric fields to collect and multiply positive ions produced by the incident radiation in mm-sized cell holes in dielectric materials, achieving a nm-equivalent spatial resolution of the localization of ionization events, when scaled to liquid water with unit density. Their design assumes that ion impact ionizations of gas molecules within the cell holes dominate signal formation, yet this assumption has lacked direct physical verification. Electron emission from the cell hole walls due to ion impact could also contribute, requiring alternative designs to optimize efficiency.\n  To investigate this, a nanodosimetric detector featuring a single cell hole with a diameter of 1.5 mm in a dielectric plate was developed. Ion collection and multiplication were achieved by applying a negative high voltage to the glass cathode 0.5 mm below the cell hole, assisted by a low drift field above the plate. A grounded readout electrode with a 0.8 mm hole covers the cell hole to prevent interactions of collected ions with the hole walls. High signal yields in 1 mbar and 2 mbar propane gas were observed and indicated that ion impact ionizations of the gas molecules are indeed the primary mechanism for signal induction. The compact nanodosimeter setup was further modeled with Geant4-DNA and Garfield++ for deeper insight.

Deviatov"], "title": "Altermagnetic bulk and topological surface magnetizations for CrSb single crystals", "comment": null, "summary": "We experimentally investigate the angle dependence of magnetization $M(\u03b1)$ for single crystals of CrSb. CrSb belongs to a new class of altermagnetic materials, the small net magnetization is accompanied by alternating spin splitting in the k-space. In addition, CrSb reveals also topological features with Weyl surface states originating from bulk band topology. We observe, that $M(\u03b1)$ oscillates around zero value, so magnetization is positive for $M(\u03b1)$ maxima and it is negative for $M(\u03b1)$ minima. The magnetization reversal curves $M(H)$ are non-linear with low-field hysteresis, but with almost linear high-field branches. The slope of the linear branches well correlates with $M(\u03b1)$ oscillations, so it is positive for $M(\u03b1)$ maxima and negative for $M(\u03b1)$ minima. We demonstrate, that the interplay between the positive and the negative $M(H)$ slopes originates from several magnetic phases in CrSb. In particular, current-carrying topological surface states are responsible for the diamagnetic-like $M(H)$ negative slope, which dominates for the directions of full spin compensation in the bulk CrSb altermagnetic spectrum. Due to the spin-momentum locking, topological surface states are spin-polarized, which is responsible for the low-field hysteresis.

Recently, in a class of kagome superconductors represented by CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, experimental reports have suggested rotational symmetry breaking and time reversal symmetry breaking associated with a charge density wave (CDW) order, revealing an exotic nature of this CDW order. Here, utilizing our recently developed capability of performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tunable magnetic field (magneto-ARPES), we reveal momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. While the response in the electronic structure is clearly compatible with piezomagnetism, strong orbital-selectivity is observed. Specifically, bands associated with the vanadium $d$-orbitals contributing to the Van Hove singularities (VHS) near the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary exhibit selective spectral broadening that breaks C$_6$ rotational symmetry and is odd in magnetic field, disappearing above the CDW transition. Meanwhile, the antimony $p$-orbital dominated electron pocket at the BZ center becomes elongated under an applied field -- an effect that persists above the $T_{\\rm CDW}$. Our observations delineate the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking associated with the vanadium VHS-bands at the onset of the CDW order, while the field-induced rotational symmetry breaking largely associated with the antimony $p$ orbitals reflects fluctuations beyond the CDW ordering temperature.

Yet, detecting synthetic breath biomarkers, with inherently low Raman cross-sections, at <100 ppb remains challenging. We demonstrate SERS detection down to clinically relevant 10 ppb via water-mediated trapping in hydroxylated nanoporous silica-coated plasmonic nanogaps, using pentafluoropropylamine (PFP) as a representative synthetic breath biomarker. Uniform nanogaps, with >1000 times electric field enhancement, were generated between a gold film and gold-silica core-shell nanoparticle assemblies using electric field-driven evaporation. Oxygen plasma treatment hydroxylated the silica, enabling water-mediated hydrogen bonding that strengthened PFP adsorption, confirmed by density functional theory.

Comments welcomed", "summary": "We present a cardinal solution for the long-standing and fundamental problem associated with the adiabatic, reversible, and controlled excitation of both dark and bright solitons in Kerr micro-resonators with normal group velocity dispersion. Our findings stem from the inclusion of a localised non-Hermitian potential, which we use to drastically reshape the characteristic collapsed snaking structure associated with such solitons. Consequently, we demonstrate a novel snaking-free bifurcation landscape where solitons of all possible widths are continuously connected via the dynamic change of the cavity detuning, and hence dissipative localised states of unprecedentedly high pump-to-comb conversion efficiencies can be excited in an adiabatic, deterministic, and reversible fashion. Our fundamental discovery has practical implications of paramount importance for frequency comb generation in all-normal dispersion cavities, which are key to comb generation in most spectral regions away from the telecom bands.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u5149\u5b64\u5b50\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u5541\u557e\u5fae_ring resonator\u4e2d\u7edd\u5730\u53cd\u8f6c\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u975e\u4fdd\u771f\u52bf\u80fd\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u91cd\u5851\u4e86\u5149\u5b64\u5b50\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u4f38\u7f29\u7684\u632f\u8361\u89e3\u6784\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6298\u53e0\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u8154\u70e7\u7ed3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5149\u5b64\u5b50\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cf5\u5230\u8c10\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u5b64\u5b50\u5728\u5fae_ring resonator\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u5728\u5149\u8c03\u5236\u548c\u9891\u7387\u7ec4\u5408\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5168\u6ce2\u957f\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7edd\u5730\u53cd\u8f6c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u975e\u4fdd\u771f\u52bf\u52bf\u80fd\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6697\u3001\u4eae\u4e24\u79cd\u5149\u5b64\u5b50\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u5541\u557e\u5fae_ring resonator\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u8154\u70e7\u7ed3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u5b64\u5b50\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u975e\u6298\u53e0\u5149\u5b64\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u5b64\u5b50\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u8154\u70e7\u7ed3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cf5\u5230\u8c10\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5149\u8c03\u5236\u548c\u9891\u7387\u7ec4\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5149\u5b64\u5b50\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u5541\u557e\u5fae_ring resonator\u4e2d\u7684\u7edd\u5730\u53cd\u8f6c\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9891\u7387\u7ec4\u5408\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

The coupled electron-vibration-photon system, together with the electrodes and a dissipative environment, is described within an open quantum system framework and solved using a numerically exact quantum dynamical approach. The reaction coordinate is modeled with a Morse potential, enabling explicit treatment of molecular anharmonicity and bond-breaking behavior. By varying the cavity frequency across the infrared regime to cover typical nuclear vibrational energies, we observe multiple resonant rate suppression features that emerge whenever the cavity mode is brought into resonance with a dipole-allowed vibrational transition along the anharmonic ladder up to the dissociation threshold. These findings open the door to extending polaritonic chemistry into genuinely nonequilibrium scenarios relevant to molecule-electrode interfaces. Moreover, building on these results, we further propose a multi-mode vibrational strong coupling strategy in which several cavity modes are individually matched to distinct vibrational transitions. This engineered multi-resonant cavity induces a stepwise vibrational ladder descending process that efficiently drains vibrational excited energy. The resulting cavity-assisted cooling suggests a potential route toward mitigating voltage-induced bond rupture and the long-standing instability issues of molecular junctions operating under high bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Our results are organized into two main propositions. First, for pure Gaussian states, we show that every correlated mode possesses a unique single-degree-of-freedom partner that fully captures its correlations (consisting of entanglement), and we provide an explicit construction of this partner from the complex structure of the system's state. Second, for mixed Gaussian states, we constructively demonstrate that the notion of a partner subsystem splits into two: a correlation partner, which contains all classical and quantum correlations and need not correspond to a single degree of freedom, and an entanglement partner, which is always at most single-mode. Finally, we extend the construction of partners to multi-mode subsystems.

Despite evidence that interfacial effects persist under sub-nanometre confinement, the molecular-scale behaviour and its evolution with slit width remain unclear. Here, we use machine-learning molecular dynamics with first-principles accuracy to probe water at graphene surfaces across slit widths ranging from the open-interface limit to angstrom-scale confinement. We find that water undergoes a sharp structural transition: when three or more water layers fit between the walls, the structure of the graphene-water interface is effectively indistinguishable from that in an open system, with density layering, hydrogen bonding, and orientational ordering retaining interfacial character. Below this threshold, however, angstrom-scale confinement strongly reorganises the liquid, producing enhanced ordering, a restructured hydrogen-bond network, and modified orientational motifs. These results establish a molecular-level picture that clearly separates interfacial behaviour from genuine nanoconfinement and provide guidance for predicting and controlling the structure of water

They are responsible for providing accurate energy measurements of particles produced in high-energy collisions. The demanding requirements set for next-generation collider experiments impose new challenges on the design of new detectors, and a systematic approach to their optimization is increasingly necessary. The performance of calorimeters is primarily characterized by their energy resolution, parameterized by a stochastic and a constant term, related to sampling fluctuations and non-uniformities respectively. To improve the reconstruction quality of physics objects in the calorimeter, both terms need to be taken into account. Changes in a longitudinally constrained design usually result in a trade-off between these terms, making optimization a non-trivial task. This work focuses on the optimization of a hadronic sampling calorimeter, based on the FCC-ee ALLEGRO detector concept. By controlling the absorber layer thickness in a Geant4 simulation, the impact of the passive to active material proportion on the deposited energy distribution and resolution can be analyzed.

In condensed matter physics, vigorous research has clarified how chiral materials harbour unconventional electronic and vibrational responses. In parallel, recent studies have demonstrated that chiral structures can be engineered or tuned from achiral precursors. Despite these complementary advances, an integrated understanding of electronic and phononic dynamics, self-organized chiral structures, and their interplay is still lacking. Such an integrated framework is crucial both for elucidating the spontaneous formation and stabilization of chiral structures and for advancing the electronic functionalities of chiral materials. Here, we predict novel spontaneous structural phase transitions unique to chiral crystals with screw symmetry. In quasi-one-dimensional chiral crystals, the phonon frequency renormalized by the electron-phonon coupling depends on the handedness of circular polarization. Consequently, the soft mode encoding the intrinsic phonon angular momentum induces spin-selective Peierls gaps in the electronic band, entailing a helical spin density wave and chiral lattice distortion. We also elucidate the chiral signature of collective modes. Our findings offer new avenues for advanced spintronics applications and crucial insights into the elusive mechanisms underlying the formation process of chirality in nature.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In particular, our results show, for the first time, that the fluid velocity in inhomogeneous cosmologies develops mixmaster-esque oscillations consistent with the generalised BKL conjecture of Uggla et al.

Our work establishes a general platform for exploring higher-order EP-based phenomena while clarifying the fundamental boundary of non-Hermitian sensitivity enhancement across diverse physical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u9ad8\u9636\u4f8b\u5916\u70b9\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e2a\u7eb3\u7c73\u673a\u68b0\u632f\u5b50\u548c\u65e0\u9650\u7684\u865a\u62df\u632f\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e03\u9636\u4f8b\u5916\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8026\u5408\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u53d7\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u9636\u4f8b\u5916\u70b9\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u6839\u54cd\u5e94\u653e\u5927\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9636\u4f8b\u5916\u70b9\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u654f\u611f\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u8ba9\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u5355\u4e2a\u7eb3\u7c73\u673a\u68b0\u632f\u5b50\u548c\u65e0\u9650\u7684\u865a\u62df\u632f\u5b50\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u56de\u8def\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u9ad8\u9636EPs\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e03\u9636EPs\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8026\u5408\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u53d7\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6839\u54cd\u5e94\u653e\u5927\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u9ad8\u9636EPs\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

Mass-balance stakes are commonly used for localized measurements, with the exposed length typically measured manually at infrequent intervals. This paper presents the design and validation of new instrumentation that automates mass-balance stake readings, thus enabling continuous measurements with high temporal resolution. The instrumentation comprises readout electronics that are mounted on mass-balance stakes to measure wind-induced vibrations. The stake vibrational frequency depends sensitively on the exposed length, and changes in the measured frequency therefore probe glacier surface melt and accumulation. Initial instrumentation field tests conducted at Color Lake on Umingmat Nunaat (Axel Heiberg Island), Nunavut, demonstrate centimeter-level precision on length measurements. The instrumentation can be attached to existing mass-balance stakes and is low-cost (~ $50 USD) in comparison to many other systems that perform automated surface ablation measurements.

Mentink"], "title": "Spin-correlation dynamics: A semiclassical framework for nonlinear quantum magnetism", "comment": null, "summary": "Classical nonlinear theories are highly successful in describing far-from-equilibrium dynamics of magnets, encompassing phenomena such as parametric resonance, ultrafast switching, and even chaos. However, at ultrashort length and time scales, where quantum correlations become significant, these models inevitably break down. While numerous methods exist to simulate quantum many-body spin systems, they are often limited to near-equilibrium conditions, capture only short-time dynamics, or obscure the intuitive connection between nonlinear behavior and its geometric origin in the su(2) spin algebra. To advance nonlinear magnetism into the quantum regime, we develop a theory in which semiclassical spin correlations, rather than individual spins, serve as the fundamental dynamical variables. Defined on the bonds of a bipartite lattice, these correlations are inherently nonlocal, with dynamics following through a semiclassical mapping that preserves the original spin algebra. The resulting semiclassical theory captures nonlinear dynamics that are entirely nonclassical and naturally accommodates phenomenological damping at the level of correlations, which is typically challenging to include in quantum methods. As an application, we focus on Heisenberg antiferromagnets, which feature significant quantum effects. We predict nonlinear scaling of the mean frequency of quantum oscillations in the N\u00e9el state with the spin quantum number S.

In particular, the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode of the oxygen ion in the $CuO_{2}$ plane has been proposed to be responsible for the dramatic peak-dip-hump(PDH) structure in the anti-nodal spectrum. The recent observation of the exceptional flat quasiparticle dispersion in the anti-nodal region and the sudden suppression of the PDH structure around the pseudogap end point cast doubts on such a scenario. Instead, a scenario involving the coupling to the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation seems to resolve both puzzles naturally. Here we present a systematic study on the interplay between antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and electron-phonon coupling in the cuprate superconductors. We show that the coupling strength to the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode is strongly suppressed by the vertex correction caused by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the $\\mathbf{q}\\rightarrow 0$ limit as a result of the destructive interference between electron-phonon coupling at electron momentum differ by the antiferromagnetic wave vector. Counterintuitively, we find that the same vertex correction enhances the phonon contribution to the PDH structure. We also find that while the coupling to either the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation or the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode can generate a PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum with similar phenomenologies, the sudden suppression of such a structure around the pseudogap end point should be mainly attributed to the dramatic change in the nature of the spin fluctuation at such a critical doping. We suggest to take the PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum as a spectral signature for the emergence of fluctuating local moment in the pseudogap phase and the entrance of a doped Mott insulating state.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

One demonstration of this non-singular behavior on horizon was provided by Fronsdal in 1959, by finding a global isometric embedding of the Schwarzschild metric into a six-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. Isometric embeddings for the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m metric have also been constructed, but they only embed the region external to the inner horizon or in a single Eddington-Finkelstein patch. This paper presents a global isometric embedding for the maximally extended Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m spacetime into a nine-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. We present the solution in terms of explicit local four-dimensional coordinates, and also as a level-set of functions of the higher-dimensional embedding spacetime.

The evolution governed by the Liouville operator preserves many properties of full quantum dynamics, including the conservation of total population, energy, and purity, and has shown quantitative agreement with exact quantum results for the expectation values of many observables where direct comparisons are feasible. However, since the QCLE density matrix operator is obtained from the partial Wigner transform of the full quantum density matrix, its matrix elements can have negative values, implying that the diagonal matrix elements behave as pseudo-densities rather than densities of classical phase space. Here, we compare phase-space distributions generated by exact quantum dynamics with those produced by QCLE evolution from pure quantum initial states. We show that resonance effects in the off-diagonal matrix elements differ qualitatively, particularly for low-energy states. Furthermore, numerical and analytical results for low-dimensional models reveal that the QCLE can violate the positivity of marginal phase-space densities, a property that should hold at all times for any physical system. A perturbative analysis of a model system confirms that such violations arise generically. We also show that the violations of positivity of the marginal densities vanish as the initial energy of the system increases relative to the energy gap between subsystem states. These findings suggest that a negativity index, quantifying deviations from positivity, may provide a useful metric for assessing the validity of mixed quantum\\textendash{}classical descriptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178Liouville\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08QCLE\uff09\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u70ed\u6ce2\u957f\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0QCLE\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u603b\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u5143\u7d20\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u8d1f\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5143\u7d20\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4f2a\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7ecf\u5178\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u7cbe\u786e\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u6001\u548cQCLE\u6f14\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7684\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u80fd\u6001\u7684\u6790\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6570\u503c\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cQCLE\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e86\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u6b63\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e00\u6027\u8d28\u5e94\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u6270\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u8fdd\u53cd\u6b63\u6027\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u7cfb\u7edf\u521d\u59cb\u80fd\u91cf\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u7ea7\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6b63\u6027\u7684\u8fdd\u53cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u8fdd\u53cd\u6b63\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u662f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u70ed\u6ce2\u957f\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u6b63\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u7684Liouville\u65b9\u7a0b\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cQGLE\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e86\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u6b63\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u67d0\u4e9b\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6b63\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6027 violations \u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

Our study focuses on the following purposes. Firstly, to investigate the fundamental gravitational structural features of the model, we analyze the dynamical behavior of the field equations, the fulfillment of the Bianchi identities, the associated conservation laws, and the application of the second Noether theorem at the background and first-order perturbation levels. Moreover, the model's distinguishing characteristics and theoretical differences from the corresponding standard scenarios are also investigated.\n  Secondly, we aim to obtain exact analytical solutions and analyze the time evolution of key cosmological quantities, considering the integration constants influence, and the number of spacetime dimensions, and the fractional parameter effects.

Our approach transforms computational timing variations from hardware and operating system sources into permutation dynamics that generate Poisson-distributed numbers, accurately reproducing the photon statistics of optical coherent states. The theoretical foundation is established by the Uniform Convergence Theorem, which provides exponential convergence to uniformity under modular projection with rigorous error bounds.

However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($\u0394t$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $\u0394t$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $\u03b5\\to 0$ of the error parameter $\u03b5$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $\u03b5\\neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($\u03b5^2$) vs O($\u0394t$)). Through simulations, we demonstrate that these theoretical benefits yield numerical advantages: (i) QKUD provides numerically exact results at small $\u03b5$, (ii) it remains stable across a broad range of $\u03b5$ values, indicating low parameter sensitivity, and (iii) it can solve problems unreachable by conventional time evolution.

To capture the truly collective part one needs to go beyond this short-range contribution tied to interfaces between subregions. Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states.

Classically, each phase is defined by its flow pattern and how stationary sets organize phase space (e.g. fixed points and limit cycles), with transitions triggered by local bifurcations or global basin rearrangements. In the quantum regime, these reorganizations are often blurred by density-matrix averaging, and spectral indicators such as the Liouvillian gap can miss changes that unfold mainly in the transients. Here we introduce a topological graph invariant, the molecule, which captures the phase-space connectivity of fixed points and limit cycles. Transitions show up as discrete changes of this invariant, with each form marking a distinct quantum dynamical pattern (e.g. relaxation pathway). The molecule encodes the global topological constraints that govern how stationary sets and their basins can rearrange, clarifies when such rearrangements can affect the Liouvillian modes, and reveals additional transitions that remain hidden in the steady-state spectrum but stem from global changes of the flow topology.

In the first and second part of the thesis, we study the fibred Calabi-Yau and M-theory moduli stabilization scenario. We consider both flux-stabilized models and non-perturbative stabilization methods. We perform a holographic analysis to determine the spectrum of the assumed dual $CFT_3$ to understand its AdS/CFT implications. For the flux stabilization, which relies on a large complex Chern-Simons invariant, moduli have integer dimensions similar to the DGKT flux-stabilized model in type IIA. For the non-perturbative stabilization, the results are similar to race-track models in type IIB.\n  In the last part of the thesis, we solve the Wheeler DeWitt equation for the planar Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole in a minisuperspace approximation. We construct semiclassical Wheeler-DeWitt states from Gaussian wavepackets that are peaked on classical black hole interior solutions. By using the metric component $g_{xx}$ as a clock, these states are evolved through both the exterior and interior horizons. Close to the singularity, we show that quantum fluctuations in the wavepacket become important, and therefore the classicality of the minisuperspace approximation breaks down. Towards the AdS boundary, the Wheeler-DeWitt states are used to recover the Lorentzian partition function of the dual theory living on this boundary. This partition function is specified by an energy and a charge. Finally, we show that the Wheeler-DeWitt states know about the black hole thermodynamics, recovering the grand canonical thermodynamic potential after an appropriate averaging at the black hole horizon.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

At one loop, using dimensional regularization with an IR mass regulator $m$, we compute the photon vacuum polarization. We find a clean separation between UV and soft logarithms: the former is gauge and process independent and fixes the beta function, whereas the latter encodes nonlocal, IR-dominated contributions that may depend on gauge parameters and must not be interpreted as UV running. In the quadratic-gravity sector, the photon self-energy is UV finite--the $\\ln\u03bc^{2}$ pieces cancel--leaving only $\\ln(Q^{2}/m^{2})$ soft logs. Consequently, quadratic gravity does not modify the one-loop UV coefficient and thus does not alter $\u03b2(e)$. Therefore, the physical running coincides with the $\u03bc$-running in QED at one loop. Our analysis clarifies how to extract a gauge and process independent running in the presence of gravitational interactions and why soft logs from quadratic gravity should not contribute to $\u03b2(e)$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Although many mitigation strategies exist, their connection to convergence performance under different iteration budgets remains unclear. Moreover, a systematic analysis identifying which state-of-the-art mitigation techniques perform best under specific scenarios is also lacking. We benchmark four approaches, Local-Global, Adiabatic, State Efficient Ansatz (SEA), and Pretrained VQE, against standard VQE on molecular systems from 4 to 14 qubits, analyzing gradient variance up to 50 layers and convergence over 1000 iterations. Our results show that the impact of gradient preservation is iteration-dependent. In the 14-qubit BeH2 system, Pretrained VQE outperforms SEA at 100 iterations despite lower gradient variance, but SEA becomes 2.2x more accurate at 1000 iterations. For smaller systems, SEA achieves near-exact energies (H2: 10^-5 Ha, LiH: 2x10^-4 Ha) with fidelities 0.999, while standard methods plateau early.

The excited states are prepared by the Euclidean path integral in the CFT with a source turned on for some double-trace operator, with a small, $O(1)$ amplitude $\u03bb$. On the gravity side, the double-trace operator deforms the bulk geometry as well as the entanglement structure of the state of bulk matter fields. By the quantum extremal surface formula, this leads to a deformation of the shape of the entanglement wedge, an effect which becomes manifest in the entanglement entropy at $O(\u03bb^2 G_N)$. On the CFT side, we explicitly calculate the entanglement entropy perturbatively in the source amplitude to $O(\u03bb^2)$, in terms of modular-flowed correlation functions of double-trace operators. We then evaluate these modular-flowed correlation functions using Witten diagrams. This calculation involves a Schwinger-Keldysh contour ordering prescription in the bulk, which we motivate using analytic continuation from Euclidean replica correlators.

The quadrupole interaction enables to resolve multiple NMR transitions, which are consistent with our eigenenergy calculations. Our experimental results indicate that the nuclear spin can be driven efficiently irrespective of its hybridization with the electron spin, which is required for direct control of the nuclear spin in the long-lifetime regime.

In the case of the two-line BCFW shift, we have a famous improved behavior at infinity that allows for the amplitude to be reconstructed from the pole factorization. For other shifts, the poles at infinity are present and need to be considered, however general principles do not fix the residues of the amplitude on these poles. The web of all possible shifts is large, we focus primarily on a case of $(n{-}2)$-line anti-holomorphic shift, which also appears in the context of unitarity cuts of gravity loop integrands. We will find that for one class of shifts the gravity amplitudes at infinity exhibit a peculiar factorization property, quite different from the usual factorization on poles, while for other shifts, they evaluate to the same amplitude on shifted kinematics.

We present a novel mitigation technique for quantum sensors to efficiently reverse the effects of any noise that can be described by a completely positive trace preserving map.

We anticipate that the control afforded by near-surface delta doping will enable new developments in NV quantum sensing from nanoscale NMR to entanglement-enhanced metrology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5728 diamond \u589e\u957f\u671f\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u03b4\u63ba\u6742\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5236\u4f5c\u4e86\u8868\u9762\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u6c2e-\u78f7 vacancy\uff08NV\uff09\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c2e-\u78f7 NV \u611f\u5e94\u5668\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8868\u9762\u6c2e-\u78f7 NV \u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u52bf\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22\u8868\u9762\u6c2e-\u78f7 NV \u7684\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u611f\u77e5\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728 diamond \u589e\u957f\u671f\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u03b4\u63ba\u6742\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236NV\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86NV\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u611f\u5e94\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u5b50\u6ce8\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684NV\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86NV\u611f\u5e94\u5668\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u9762\u03b4\u63ba\u6742\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728 diamond \u8868\u9762\u5236\u9020\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u7684NV\u611f\u5e94\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u611f\u77e5\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5c40\u9762\u3002"}}

As an alternative, the Earth's magnetic field entails location information and is found critical to many animals' cognitive and navigation behavior. However, the practical use of the Earth's magnetic field for geo-localization hinges on an ultra-sensitive magnetometer. This work investigates how quantum magnetic sensing can be used for this purpose. We theoretically derive the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the estimation error of quantum sensing when using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and prove the quantum advantage over classical magnetometers. Moreover, we employ a practical distributed quantum sensing protocol to saturate CRLB. Based on the estimated magnetic field and the earth's magnetic field map, we formulate geo-localization as a map-matching problem and introduce a coarse-to-fine Mahalanobis distance search in both gradient space (local field derivatives) and corner space (raw field samples). We simulate the proposed quantum sensing-based geo-localization framework over four cities in the United States and Canada.

We investigate quantum machine learning for this task, focusing on Quantum Kernel Methods (QKMs) applied to real and complex SAR chips extracted from the SARFish dataset. We tackle two binary classification problems, the first for distinguishing vessels from non-vessels, and the second for distinguishing fishing vessels from other types of vessels. We compare QKMs applied to real and complex SAR chips against classical Laplacian, RBF, and linear kernels applied to real SAR chips. Using noiseless numerical simulations of the quantum kernels, we find that QKMs are capable of obtaining equal or better performance than the classical kernel on these tasks in the best case, but do not demonstrate a clear advantage for the complex SAR data.

In this paper, we explore these local encodings from the perspective of the corresponding time-evolution unitaries. Specifically, we propose a new framework for digital implementations of these qubit-encoded fermionic time-evolution unitaries based on \\emph{flow sets}, which are one-dimensional subsets of the directed fermionic interaction graph. We find that any local fermionic encoding, when restricted to a given flow set, adopts a simple structure that we can classify systematically. For each categorized flow-set form, we propose a low-depth qubit quantum circuit that implements the time evolution unitary using the stabilizer formalism. As an application of our construction, we introduce novel flow-based decompositions for known two-dimensional encodings, leading to efficient circuit decompositions of time-evolution unitaries.

Under such double coupling, it is found that while the Hamiltonian of the system is clearly Hermitian the dynamics of the quadrature components of the field operators can be attributed to non-Hermicity of the system. It is manifested in an asymmetric coupling between the quadrature components which then leads to a variety of remarkable features. In particular, we identify how the emerging exceptional point controls the conversion of thermal states of the modes into single-mode classically or quantum squeezed states. Furthermore, for reservoirs being in squeezed states, we find that the two-photon correlations present in these reservoirs are responsible for unidirectional flow of populations and correlations among the modes and the flow can be controlled by appropriate tuning of the mutual orientation of the squeezed noise ellipses. In the course of analyzing these effects we find that the flow of the population creates the first-order coherence between the modes which, on the other hand rules out an enhancement of the two photon correlations responsible for entanglement between the modes.

In the language of quantum probability, this is a C\\(^*\\)-algebraic reformulation of the known fact that the singlet correlations admit no local hidden-variable model with jointly distributed outcomes on one probability space.\n  We also give an explicit realization of the same spinor structure within the author's Quantum Index Algebra (QIA) framework, where locality appears as disjoint index slots and the singlet state as a simple index cocycle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8d1d\u5c14-CHSH\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e24\u7c92\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb-1\u20442\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d1d\u5c14\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u9690\u5f0f\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u4ea4\u6362 Clifford \u4ee3\u6570\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u81ea\u65cb Clifford \u4ee3\u6570\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u67ef\u5c14\u83ab\u54e5\u6d1b\u592b\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8d1d\u5c14-CHSH\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d77\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8d1d\u5c14-CHSH\u77db\u76fe\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u7684\u4f53\u73b0\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u5c40\u90e8\u9690\u5f0f\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u63cf\u8ff0\u6b64\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

However, the current software ecosystem forces developers to manually orchestrate low-level network resources, such as entanglement generation (EPR pairs) and classical synchronization, leading to verbose, error-prone, and non-scalable code. This paper introduces \\textbf{NetQMPI}, a high-level Python framework that adapts the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard to the quantum domain using the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) paradigm. Built as a middleware over the NetQASM SDK, NetQMPI abstracts the underlying physical topology, automating network initialization and resource management through a unified Communicator interface. We propose semantic point-to-point primitives and novel collective operations--such as expose and unexpose--that address the constraints of the No-Cloning Theorem by leveraging multipartite entanglement for data distribution. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that NetQMPI decouples algorithmic logic from network size, reducing the code complexity for generating an $N$-node GHZ state from $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to constant complexity $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. Furthermore, the framework ensures backend agnosticism, enabling the seamless execution of high-level applications on rigorous physical simulators like NetSquid (via SquidASM) and future quantum hardware adhering to the NetQASM standard.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Using the GHZ state as a representative example, we demonstrate that while fully correlated measurements can initially distinguish a macroscopic superposition from its corresponding classical mixture, generic many-body evolution renders them operationally indistinguishable for most times during the evolution. By analyzing both distinguishability measures and established quantifiers of macroscopic quantumness, we find that equilibration not only hides coherence from accessible observables but also suppresses macroscopic superpositions themselves.

One of the most significant outcomes of our work is that the shell thickness emerges as a useful parameter for controlling the interaction, opening avenues for both fundamental physics and applications in quantum technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5706\u67f1\u578b\u7a7a\u5fc3\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5468\u56f4\u539f\u5b50\u7684Casimir-Polder\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6750\u6599\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u5fae\u7eb3\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7406\u89e3Casimir-Polder\u529b\u5bf9\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5468\u56f4\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u539f\u5b50\u4e0e\u5706\u67f1\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u58f3\u539a\u5ea6\u548c\u539f\u5b50-\u5706\u67f1\u4f53\u95f4\u8ddd\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0cCasimir-Polder\u52bf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u6307\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u58f3\u539a\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u58f3\u539a\u5ea6\u8c03\u63a7Casimir-Polder\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

A major theoretical challenge is to construct dynamical models that are simultaneously consistent with classical thermodynamics and complete positivity. In this work, we develop a framework that addresses this issue by extending classical stochastic dynamics to the quantum domain. We begin by formulating a generalized Langevin equation in which both friction and noise act symmetrically on the two Hamiltonian equations. From this, we derive a generalized Klein-Kramers equation expressed in terms of Poisson brackets, and we show that it admits the Boltzmann distribution as its stationary solution while satisfying the first and second laws of thermodynamics along individual trajectories. Applying canonical quantization to this classical framework yields two distinct quantum master equations, depending on whether the friction operators are taken to be Hermitian or non-Hermitian. By analyzing the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, we determine the conditions under which these equations reduce to a Lindblad-type generator. Our results demonstrate that complete positivity is ensured only when friction and noise are included in both Hamiltonian equations, thus fully justifying the classical construction. Moreover, we find that the friction coefficients must satisfy the same positivity condition in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian formulations, revealing a form of universality that transcends the specific operator representation. The formalism offers a versatile tool for deriving quantum versions of the thermodynamic laws and is directly applicable to a wide class of nonequilibrium nanoscale systems.", "AI": {"tldr":

Finally, we present a brief scaling characterization that demonstrates the computational intractability of classically simulating the kernel as the number of resonators scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Kerr\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7269\u5143\u4e0e\u58f0\u5b50\u5171\u632f\u5668\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6838\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f53\u6570\u76ee\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u6838\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728 Kerr \u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u5c06 Kerr \u7269\u5143\u4e0e\u58f0\u5b50\u5171\u632f\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6838\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cKerr \u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f4\u63a5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6838\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u632f\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u632f\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u6838\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6025\u5267\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u8d85\u51fa\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e Kerr \u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7269\u5143\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6a21\u62df\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6838\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u6027\u3002 "}}

Therefore, understanding the behavior of DWDMs under such attacks is essential for assessing the practical security of QKD systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the characteristics of DWDMs under high-power laser illumination. Our experimental results show that certain DWDM samples exhibit pronounced changes in their spectral features once the injected laser power surpasses a specific threshold. Taking the Trojan-horse attack as an illustrative example, we further perform a theoretical analysis of the resulting spectral side channel and show that it can reduce the maximum secure transmission distance to below 66.9% of its original value.

Among the proposals that have demonstrated robustness against this issue, the ADAPT-VQE algorithm stands out for ground state estimation, primarily due to its iterative ansatz construction. Although ADAPT-VQE has been extensively benchmarked on molecular Hamiltonians, where the ground states typically exhibit low entanglement, its performance for highly entangled ground states remains largely unexplored. In this work, we explore a variant of this algorithm known as qubit-ADAPT-VQE, assessing its ability to achieve ground states with substantial entanglement in spin models. We focus on four-qubit systems and employ an algebraic entanglement classification to identify distinct entanglement classes among ground states, and consider a representative of each class as an initial state to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.

In this work, we analyze a system of four inductively coupled fluxonium qubits to determine the impact of spectator qubits on the performance of a \\textsc{cnot} gate. Our results show that spectator-induced errors are strongly suppressed when the transition frequencies of the spectator qubits are sufficiently detuned from those of the active qubits. We identify favorable frequency configurations for the four-qubit chain that yield \\textsc{cnot} gate errors below $10^{-4}$ for gate times shorter than 100 ns. Leveraging the locality of the nearest-neighbor coupling, we extrapolate our findings to longer fluxonium chains, suggesting a viable path toward scalable, low-error quantum information processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Conventional methods such as the Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction scale exponentially with molecular size, limiting their applicability to large molecules. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative by mapping molecular Hamiltonians by qubits, enabling cheaper computational scaling. Previous studies have shown that it is possible to formulate molecular ground state calculations as discrete optimization problems, addressable by quantum annealing. However, these efforts have been limited by previous generations of hardware and suboptimal annealing techniques. Here, the $H_{2}O$ ground-state problem is mapped to an Ising Hamiltonian using the Xian-Bias-Kas (XBK) method. By taking advantage of enhanced qubit connectivity and shorter embedding chains, it is solved with a more than doubled probability of achieving Hartree-Fock-level solutions with respect to the most advanced predecessor. Advanced annealing strategies extend Hartree-Fock-level accuracy to significantly larger problem instances, enabling solutions that use nearly 2.5 times more physically embedded qubits than the largest cases previously reported and allowing to improve annealing results by two orders of magnitude, reaching an energy difference of 0.120~Hartree relative to Hartree-Fock.
