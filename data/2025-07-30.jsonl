We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the\nexpected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial\ndifferences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not,\ncontrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can\nbe non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they\nadmit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies\nat low energies.

The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an\ninterpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing\n$a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to\nimprove network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter.\nWe then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical\nneural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such\nborderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We\nattribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between\nnearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity\nto physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical\nnoise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the\nneural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex\nquantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in\nstandard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove\nclassically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum\nadvantage."}

This behavior is\nwidely believed to extend to more general theories involving light scalar\nfields with weak non-derivative interactions. In such cases, secular growth is\nthought to be further amplified by loop corrections, and the stochastic\nformalism is often regarded as the appropriate framework to resum these\ninfrared effects. In this article we challenge this prevailing view. A crucial\ndistinction must be made between two cases: a massless scalar field protected\nby a shift symmetry, and a light scalar without such a symmetry. In the former,\nthe shift symmetry enforces derivative interactions, yielding observables in\nwhich secular growth plays no physical role. In the latter, although\ncorrelation functions develop infrared divergences in the massless limit, they\nremain fully invariant under the de Sitter isometry group. We analyze the\nstructure of these divergences arising from loop integrals and show that, in\nthe soft-momentum limit, they do not alter the time dependence of tree-level\ncorrelators. In fact, using a de Sitter-invariant renormalization scheme based\non Wilson's axioms for integration, these divergences can be systematically\nremoved order by order. We therefore conclude that neither massless nor light\nscalar fields in de Sitter space exhibit genuine secular growth. We further\ndiscuss the implications of these findings for the validity and scope of the\nstochastic approach to inflation."}

New electron\nscanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results from Hu et.al. (2023) show promise\nin detecting and identifying these excited states via the local density of\nstates (LDOS) spectrum. On a torus, there exists a mapping to a 1D lattice\nHamiltonian with center-of-mass or dipole moment conservation. In this work, we\napply perturbation theory starting from the thin cylinder limit ($L_x\n\\rightarrow \\infty, L_y <l_B$ for torus dimensions $L_x$ and $L_y$) to obtain\nan analytical approach to the low-lying neutral and charged excitations of the\n$\\nu =1/3$ FQHE state. Notably, in the thin cylinder we can systematically\nenumerate all the low-lying excitations by the patterns of 'dipoles' formed by\nthe electron occupation pattern on the 1D lattice. We find that the\nthin-cylinder limit predicts a significant dispersion of the low-lying neutral\nexcitations but sharpness of the LDOS spectra, which measure charged\nexcitations. We also discuss connections between our work and several different\napproaches to the FQHE STM spectra, including those using the composite fermion\ntheory. Numerical exact diagonalization beyond the thin-cylinder limit suggests\nthat the energies of charged excitations remain largely confined to a narrow\nrange of energies, which in experiments might appear as a single peak."}

Using this\ninterpretation, we exploit the Polyakov anomaly formula in Conformal Field\nTheory (CFT) and apply a simple renormalization procedure to define a quantity\ncorresponding to entanglement entropy within this geometric interpretation. We\nthen show that this quantity behaves like a CFT correlation function. This\nallows us to rigorously derive an entropy calculation of Cardy and Calabrese\n(arXiv:2501.19014).

In a search of the conditions of noisy evolution to be a useful\nresource for quantum computing, we study the relation of complete positivity\n(CP) with unitality, where we find that a map must be non-unital in order to be\nNCP, but not vice-versa. As memory effects can provide advantages in the\ndynamics of noisy quantum systems, we investigate the relative CP condition and\nthe CP-divisibility condition of the system and environment subsystems of a\njoint system-environment quantum state evolving noiselessly. We show that the\nsystem and environment channels must be both CP (NCP) or CP-divisible\n(CP-indivisible) for the evolution in the joint system-environment space to be\nunitary. We illustrate our results with examples of Bell state created from\n$|00\\rangle$, GHZ state created from $|000\\rangle$, W state created from\n$|100\\rangle$, and the partial transpose (PT) operation acting on the Bell\nstate."}

The method for garnering information about ($\\tau)$ is through\nmaximizing the Fisher information. In the absence of the axis-knowledge, the\noptimality of the metrological task reduces drastically.

Journal submission planned (PRA)", "summary": "We study the variational optimization of entangled probe states for quantum\nsensing tasks involving the estimation of a structured linear function of local\nphase parameters. Specifically, we consider scenarios where each qubit in a\nspin-1/2 array accumulates a phase phi_i = alpha_i * theta, with a known weight\nvector alpha, reducing the task to single-parameter estimation of theta. Using\nparameterized quantum circuits composed of dipolar-interacting gates and global\nrotations, we optimize probe states with respect to the Classical Fisher\nInformation (CFI) using a gradient-free evolutionary strategy. We benchmark the\noptimized circuits for two relevant cases: (i) uniform encoding, where all\nqubits contribute equally to the phase function, and (ii) a custom encoding\nwhere a central qubit dominates the weight vector. In both cases, the optimized\nprobe states approach the respective entanglement-enhanced (EE) limits dictated\nby the encoding structure.

In this paper, we make a\nsystematic analysis of lattice anomalies - the analog of 't Hooft anomalies in\nlattice systems - for which we give a precise definition. Crucially, a lattice\nanomaly is not a feature of a specific Hamiltonian, but rather is a topological\ninvariant of the symmetry action. The controlled setting of lattice systems\nallows for a systematic and rigorous treatment of lattice anomalies, shorn of\nthe technical challenges of QFT. We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the\nexpected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial\ndifferences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not,\ncontrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can\nbe non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they\nadmit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies\nat low energies. Nevertheless, we show that lattice anomalies (including\nIR-trivial ones) have a number of interesting consequences in their own right,\nincluding connections to commuting projector models, phases of many-body\nlocalized (MBL) systems, and quantum cellular automata (QCA). We make\nsubstantial progress on the classification of lattice anomalies and develop\nseveral theoretical tools to characterize their consequences on symmetric\nHamiltonians.

A linear potential gradient applied to the flat bands\ndrives the Stark localization, under which the Stark localized states may\nhybridize and leads to a new gap in the real space, dubbed the real space\nenergy gap (RSEG).
