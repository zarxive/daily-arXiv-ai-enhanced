In birds, quiet breathing operates at a resonance of the respiratory\nbiomechanics, but song, a behavior thought to be shaped by strong sexual\nselection, requires much higher breathing rates. Combining physiological\nrecordings with a nonlinear biomechanical model, we show in canaries (Serinus\ncanaria) that song production drives the system into a nonlinear regime that\nbroadens the frequency range of amplified responses. This enhancement\nencompasses all syllabic rates, with an average magnification of ~94% of the\ntheoretical maximum.

This model couples surface and bulk\nhydrodynamics, accommodates large shape deformations and incorporates a\ndiffusible contraction-generating molecule (myosin) that drives cortical flows.\nThese capabilities enable a systematic exploration of how mechanical cues\ndirect cell polarization and migration. We first demonstrate that spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking of cortical activity can lead to persistent and directed\nmovement in channels.

Here, using\nfirst-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we report a new\ntopological transition generated by HOI, which we term 'ferric transition', in\nsingle-layer MnSeTe. Surprisingly, skyrmion stability and collapse remain\nlargely unaffected by HOI due to the dominant role of DMI near the saddle\npoint, whereas the Bloch point is strongly modified, giving rise to this novel\ntransition. This mechanism is fundamentally distinct from the well-known radial\nand chimera transitions. Moreover, we predict that Janus MnSeTe exhibits\nremarkably high skyrmion energy barriers due to its strong DMI, among the\nhighest reported for intrinsic 2D magnets. Our findings unveil an unexpected\nrole of HOI in skyrmion topological transitions and establish Janus MnSeTe as a\nrobust platform for 2D skyrmionics."}

Under resonant excitation, several coherent modes are\ngenerated by external alternating fields, whose frequencies are tuned to\nresonance with some transition frequencies of the trapped system. A Bose system\nof trapped atoms with Bose-Einstein condensate can display two types of the\nJosephson effect, the standard one, when the system is separated into two or\nmore parts in different locations or when there are no any separation barriers,\nbut the system becomes nonuniform due to the coexistence of several coherent\nmodes interacting with each other, which is termed internal Josephson effect.\nThe mathematics in both these cases is similar. We concentrate on the internal\nJosephson effect. Systems with nonlinear coherent modes demonstrate rich\ndynamics, including Rabi oscillations, Josephson effect, and chaotic motion.\nUnder Josephson effect, there exist dynamic transitions that are similar to\nphase transitions in equilibrium systems. The bosonic Josephson effect is shown\nto be realizable not only for weakly interacting systems, but also in\nsuperfluids, with not necessarily weak interactions. Sufficiently strong\nnonresonant excitation can generate several types of nonequilibrium states\ncomprising vortex germs, vortex rings, vortex lines, vortex turbulence, droplet\nturbulence, and wave turbulence. Nonequilibrium states can be characterized and\ndistinguished by effective temperature, effective Fresnel number, and dynamic\nscaling laws."}

In this\nstudy, a novel excitation method, evaporative cryocooling, was introduced for\nmeasuring the thermal diffusivity of tested samples.

However, evaporative cryocooling cannot be considered a pulsed\nmethod due to its prolonged excitation duration. In general, it is difficult to\nmeasure thermal diffusivity based on non-impulsive pulsed excitation at times\ncommensurate with the pulse duration, often due to ill-defined pulse shape and\nwidth and the subsequent potentially complicated thermal response which may be\nsubject to diffusive broadening.

A deterministic property\nmeans that identical random perturbations at the inlet lead to identical\npatterns downstream; during this stage, the non-identical, stochastic component\ngrows and eventually dominates the flow further downstream. We argue that these\nproperties can be explained by exploring the concept of convective space-time\nchaos, where secondary perturbations on top of a chaotic state grow but move\naway in the laboratory reference frame. We illustrate this with two simple\nmodels of convective space-time chaos, one is a partial differential equation\ndescribing waves on a film flowing down a plate, and the other is a set of\nunidirectionally coupled ordinary differential equations. To prove convective\nspace-time chaos, we calculate the profiles of the convective Lyapunov\nexponent. The repeatability of the turbulent field in different identical\nexperimental runs corresponds to the reliability of stable dynamical systems in\nresponse to random forcing. The onset of the stochastic component is quantified\nwith the spatial Lyapunov exponent. We demonstrate how an effective\nrandomization of the field is observed when the driving is quasiperiodic.\nFurthermore, we discuss space-time duality, which links sensitivity to boundary\nconditions in the convective space-time chaos to the usual sensitivity to\ninitial conditions in a standard chaotic regime."}

While the symmetry groups of\ncompact attractors are well understood, the corresponding analysis for\nnon-compact basins and their boundaries has remained underdeveloped. We\nestablish a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating the hierarchical\ninclusion of a chain of symmetry groups, showing that boundary symmetries can\nstrictly exceed those of attractors and their basins. To determine admissible\nsymmetry groups of basin boundaries, we propose three complementary approaches:\n(i) thickening transfer, which connects admissibility results from compact\nattractors to basins; (ii) algebraic constraints, which exploit the closed\nnature of boundaries to impose structural restrictions; and (iii) connectivity\nand flow analysis, which analyzes how the system's dynamics permute states.\nNumerical experiments on the Thomas system confirm these theoretical results,\nillustrating that cyclic group actions permute basins while preserving their\ncommon boundary, whereas central inversion leaves both basins and boundaries\ninvariant.

This Thesis explores emergent cooperative phenomena in\ncollective light-matter systems. We study ensembles of interacting quantum\nemitters coherently driven by a laser field and coupled to photonic structures,\nfocusing on the hybrid description of emitters dressed by light. The interplay\namong quantum emitters, coherent driving, and photonic environments reveals a\nrich landscape of cooperative effects. While single-emitter dressing has been\nwidely studied, we address collective phenomena in two non-identical emitters\nmodelled as two-level systems. Strong interaction forms a dimer exhibiting\nsuperradiant and subradiant states, with two-photon resonances directly\nconnecting ground and doubly excited states. This nonlinear process, central to\nthe Thesis, enables new regimes of cooperative light-matter physics. Analytical\nstudies show how interactions reshape observables such as emission intensity,\nphoton statistics, and spectra, offering implications for quantum metrology.\nThe sensitivity of two-photon processes to emitter distance and driving\nstrength enables high-precision sensing and sub-wavelength imaging.\nUnexpectedly, we find that off-resonant virtual states may gain population\nthrough dissipation, redefining their role in open systems. To capture this, we\ndevelop a hierarchical adiabatic elimination method for metastable dynamics. We\nalso analyze entanglement in emitters coupled to a lossy cavity, identifying\nfive mechanisms, including the frequency-resolved Purcell effect introduced\nhere. This selective enhancement stabilizes cooperative states and enables\nscalable entanglement. Our models, tailored to solid-state platforms such as\nquantum dots and molecular aggregates, address challenges like inhomogeneous\nbroadening and decoherence, demonstrating the feasibility of harnessing\ncooperative light-matter effects for quantum technologies."}

Furthermore, we investigate the thermodynamics in the extended\nphase space, deriving the Hawking temperature, equation of state, Gibbs free\nenergy, and specific heat capacity, and establishing a consistent first law and\nSmarr relation with natural work terms for $\\alpha$ and $(\\rho_s, r_s)$. We\nfind that the interplay between the CoS and the DM halo produces quantitative\nand sometimes qualitative changes in both dynamical and thermodynamical\nproperties, including shifts of the Hawking--Page transition and heat-capacity\ndivergences, thus reshaping the phase structure of Schwarzschild--AdS BHs."}

Here, kernel- and neural network-based\napproaches for intramolecular degrees of freedom are combined with distributed\ncharge models for long range electrostatics to describe the interaction\nenergies of condensed phase systems. The main focus is on illustrative examples\nranging from pure liquids (dichloromethane, water) to chemically and\nstructurally heterogeneous systems (eutectic liquids, CO on amorphous solid\nwater), reactions (Menshutkin), and spectroscopy (triatomic probes for protein\ndynamics). For all examples, small to medium-sized clusters are used to\nrepresent and improve the total interaction energy compared with reference\nquantum chemical calculations. Although remarkable accuracy can be achieved for\nsome systems (chemical accuracy for dichloromethane and water), it is clear\nthat more realistic models are required for van der Waals contributions and\nimproved water models need to be used for more quantitative simulations of\nheterogeneous chemical and biological systems."}

We show that the vacuum expectation value of the vector field can drive\na de Sitter solution, for which the effects of the non-minimal coupling are\nnegligible at the background level but provide essential order-one corrections\nto the sound speed of the scalar mode, keeping the setup weakly coupled at the\nlevel of perturbations.

To theoretically tackle the diverse correlated\nand topological states emerging from moir\\'e superlattices, one usually adopts\nan effective low-energy continuum model based on which the electron-electron\neffects are further considered. However, the construction of an accurate\ncontinuum model remains a challenging task, particularly for complex moir\\'e\nsuperlattices such as twisted transition metal dichalcogenides. In this work,\nwe develop a formalism for constructing generic continuum models that are in\nprinciple applicable for arbitrary moir\\'e superlattices and are extrapolatable\nto any twist angles. Our key insight is that the microscopic electronic\nproperties are intrinsic properties of the system, which should remain\ninvariant across all twist angles; the lattice relaxations act as external\ninputs that vary with twist angles and are coupled with the electrons, and the\ncoupling coefficients are characterized by intrinsic parameters. This partition\nenables a universal description of the angle variation of the continuum model\nusing a single set of model parameters. To extract the model parameters, we\ndesign a numerical workflow based on data from first principles density\nfunctional theory calculations. We apply this framework to twisted bilayer\nMoTe$_{2}$, and obtain a single set of model parameters that accurately\nreproduce first-principles results, including electronic band structures,\ncharge density distributions and Chern numbers, at three different twist\nangles. Furthermore, the model extrapolates robustly to smaller twist angles.\nOur work not only provides a more precise understanding of the microscopic\nproperties of moir\\'e superlattices, but also lays a foundation for future\ntheoretical studies of low-energy electronic properties in generic moir\\'e\nsuperlattice systems."}

This Thesis explores emergent cooperative phenomena in\ncollective light-matter systems. We study ensembles of interacting quantum\nemitters coherently driven by a laser field and coupled to photonic structures,\nfocusing on the hybrid description of emitters dressed by light. The interplay\namong quantum emitters, coherent driving, and photonic environments reveals a\nrich landscape of cooperative effects. While single-emitter dressing has been\nwidely studied, we address collective phenomena in two non-identical emitters\nmodelled as two-level systems. Strong interaction forms a dimer exhibiting\nsuperradiant and subradiant states, with two-photon resonances directly\nconnecting ground and doubly excited states. This nonlinear process, central to\nthe Thesis, enables new regimes of cooperative light-matter physics. Analytical\nstudies show how interactions reshape observables such as emission intensity,\nphoton statistics, and spectra, offering implications for quantum metrology.\nThe sensitivity of two-photon processes to emitter distance and driving\nstrength enables high-precision sensing and sub-wavelength imaging.\nUnexpectedly, we find that off-resonant virtual states may gain population\nthrough dissipation, redefining their role in open systems. To capture this, we\ndevelop a hierarchical adiabatic elimination method for metastable dynamics. We\nalso analyze entanglement in emitters coupled to a lossy cavity, identifying\nfive mechanisms, including the frequency-resolved Purcell effect introduced\nhere.

Among various automated\nstrategies, Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains underexplored, particularly in\nQuantum Machine Learning contexts. This work introduces RL-QAS, a framework\nthat applies RL to discover effective circuit architectures for classification\ntasks. We evaluate RL-QAS using the Iris and binary MNIST datasets. The agent\nautonomously discovers low-complexity circuit designs that achieve high test\naccuracy. Our results show that RL is a viable approach for automated\narchitecture search in quantum machine learning. However, applying RL-QAS to\nmore complex tasks will require further refinement of the search strategy and\nperformance evaluation mechanisms."}

A qubit-based quantum\ncomputer, augmented with an active bosonic register, and with qubit, bosonic,\nand mixed qubit-boson quantum gates, offers a more powerful platform for\nsimulating bosonic theories. We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a\nhybrid analog-digital trapped-ion quantum computer, where qubits are encoded in\nthe internal states of the ions, and the bosons in the ions' motional states.\nSpecifically, we simulate nonequilibrium dynamics of a (1+1)-dimensional Yukawa\nmodel, a simplified model of interacting nucleons and pions, and measure\nfermion- and boson-occupation-state probabilities.

However, it has been\nstruggling with precise local operations due to relatively narrow lattice\nspacings. Here, we introduce a new quantum processor incorporating orbit-qubit\nencoding and internal states (as auxiliary degrees of freedom) to achieve\nspatially selective operations together with parallel control. With this\nprocessor, we generate one-dimensional and two-dimensional cluster states using\nminimal layers of controlled-Z gates. We experimentally detect the multipartite\nentanglement of a two-dimensional cluster state involving 123 orbit qubits\nthrough direct stabilizer measurements, verifying the full bipartite\nnon-separability. Furthermore, we demonstrate measurement-based quantum\ncomputation by implementing single-qubit and two-qubit logical gates,\nhighlighting the flexibility of orbit-qubit operations. Our results establish\norbit-qubit optical lattices as a scalable quantum processing architecture,\nopening new pathways for quantum computation applications."}

However, these\npulses dissipate heat, shifting spin-qubit frequencies and reducing gate\nfidelities. The cause of this pulse heating in quantum-dot devices is unknown.\nHere, we measure pulse heating using charged two-level fluctuators (TLFs) in\nSi/SiGe quantum dots. We find that the TLFs are susceptible to pulse heating.\nThe amount of heating depends on the pulse amplitude and frequency, but not on\nthe distance between the pulsed gates and the TLFs. The amount of heating also\ngenerally depends on the idling voltage of the pulsed gates, suggesting that\nelectrons accumulated under or near the gates contribute to the heating. We\nhypothesize that reducing the area of the gates with electrons nearby could\nmitigate the heating."}

Using one-dimensional and two-dimensional\nnon-Hermitian models, we establish a universal link between nonlinear dynamics\nand the QGT, thereby connecting quantum state geometry to observable transport\nphenomena. Crucially, our analysis indicates that the wavepacket width\nsignificantly affects non-Hermitian transport -- a feature absent in Hermitian\nsystems.

Introducing a twist angle or\nlattice mismatch between layers creates a periodic moir\\'e potential that\nsignificantly reshapes the energy landscape and introduces a high-dimensional\ncomplexity absent in aligned bilayers. Recent experimental advances have\nenabled direct observation and control of interlayer excitons in such\nmoir\\'e-patterned systems, yet a microscopic theoretical framework capturing\nboth their thermalization and spatiotemporal dynamics remains lacking.

Surprisingly, we reveal that flat bands, which typically trap\nexcitons, can significantly enhance exciton propagation. This counterintuitive\nbehavior emerges from the interplay between the flat-band structure giving rise\nto a bottleneck effect for exciton relaxation and thermal occupation dynamics\ncreating hot excitons.
