In birds, quiet breathing operates at a resonance of the respiratory\nbiomechanics, but song, a behavior thought to be shaped by strong sexual\nselection, requires much higher breathing rates. Combining physiological\nrecordings with a nonlinear biomechanical model, we show in canaries (Serinus\ncanaria) that song production drives the system into a nonlinear regime that\nbroadens the frequency range of amplified responses.

In particular, the effect of higher-order\nexchange interactions (HOI) on these phenomena is unknown. Here, using\nfirst-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we report a new\ntopological transition generated by HOI, which we term 'ferric transition', in\nsingle-layer MnSeTe. Surprisingly, skyrmion stability and collapse remain\nlargely unaffected by HOI due to the dominant role of DMI near the saddle\npoint, whereas the Bloch point is strongly modified, giving rise to this novel\ntransition. This mechanism is fundamentally distinct from the well-known radial\nand chimera transitions. Moreover, we predict that Janus MnSeTe exhibits\nremarkably high skyrmion energy barriers due to its strong DMI, among the\nhighest reported for intrinsic 2D magnets.

Under resonant excitation, several coherent modes are\ngenerated by external alternating fields, whose frequencies are tuned to\nresonance with some transition frequencies of the trapped system. A Bose system\nof trapped atoms with Bose-Einstein condensate can display two types of the\nJosephson effect, the standard one, when the system is separated into two or\nmore parts in different locations or when there are no any separation barriers,\nbut the system becomes nonuniform due to the coexistence of several coherent\nmodes interacting with each other, which is termed internal Josephson effect.\nThe mathematics in both these cases is similar. We concentrate on the internal\nJosephson effect. Systems with nonlinear coherent modes demonstrate rich\ndynamics, including Rabi oscillations, Josephson effect, and chaotic motion.\nUnder Josephson effect, there exist dynamic transitions that are similar to\nphase transitions in equilibrium systems. The bosonic Josephson effect is shown\nto be realizable not only for weakly interacting systems, but also in\nsuperfluids, with not necessarily weak interactions. Sufficiently strong\nnonresonant excitation can generate several types of nonequilibrium states\ncomprising vortex germs, vortex rings, vortex lines, vortex turbulence, droplet\nturbulence, and wave turbulence. Nonequilibrium states can be characterized and\ndistinguished by effective temperature, effective Fresnel number, and dynamic\nscaling laws."}

In this\nstudy, a novel excitation method, evaporative cryocooling, was introduced for\nmeasuring the thermal diffusivity of tested samples. Compared to conventional\nexcitation modalities, evaporative cryocooling excitation is compact, portable,\nand low cost. However, evaporative cryocooling cannot be considered a pulsed\nmethod due to its prolonged excitation duration. In general, it is difficult to\nmeasure thermal diffusivity based on non-impulsive pulsed excitation at times\ncommensurate with the pulse duration, often due to ill-defined pulse shape and\nwidth and the subsequent potentially complicated thermal response which may be\nsubject to diffusive broadening.

A deterministic property\nmeans that identical random perturbations at the inlet lead to identical\npatterns downstream; during this stage, the non-identical, stochastic component\ngrows and eventually dominates the flow further downstream. We argue that these\nproperties can be explained by exploring the concept of convective space-time\nchaos, where secondary perturbations on top of a chaotic state grow but move\naway in the laboratory reference frame. We illustrate this with two simple\nmodels of convective space-time chaos, one is a partial differential equation\ndescribing waves on a film flowing down a plate, and the other is a set of\nunidirectionally coupled ordinary differential equations. To prove convective\nspace-time chaos, we calculate the profiles of the convective Lyapunov\nexponent. The repeatability of the turbulent field in different identical\nexperimental runs corresponds to the reliability of stable dynamical systems in\nresponse to random forcing. The onset of the stochastic component is quantified\nwith the spatial Lyapunov exponent. We demonstrate how an effective\nrandomization of the field is observed when the driving is quasiperiodic.\nFurthermore, we discuss space-time duality, which links sensitivity to boundary\nconditions in the convective space-time chaos to the usual sensitivity to\ninitial conditions in a standard chaotic regime."}

While the symmetry groups of\ncompact attractors are well understood, the corresponding analysis for\nnon-compact basins and their boundaries has remained underdeveloped. We\nestablish a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating the hierarchical\ninclusion of a chain of symmetry groups, showing that boundary symmetries can\nstrictly exceed those of attractors and their basins. To determine admissible\nsymmetry groups of basin boundaries, we propose three complementary approaches:\n(i) thickening transfer, which connects admissibility results from compact\nattractors to basins; (ii) algebraic constraints, which exploit the closed\nnature of boundaries to impose structural restrictions; and (iii) connectivity\nand flow analysis, which analyzes how the system's dynamics permute states.\nNumerical experiments on the Thomas system confirm these theoretical results,\nillustrating that cyclic group actions permute basins while preserving their\ncommon boundary, whereas central inversion leaves both basins and boundaries\ninvariant.

This Thesis explores emergent cooperative phenomena in\ncollective light-matter systems. We study ensembles of interacting quantum\nemitters coherently driven by a laser field and coupled to photonic structures,\nfocusing on the hybrid description of emitters dressed by light. The interplay\namong quantum emitters, coherent driving, and photonic environments reveals a\nrich landscape of cooperative effects. While single-emitter dressing has been\nwidely studied, we address collective phenomena in two non-identical emitters\nmodelled as two-level systems. Strong interaction forms a dimer exhibiting\nsuperradiant and subradiant states, with two-photon resonances directly\nconnecting ground and doubly excited states. This nonlinear process, central to\nthe Thesis, enables new regimes of cooperative light-matter physics. Analytical\nstudies show how interactions reshape observables such as emission intensity,\nphoton statistics, and spectra, offering implications for quantum metrology.\nThe sensitivity of two-photon processes to emitter distance and driving\nstrength enables high-precision sensing and sub-wavelength imaging.\nUnexpectedly, we find that off-resonant virtual states may gain population\nthrough dissipation, redefining their role in open systems. To capture this, we\ndevelop a hierarchical adiabatic elimination method for metastable dynamics. We\nalso analyze entanglement in emitters coupled to a lossy cavity, identifying\nfive mechanisms, including the frequency-resolved Purcell effect introduced\nhere. This selective enhancement stabilizes cooperative states and enables\nscalable entanglement. Our models, tailored to solid-state platforms such as\nquantum dots and molecular aggregates, address challenges like inhomogeneous\nbroadening and decoherence, demonstrating the feasibility of harnessing\ncooperative light-matter effects for quantum technologies."}

We use a\nquantitative approach by studying in detail the phase space of a combined\n$F(R,\\phi)$ cosmological system, focusing on the de Sitter and power-law\nsubspaces of the total phase space. As we show, the de Sitter subspace of the\n$F(R,\\phi)$ system shares the same fixed points as the vacuum $F(R)$ gravity\nsystem and the trajectories in the phase space tend to these fixed points.\nHowever, the power-law subspace is not stable and cannot be realized by the\ncombined $F(R,\\phi)$ system. To this end, we propose a well-motivated\nphenomenological $F(R)$ gravity model for which the $R^2$ term is switched off\nbelow a critical curvature near the end of the $R^2$ slow-roll inflationary\nera, and below that critical curvature, only the Einstein-Hilbert gravity term\nand the scalar field remain in the effective inflationary Lagrangian.

However, the construction of an accurate\ncontinuum model remains a challenging task, particularly for complex moir\\'e\nsuperlattices such as twisted transition metal dichalcogenides. In this work,\nwe develop a formalism for constructing generic continuum models that are in\nprinciple applicable for arbitrary moir\\'e superlattices and are extrapolatable\nto any twist angles. Our key insight is that the microscopic electronic\nproperties are intrinsic properties of the system, which should remain\ninvariant across all twist angles; the lattice relaxations act as external\ninputs that vary with twist angles and are coupled with the electrons, and the\ncoupling coefficients are characterized by intrinsic parameters. This partition\nenables a universal description of the angle variation of the continuum model\nusing a single set of model parameters. To extract the model parameters, we\ndesign a numerical workflow based on data from first principles density\nfunctional theory calculations. We apply this framework to twisted bilayer\nMoTe$_{2}$, and obtain a single set of model parameters that accurately\nreproduce first-principles results, including electronic band structures,\ncharge density distributions and Chern numbers, at three different twist\nangles.

While single-emitter dressing has been\nwidely studied, we address collective phenomena in two non-identical emitters\nmodelled as two-level systems. Strong interaction forms a dimer exhibiting\nsuperradiant and subradiant states, with two-photon resonances directly\nconnecting ground and doubly excited states.

Here, we present a\ncomprehensive three-dimensional study of gate-defined quantum dot hole spin\nqubits in strained Si$_{0.2}$Ge$_{0.8}$/Ge heterostructures. In contrast to\nprior work relying on idealized confinement or decoupled Poisson-Schr\\\"odinger\ntreatments, our approach combines self-consistent electrostatics with a\nfour-band Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian to resolve spin-orbit interactions,\nwavefunction asymmetries, and g-tensor anisotropies in realistic device\nstructures. We quantify the impact of device size and gate bias on wavefunction\nlocalization, electric-field-induced g-factor modulation, and identify \"sweet\nspots\" in vertical electric field where g-factor sensitivity to charge noise is\nminimized, enhancing spin dephasing times. Spin relaxation due to phonon\ncoupling is also modeled, revealing size-dependent T1 behavior consistent with\nstrong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic-field scaling near\n$B^{-8}$. This work establishes a predictive modeling framework for optimizing\nspin coherence in planar Ge quantum dots and provides quantitative design\nguidance for scalable, electrically controlled hole spin qubits in group-IV\nsemiconductors."}
