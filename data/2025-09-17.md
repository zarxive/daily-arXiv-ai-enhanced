### [1] [Entanglement Suppression in Quantum Field Theories: Holography, Chaos, and Mixed-State Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12260)
*Davood Momeni*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Entanglement entropy growth in CFTs can be suppressed by local operator quenches interacting with mixed-state excitations, linked to black hole scattering in AdS. This opens up five research directions: higher dimensions, quantum chaos via OTOCs, absence of suppression in integrable models, entanglement negativity, and geometric interpretation in AdS scattering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the suppression of entanglement entropy in quantum field theories (especially CFTs) and its connection to black hole physics and quantum chaos is a key area of modern theoretical physics. This phenomenon offers rich avenues for exploring the interplay between holography, non-equilibrium dynamics, and quantum information theory.

Method: The paper proposes five interconnected research directions based on the phenomenon of entanglement suppression. Each direction builds on the initial observation and explores its implications in different contexts, contributing to a broader understanding of the phenomenon's mechanisms and applications.

Result: The paper contributes a new phenomenon (entanglement suppression) and provides a holographic dual interpretation in terms of black hole scattering. It also outlines five promising research directions, each with its own potential for advancing our knowledge in holography, quantum chaos, integrable models, and quantum information theory.

Conclusion: This work opens up a new avenue for research in quantum gravity, quantum field theory, and quantum information science. The proposed directions are expected to shed light on the relationship between holography, non-equilibrium dynamics, and quantum chaos, while also advancing our understanding of entanglement properties in quantum systems.

Abstract: Recent work has revealed that entanglement entropy growth in conformal field
theories (CFTs) can be suppressed when a local operator quench interacts with a
mixed-state excitation, providing a dual interpretation in terms of black hole
scattering in AdS. This phenomenon, termed \emph{entanglement suppression},
opens several promising directions for exploration. In this proposal, I outline
five distinct yet interconnected research trajectories: generalization to
higher dimensions, the role of quantum chaos via out-of-time-order correlators
(OTOCs), the absence of suppression in integrable models, the extension to
entanglement negativity as a probe of mixedness, and a geometric interpretation
based on scattering cross sections in AdS. Each direction offers new insights
into the interplay between holography, non-equilibrium dynamics, and quantum
information.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨量子测量问题，通过量子系统、环境和观察者构建完全量子化的宇宙，得出观察者可以出现客观的经典测量结果，挑战测量假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨量子测量问题，试图从理论角度解决量子力学中的核心挑战。

Result: 得出结论，完全量子化的宇宙中可以出现观察者的客观经典测量结果，挑战测量假设。

Conclusion: 量子测量问题的解决可以通过构建没有测量假设的完全量子模型实现。

Abstract: The quantum measurement problem, the unresolved conflict between the unitary
evolution of the wave function and the postulate of wave function collapse,
remains the most profound conceptual challenge in quantum foundations. While
environment-induced decoherence provides a compelling practical mechanism for
the appearance of collapse, it does not resolve the fundamental issue of the
observer's own quantum state. This work moves beyond philosophical discourse by
introducing a novel computational framework to simulate a fully unitary
universe comprising a quantum system (Q), a decohering environment (E), and a
model physical observer (O). We strictly forbid the collapse axiom. Our
simulations investigate whether a definite, classical measurement outcome can
emerge objectively within O's state. The results demonstrate that objective
classicality can emerge from unitary dynamics, challenging the necessity of the
measurement postulate and providing a computational pathway toward resolving
the quantum measurement problem.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过分布式量子传感器网络估计全局参数并保护局部编码值的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算和量子通信技术的发展，如何在分布式量子网络中实现数据的有效传输和参数的估计成为了研究的热点。保护局域信息的同时，准确估计全局参数具有重要的理论和应用价值。

Method: 本论文在连续变量子子状态的框架下研究了分布式量子网络的估计问题，提出了一种 multipartite 网络模型，通过共享高冗余的纠缠态实现了Heisenberg尺度的精度。

Result: 实验表明，在有限冗余状态下，虽然完全隐私的条件无法满足，但可以通过调节冗余度在某种程度上接近隐私边界。并且，在有位移和光学损耗的情况下，比较了不同连续变量子子资源的状态，结果显示所提出的协议具有较好的性能。

Conclusion: 通过多光子纠缠态的优势，分布式量子网络的估计精度得到了显著提升。尽管 socialist 在有限资源条件下无法完全实现隐私，但通过控制冗余度可以在某种程度上接近隐私边界。此外，对比了不同的连续变量子子资源的状态，证明了该协议的有效性和优势。

Abstract: Can a distributed network of quantum sensors estimate a global parameter
while protecting every locally encoded value? We answer this question
affirmatively by introducing and analysing a protocol for distributed quantum
sensing in the continuous-variable regime. We consider a multipartite network
in which each node encodes a local phase into a shared entangled Gaussian
state. We show that the average phase can be estimated with high precision,
exhibiting Heisenberg scaling in the total photon number, while individual
phases are inaccessible. Although complete privacy - where all other
combinations of phases remain entirely hidden - is unattainable for finite
squeezing in multi-party settings, it emerges in the large-squeezing limit. We
further investigate the impact of displacements and optical losses, revealing
trade-offs between estimation accuracy and privacy. Finally, we benchmark the
protocol against other continuous-variable resource states.

Abstract: We give a simple, fully correct, and assumption-light replacement for the
contested "domain-extension" in Step 9 of a recent windowed-QFT lattice
algorithm with complex-Gaussian windows~\citep{chen2024quantum}. The published
Step~9 suffers from a periodicity/support mismatch. We present a pair-shift
difference construction that coherently cancels all unknown offsets, produces
an exact uniform CRT-coset state over $\mathbb{Z}_{P}$, and then uses the QFT
to enforce the intended modular linear relation. The unitary is reversible,
uses $\mathrm{poly}(\log M_2)$ gates, and preserves the algorithm's
asymptotics. Project Page: https://github.com/yifanzhang-pro/quantum-lattice.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) are powerful variational ans\"atze capable of
representing highly entangled quantum many-body wavefunctions. While the
average entanglement properties of ensembles of restricted Boltzmann machines
are well understood, the entanglement structure of autoregressive NQS such as
recurrent neural networks and transformers remains largely unexplored. We
perform large-scale simulations of ensembles of random autoregressive
wavefunctions for chains of up to $256$ spins and uncover signatures of
transitions in their average entanglement scaling, entanglement spectra, and
correlation functions. We show that the standard softmax normalization of the
wavefunction suppresses entanglement and fluctuations, and introduce a square
modulus normalization function that restores them. Finally, we connect the
insights gained from our entanglement and activation function analysis to
initialization strategies for finding the ground states of strongly correlated
Hamiltonians via variational Monte Carlo.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Entanglement purification protocols (EPPs) are essential for generating
high-fidelity entangled states in noisy quantum systems, enabling robust
quantum networking and computation. Building on the circuit of the foundational
recurrence protocol, we generalize two-way EPPs to arbitrary stabilizer codes.
Through analytical derivations and noisy circuit simulations incorporating
circuit-level noise, we demonstrate enhanced purification performance, with
fidelity improvements and finite distillation rates for distillable input
states. We propose efficient circuit designs for EPPs tailored to dual-species
Rydberg atom arrays, leveraging species-specific laser control and interspecies
Rydberg interactions. Introducing a low-overhead operation set, the
dual-species atom convenient operation set, we facilitate straightforward
compilation of EPP circuits without the need for ancillary atoms or complex
atom rearrangements. Our framework provides practical guidance for near-term
implementations on dual-species platforms, advancing towards scalable
entanglement distribution in neutral atom systems and paving the way for
fault-tolerant quantum technologies.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are gaining increasing interest due to their
potential to detect complex patterns in data by leveraging uniquely quantum
phenomena. This makes them particularly promising for biomedical applications.
In these applications and in other contexts, increasing statistical power often
requires aggregating data from multiple participants. However, sharing data,
especially sensitive information like personal genomic sequences, raises
significant privacy concerns. Quantum federated learning offers a way to
collaboratively train QNN models without exposing private data. However, it
faces major limitations, including high communication overhead and the need to
retrain models when the task is modified. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a privacy-preserving QNN training scheme that utilizes mixed quantum
states to encode ensembles of data. This approach allows for the secure sharing
of statistical information while safeguarding individual data points. QNNs can
be trained directly on these mixed states, eliminating the need to access raw
data. Building on this foundation, we introduce protocols supporting
multi-party collaborative QNN training applicable across diverse domains. Our
approach enables secure QNN training with only a single round of communication
per participant, provides high training speed and offers task generality, i.e.,
new analyses can be conducted without reacquiring information from
participants. We present the theoretical foundation of our scheme's utility and
privacy protections, which prevent the recovery of individual data points and
resist membership inference attacks as measured by differential privacy. We
then validate its effectiveness on three different datasets with a focus on
genomic studies with an indication of how it can used in other domains without
adaptation.

Abstract: Encoding a qubit in a larger Hilbert space of an oscillator is an efficient
way to protect its quantum information against decoherence. Promising examples
of such bosonic encodings are the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. In
this work, we investigate how redefining the stabilizer group of the GKP codes
to include all operations with trivial action on the code space can contribute
to the search for an optimal implementation of a logical circuit when it is
affected by noise. We find the generators of the Gaussian stabilizer group,
allowing us to search for different physical implementations of a Clifford
operation. We then propose an algorithm that finds the optimal implementation
of a given logical Clifford circuit on GKP codes, such that the state is less
affected by loss errors during the computation. Finally, we demonstrate
numerically, with logical randomized benchmarking, that such a compiler can
increase the lifetime of square-GKP qubits while running Clifford circuits,
compared to a random walk compiler.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce the Cyclic Variational Quantum Eigensolver (CVQE), a
hardware-efficient framework for accurate ground-state quantum simulation on
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. CVQE departs from conventional
VQE by incorporating a measurement-driven feedback cycle: Slater determinants
with significant sampling probability are iteratively added to the reference
superposition, while a fixed entangler (e.g., single-layer UCCSD) is reused
throughout. This adaptive reference growth systematically enlarges the
variational space in most promising directions, avoiding manual ansatz or
operator-pool design, costly searches, and preserving compile-once circuits.
The strategy parallels multi-reference methods in quantum chemistry, while
remaining fully automated on quantum hardware. Remarkably, CVQE exhibits a
distinctive staircase-like descent pattern, where successive energy drops
sharply signal efficient escape from barren plateaus. Benchmarks show that CVQE
consistently maintains chemical precision across correlation regimes,
outperforms fixed UCCSD by several orders of magnitude, and achieves favorable
accuracy-cost trade-offs compared to the Selected Configuration Interaction.
These results position CVQE as a scalable, interpretable, and
resource-efficient paradigm for near-term quantum simulation.

*Søren Smidstrup,Shela Aboud,Ricardo Borges,Anders Blom,Pankaj Aggarwal,Robert Freeman,Jamil Kawa*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the application of the QuantumATK tool, which combines DFT with non-equilibrium Green's functions and machine-learned force-fields, for simulating superconducting qubits and quantum sensors. They explore how many-body physics, especially electron-electron interactions, can enhance the accuracy of these simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for accurate modeling of quantum devices to advance quantum computing and sensing technologies.

Method: The authors use QuantumATK to combine DFT, non-equilibrium Green's functions, and machine-learned force-fields to model quantum sensors and qubits. They specifically examine the integration of many-body physics to simulate electron interactions.

Result: The paper successfully demonstrates that including many-body physics improves the simulation of superconducting qubits and sensors, moving beyond single-particle models.

Conclusion: QuantumATK provides a powerful framework for modeling quantum devices, particularly in capturing complex quantum phenomena through advanced theoretical methods.

Abstract: Materials engineering using atomistic modeling is an essential tool for the
development of qubits and quantum sensors. Traditional density-functional
theory (DFT) does however not adequately capture the complete physics involved,
including key aspects and dynamics of superconductivity, surface states, etc.
There are also significant challenges regarding the system sizes that can be
simulated, not least for thermal properties which are key in quantum-computing
applications. The QuantumATK tool combines DFT, based on LCAO basis sets, with
non-equilibrium Green's functions, to compute the characteristics of interfaces
between superconductors and insulators, as well as the surface states of
topological insulators. Additionally, the software leverages machine-learned
force-fields to simulate thermal properties and to generate realistic amorphous
geometries in large-scale systems. Finally, the description of superconducting
qubits and sensors as two-level systems modeled with a double-well potential
requires many-body physics, and this paper demonstrates how electron-electron
interaction can be added to the single-particle energy levels from an atomistic
tight-binding model to describe a realistic double-quantum dot system.

quantum entropy source, which is achieved via hybrid photonic integration with
a SiO2 waveguide, generates raw quantum random numbers. The hybrid photonic and

system-in-package technology. A microcontroller unit acquires the raw data and
outputs the processed quantum random numbers via a serial peripheral interface.
According to the characterization results, the QRNG chip achieves a constant
real-time output rate of 5.2 Mbps across the industrial temperature range of
-40{\deg}C to 85{\deg}C, making it suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Cluster states are multipartite entangled states that are maximally connected
and resilient to decoherence, making them valuable resources for quantum
information processing. Continuous-variable (CV) cluster states have been
extensively investigated for such applications. Here we present a pulsed
protocol for generating CV cluster states in a phononic quantum network
composed of phonon waveguides, mechanical resonators, and optical cavities. A
key feature of this architecture is the modular design, where pairs of
mechanical modes act as building blocks with only local, tunable interactions
between mechanical and cavity modes. The scheme is scalable, requiring just
$4N$ driving tones for $N$ mechanical resonators. We characterize the resulting
cluster states by evaluating the nullifiers of the CV modes. We also study the
effects of dissipation, showing that strong squeezing with large phonon
occupations can degrade the generated cluster states under finite mechanical
and optical losses. As a direct application, we demonstrate that distant
mechanical modes can be entangled via local measurements.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum metrology, an emerging field at the intersection of
quantum estimation and non-Hermitian physics, holds promise for revolutionizing
precision measurement. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of
non-Hermitian quantum parameter estimation in the quantum regime, with a
special focus on achieving Heisenberg scaling. We introduce a concise
expression for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) that applies to general
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, enabling the analysis of estimation precision in
these systems. Our findings unveil the remarkable potential of non-Hermitian
systems to attain the Heisenberg scaling of $1/t$, where $t$ represents time.
Moreover, we derive optimal measurement conditions based on the proposed QFI
expression, demonstrating the attainment of the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound.
By constructing non-unitary evolutions governed by two non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians, one with parity-time symmetry and the other without specific
symmetries, we experimentally validate our theoretical analysis. The
experimental results affirm the realization of Heisenberg scaling in estimation
precision, marking a substantial milestone in non-Hermitian quantum metrology.

Conclusion: 研究强调了RNOs在量子信息处理中的关键作用，包括资源转换和消散问题的解决，为量子通信和计算提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We investigate resource nongenerating operations (RNOs) in both static and
dynamical quantum resource theories. For the static scenarios, we derive a
sufficient condition for state transformations under RNOs. Then we construct a
dynamical resource theory where RNOs constitute the set of free operations, and
we propose an axiomatic approach to quantify quantum channels. We further
analyze the erasure of the dynamical resources. As applications, we establish
bounds on the asymptotic cost of states under RNOs in a generic convex resource
theory and obtain capacity bounds for communication tasks assisted by dynamical
coherence. Our results clarify the key roles of RNOs in quantum information
processing tasks.

Abstract: Perturbation theories provide valuable insights on quantum many-body systems.
Systems of interacting particles, like electrons, are often treated
perturbatively around exactly solvable Gaussian points. Systems of interacting
qubits have gained increasing prominence as another class of models for quantum
systems thanks to the recent advances in experimentally realizing mesoscopic
quantum devices. Stabilizer states, innately defined on systems of qudits, have
correspondingly emerged as another class of classically simulatable starting
point for the study of quantum error-correcting codes and topological phases of
matter in such devices. As a step towards analyzing more general quantum
many-body problems on these platforms, we develop a systematic stabilizer
perturbation theory in qubit systems. Our approach relies on the local
Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, which we show can be efficiently performed
through the binary encoding the Pauli algebra. As demonstrations, we first
benchmark the stabilizer perturbation theory on the transverse field Ising
chain in one dimension. The method is then further applied to $\mathbb{Z}_2$
toric code on square lattice and kagome lattice to probe the tendency toward
confinement for anyonic excitations.

Conclusion: This work offers a fresh perspective on deriving the Landau-Zener formula, highlighting the importance of integrability concepts in quantum systems analysis.

Abstract: The Landau-Zener formula describes the diabatic transition probability of a
two-level system under linear driving. Its rigorous derivation typically relies
on sophisticated mathematical tools, such as special functions, Laplace
transforms, or contour integrals. In this work, we present a derivation of the
Landau-Zener transition probability using a fundamentally different approach
via functional equations. By leveraging integrability, we prove that this
transition probability satisfies a functional equation, whose solutions
establish the exponential form of the formula. The coefficient in the exponent
is then determined through a lowest-order perturbation calculation. This
derivation is rigorous and does not involve any sophisticated mathematics. Our
work provides insights into the origin of the exponential form of the
Landau-Zener transition probability, and shows that the Landau-Zener formula
can be viewed as a consequence of integrability, though the two-level
Landau-Zener Hamiltonian itself does not satisfy the integrability conditions.

Abstract: The Nonequilibrium Fermi's Golden Rule (NE-FGR) provides a convenient
theoretical framework for calculating the charge transfer rate between a
photoexcited bright donor electronic state and a dark acceptor electronic
state, when the nuclear degrees of freedom start out in a nonequilibrium
initial state. In this paper, we show that NE-FGR rates can be significantly
modified by placing the molecular system inside an electromagnetic microcavity,
even when the coupling with the cavity modes is weak. In this case,
cavity-modified NE-FGR rates can also be estimated from the same inputs needed
for calculating the cavity-free NE-FGR rates, thereby bypassing the need for an
explicit simulation of the molecular system inside the cavity. We also
introduce an approximate limit of the cavity-modified NE-FGR, which we denote
cavity-modified Instantaneous Marcus Theory, since it is based on the same
assumptions underlying Marcus theory. The utility of the proposed framework for
calculating cavity-modified NE-FGR rates is demonstrated by applications to
photo-induced charge transfer in the carotenoid-porphyrin-C$_{60}$ molecular
triad dissolved in liquid tetrahydrofuran and the Garg-Onuchic-Ambegaokar model
for charge transfer in the condensed phase.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present EmuPlat, a framework-agnostic quantum hardware emulation platform
that addresses the interoperability gap between high-level quantum programming
frameworks and hardware-specific pulse control systems. Unlike existing
solutions that operate within isolated software stacks, EmuPlat provides a
unified infrastructure enabling seamless integration across diverse quantum
computing ecosystems, including CUDA-Q, Qiskit, and Qibolab. The platform
implements a complete transpiler-compiler pipeline that systematically
transforms abstract quantum circuits through four validated stages: (1)
recursive gate decomposition to a minimal native set
$\mathcal{G}_{\text{native}} = \{I, Z, RZ(\theta), \text{GPI2}(\phi), CZ, M\}$,
(2) virtual Z optimization implementing phase tracking without physical pulses,
(3) connectivity-aware routing with automated SWAP insertion, and (4)
deterministic pulse compilation respecting hardware timing constraints. Our
modular architecture, based on clean architecture principles with a novel
adapter pattern, supports extensible integration of multiple quantum dynamics
simulation engines while maintaining consistent interfaces. We demonstrate
EmuPlat's capabilities through comprehensive benchmarks on superconducting
transmon architectures: Bell state preparation achieves 99.958\% fidelity with
hardware-calibrated noise models, while 4-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform
implementations successfully demonstrate scalable circuit execution. The
platform's production-ready implementation, validated through end-to-end
testing with TransformationValidator, establishes EmuPlat as essential
infrastructure for accelerating hybrid quantum-classical algorithm development
and hardware-software co-design.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Investigates the role of stochastic system-bath couplings in shaping non-Markovian behavior in open quantum systems, revealing how memory effects manifest through reduced dynamics and the interplay between system-environment interaction and environmental memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding non-Markovian dynamics is vital for advancing quantum information processing, metrology, and communication technologies. This study aims to elucidate the factors influencing non-Markovian behavior, particularly in open quantum systems.

Method: The study employs the central spin model within a time-convolutionless master equation framework to model and analyze the system-bath interactions and their impact on non-Markovian behavior.

Result: The dynamics are influenced by both the environment's intrinsic memory and the system-environment interaction structure. QFI flow may fail to detect memory effects under weak coupling and near-resonance, while the BLP measure succeeds. Modulation of the interaction kernel leads to complex revivals of non-Markovianity.

Conclusion: These findings enhance our understanding of non-Markovian dynamics, highlight the limitations of single-witness approaches, and suggest that stochasticity and modulation can be utilized to create robust quantum technologies.

Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics is central to quantum information processing, as
memory effects strongly influence coherence preservation, metrology, and
communication. In this work, we investigate the role of stochastic system--bath
couplings in shaping non-Markovian behavior of open quantum systems, using the
central spin model within a time-convolutionless master equation framework. We
show that the character of the reduced dynamics depends jointly on the
intrinsic memory of the environment and on the structure of the
system--environment interaction. In certain regimes, the dynamics simplify to
pure dephasing, while in general both amplitude damping and dephasing
contribute to the evolution. By employing two complementary measures: the
Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) flow and the Breuer--Laine--Piilo (BLP)
measure, we demonstrate that QFI flow may fail to witness memory effects in
weak-coupling and near-resonant regimes, whereas the BLP measure still detects
information backflow. Furthermore, external modulation of the interaction
kernel produces qualitatively richer behavior, including irregular and
frequency-dependent revivals of non-Markovianity. These results clarify the
physical origin of memory effects, highlight the limitations of single-witness
approaches, and suggest that stochasticity and modulation can be harnessed to
engineer robust, noise-resilient quantum technologies.

Conclusion: 该研究表明，深度为O(log n)的量子电路可以通过少量样本实现高精度量子态估计，为量子计算的实际应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is one of the fundamental problems in quantum
information. Among various metrics, sample complexity is widely used to
evaluate QST algorithms. While multi-copy measurements are known to achieve
optimal sample complexity, they are challenging to implement on near-term
quantum devices. In practice, single-copy measurements with shallow-depth
circuits are more feasible. Although a near-optimal QST algorithm under
single-qubit measurements has recently been proposed, its sample complexity
does not match the known lower bound for single-copy measurements. Here, we
make two contributions by employing circuits with depth $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$
on an $n$-qubit system. First, QST for rank-$r$ $d$-dimensional state $\rho$
can be achieved with sample complexity $\mathcal{O}\!\left(\tfrac{dr^2 \ln
d}{\epsilon^2}\right)$ to error $\epsilon$ in trace distance, which is
near-optimal up to a $\ln d$ factor compared to the known lower bound
$\Omega\left(\frac{dr^2}{\epsilon^2}\right)$. Second, for the general case of
$r = d$, we can remove the $\ln d$ factor, yielding an optimal sample
complexity of $\mathcal{O}\!\left(\frac{d^3}{\epsilon^2}\right)$.

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating open quantum systems coupled to
Gaussian environments valid for any configuration and coupling strength. The
algorithm is for instance applicable to problems with strongly coupled, or
non-Markovian, environments; problems with multiple environments out of mutual
equilibrium; and problems with time-dependent Hamiltonians. We show that the
algorithm can reproduce the true dynamics of such problems at arbitrary
accuracy and, for a broad range of problems, only adds a minor resource cost
relative to Trotterized time evolution; the cost is polynomial in the inverse
target accuracy. The algorithm is based on the insight that any Gaussian
environment can be represented as a train of ancillary qubits that sequentially
interact with the system through a time-local coupling, given by the
convolution square root of the bath correlation function; this is a secondary
result of our work. Our results open up new applications of quantum computers
for efficient simulation of non-equilibrium and open quantum systems.

Abstract: Floquet modulations often yield effective Hamiltonians not easily accessible
in traditional time-dependent systems, which brings opportunities for exploring
novel physics of quantum dynamics. We investigate a Floquet system exhibiting
translational symmetry at any fixed time but the spatial periodicity is
time-dependent. Such a system is a natural platform for studying thermalization
and novel dynamical structures. We find that the single-particle Hilbert space
spontaneously develops a structure of a two-level subsystem and the rest part
forms a bath. The dynamic process is analyzed perturbatively within the
two-level subsystem as well as numerical solutions, exhibiting stable
time-evolutions. These results enrich our understanding of Floquet
thermalization without definite spatial periodicity, which brings hints for
exploring many-body physics such as scar states.

Abstract: Quantum circuits form a foundational framework in quantum science, enabling
the description, analysis, and implementation of quantum computations. However,
designing efficient circuits, typically constructed from single- and two-qubit
gates, remains a major challenge for specific computational tasks. In this
work, we introduce a novel artificial intelligence-driven protocol for quantum
circuit design, benchmarked using shadow tomography for efficient quantum state
readout. Inspired by techniques from natural language processing (NLP), our
approach first selects a compact gate dictionary by optimizing the entangling
power of two-qubit gates. We identify the iSWAP gate as a key element that
significantly enhances sample efficiency, resulting in a minimal gate set of
{I, SWAP, iSWAP}. Building on this, we implement a recurrent neural network
trained via reinforcement learning to generate high-performing quantum
circuits. The trained model demonstrates strong generalization ability,
discovering efficient circuit architectures with low sample complexity beyond
the training set. Our NLP-inspired framework offers broad potential for quantum
computation, including extracting properties of logical qubits in quantum error
correction.

Abstract: We investigate a two-dimensional nonlinear oscillator with a

expressions for the energy spectrum and wave functions. Based on the canonical
partition function, we derive key thermodynamic quantities, including internal
energy, specific heat, free energy, and entropy. Our results show that, unlike
the one-dimensional case, where the specific heat is unaffected by the
nonlinearity parameter $k$, the two-dimensional system exhibits a strong
$k-$dependence. At high temperatures, the specific heat becomes
temperature-independent for fixed values of $k$, in line with the Dulong-Petit
law. However, these behaviors occur only for negative values of $k$. These
findings highlight the impact of effective mass nonlinearity on macroscopic
thermodynamic quantities and suggest that tuning the parameter $k$ could serve
as an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of quantum devices,
including thermal machines and optoelectronic components.

Abstract: Phase-mismatch in nonlinear optical processes can severely limit the
propagation and conversion efficiency of light fields. Here, we present an
efficient optimal-control strategy to mitigate the detrimental effects of
phase-mismatch in an electromagnetically induced transparency medium via
non-resonant four-wave mixing (FWM). By applying a set of fixed, linearly
modulated coupling fields that induce a dark eigenmode, we globally optimize a
single coupling detuning to minimize the spontaneous emission loss, the primary
factor limiting conversion efficiency. Our approach outperforms existing FWM
schemes by providing strong robustness against large phase-mismatch variations
while maintaining efficient probe-to-signal conversion. These results offer a
promising route toward more efficient nonlinear frequency conversion,
alleviating the stringent requirement for phase matching in experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving quantum control strategies in the presence of noise and other challenges is motivated by the need for reliable quantum technologies.

Method: The paper benchmarks several methodologies across quantum tasks in a noisy environment using simulations and the Lindblad equation.

Result: Deterministic protocols excel for entanglement, while machine learning methods perform better in dynamic tasks, indicating a synthesis of traditional and ML-based approaches.

Conclusion: No single strategy is universally dominant, and the future lies in combining physics-informed methods with ML for high-fidelity quantum control.

Abstract: We address a wide spectrum of quantum control strategies, including various
open-loop protocols and advanced adaptive methods. These methodologies apply to
few-qubit scenarios and naturally scale to larger N-qubit systems. We benchmark
them across fundamental quantum tasks: entanglement preservation/generation,
and directed quantum transport in a disordered quantum walk. All simulations
are performed in a challenging environment featuring non-Markov colored noise,
imperfections, and the Markov Lindblad equation. With a complex task-dependent
performance hierarchy, our deterministic protocols proved highly effective for
entanglement generation/preservation, and in specific pulse configurations,
they even outperformed the RL-optimization. In contrast, more advanced methods
demonstrate a marked specialization. For entanglement preservation, a
physics-informed hybrid Quantum Error Correction and Dynamical Decoupling
(QEC-DD) protocol provides the most stable and effective solution,
outperforming all other approaches. Conversely, for dynamic tasks requiring the
discovery of non-trivial control sequences, such as DD, Floquet engineering,
and rapid entanglement generation or coherent transport, the model-free
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents consistently find superior solutions. We
further demonstrate that the control pulse envelope is a non-trivial factor
that actively shapes the control landscape, which determines the difficulty for
all protocols and highlights the adaptability of the RL agent. We conclude that
no single strategy is universally dominant. A clear picture emerges: the future
of high-fidelity quantum control lies in a synthesis of physics-informed
design, as exemplified by robust hybrid methods, and the specialized,
high-performance optimization power of adaptive machine learning.

Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of quantum analogs of classical impact

Abstract: The uniqueness of purifications of quantum states on a system $A$ up to local
unitary transformations on a purifying system $B$ is central to quantum
information theory. We show that, if the two systems are modelled by commuting
von Neumann algebras $M_A$ and $M_B$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$, then
uniqueness of purifications is equivalent to Haag duality $M_A = M_B'$. In
particular, the uniqueness of purifications can fail in systems with infinitely

jointly generate $B(\mathcal H)$ and hence allow for local tomography of all
density matrices on $\mathcal H$.

Abstract: Maximizing the computational utility of near-term quantum processors requires
predictive noise models that inform robust, noise-aware compilation and error
mitigation. Conventional models often fail to capture the complex error
dynamics of real hardware or require prohibitive characterization overhead. We
introduce a data-efficient, machine learning-based framework to construct
accurate, parameterized noise models for superconducting quantum processors.
Our approach circumvents costly characterization protocols by learning
hardware-specific error parameters directly from the measurement data of
existing application and benchmark circuits. The generality and robustness of
the framework are demonstrated through comprehensive benchmarking across
multiple quantum devices and algorithms. Crucially, we show that a model
trained exclusively on small-scale circuits accurately predicts the behavior of
larger validation circuits. Our data-efficient approach achieves up to a 65%
improvement in model fidelity quantified by the Hellinger distance between
predicted and experimental circuit output distributions, compared to standard
noise models derived from device properties. This work establishes a practical
paradigm for noise characterization, providing a crucial tool for developing
more effective noise-aware compilation and error-mitigation strategies.

environments (commonly referred to as HPC+QC integration) marks a pivotal step
in advancing computational capabilities for scientific research. Here we report
the integration of a superconducting 20-qubit quantum computer into the HPC
infrastructure at Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ), one of the first
practical implementations of its kind. This yielded four key lessons: (1)
quantum computers have stricter facility requirements than classical systems,
yet their deployment in HPC environments is feasible when preceded by a
rigorous site survey to ensure compliance; (2) quantum computers are inherently
dynamic systems that require regular recalibration that is automatic and
controllable by the HPC scheduler; (3) redundant power and cooling
infrastructure is essential; and (4) effective hands-on onboarding should be
provided for both quantum experts and new users. The identified conclusions
provide a roadmap to guide future HPC center integrations.

### [34] [Towards Universal Quantum Tamper Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12986)
*Anne Broadbent,Upendra Kapshikar,Denis Rochette*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Tamper-resilient cryptography protects data from physical tampering. While classical methods are limited by function restrictions, quantum methods offer more robust solutions. Quantum encodings can handle larger tampering families, suggesting quantum methods are more powerful.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finding stronger security methods against potential adversaries who can manipulate data physically is crucial. Quantum cryptography presents a promising solution in this area.

Method: The paper uses a general treatment of quantum maps and demonstrates that Haar-random encoding schemes are effective against arbitrary quantum tampering families under specific constraints.

Result: The study introduces a quantum tamper detection method that surpasses classical limitations, showing potential for universal quantum tamper detection.

Conclusion: Quantum tamper detection offers a stronger solution than classical cryptography, suggesting it should be the preferred method for protecting against physical data tampering.

Abstract: Tamper-resilient cryptography studies how to protect data against adversaries
who can physically manipulate codewords before they are decoded. The notion of
tamper detection codes formalizes this goal, requiring that any unauthorized
modification be detected with high probability. Classical results, starting
from Jafargholi and Wichs (TCC 2015), established the existence of such codes
against very large families of tampering functions, subject to structural
restrictions ruling out identity and constant maps. Recent works of Boddu and
Kapshikar (Quantum, 7) and Bergamaschi (Eurocrypt 2024) have extended these
ideas to quantum adversaries, but only consider unitary tampering families.
  In this work, we give the first general treatment of tamper detection against
arbitrary quantum maps. We show that Haar-random encoding schemes achieve
exponentially small soundness error against any adversarial family whose size,
Kraus rank, and entanglement fidelity obey natural constraints, which are
direct quantum analogues of restrictions in the classical setting. Our results
unify and extend previous works. Beyond this, we demonstrate a fundamental
separation between classical and quantum tamper detection. Classically, relaxed
tamper detection which allows either rejection or recovery of the original
message cannot protect even against the family of constant functions. This
family is of size $2^n$. In contrast, we show that quantum encodings can handle
this obstruction, and we conjecture and provide evidence that they may in fact
provide relaxed tamper detection and non-malleable security against any family
of quantum maps of size up to $2^{2^{\alpha n}}$ for any constant $\alpha
<\frac{1}{2}$, leading to a conjecture on the existence of universal quantum
tamper detection. Our results provide the first evidence that quantum tamper
detection is strictly more powerful than its classical counterpart.

### [35] [Mitigating the sign problem by quantum computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13017)
*Kwai-Kong Ng,Min-Fong Yang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses a proposed method to address the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulations using a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion method, but finds that it may not effectively resolve the issue for certain Hamiltonians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper stems from the significant challenge posed by the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, which restricts their application in condensed matter physics and other fields.

Method: The qc-SSE method introduces a constant energy shift to the Hamiltonian and employs an operator contraction technique to enhance computational efficiency.

Result: The study finds that moderate shifts in the qc-SSE method can effectively mitigate the sign problem in finite systems, particularly when applied to specific models like the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain, while large shifts can increase errors and leave the sign problem unresolved.

Conclusion: The qc-SSE method does not completely solve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms but provides a promising alternative for practical applications by suppressing negative weights under optimal conditions.

Abstract: The notorious sign problem severely limits the applicability of quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) simulations, as statistical errors grow exponentially with system
size and inverse temperature. A recent proposal of a quantum-computing
stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be
avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we
critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve
the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it
provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of
negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test
case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size,
temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method
is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate
shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large
shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose an optimization method for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver
(VQE) that combines adaptive and physics-inspired ansatz design. Instead of
optimizing multiple layers simultaneously, the ansatz is built incrementally
from its operator subsets, enabling subspace optimization that provides better
initialization for subsequent steps. This quasi-dynamical approach preserves
expressivity and hardware efficiency while avoiding the overhead of operator
selection associated with adaptive methods. Benchmarks on one- and
two-dimensional Heisenberg and Hubbard models with up to 20 qubits show
improved fidelities, reduced function evaluations, or both, compared to
fixed-layer VQE. The method is simple, cost-effective, and particularly
well-suited for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

Motivation:  detections of entanglement in high-dimensional quantum systems remain a key challenge in quantum information science, this paper addresses it by proposing a novel method.

Method:  maps the Hilbert space of high-dimensional two-qudit states to the space of two qubits, enabling the use of established two-qubit entanglement witnesses.

Result:  identifies a vast majority of pure entangled states, measurement efficiency does not scale with qudit dimensionality, method demonstrated sensitivity in two classes of states and feasible with current techniques.

Conclusion: proposed method provides a practical solution for detecting entanglement in high-dimensional systems, opens new possibilities for quantum communication and computing applications

Abstract: This paper presents an efficient method for detecting entanglement in
high-dimensional two-qudit states by mapping the Hilbert space onto the space
of two qubits. This transformation enables the use of well-established
two-qubit entanglement witnesses. The proposed approach is not restricted to
any specific class of states, successfully identifies a vast majority of pure
entangled states, and requires a number of measurements that does not increase
with the dimensionality of the qudits. The method demonstrates solid
sensitivity when applied to two notable classes of states,
incomplete-permutation-symmetric states and random pure states mixed with white
noise, and is shown to be feasible with current experimental techniques.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show a simple and systematic way to certify any given bipartite state as
the unique joint $1$-eigenstate of two separable projectors, each of which can
be measured with simple local observables. This is practically useful, as the
detection probabilities of the two stabilizer projectors relate directly to the
fidelity of certification. The same result gives a simple and effective lower
bound on the entanglement fidelity of a quantum channel in terms of two
ensemble fidelities.
  We then generalise the bipartite result recursively to multipartite systems,
showing that every $n$-party pure state is the unique joint $1$-eigenstate of
$2^{n-1}$ separable projectors, and an upper bound of the infidelity of the
state in terms of the infidelities of the separable stabilizer projectors.

Conclusion: 通过研究磁性材料与自旋 qubit 之间的耦合，我们展示了单向和耗散的磁性量子网络中固态自旋量子纠缠的可能性，为量子信息科学提供了新的方法和工具。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum system in which a magnet supporting
non-reciprocal magnons, chiral magnons, or both mediates the dissipative and
unidirectional coupling of spin qubits. By driving the qubits, the steady state
of this qubit-qubit coupling scheme becomes the maximally entangled Bell state.
We devise a protocol where the system converges to this entangled state and
benchmark it including qubit decay and dephasing. The protocol is numerically
tested on a hybrid system consisting of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers coupled
to magnon surface modes of an yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film. We show that the
dephasing time of the NV centers forms the bottleneck for achieving the
entanglement of NV centers separated by a distance exceeding microns. Our
findings identify the key technological requirements and demonstrate a viable
route toward steady-state entanglement of solid-state spins over distances of
several microns using magnonic quantum networks, expanding the toolbox of
magnonics for quantum information purposes.

Abstract: Molecular polaritons within the mid-infrared regime have emerged as a source
for modifying and manipulating molecular and photonic properties. However, the
development of new methodologies for photon generation is still a challenge in
nanophotonics. We propose a molecular model based on the Holstein-quantum-Rabi
Hamiltonian, which also incorporates realistic dipole moments and non-adiabatic
couplings among electronic excited states, to study the ultrafast photodynamics
of diatomic molecules in confined electromagnetic fields within quantized
cavities. In addition to vibronic transitions due to intrinsic non-adiabatic
couplings, two types of light-induced crossings emerge: one type is located at
molecular nuclear geometries where the rotating wave approximation is
fulfilled, and another type appears at different geometries where
counter-rotating transitions may occur. We make a comprehensive study of
polariton photodynamics within a time window of a few tens of femtoseconds,
where dissipative mechanisms do not influence the polariton photodynamics. We
stress the dramatic change of the polariton energy spectrum as a function of
the Huang-Rhys factor when non-adiabatic couplings are included in the model.
We conclude that both the molecular non-adiabatic couplings and, more
specifically, the counter-rotating couplings in the cavity-molecule interaction
play a crucial role in converting vibronic energy into photons through excited
dressed states. We also show that the sign of the Huang-Rhys factor has a
significant impact on this photon conversion. Our work paves the way for the
development of many-photon generation powered by strong light-matter
interaction, along with potential applications using alkaline earth monohydride
molecules.

Abstract: Logical qubits are considered an essential component for achieving
utility-scale quantum computation. Multiple recent demonstrations of logical
qubits on neutral atoms have relied on coherent qubit motion into entangling
zones. However, this architecture requires motion prior to every entangling
gate, incurring significant cost in wall clock runtime and motion-related error
accumulation. We propose and experimentally realize an alternative architecture
which unites qubit motion and in-place entanglement via nearest-neighbor gates.
Our approach maintains all-to-all connectivity, while minimizing qubit motion
overheads. We demonstrate three key results on Infleqtion's Sqale QPU, which
hosts an array of 114 neutral atom qubits. First, we perform a logical qubit
realization of a pre-compiled variant of Shor's Algorithm. We find better
logical-than-physical performance over a range of settings including with loss
correction and leakage detection. Second, we introduce a technique for
performing CNOT ladders with depth independent of both the number of logical
qubits N and the code distance d. In proof-of-principle experiments with 8 and
12 logical qubits, we find ~4x reduction in error via the logical encodings.
Third, we experimentally realize initialization of the [[16, 4, 4]]
many-hypercube QEC code. All three results benefit from optimized compilation
via Superstaq, as well as our underlying architecture uniting motion and
in-place entanglement. This architecture offers a path to reducing the overhead
of utility-scale quantum applications relative to architectures based on
entangling zones.

Abstract: We explore the concept of redundancy of critical elements in a quantum
computing architecture to circumvent disruption of quantum operations due to a
failure of such an element, for example, from a catastrophic cosmic ray event.
We illustrate this concept with reference to a recently proposed
superconducting modular quantum architecture with a star-like configuration,
which has a router at the center that enables superconducting qubit
interactions across various modules. Regarding this router as a vital element,
we propose a double-star configuration, where a loss of one router is backed by
the second one. We also examine the usefulness of this double-star
configuration under normal conditions, namely, when the quantum hardware has
been rendered safe against cosmic rays due to other mitigating actions like
shielding or movement to an underground facility. Simultaneous two qubit-pair
interactions like two simultaneous CZ gates and multiqubit gates like CCZS are
then easily facilitated.

### [43] [Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma and Reversibility of Quantum Resource Theories for Classical-Quantum Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13280)
*Bjarne Bergh,Nilanjana Datta,Anirudh Khaitan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper extends the Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma (GQSL) to classical-quantum (c-q) channels, analyzing composite hypothesis testing under parallel strategies. The optimal asymptotic asymmetric error exponent is determined by the regularization of Umegaki channel divergence, minimized over the null hypothesis. This leads to the reversibility of resource theories for c-q channels. These findings align with a concurrent work by Hayashi and Yamasaki, but employ different techniques for the proof. The key contributions include extending the GQSL to c-q channels, providing new insights into composite hypothesis testing, and establishing the reversibility of resource theories in this context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivations behind this work likely stem from the desire to generalize and refine quantum information theory tools, specifically in the realm of channel resource theories. Extending fundamental quantum coding theorems like the Stein's Lemma to different channel types is a common endeavor in quantum Shannon theory. Additionally, the study of composite hypothesis testing under time constraints (parallel strategies) adds practical relevance by addressing operational limits in realistic quantum communication and computation setups. The aim to establish channel reversibility is also theoretically important, as it can provide a foundation for quantum resource interconversions and characterizations of operational equivalence between quantum channels.

Method: The authors employ information-theoretic techniques, leveraging the framework of quantum hypothesis testing and channel divergence measures. They use the method of proving operational as well as converse bounds to identify the optimal error exponent. Scaling arguments and the use of processing inequalities appear central, while the choice of Off-diagonal Rényi relative entropy as the regularization method for Umegaki channel divergence is an important technical component. The comparison with the concurrent work suggests that different proof techniques yield the same result, highlighting the robustness of the approach.

Result: The primary result is the proof of the optimal asymptotic asymmetric error exponent for testing c-q channel powers against a structured set of alternatives, achieved by the regularized Umegaki divergence minimized over the null hypothesis. The implications include the reversibility of resource theories for c-q channels within the diamond norm framework, emphasizing the operational significance of this divergence measure. The alignment with concurrent work validates the approach but also indicates comparable outcomes, suggesting consistency within the quantum information theory domain.

Conclusion: The study advances our understanding of quantum channel resource theories by extending the GQSL and establishing reversibility in the c-q case. It introduces a method for analyzing composite hypothesis testing that highlights the role of channel divergence measures. The work not only contributes to the theoretical foundation of quantum Shannon theory but also provides tools for practical applications in quantum communication and computing. Future research could explore the extension of these results to more general quantum resource theories and their applications in practical quantum technologies.

Abstract: We extend the recent proof of the Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma by
Hayashi and Yamasaki [arXiv:2408.02722] to classical-quantum (c-q) channels. We
analyze the composite hypothesis testing problem of testing a c-q channel
$\mathcal{E}^{\otimes n}$ against a sequence of sets of c-q channels
$(\mathcal{S}_n)_n$ (satisfying certain natural assumptions), under parallel
strategies. We prove that the optimal asymptotic asymmetric error exponent is
given by the regularization of Umegaki channel divergence, minimized over
$\mathcal{S}_n$. This allows us to prove the reversibility of resource theories
of classical-quantum channels in a natural framework, where the distance
between channels (and hence also the notion of approximate interconvertibility
of channels) is measured in diamond norm, and the set of free operations is the
set of all asymptotically resource non-generating superchannels. The results we
obtain are similar to the ones in the concurrent and independent work by
Hayashi and Yamasaki [arXiv:2509.07271]. However the proof of the direct part
of the GQSL uses different arguments and techniques to deal with the challenges
that arise from dealing with c-q channels.

for the electric field gradient tensor and the two NMR parameters, the
isotropic shielding and the spin-spin coupling constants (SSCC), of selected
mercury compounds. For all three properties, the vibrational corrected values
performed closest to experimental values, and the magnitudes of the corrections
depended on the level of relativity and the basis set in the calculation.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the radial correlation energy density components for He to Ar atoms using exFCI wavefunctions and evaluates their accuracy on specific grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding correlation energy densities is crucial for advancing theories of electronic structure and improving computational methods in quantum chemistry.

Method: The study employs the exFCI method combined with restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) or ROHF reference wavefunctions to compute and analyze the components of radial correlation energy density.

Result: Results indicate promising accuracy in integrating HF and exFCI energy density components, with noted discrepancies in kinetic energy on the SG-1 grid. The use of SG-2 grid enhances the analysis of kinetic energies and subtle effects. Integration errors in correlation energy densities partially cancel out, and shell structures in radial correlation energy densities are evident. Open-shell atoms exhibit significant differences between α and β-electron correlation energy densities.

Conclusion: The findings provide valuable insights into electron correlation effects and support the development of more accurate quantum chemical models.

Abstract: The components of the radial correlation energy density are calculated and
analyzed for the atoms from He to Ar. The components include the
nucleus-electron potential correlation energy density, the kinetic correlation
energy density and the electron-electron potential correlation energy density.
The necessary correlated one and two-electron density matrices are obtained
from the Extrapolated-Full-Configuration-Interaction (exFCI) wave function
where the reference wave function is restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) or
restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) depending on whether the atom is
closed or open-shell. The accuracy associated with integrating the HF and exFCI
energy density components, and the correlation energy density components, is
evaluated on the SG-1 and SG-2 atomic grids. The SG-1 grid provides atomic
energies that are accurate to about 1 kJ mol$^{-1}$, with the exception of the
kinetic energy. The SG-2 grid is required for the analysis of atomic kinetic
energies and more subtle energetic effects. There is also a significant amount
of integration error cancellation in the correlation energy densities. The
radial correlation energy densities display notable shell structure, and there
is a substantial difference between the $\alpha$ and $\beta$-electron
correlation energy densities for the open-shell atoms.

Abstract: Recent advancements have led to the development of bright and heavy

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new quantum computing framework for valence bond methods, which are computationally expensive but chemically meaningful. While there are established fermionic-to-spin mapping techniques for orthonormal orbitals, similar methods for nonorthogonal orbitals are lacking. The authors introduce an alternative Jordan-Wigner-type mapping specifically for nonorthogonal orbitals, aiming to enable efficient quantum simulations of valence bond wavefunctions.他们用一个新量子计算框架为价键方法提供了计算上可行的解决方案。虽然目前有适用于正交轨道的 fermionic 到 spin 映射技术，但用于非正交轨道的类似方法尚未开发。作者提出了针对非正交轨道的另一种类似乔丹-维格纳(Jordan-Wigner)映射，旨在使量子模拟价键波函数更有效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Valence bond (VB) methods are widely used in quantum chemistry for their chemical interpretability, but they are computationally intensive because they involve nonorthogonal orbitals. Quantum computing has the potential to address these computational challenges, but there is currently no established framework for handling nonorthogonal spin orbitals, which limits the practical application of VB methods. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel Jordan-Wigner-type mapping for nonorthogonal orbitals, paving the way for more efficient and feasible quantum simulations of VB-type wavefunctions.随着量子计算的兴起，解决价键方法的计算复杂性问题具有重要意义。价键方法因其化学可解释性强而备受关注，但其计算成本很高，主要是因为它们涉及非正交轨道。目前，量子计算可以处理价键方法中的问题，但由于缺乏针对非正交轨道的对应方法，价键方法的实际应用仍然有限。本文提出了一种针对非正交轨道的新乔丹-维格纳类型映射，意在为价键法的量子模拟开辟更有效、更可行的道路。

Method: The authors develop an alternative Jordan-Wigner-type mapping specifically tailored for nonorthogonal spin orbitals. This mapping likely involves modifications to the standard Jordan-Wigner transformation, which traditionally applies to orthonormal orbitals. The proposed method probably utilize advances in quantum computing, such as qubit encoding or quantum circuit design, to adapt the Jordan-Wigner framework for nonorthogonal cases. Additionally, the authors may have explored the theoretical underpinnings of this new mapping, including how it affects the representation of spin states and the efficiency of quantum simulations.在方法论上，作者开发了一个专门针对非正交自旋轨道的新乔丹-维格纳类型映射。这可能涉及对传统乔丹-维格纳变换的修改，后者主要用于正交轨道。他们可能利用了量子计算的最新进展，如量子位编码或量子电路设计，来将乔丹-维格纳框架应用到非正交情况下。此外，作者可能研究了这一新映射的理论基础，包括它如何影响自旋状态的表示以及量子模拟的效率。

Abstract: Quantum computing offers a promising platform to address the computational
challenges inherent in quantum chemistry, and particularly in valence bond (VB)
methods, which are chemically appealing but suffer from high computational cost
due to the use of nonorthogonal orbitals. While various fermionic-to-spin
mappings exist for orthonormal spin orbitals, such as the widely used
Jordan-Wigner transformations, an analogous framework for nonorthogonal spin
orbitals remains undeveloped. In this work, we propose an alternative
Jordan-Wigner-type mapping tailored for the nonorthogonal case, with the goal
of enabling efficient quantum simulations of VB-type wavefunctions. Our
approach paves the way towards the development of chemically interpretable and
computationally feasible valence bond algorithms on near-term quantum devices.
An initial theoretical analysis and a preliminary application demonstrate the
feasibility of this encoding and its potential for extending the applicability
of VB methods to larger and more complex systems.

Result: 观察到偶谐波增强现象，测定了回飞电子波包的时序，特别是在水溶液中观察到了相互干涉的最小值。

Conclusion: 高调和光谱（HHS）成为研究液体和溶液中超快电子动力学的有力工具。

Abstract: High-harmonic spectroscopy (HHS) in liquids promises real-time access to
ultrafast electronic dynamics in the native environment of chemical and
biological processes. While electron recollision has been established as the
dominant mechanism of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in liquids, resolving the
underlying electron dynamics has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate
attosecond-resolved measurements of recolliding electron wave packets,
extending HHS from neat liquids to aqueous solutions. Using phase-controlled
two-colour fields, we observe a linear scaling of the two-colour delay that
maximizes even-harmonic emission with photon energy, yielding slopes of
208+/-55 as/eV in ethanol and 124+/-42 as/eV in water, the latter matching ab
initio simulations (125+/-48 as/eV). In aqueous salt solutions, we uncover
interference minima whose appearance depends on solute type and concentration,
arising from destructive interference between solute and solvent emission. By
measuring the relative phase of solvent and solute HHG, we retrieve a variation
of electron transit time by 113+/-32 as/eV, consistent with our neat-liquid
results. These findings establish HHS as a powerful attosecond-resolved probe
of electron dynamics in disordered media, opening transformative opportunities
for studying ultrafast processes such as energy transfer, charge migration, and
proton dynamics in liquids and solutions.

*Imre Bakó,László Pusztai,Orest Pizio*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper compares molecular dynamics simulations of methanol under pressure, using three force fields, evaluating how pressure affects hydrogen bonding and structural properties like clusters and rings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how pressure affects liquid structure, especially in biological liquids like methanol, is crucial for fields like biochemistry and materials science.

Method: Molecular dynamics simulations of methanol with three different force fields (TraPPE, UAM-I, OPLS/2016) under varying pressures (1-6 kbar). Analyzed properties: scattering structure factors, radial distribution functions, and collective characteristics like ring and cluster sizes, as well as self-diffusion and hydrogen bond dynamics.

Result: All three force fields showed quantitative agreement with experimental data. OPLS/2016 produced distinct results compared to the others. Pressure had minimal impact on radial distributions and neighbor counts but significantly altered collective properties, increasing cluster and decreasing ring formation, and reducing self-diffusion and hydrogen bond lifetime.

Conclusion: Pressure significantly influences collective structural and dynamic properties of methanol, with the OPLS/2016 force field highlighting these changes most distinctly.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics computer simulations have been conducted on neat liquid
methanol, using three different united atom (three site) interatomic
potentials: TraPPE [J. Phys. Chem. B 105, 3093 (2001)], UAM-I [J. Mol. Liq.
323, 114576 (2021)] and OPLS/2016 [J. Chem. Phys. 145, 034508 (2016)]. The
effects of pressure, between 1 bar and 6 kbar, have been evaluated on total
scattering structure factors, partial radial distribution functions, as well as
on collective characteristics such as ring size distributions and cluster size
distributions. Agreement with experimental density is nearly quantitative for
all the three force fields, and major trends observed for recent pressure
dependent neutron diffraction data are reproduced qualitatively. The OPLS/2016
force field, in general, generates properties that are markedly different from
results originating from the other potentials. Pressure effects are hardly
noticeable on most partial radial distribution functions and on the
distribution of the number of hydrogen bonded neighbours. On the other hand,
collective structural properties, like cluster- and ring size distributions
exhibit significant changes with increasing pressure: larger clusters become
more numerous, whereas the number of cyclic clusters, i.e., rings, decrease.
The self-diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing pressure, and the same
is valid for the average lifetime of hydrogen bonds.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Took a whole year to write, did dimensional analysis in Lean, formalized dimension theory, buckingham pi, etc. Forgive the bloated TL;DR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I wanted to implement dimensional analysis in Lean but needed formal framework for it, so delved into math, realized I needed to formalize group theory and then built everything on top of that.

Method: Started by researching group theory, defined physical dimensions as multiplicative abelian groups, proved properties, then extended to variables, SI units, etc. Tested framework on Lennard-Jones potential, success.

Result: A verified framework enabling formalized dimensional analysis, built from solid math foundation. Proved Buckingham Pi Theorem and formalized Lennard-Jones potential example.

Conclusion: Founded a new formalized science library component in Lean. Provided methods for others to build on, ensuring correctness in calculations by enforcing dimensional consistency automatically.

Abstract: Dimensional analysis is fundamental to the formulation and validation of
physical laws, ensuring that equations are dimensionally homogeneous and
scientifically meaningful. In this work, we use Lean 4 to formalize the
mathematics of dimensional analysis. We define physical dimensions as mappings
from base dimensions to exponents, prove that they form an Abelian group under
multiplication, and implement derived dimensions and dimensional homogeneity
theorems. Building on this foundation, we introduce a definition of physical
variables that combines numeric values with dimensions, extend the framework to
incorporate SI base units and fundamental constants, and implement the
Buckingham Pi Theorem. Finally, we demonstrate the approach on an example: the
Lennard-Jones potential, where our framework enforces dimensional consistency
and enables formal proofs of physical properties such as zero-energy separation
and the force law. This work establishes a reusable, formally verified
framework for dimensional analysis in Lean, providing a foundation for future
libraries in formalized science and a pathway toward scientific computing
environments with built-in guarantees of dimensional correctness.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Landau levels (LLs) are the massively-degenerate discrete energy spectrum of
a charged particle in a transverse magnetic field and lie at the heart of many
intriguing phenomena such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects as
well as quantized vortices. In this Letter, we consider coupling of LLs of a
transversely driven charge neutral particle in a synthetic gauge potential to a
quantized field of an optical cavity -- a setting reminiscent of superradiant
self-ordering setups in quantum gases. We uncover that this complex system can
be surprisingly described in terms of two highly nonlinearly-coupled quantum
harmonic oscillators, thus enabling a full quantum mechanical treatment.
Light-matter coupling mixes the LLs and the superradiant photonic mode, leading
to the formation of hybrid states referred to as ``Landau polaritons''. They
inherit partially the degeneracy of the LLs and possess intriguing features
such as non-zero light-matter entanglement and quadrature squeezing. Depending
on the system parameters and the choice of initial state, the system exhibits
diverse nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and multiple steady states, with
distinct physical properties. This work lays the foundation for further
investigating the novel, driven-dissipative Landau-polariton physics in
quantum-gas--cavity-QED settings.

*Yitao Feng,Ryohei Kobayashi,Yu-An Chen,Shinsei Ryu*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Higher-form symmetry in tensor product Hilbert spaces emerges only with enforced Gauss laws. The paper introduces a method to define 't Hooft anomalies for higher-form symmetries in lattice models, based on cohomology classes. In (2+1)D, specifically, an index in $H^4(B^2G, U(1))$ characterizes these anomalies, extending the Else-Nayak framework for 0-form symmetries. For arbitrary dimensions, the anomaly is characterized by an index in $H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of higher-form symmetries in quantum systems is crucial for uncovering new phases of matter. This paper provides a systematic approach to identifying and characterizing 't Hooft anomalies in these systems, which are essential for ensuring gauge invariance and consistency in theoretical models.

Method: The authors construct an index using cohomological tools, specifically$H^4(B^2G, U(1))$in (2+1)D and generalize it tohigher dimensions with$H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$. This method builds on previous work by Else and Nayak but extends it to encompass higher-form symmetries.

Result: The paper presents a novel mathematical framework for identifying 't Hooft anomalies in higher-form symmetries of lattice models. By relating these anomalies to specific cohomology classes, the authors provide a systematic way to study and predict their occurrence in various quantum systems.

Conclusion: This work advances the understanding of higher-form symmetries and their anomalies in quantum lattice models. The proposed framework offers a powerful tool for analyzing new phases of matter and ensuring consistency in symmetry-based quantum theories.

Abstract: Higher-form symmetry in a tensor product Hilbert space is always emergent:
the symmetry generators become genuinely topological only when the Gauss law is
energetically enforced at low energies. In this paper, we present a general
method for defining the 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetries in lattice
models built on a tensor product Hilbert space. In (2+1)D, for given Gauss law
operators realized by finite-depth circuits that generate a finite 1-form $G$
symmetry, we construct an index representing a cohomology class in $H^4(B^2G,
U(1))$, which characterizes the corresponding 't Hooft anomaly. This
construction generalizes the Else-Nayak characterization of 0-form symmetry
anomalies. More broadly, under the assumption of a specified formulation of the
$p$-form $G$ symmetry action and Hilbert space structure in arbitrary $d$
spatial dimensions, we show how to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly of the
symmetry action by an index valued in $H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$.

Motivation: 探索高对称性格点模型中的stripe半价化现象，以及在不同$	ext{SU}(N)$群下的行为变化。

Method: 使用了大型Determinant量子蒙特卡罗模拟和$	ext{large-$N$}$鞍点分析。

Result: 在弱耦合下存在抗铁磁有序的局域磁矩；当$	ext{SU}(N)$群大小大于等于6时，强$	ext{Kondo}$耦合导致stripe半价化，出现波矢$(oldsymbol{	ext{k}}=(	ext{π},0))$的条纹化模式。

Conclusion: stripe半价化是$	ext{SU}(N)$群大小的影响，与通道对称性打破相关。该研究表明，在不同耦合条件下，系统的行为与$	ext{SU}(N)$大小密切相关。

Abstract: We carry out large-scale, sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo
simulations of the square lattice $\mathrm{SU}(N)$-symmetric two-channel Kondo
lattice model at half-filling. We map out the zero-temperature phase diagram
for $N = 2, 4, 6$, and $8$, as a function of the Kondo coupling strength. In
the weak-coupling regime, we observe antiferromagnetic order of the localized
moments. Remarkably, for $N \geq 6$, sufficiently strong Kondo coupling induces
spontaneous channel symmetry breaking, forming a stripe dimerization pattern
with a wave vector $\boldsymbol{k}=(\pi,0)$ alternating between channels. These
findings are supported by a complementary large-$N$ saddle point analysis,
which identifies the striped hybridization pattern as the energetically
preferred configuration. The spatial symmetry-breaking results in an
anisotropic Fermi surface reconstruction.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper explores the phase diagrams of magic-angle twisted bilayer and symmetric trilayer graphene (MA-TBG/TSTG) under strain, focusing on their incommensurate Kekulé spiral (IKS) order and the role of electron-phonon couplings, Coulomb interactions, and spin structures in determining electronic properties and potential for superconductivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the electronic properties of twisted graphene layers is crucial for advancing research in correlated electron systems, topological phases, and potential applications in flexible and ultrarelativistic electronic devices. The manipulation of these properties through strain is a promising avenue for studying exotic states of matter like unconventional superconductivity.

Method: The authors use a combination of theoretical analysis, including electronic structure calculations and competing phases modeling, alongside STM experiments to infer the relative importance of various interactions in determining the electronic state of MA-TBG and TSTG under strain.

Result: The study reveals that strain-stabilized IKS order in MA-TBG and TSTG is influenced by spin structures, which in turn affects the visibility of the IKS order in STM measurements. Additionally, the findings highlight the interplay between electronic structure, spin interactions, and superconducting tendencies in these materials.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the emerging understanding of the electronic landscape of twisted graphene multilayers, offering insights into the factors that stabilize and compete for orders and leading to discussions on the potential for high-temperature superconductivity in these materials.

Abstract: We revisit the global phase diagram of magic-angle twisted bilayer and
[symmetric] trilayer graphene (MA-TBG/TSTG) in light of recent scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements on these materials. These experiments
both confirmed the importance of strain in stabilizing the predicted
incommensurate Kekul\'{e} spiral (IKS) order near filling $|\nu|=2$ of the
weakly dispersive central bands in both systems, and suggested a key role for
electron-phonon couplings and short-range Coulomb interactions in selecting
between various competing orders at low strain in MA-TBG. Here, we show that
such interactions $\textit{also}$ play a crucial role in selecting the spin
structure of the strain-stabilized IKS state. This in turn influences the
visibility of the IKS order in STM in a manner that allows us to infer their
relative importance. We use this insight in conjunction with various other
pieces of experimental data to build a more complete picture of the phase
diagram, focusing on the spectrum of low-lying collective modes and the nature
of the doped Fermi surfaces. We explore the broad phenomenological implications
of these results for superconductivity.

Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，检测拓扑相中长程纠缠变得重要，ZX图协议提供了一个可行的解决方案。

Method: 研究使用ZX图协议，通过状态空间的实空间二分和ZX图表达式，识别长程纠缠特征。

Result: ZX图协议通过跨边界图连接性区分了Different量子码（如像码和色码），利用非局部节点的数量作为区分标志。

Conclusion: ZX图协议是一种有效的方法，通过图形推理克服熵计算的局限，可靠地检测拓扑长程纠缠。

Abstract: Establishing a universal diagnostic of topological order remains an open
theoretical challenge. In particular, diagnosing long-range entanglement
through the entropic area law suffers from spurious contributions, failing to
unambiguously identify topological order. Here we devise a protocol based on
the ZX calculus, a graphical tensor network, to determine the topological order
of a state circumventing entropy calculations. The protocol takes as input
real-space bipartitions of a state and returns a ZX contour diagram,
$\mathcal{D}_{\partial A}$, displaying long-range graph connectivity only for
long-range entangled states. We validate the protocol by showing that the
contour diagrams of the toric and color codes are equivalent except for the
number of non-local nodes, which differentiates their topological order. The
number of these nodes is robust to the choice of the boundary and ground-state
superposition, and they are absent for trivial states, even those with spurious
entropy contributions. Our results single out ZX calculus as a tool to detect
topological long-range entanglement by leveraging the advantages of
diagrammatic reasoning against entropic diagnostics.

Result: 在两个基元单元模型中发现了互作用诱导的反铁磁中间相，在Jz负区间出现抑制磁化的区域；三原子基元模型缺乏中间相，呈现不对称边局域化和反铁磁秩序。两基元模型中的零能边模在有限相互作用强度下被拓扑保护；三基元模型中边模在有限能量上存在，但保护被打破，但仍保持边局域化特征。

Conclusion: 两基元模型的互作用 SSH 链表现出拓扑相图中的中间反铁磁相和边模保护，在Jz负区间出现抑制磁化的区域；而三基元模型缺乏中间相，边模特征在有相互作用时被打破。

Abstract: We investigate interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains with two- and
three-site unit cells using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
simulations. By selecting appropriate filling fractions and sweeping across
interaction strength \( J_z \) and dimerization \( \delta \), we map out their
phase diagrams and identify transition lines via entanglement entropy and
magnetization measurements. In the two-site model, we observe the emergence of
an interaction-induced antiferromagnetic intermediate phase between the
topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes, as well as a critical region at
negative \( J_z \) with suppressed magnetization and finite-size scaling of
entanglement entropy. In contrast, the three-site model lacks an intermediate
phase and exhibits asymmetric edge localization and antiferromagnetic ordering
in both positive and negative \( J_z \) regimes. We further examine the
response of edge states to Ising perturbations. In the two-site model,
zero-energy edge modes are topologically protected and remain robust up to a
finite interaction strength. However, in the three-site model, where the edge
states reside at finite energy, this protection breaks down. Despite this, the
edge-localized nature of these states survives in the form of polarized modes
whose spatial profiles reflect the non-interacting limit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing efficient quantum impurity solvers is crucial for studying strongly correlated materials, and scaling up methods like the Gutzwiller Approximation requires innovative approaches.

Method: A graph transformer-based NQS framework was developed to handle arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals. An error control mechanism was integrated to stabilize iterative updates in quantum embedding loops.

Result: Our approach matched exact diagonalization results for the Anderson Lattice Model, demonstrating high accuracy.

Conclusion: The primary computational bottleneck is high-accuracy sampling during the embedding loop, suggesting a need for improved inference techniques to advance the field of strongly correlated systems modeling.

Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a promising approach to solve
second-quantised Hamiltonians, because of their scalability and flexibility. In
this work, we design and benchmark an NQS impurity solver for the quantum
embedding methods, focusing on the ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA)
framework. We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to
represent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control
mechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding
loops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations
of the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the
exact diagonalisation impurity solver. Finally, our analysis of the
computational budget reveals the method's principal bottleneck to be the
high-accuracy sampling of physical observables required by the embedding loop,
rather than the NQS variational optimisation, directly highlighting the
critical need for more efficient inference techniques.

Conclusion: 为研究三维拓扑相变提供了新的数值/理论框架和研究方向。该发现为研究高阶拓扑材料和小型量子位开发提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We investigate the nature of the topological phase transition of the
antiferromagnetic Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of a
magnetic field along the [111] direction. The field opens a topological gap in
the Majorana fermion spectrum and leads to a sequence of topological phase
transitions before the field polarised state is reached. At mean field level
the gap first closes at the three $M$ points in the Brillouin zone, where the
Majorana fermions form Dirac cones, resulting in a change of Chern number by
three. An odd number of Dirac fermions in the infrared is unusual and requires
Berry curvature compensation in the UV, which occurs via topological, ring-like
hybridisation gaps with higher-energy bands. We perform a renormalisation-group
analysis of the topological phase transition at the three $M$ points within the
Yukawa theory, allowing for intra- and inter-valley fluctuations of the
spin-liquid bond operators. We find that the latter lead to a breaking of
Lorentz invariance and hence a different universality compared to the standard
Ising Gross-Neveu-Yukawa class.

TL;DR: 研究了分数量子Hall（FQH）流体中的自旋富奇态在LLL能级的色散关系，发现复合 fermion（CF）激发在所有波长下都能准确描述 collective 模式的色散，而密度波态仅在长波极限下部分状态有效。提出了一种用于描述额外高能量自旋保持部分态激发的ansatz，并在ν=2/5状态进行了计算。这些部分态激发可以通过圆偏极化不弹性光散射实验观察到。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更好地理解 FQH 态中的 collective 模式，特别是自旋相关方面的行为，研究者通过构造不同的试态函数（如复合 fermion 激发和密度波态），使用球面几何和LLL投影方法，来计算这些模式的色散关系。通过对南海维数和结构因子的计算，发现不同的试态在不同情况下表现出不同的色散特性，有助于分辨其物理性质和激发机制。这项工作为 FQH 系统中的自旋动力学提供了新的见解，并可能为未来的实验设计提供指导。

Method: 研究采用了LLL投影的方法，将密度波和复合 fermion激发作为候选试态来计算它们在自旋翻转和自旋保持两种情况下的色散。具体来说，对密度波态，研究者推导了自旋富奇态LLL投影算符的交换代数，利用这种代数从 FQH 地貌的静结构因子（即静止结构因子）中提取了密度波态的色散值。而对于复合 fermion激发，直接计算了它们的色散情况来比较两者在不同波长下的表现。这种混合的分析方法确保了结论的有效性和准确性。

Result: 结果显示，复合 fermion 激发在所有波长下都能准确描述 collective 模式的色散，而密度波态仅在短波极限下部分状态有效。深入分析表明，在自旋单重态的初级Jain态（如ν=2/5）中，自旋保持的密度波态在长波极限下也是不够准确的。研究者推测这可能是因为存在一种更高能量的自旋保持部分态激发，类似于在完全极化的情况下发现的类似激发。为此，研究者提出了这种部分态激发的ansatz，并计算了其色散，验证了这种新部分态的存在。这些部分态激发可以通过圆偏极化不弹性光散射实验来观察和检测。

Conclusion: 此研究为FQH系统中自旋相关 collective 模式的分类和理解提供了新的理论框架，并为自然界中对应的激发现象提供了明确的物理图像。实验结果的直接观察将为FQH态的详细动力学特性提供直接证据，并有助于进一步验证理论模型和激发机制。此外，此类部分态激发的存在对于理解更复杂自旋状态可能是有价值的。

Abstract: Collective modes capture the dynamical aspects of fractional quantum Hall

FQH states in the lowest Landau level (LLL) along the Jain sequence of fillings
$\nu{=}n/(2n{\pm}1)$ and compute the Coulomb dispersion of their spin-flip and
spin-conserving collective modes in the spherical geometry. We use the
LLL-projected density-wave and composite fermion (CF) exciton states as trial
wave functions for these modes. To evaluate the dispersion of density-wave
states, we derive the commutation algebra of spinful LLL-projected density
operators on the sphere, which enables us to extract the gap of the
density-wave excitations from the numerically computed density-density
correlation function, i.e., the static structure factor, of the FQH ground
state. We find that the CF excitons provide an accurate description of the
collective modes at all wavelengths, while the density-wave states fail to do
so. Specifically, the spin-flip density wave reliably captures the spin-flip
collective mode only for the Laughlin and Halperin states, and that too only in
the long-wavelength limit. Interestingly, for spin-singlet primary Jain states,
the spin-conserving density mode is inaccurate even in the long-wavelength
regime. We show that this discrepancy stems from the presence of an additional
high-energy spin-conserving parton mode, similar to that found in fully
polarized secondary Jain states at $\nu{=}n/(4n{\pm}1)$. We propose an ansatz
for this parton mode and compute its Coulomb dispersion in the singlet state at
$\nu{=}2/5$. The predicted parton mode can be observed in circularly polarized
inelastic light scattering experiments.

Abstract: The theory of embedding and generalized synchronization in reservoir
computing has recently been developed. Under ideal conditions, reservoir
computing exhibits generalized synchronization during the learning process.
These insights form a rigorous basis for understanding reservoir computing
ability to reconstruct and predict complex dynamics. In this study, we
clarified the dynamical system structures of generalized synchronization and
embedding by comparing the Lyapunov exponents of a high dimensional neural
network within the reservoir computing model with those in actual systems.
Furthermore, we numerically calculated the Lyapunov exponents restricted to the
tangent space of the inertial manifold in a high dimensional neural network.
Our results demonstrate that all Lyapunov exponents of the actual dynamics,
including negative ones, are successfully identified.

Abstract: The study of experimental data is a relevant task in several physical,
chemical and biological applications. In particular, the analysis of chaotic
dynamics in cardiac systems is crucial as it can be related to some
pathological arrhythmias. When working with short and noisy experimental time
series, some standard techniques for chaos detection cannot provide reliable
results because of such data characteristics. Moreover, when small datasets are
available, Deep Learning techniques cannot be applied directly (that is, using
part of the data to train the network, and using the trained network to analyze
the remaining dataset). To avoid all these limitations, we propose an automatic
algorithm that combines Deep Learning and some selection strategies based on a
mathematical model of the same nature of the experimental data. To show its
performance, we test it with experimental data obtained from ex-vivo frog heart
experiments, obtaining highly accurate results.

Abstract: Optical fields provide an accessible platform to explore connections between
classical and quantum mechanics. We introduce a group-theoretic framework based
on the $\mathrm{su}(1,1)$ Lie algebra to construct classical analogs of
continuous-variable quantum states using the spatial degree of freedom of
paraxial scalar beams. Our framework maps squeezed number states onto scalar
beams expanded in orthonormal Gaussian modal bases, encompassing both Gaussian
and non-Gaussian classical analogs, including one- and two-mode squeezed beams.
To characterize the structural changes induced by squeezing, we examine
phase-space redistribution through Fourier analysis and optical Wigner
distribution functions. We derive analytical expressions for the waist,
curvature, and Gouy phase of two-mode squeezed Laguerre-Gaussian beams, and
establish a relation between the number of accessible modes and the achievable
squeezing under finite numerical aperture. While squeezing introduces spatial
and spectral correlations that reshape the beam structure, these beams remain
constrained by the diffraction limit, as confirmed by the numerical propagation
of apodized beams. These correlations give rise to classical entanglement. We
establish a classical analog of the Duan--Simon inseparability criterion for
continuous-variable two-mode Gaussian states. For non-Gaussian squeezed states,
we analyze the marginal optical Wigner distribution functions and identify
phase-space features, such as negativity, that act as witnesses of classical
continuous-variable entanglement. Our framework unifies classical analogs of
continuous-variable quantum states through beam engineering, enabling
quantum-inspired applications in optical imaging, metrology, and communication.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: LensPlus是一个基于深度学习的无 modifications框架，能够通过结合低NA和高NA的数据集来提高定量相位成像（QPI）的带宽-分辨率乘积（SBP）。该方法通过学习恢复低NA测量中丢失的高频特征，从而在保持广阔视野的同时提高了分辨率。结果表明，该技术能够在不修改设备的情况下显著改善成像性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着光学显微镜技术的发展，成像分辨率和视野范围之间的权衡成为研究者们需要解决的关键问题。传统的高NA和低NA显微镜之间的不足限制了图像质量的提升。

Method: LensPlus通过结合配对数据集，利用低NA和高NA显微镜获得的数据进行深度学习训练，以恢复低NA测量丢失的高频特征。该方法不依赖硬件修改，能够在保持视野和分辨率的基础上提升成像性能。

Result: 该方法将使用10x/0.3 NA和40x/0.95 NA显微镜获取的图像转为与使用40x/0.95 NA和100x/1.45 NA显微镜获得的图像质量相当，并且在SBP上提高了约1.87倍（1.43倍）。该改进通过非生成模型实现，确保了定量精度。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了通过深度学习改进SBP的可能性，提供了无修改设备的解决方案，为保持视野和提升分辨率提供了新选择，尤其适用于时序研究、大区域制图等场景。

Abstract: The space-bandwidth product (SBP) imposes a fundamental limitation in
achieving high-resolution and large field-of-view image acquisitions
simultaneously. High-NA objectives provide fine structural detail at the cost
of reduced spatial coverage and slower scanning as compared to a low-NA
objective, while low-NA objectives offer wide fields of view but compromised
resolution. Here, we introduce LensPlus, a deep learning-based framework that
enhances the SBP of quantitative phase imaging (QPI) without requiring hardware
modifications. By training on paired datasets acquired with low-NA and high-NA
objectives, LensPlus learns to recover high-frequency features lost in low-NA
measurements, effectively bridging the resolution gap while preserving the
large field of view and thereby increasing the SBP. We demonstrate that
LensPlus can transform images acquired with a 10x/0.3 NA objective (40x/0.95 NA
for another model) to a quality comparable to that obtained using a 40x/0.95 NA
objective (100x/1.45 NA for the second model), resulting in an SBP improvement
of approximately 1.87x (1.43x for the second model). Importantly, unlike
adversarial models, LensPlus employs a non-generative model to minimize image
hallucinations and ensure quantitative fidelity as verified through spectral
analysis. Beyond QPI, LensPlus is broadly applicable to other lens-based
imaging modalities, enabling wide-field, high-resolution imaging for time-lapse
studies, large-area tissue mapping, and applications where high-NA oil
objectives are impractical.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了对光速及光在介质中行为的理解，为其在教育中的应用提供了新的视角。

Abstract: While the numerical value of the speed of light is known with extraordinary
precision, its theoretical definition remains a subject of fundamental
interest. We show that the definition of mass and velocity of light follow from
the conserved quantities of the electromagnetic field. The proposed definition
of the speed of light is always bounded from above by the phase velocity and
equals it for plane waves. As a consequence, we obtain a generalization of
Einstein's mass-energy relation for electromagnetic fields in media: $m =
\varepsilon\mu E / c^2$. Hence, irrespective of the light's intensity, the
electromagentic field in near-zero-index material is always massless. This
approach offers new pedagogical insights into the fundamental nature of light
propagation.

Abstract: Unidirectional emission holds significant potential for advancing integrated
photonics and quantum information technologies. However, the inherent
randomness of spontaneous emission fundamentally makes its efficient
realization rather challenging. To address this, here we develop a quantitative
metric -- iso-frequency contour straightness and implement Fourier-transform
analysis of radiation patterns to systematically evaluate directional quality
of emission in photonic crystal (PhC) slabs. Through structural optimization,
we demonstrate single-emitter radiation efficiency enhancement while
maintaining low-loss unidirectional propagation. Furthermore, by strategically
positioning multi-emitter arrays within PhC platforms, we simultaneously
achieve scalable intensity amplification and superradiant emission via
cooperative effects. This synergy of photonic band engineering and collective
emitter coupling is able to realize unprecedented spatiotemporal coherence
control in quantum emitter arrays.

Abstract: The propagation path of topologically protected states is bound to the
interface between regions with different topology, and as such, the
functionality of linear photonic devices leveraging these states is fixed
during fabrication. Here, we propose a mechanism for dynamic control over a
driven dissipative system's local topology, yielding reconfigurable topological
interfaces and thus tunable paths for protected routing. We illustrate our
approach in non-resonantly pumped polariton lattices, where the nonlinear
interaction between the polaritons and the exciton reservoir due to
non-resonant pumping can yield a dynamical change of the topology. Moreover,
using a continuous model of the polariton system based on a driven-dissipative
Gross-Pitaevskii equation alongside the spectral localizer framework, we show
that the local changes in the nonlinear non-Hermitian system's topology are
captured by a local Chern marker. Looking forward, we anticipate such
reconfigurable topological routing will enable the realization of novel classes
of topological photonic devices.

Abstract: Silicon's indirect bandgap has long been seen as a limitation, fundamentally
restricting its ability to emit light and hindering the development of
silicon-based light sources. Here, we present a conceptually new solution to
this persistent challenge. We demonstrate ultrabroadband photo- and
electroluminescence from silicon, enabled by a novel radiative pathway mediated
by momentum-expanded Heisenberg photonic states that bypass phonon-assisted
transitions. This mechanism, previously demonstrated using metallic
nanoparticles as photon confiners, is now realized in an all-silicon material
using embedded sub-1.5 nm silicon nanoparticles to create confined photonic
states. The results show excellent agreement with prior studies, confirming
that the confinement size, rather than the specific confining material, is the
main factor for activating radiative transitions in a momentum-forbidden
system. Consistent with the photonic momentum expansion concept, both photo-
and electro-driven emissions span the visible and near-infrared spectral
ranges, with electroluminescence visible to the naked eye even under ambient
daylight conditions. The simplicity and material-agnostic nature of this
approach promise compatibility with standard fabrication processes, offering a
practical and transformative route toward high-performance, all-silicon
light-emitting diodes and laser sources. More generally, these findings reveal
the emergence of a new hybrid light-matter regime, photonic Heisenberg matter,
where extreme photon confinement directly reshapes the electronic transition
landscape.

Abstract: Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse
problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent
imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion
model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase
from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework
with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables
complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for
training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and
experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes,
imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups.
Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene
beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures,
highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a
cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in
computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent
imaging applications beyond holography.

Abstract: Nonlinear chiral light sources are crucial for emerging applications in
chiroptics, including ultrafast spin dynamics and quantum state manipulation.
However, achieving precise and dynamic control over nonlinear optical chirality
with natural materials and metasurfaces, particularly those based on
non-centrosymmetric materials such as lithium niobate (LN), is hindered by the
complex tensorial nature of the second-order nonlinear susceptibility. Here, we
demonstrate a nonlinear nonlocal metasurface, comprising plasmonic nanoantennas
atop an x-cut LN thin film, that enables dynamic and continuous control of
second-harmonic (SH) chirality. By leveraging two spectrally detuned resonances
arising from the excitation of orthogonally propagating guided modes, enabled
by lattice anisotropy and LN birefringence, we achieve full-range tuning of SH
chirality, from right- to left-handed circular polarization, simply by rotating
the polarization of a linearly polarized pump. The SH chirality, quantified by
the Stokes parameter S3, is thereby continuously tuned from 0.991 to -0.993 in
simulations and from 0.920 to -0.815 in experiments, while maintaining
consistently enhanced SH intensity across the entire tuning range. Our approach
opens new avenues for developing compact and tunable chiral sources, with
potential applications in integrated nonlinear photonics and adaptable quantum
technologies.

maintains consistent light sheet properties even in dense, scattering-prone

Abstract: Flat bands, characterized by zero group velocity and strong energy
localization, enable interaction-enhanced phenomena across both quantum and
classical systems. Existing photonic flat-band implementations were limited to
evanescent-wave systems, specific lattice symmetries, or complex supercell
modulations. A simple, universal, and efficient approach to realizing flat
bands without dedicated source excitation is to be explored. Here, inspired by
geometrically frustrated configurations, we theoretically proposed and
experimentally demonstrated threefold-degenerate flat bands by integrating
orbital and rotational degrees of freedom in a photonic dipolar kagome lattice.
By rotating the dipole orientation, the system exhibits a band flip transition
at which point all bands achieve complete flatness and degeneracy across the
entire Brillouin zone. In contrast to conventional s-orbital kagome lattices
with only a single flat band, our approach flattens the entire band structure,
eliminating dispersive modes and enabling compatibility with arbitrary
excitations. These results establish a new mechanism for flat-band engineering,
offering a tunable strategy for enhancing light-matter interactions and may
have applications in compact photonic devices and energy-efficient information
processing.

Abstract: Optical analog computing enables powerful functionalities, including spatial
differentiation, image processing, and ultrafast linear operations. Yet, most
existing approaches rely on resonant or periodic structures, whose performance
is strongly wavelength-dependent, imposing bandwidth limitations and demanding
stringent fabrication tolerances. Here, to address some of these challenges, we
introduce a highly tunable platform for optical processing, composed of two
cascaded uniform slabs exhibiting both circular and linear birefringence, whose
response exhibits features relevant to optical processing without relying on
resonances. Specifically, using a coupled-wave theory framework we show that
sharp reflection minima, referred to as spectral holes, emerge from destructive
interference between counter-propagating circularly polarized waves in uniform
birefringent slabs, and can be engineered solely through parameter tuning
without requiring any spatial periodicity. Unlike traditional Bragg scattering,
this mechanism operates without a resonance condition and enables a
comparatively broader spectral response through material parameter tuning in
spatially uniform media. When operated in the negative refraction regime
enabled by giant chirality, the proposed system acts as a
polarization-selective Laplacian-like operator, whose functionality is
evidenced by an edge-detection proof of concept. The required material
parameters align closely with recent experimental demonstrations of giant,
tunable chirality via meta-optics, presenting a promising pathway towards
compact and reconfigurable platforms for all-optical pattern recognition and
image restoration.

Abstract: Two-wavelength adaptive optics (AO) systems sense wavefront errors using a
beacon at one wavelength, while correcting for subsequent imaging or beam
projection at another. Although most AO systems operate in this manner, the
relevant AO literature is generally concerned with quantifying system
performance at a single wavelength, effectively ignoring the two-wavelength
nature of the problem. In this paper, we study the effects of anisoplanatism,
or the physical separation of the beacon and transmit light, on two-wavelength
AO systems for imaging and beam projection applications. We derive the
piston-removed (PR) and piston-and-tilt-removed (PTR) optical-path-difference
(OPD) variances including anisoplanatism, which are key metrics of AO system
performance. We compare our closed-form PR and PTR OPD variances to numerical
results and discuss their physical significance. In addition, we introduce the
two-wavelength isoplanatic angle and show how it can be used to quickly assess
two-wavelength AO system performance. At large, the analysis contained in this
paper will inform the design and implementation of two-wavelength AO systems
for multiple imaging and beam projection applications.

Abstract: Unlocking the full potential of integrated photonics requires versatile,
multi-functional devices that can adapt to diverse application demands.
However, confronting this challenge with conventional single-function
resonators often results in tedious and complex systems. We present an elegant
solution: a versatile and reconfigurable dual-polarization Si3N4 microresonator
that represents a paradigm shift in on-chip photonic designs. Our device, based
on a binary-star orbital architecture, can be dynamically reconfigured into
three distinct topologies: a M\"obius-like microcavity, a Fabry-P\'erot
resonator, and a microring resonator. This unprecedented functionality is
enabled by a tunable balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer that facilitates
controllable mutual mode coupling of counterpropagating lights using a single
control knob. We experimentally demonstrate that the device not only supports
polarization-diverse operation on a compact footprint but also gives rise to a
rich variety of physical phenomena, including a standing wave cavity, a
traveling wave cavity, free spectral range multiplication, and the photonic

Abstract: We demonstrate that narrowband multi-cycle terahertz (MC-THz) sources based
on periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) wafer stacks can be driven by high
repetition-rate, high energy femtosecond ytterbium-doped lasers. Operating at
10-kHz repetition rate with up to 104 W of pump power on a 10-wafer stack, we
measure 26.4 mW of THz average power for a narrowband multi-cycle source. We
identify and quantify strong lensing effects causing dramatic beam focusing in
47 wafer stacks which act as a primary limitation in the current configuration,
and present mitigation strategies for future scaling. This first study of high
average power narrowband multi-cycle THz sources offers a path forward to
Watt-level high repetition rate sources using thin lithium niobate plates.

Abstract: Modern high-definition display and augmented reality technologies require the
development of ultracompact micro- and nano-pixels with colors covering the
full gamut and high brightness. In this regard, lasing nano-pixels emitting
light in the spectral range 400-700 nm are highly demanded. Despite progress in
red, green, and ultraviolet nanolasers, the demonstrated blue-range (400-500
nm) single-particle-based lasers are still not subwavelength yet. Here we
fabricate CsPbCl$_3$ cubic-shaped single-crystal nanolasers on a silver
substrate by wet chemistry synthesis, producing their size range around 100-500
nm, where the nanoparticle with sizes
0.145$\mu$m$\times$0.195$\mu$m$\times$0.19$\mu$m and volume 0.005 $\mu$m$^3$
(i.e. $\sim\lambda^3$/13) is the smallest nanolaser among the lasers operating
in the blue range reported so far, with emission wavelength around
$\lambda\approx 415$ nm. Experimental results at a temperature of 80 K and
theoretical modeling show that the CsPbCl$_3$ nanolaser is a polaritonic laser
where exciton-polaritons are strongly coupled with Mie resonances enhanced by
the metallic substrate. As a result, the combination of the strong excitonic
response of CsPbCl$_3$ materials, its high crystalline quality, and optimized
optical resonant properties resulting in a population-inversion-free lasing
regime are the key factors making the proposed nanolaser design superior among
previously reported ones in the blue spectral range.

Abstract: Photons, unlike electrons, do not couple directly to magnetic fields, yet
synthetic gauge fields can impart magnetic-like responses and enable
topological transport. Discretized Floquet evolution provides a controlled
route, where the time-ordered sequencing of non-commuting Hamiltonians imprints
complex hopping phases and breaks time-reversal symmetry. However, stabilizing
such driven dynamics and observing unambiguous topological signatures on a
reconfigurable platform has remained challenging. Here we demonstrate synthetic
gauge fields for light on a programmable photonic processor by implementing
discretized Floquet drives that combine static and dynamic phases. This
approach reveals hallmark features of topological transport: chiral circulation
that reverses under drive inversion, flux-controlled interference with high
visibility, and robust directional flow stabilized by maximizing the minimal
Floquet quasi-energy gap. The dynamics are further characterized by a
first-harmonic phase order parameter, whose per-period winding number
quantifies angular drift and reverses sign with the drive order. These results
establish discretized, gap-optimized Floquet evolution as a versatile and fully
programmable framework for topological photonics, providing a compact route to
engineer gauge fields, stabilize driven phases, and probe winding-number
signatures of chiral transport.

Abstract: We review, critique, and extend results related to the problem of closed loop
shape equilibria of a string shooter, a type of catenary consisting of steady,
axially moving configurations of an inertial, inextensible, perfectly flexible
string in the presence of gravity and drag forces. We highlight recurring
misconceptions, and relate to similar problems, including the lariat (no
gravity), chain fountain (not closed), and heavy \emph{elastica} (bending
stiffness). We focus on the difficulty inherent to continuing a catenary
through a vertical orientation, necessary to close a loop, which difficulty
changes in nature as the system undergoes bifurcations with increasing drag. We
construct solutions by implementing available analytical results, and
numerically generate additional solutions with added bending stiffness. We
briefly discuss global balances of linear, angular, and pseudo-momentum for
this system.

Abstract: The Spin Physics Detector (SPD) experiment at the NICA collider in JINR aims
to investigate the spin structure of nucleons and spin-related phenomena. The
combination of the number of background processes, the event rate and

commercially available FPGA-based modules and high-speed optical interfaces
with custom-developed components based on widely accessible technologies. This
approach provides scalability from 180,000 at the initial stage of the
experiment to more than 600,000 detector channels in the final configuration

ensures adaptability for future upgrades while maintaining high efficiency and

TL;DR: Muon scattering tomography (MST) gains attention for imaging in short durations, but neglecting momentum affects image quality. This research proposes incorporating momentum into MST and determining Cherenkov detector thresholds using a 'equi-percentage scheme,' which sets thresholds based on muon momentum distribution. With only two detector layers, image quality improves significantly, reaching near-saturation with four layers. The study demonstrates that momentum measurement enhances MST performance, even with coarse measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon imaging has gained attention, but the neglect of muon momentum in MST reconstruction algorithms limits image quality. This research aims to address this issue by proposing momentum-based approaches and optimizing Cherenkov detector configurations.

Method: The research involves developing an algorithm to incorporate muon momentum into MST and establishing a 'equi-percentage scheme' for Cherenkov detector thresholds. The method uses cosmic muon momentum distribution to set thresholds and validates the approach through simulations with two to four detector layers.

Result: The proposed approach improves reconstructed image quality significantly, even with just two detector layers. With four layers, the system reaches near-saturation performance. This indicates that coarse momentum measurement using a small number of Cherenkov detectors can achieve high-quality imaging results.

Conclusion: Momentum measurement enhances the performance of short-duration MST. The 'equi-percentage scheme' for Cherenkov detectors enables near-optimal image quality with only two to four layers, demonstrating that coarse momentum measurement is effective for practical applications.

Abstract: Muon imaging, especially muon scattering tomography (MST), has recently
garnered significant attention. MST measures the magnitude of muon scattering
angles inside an object, which depends not only on the material properties but
also on the muon momentum. Due to the difficulty of simultaneous measurement of
momentum, it was neglected and taken as a constant in multiple MST
reconstruction algorithms. Recently, an experimental measurement scheme has
emerged that is feasible in engineering, but it requires many layers of
detectors to approach the true momentum. From this, we proposed both an
algorithm to incorporating momentum into MST, and a scheme to determine the
thresholds of Cherenkov detectors. This novel scheme, termed the
"equi-percentage scheme", sets momentum thresholds for Cherenkov detector
layers based on cosmic muon momentum distribution. Results showed our approach
delivers noticeable enhancement in reconstructed image quality even with only
two detector layers, reaching near-saturation performance with four layers.
This study proves that momentum measurement significantly enhances
short-duration MST, and that substantial improvement can be achieved with
relatively coarse momentum measurement using 2-4 layers of Cherenkov detectors.

Abstract: We investigate the geodesic motion of test particles around a charged
Euler-Heisenberg Anti-de Sitter black hole (CEH-AdS-BH) with a cloud of strings
(CoS) and surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). Our analysis examines
how the interplay between Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamic
corrections, string cloud, and PFDM distributions modifies fundamental BH
properties. We study dynamics of both massless photons and massive neutral test
particles, deriving the effective potentials and trajectory equations that
govern particle motion in this exotic spacetime. The photon sphere analysis
shows systematic increases in shadow radii with string cloud parameter
variations, while innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) calculations
demonstrate competing effects between string-induced gravitational weakening
and electromagnetic charge contributions. We examine scalar and electromagnetic
field perturbations using the Klein-Gordon and Maxwell equations, establishing
the perturbative potentials that characterize wave propagation in the modified
background. The scalar perturbative potential exhibits characteristic barrier
structures influenced by all exotic matter components, while electromagnetic
perturbations show fundamental differences due to their vector nature. Our
thermodynamic investigation extends the conventional framework by incorporating
additional intensive variables corresponding to cosmic string and perfect fluid
dark matter contributions. The specific heat capacity analysis reveals
divergence points that demarcate thermodynamically stable and unstable regions,
while the Gibbs free energy exhibits modified profiles that extend Anti-de
Sitter black hole thermodynamics into new parameter regimes.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个简洁的、解析的流体模型，为描述旋转曲线提供了一个物理上动机丰富的框架，值得在更大样本的 galaxy 上进行更广泛的研究。

Abstract: The anomalous rotation curves of galaxies provide compelling evidence for
dark matter, yet its fundamental nature and distribution remain key unresolved
issues in astrophysics. In this work, we investigate a dark matter model
derived from first principles within General Relativity, treating the halo as a
perfect fluid with a specific anisotropic equation of state characterized by a
single parameter. This framework yields two families of static, spherically
symmetric solutions: a Power-Law metric and a Logarithmic metric. As an initial
viability test, we fit the model's derived circular velocity profiles to the
dark matter contributions of representative galaxies from the SPARC database.
Our analysis reveals that the two solutions effectively describe different
regions of the halo: the Logarithmic form accurately models the large-radius
behavior, while the Power-Law form successfully reproduces the inner rotation
curve. Notably, the model consistently favors a shallow central density
profile, aligning with cored halo models and providing a fit for galaxies with
a gradual rise in velocity. We conclude that this simple, analytically-derived
fluid model provides a compelling and physically-motivated framework for
describing galactic rotation curves, warranting a more exhaustive study across
a larger sample of galaxies.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate two Dark Energy (DE) models characterized by
higher-order derivatives of the Hubble parameter $H$, which generalize
previously proposed DE scenarios. Assuming a power-law form of the scale factor
$a(t)$ given by $a(t)=b_0t^n$, we derive analytical expressions for the DE
energy density, pressure, the Equation of State (EoS) parameter, the
deceleration parameter and the evolutionary form of the fractional DE density.
Both non-interacting and interacting dark sector frameworks are examined, with
the interaction modeled through a coupling term proportional to the Dark Matter
(DM) energy density. For specific parameter sets corresponding to power-law
indices $n=2$, $n=3$, and $n=4$, we compute the present age of the Universe.
The obtained values deviate from the observationally inferred age of $\approx
13.8$ Gyr; however, a systematic trend is identified, with larger $n$ leading
to higher ages. Furthermore, interacting scenarios consistently predict larger
ages compared to their non-interacting counterparts. These results highlight
the phenomenological viability and limitations of higher-derivative DE models
in describing the cosmic evolution.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Bianchi I cosmology in Hu-Sawicki f(R) gravity, deriving a 4D dynamical system from field equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding cosmological dynamics in modified gravity theories like Hu-Sawicki f(R) is crucial for testing their viability against observations. Bianchi I models with anisotropy provide a framework to explore these dynamics.

Method: The authors derive a 4D dynamical system from the field equations of Hu-Sawicki f(R) gravity for homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi I cosmology. Fixed points and their stability are analyzed in both vacuum and matter cases.

Result: The analysis shows that Hu-Sawicki gravity allows for isotropization in both the past and future for vacuum and matter cases. For the matter case, isotropization occurs for dust, radiation, and cosmological constant. The phase space contains lines and 2D sheets of fixed points with rich phenomenology.

Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive dynamical systems analysis of Bianchi I cosmology in Hu-Sawicki f(R) gravity, highlighting the isotropization behavior and the structure of fixed points in the phase space, which offers valuable insights into the gravitational theory's cosmological applications.

Abstract: We perform the dynamical system analysis for the homogeneous and anisotropic
Bianchi I cosmology in the context of Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity with parameters
$\{n,C_{1}\}=\{1,1\}$. Deriving the corresponding four-dimensional dynamical
system from the field equations allows us to find the fixed points of the
system in both the vacuum and matter cases alongside their stability. This
approach also provides analytical expressions for both the cosmic expansion and
shear of each fixed point. We show that, for the chosen parameters, Hu-Sawicki
gravity allows for isotropization both in the past and in the future for both
vacuum and matter. For the matter case, the analysis was subdivided into the
dust, radiation and cosmological constant cases, and we show that all three
cases exhibit past and future isotropization. The obtained results also
revealed interesting aspects of the phase space such as the existence and
phenomenology of lines and two-dimensional sheets of fixed points.

Abstract: I investigate spacetime singularities from the point of view of the
wavefunction of the universe. In order to extend the classical notion of
geodesic incompleteness one has to include the proper time of an observer as a
degree of freedom in the Wheeler DeWitt equation. This leads to a Schr\"odinger
equation along the observer worldline. Near the singularity, as in the
classical BLK treatment, I ignore spatial gradients and effectively describe
the spacetime around the worldline in the mini-superspace approximation. The
problem proves identical to a spherically symmetric scattering of a quantum
particle off a central potential and singularity avoidance is tantamount to the
unitary evolution of this system. Standard types of matter (dust, radiation)
correspond to regular potentials and thus lead to a bounce. The most singular
component, spatial anisotropy, is associated to a conserved charge and yields a
negative inverse-square potential-like standard angular momentum, but with
opposite sign. This potential is critical, in that the unitarity of the
evolution depends on the actual numerical factor in front of it, i.e., on the
anisotropy charge.

Abstract: The spectrum of radial oscillations of neutron stars is systematically
studied within two frameworks of viscous relativistic hydrodynamics: the
relativistic Navier-Stokes and Israel-Stewart theories. A correspondence is
established between the discrete stellar eigenmodes and the continuous
dispersion relation of perturbations around a homogeneous fluid, providing a
basis for interpreting our numerical results. We analyze the Newtonian limit
and assess the impact of relativistic corrections, such as the gravitational
redshifting of microscopic relaxation timescales. We show that bulk viscosity
can significantly affect the behavior of both hydrodynamic and nonhydrodynamic
fundamental modes, and that, depending on the magnitude of the viscous effects,
it is the nonhydrodynamic mode that becomes unstable beyond the turning point
in a sequence of equilibrium configurations. These results provide a useful
step toward systematic studies of neutron star quasinormal modes in the
presence of viscosity.

Abstract: Black holes are believed to possess vanishing Love numbers, which implies
that they do not deform in the presence of external tides. This fact has been
verified in a number of scenarios, that involve tides of bosonic fields of
various natures (e.g. scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational), and has
triggered active research in trying to identify the underlying reason.
Surprisingly, two counterexamples have been found recently. The first, concerns
charged-field tides on electrically-charged black holes. In that case, however,
the response cannot be disentangled from dissipative effects, and might thus be
argued to not consist of a truly conservative deformation. The second concerns
fermionic tides on neutral holes. While these yield a purely conservative
response, they lack a classical interpretation, which is the physical regime
where black hole deformability is understood. Here, we consider magnetic
Reissner-Nordstrom black holes and show that electrically-charged, scalar-field
tides induce non-vanishing tidal Love numbers. We prove that this is a purely
non-dissipative effect, in contrast to the cases of rotating or
electrically-charged black holes, and hence consists of a genuine deformation.
In addition, the magnetic charge resolves common ambiguities in defining Love
numbers, so our result does not rely on any regularisation scheme. This
constitutes a clear realisation of how new physics can influence black hole
tidal deformability, and offers new perspectives on the study of black hole
Love numbers.

Abstract: The anisotropic influence on the $f$-mode frequency of oscillations and
dimensionless tidal deformability of strange quark matter are analyzed by
employing the nonradial oscillation equations for the complete general
relativity frame and tidal deformability equations, which are derived and
modified from their standard form to introduce the anisotropic factor. The
fluid in the compact star follows the MIT bag model with vector coupling. For
the anisotropic function, we use a local anisotropy, which is regular along the
whole star and is null both at the center and on the star's surface. We show
that the $f$-frequency of oscillation and dimensionless tidal deformability
change considerably with the anisotropy. Finally, we investigate the
correlation between the dimensionless tidal deformability of the GW$170817$
event with the anisotropy.

Abstract: We derive a class of regular black holes from the proper-time renormalization
group approach to asymptotically safe gravity. A central challenge is the
robustness of physical predictions to the regularization scheme. We address
this by computing key observables for our quantum-corrected black holes, which
are non-singular and asymptotically Schwarzschild. We calculate the quasinormal
mode spectrum, finding significant deviations from the classical case. The
Hawking radiation spectrum is strongly suppressed, implying a slower
evaporation rate and relaxed constraints on primordial black holes as dark
matter. Shadows and ISCO radii remain consistent with observations. Our results
demonstrate that the singularity resolution and its primary observational
implications are robust physical outcomes.

Conclusion: 增强对黑洞物理过程的理解，尤其是守恒和能量无穷大的局限性。

Abstract: We consider the behavior of the analogue of the Lemaitre time when a particle
approaches the horizon of a rotating black hole. For the Kerr metric, the
aforementioned time coincides with the Doran or Natario time but we consider a
more general class of metrics. We scrutiny relationship between (i) its
finiteness or divergence, (ii) the forward-in-time condition, (iii) the sign of
a generalized momentum/energy, (iv) the validity of the principle of kinematic
censorship. The latter notion means impossibility to release in any event an
energy which is literally infinite. As a consequence, we obtain a new
explanation, why collisions of two particles inside the horizon do not lead to
infinite energy in their center of mass frame. The same results are also
obtained for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric

Abstract: In this work, we apply the generalised Feshbach Villars transformation (GFVT)
to spin-0 scalar fields in a Schwarzschild gravitational background. Starting
from the covariant Klein Gordon equation, we reformulate the dynamics in the FV
two-component representation, which enables a natural separation of positive-
and negative-energy branches. In the far-field approximation, the system
exhibits a hydrogen like bound spectrum, confirming the ability of GFVT to
provide a consistent probabilistic interpretation in curved spacetime. We then
extend the formalism by introducing a relativistic harmonic oscillator
potential, which transforms the radial equation into a biconfluent Heun form.
The requirement of square integrability leads to a discrete oscillator spectrum
that remains independent of the gravitational parameter, with gravity appearing
only through selection rules on the admissible quantum states. Explicit wave
functions, probability densities, and graphical results are presented,
illustrating the internal consistency of the method. Overall, this study
demonstrates the effectiveness of GFVT as a bridge between relativistic quantum
mechanics and curved geometry, and it highlights its potential for future
applications in strong gravitational fields.

Result: 随着观察角度和旋转速度的变化，EVPA表现出复杂的变化趋势，具体取决于黑洞的几何参数。

Conclusion:  EVPA的变化与black hole参数和观察角度密切相关，为理解极端黑洞环境提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, Hou et al. [Astrophys. J. Lett. 988, L51 (2025)] revealed that the
EVPA (Electric Vector Position Angle) of polarization vectors in the
near-horizon images is governed solely by spacetime geometry and is
irrespective of the plasma flows. Here, we generalize the study to the scenario
of a rotating hair black hole within Horndeski gravity and probe the effects of
the hairy parameter on the EVPA. For a fixed inclination, the hairy parameter
enhances the observed EVPA in the slowly rotating case, but decreases it in the
rapidly rotating case. For a fixed black hole spin, the influence of the hairy
parameter on the observed EVPA under different observer inclinations is further
modulated by the azimuthal angle of the observed polarization vector. The hairy
parameter's impact is more distinct in the low inclination case as the
azimuthal angle lies within a specific range, but is almost independent of the
observer inclination as the azimuthal angle is beyond this specific range.
Furthermore, the dependence of the hairy parameter's impact on the EVPA is
stronger with respect to the black hole spin than to the inclination angle.
These results could help to further understand the near-horizon polarized
images and Horndeski gravity.

Abstract: In this work, we explore a possible application of a machine learning
classifier for candidate events in a template-based search for
gravitational-wave (GW) signals from various compact system sources. We analyze
data from the O3a and O3b data acquisition campaign, during which the
sensitivity of ground-based detectors is limited by real non-Gaussian noise
transient. The state-of-the-art searches for such signals tipically rely on the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a chi-square test to assess the consistency of
the signal with an inspiral template. In addition, a combination of these and
other statistical properties are used to build a 're-weighted SNR' statistics.
We evaluate a Random Forest classifiers on a set of double-coincidence events
identified using the MBTA pipeline. The new classifier achieves a modest but
consistent increase in event detection at low false positive rates relative to
the standard search. Using the output statistics from the Random Forest
classifier, we compute the probability of astrophysical origin for each event,
denoted as $p_\mathrm{astro}$. This is then evaluated for the events listed in
existing catalogs, with results consistent with those from the standard search.
Finally, we search for new possible candidates using this new statistics, with
$p_\mathrm{astro} > 0.5$, obtaining a new subthreshold candidate (IFAR =0.05)
event at $gps: 1240423628$ .

Abstract: The field of gravitational wave (GW) detection is progressing rapidly, with
several next-generation observatories on the horizon, including LISA. GW data
is challenging to analyze due to highly variable signals shaped by source
properties and the presence of complex noise. These factors emphasize the need
for robust, advanced analysis tools. In this context, we have initiated the
development of a low-latency GW detection pipeline based on quantum neural
networks (QNNs). Previously, we demonstrated that QNNs can recognize GWs
simulated using post-Newtonian approximations in the Newtonian limit. We then
extended this work using data from the LISA Consortium, training QNNs to
distinguish between noisy GW signals and pure noise. Currently, we are
evaluating performance on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset and comparing
it against classical methods. Our results show that QNNs can reliably
distinguish GW signals embedded in noise, achieving classification accuracies
above 98\%. Notably, our QNN identified 5 out of 6 mergers in the Sangria blind
dataset. The remaining merger, characterized by the lowest amplitude,
highlights an area for future improvement in model sensitivity. This can
potentially be addressed using additional mock training datasets, which we are
preparing, and by testing different QNN architectures and ansatzes.

Abstract: In this work, our aim is to obtain a Hamiltonian formulation suitable for
canonical quantization. Moreover, we assume that the early Universe can be
described with fewer initial symmetries, thus we abandon the isotropy
assumption and instead explore anisotropic universes, beginning with the
simplest one, namely Bianchi I (BI). The presence of small initial fluctuations
in the early universe can be well described by perturbations around a
homogeneous background. GR is a constrained system, and we apply the so-called
Dirac procedure for constrained systems to derive a gauge-invariant Hamiltonian
formulation suitable for quantization. In this work, we present how this
procedure can be extended to a generic background and its relation to the
Kuchar decomposition. Subsequently, we apply this formulation to a BI universe,
obtaining new and interesting results on the gauge-invariant representation of
matter and geometry perturbations. Contrary to the FLRW case, in which all the
modes decouple, in BI we see that scalar and tensor modes do not decouple. We
show that new types of gauge-fixing conditions exit in this case. For instance,
a gravitational wave can be encoded into scalar modes, by introducing a new
gauge which is not valid in FLRW. Furthermore, we make a first step towards a
consistent and unified quantization of the composite system made of a
background mode and perturbation modes. Specifically, we study tensor modes in
a FLRW universe. We focus on the relation between the choice of internal time
of the universe and the quantum evolution it undergoes. Our results indicate
that the time reparametrization invariance in general relativity affects the
quantum evolution of the background and perturbation modes. However, in the
classical limit, i.e. for a large universe, the dynamics becomes unique. Thus,
the predictive power of the theory is maintained.

Abstract: We construct exact solutions that describe the near horizon region of
extremal rotating black holes in Einstein-Born-Infeld theory. Using generalized
Komar integrals, we extract the electric charge and angular momentum from the
near horizon geometries and study their deviations from the Kerr-Newman
solution. We identify two features that are direct consequences of the
nonlinearities of Born-Infeld theory. First, we find solutions which have
vanishing charge but nontrivial electric and magnetic fields. Second, we find
that extremal rotating black holes do not exist for sufficiently small charge
and angular momentum. Based on analogy with the static black holes, we argue
that it would be particularly interesting to construct the full rotating
solutions in these parameter regions as they may provide examples of rotating
black holes without Cauchy horizons.

Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a perfect liquid drop at the
equilibrium is extended to rotating systems with a small frequency $\omega$
within the effective-surface (ES) approach. The NS angular momentum $I$ and
moment of inertia (MI) for a slow stationary azimuthal rotation around the
symmetry axis is calculated by using the Kerr metric approach in the
Boyer-Lindquist and Hogan forms for the perfect liquid-drop model of NSs. The
gradient surface terms of the NS energy density $\mathcal{E}(\rho)$ [Equation
of State] are taken into account along with the volume ones at the leading
order of the leptodermic parameter $a/R \ll 1$, where $a$ is the ES crust
thickness and $R$ is the mean NS radius. The macroscopic NS angular momentum
$I$ at small frequencies $\omega$, up to quadratic terms, can be specified for
calculations of the adiabatic MI, $\Theta=d I/d \omega$, by using Hogan's inner
gravitational metric, $r\le R$. The NS MI,
$\Theta=\tilde{\Theta}/(1-\mathcal{G}_{t\varphi})$, was obtained in terms of
the statistically averaged MI, $\tilde{\Theta}$, and its time and azimuthal
angle correlation, $\mathcal{G}_{t\varphi}$, as sumes of the volume and surface
components. The MI $\Theta$ depends dramatically on its effective radius $R$
because of a strong gravitation. We found the significant shift of the
Schwarzschild radius $R_{\rm S}$ to a much smaller position due to the time and
azimuthal correlation term $\mathcal{G}_{t\varphi}$. The adiabaticity condition
is carried out for several neutron stars in a strong gravitation case.

Abstract: Asymptotic velocity domination (AVD) posits that when back-propagated to the
Big Bang generic cosmological spacetimes solve a drastically simplified version
of the Einstein field equations, where all dynamical spatial gradients are
absent (similar as in the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz scenario). Conversely,
a solution can in principle be reconstructed from its behavior near the Big
Bang. This property has been rigorously proven for the Gowdy class of
cosmologies, both polarized and unpolarized. Here we establish for the
polarized case a quantum version of the AVD property formulated in terms of
two-point functions of (the integrands of) Dirac observables: these correlators
approach their much simpler velocity dominated counterparts when the time
support is back-propagated to the Big Bang. Conversely, the full correlators
can be expressed as a uniformly convergent series in averaged spatial gradients
of the velocity dominated ones.

Abstract: Detecting unmodeled gravitational wave (GW) bursts presents significant
challenges due to the lack of accurate waveform templates required for
matched-filtering techniques. A primary difficulty lies in distinguishing
genuine signals from transient noise. Machine learning approaches, particularly
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer promising alternatives for this
classification problem. This paper presents a CNN-based pipeline for detecting
short GW bursts (duration $< 10~\mathrm{s}$), adapted from an existing
framework designed for longer-duration events. The CNN has been trained on
core-collapse supernova (CCSN) gravitational waveform models injected into
simulated Gaussian noise. The network successfully identifies these signals and
generalizes to CCSN waveforms not included in the training set, showing the
potential of U-Net architectures for detecting short-duration gravitational
wave transients across diverse astrophysical scenarios.

Motivation: Detecting gravitational waves is a key goal in modern physics, and this work contributes methods to achieve it.

Method: The study uses high-precision timing and non-locality principles, focusing on clock desynchronization as a detection mechanism.

Result: An optimal detector design around 1 Hz is proposed, suitable for detecting intermediate mass black hole binaries.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for feasible gravitational wave detectors by leveraging current technologies and theoretical insights.

Abstract: The experimental possibility of detecting gravitational waves via their
induced time perturbations is explored here, expanding from previous work. The
oscillations of the time-time component in the metric are made explicit when
working in asynchronous gauges: the desynchronization between a perturbed clock
and a reference unperturbed clock constitutes the corresponding observable core
target of a detector. To this end we explore the experimental techniques
currently available for a preliminary assessment towards a feasibility study.
We survey the state of the art in the fields of high precision timing and
information preservation, necessary for achieving geodesic non-locality. A
synthesis for a feasible prototype detector with the desired characteristics is
presented. The optimum point between existing technologies is found around the
1 Hz frequency band, opening the window for the observation of classes of
speculated sources of gravitational radiation such as intermediate mass black
hole binaries.

formulated in terms of dynamical coordinate transformations, within the

Motivation: 该论文旨在发展超黎曼面之间的解析映射理论，以增强超对称场论中的数学框架，特别是在共形场论和弦论的上下文中，这为理解更深刻的理论结构提供了工具。

tensionless string theory on $\text{AdS}_3\times S^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$. In the
former, they can be used to calculate correlators in a manifestly

correlators with space-time supersymmetry.

Abstract: We study the dynamics and phase structure of Abelian gauge theories in
$d=1+1$ dimensions. These include $U(1)$ gauge theory coupled to a scalar and a
fermion, as well as the two-flavour Schwinger model with different charges.
Both theories exhibit a surprisingly rich phase diagram as masses are varied,
with both $c=1$ and $c=1/2$ critical lines or points. We build up to the study
of 2d chiral gauge theories, which hold particular interest because they
provide a mechanism for symmetric mass generation, a phenomenon in which
fermions become gapped without breaking chiral symmetries.

Abstract: The maximal gauged supergravities in five spacetime dimensions with gauge
groups contained in $\mathbb{R}^+ \times \textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ are described. The
$\textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ factor is the duality group of ungauged maximal
supergravity and $\mathbb{R}^+$ is the scaling symmetry of the five-dimensional
metric, usually called the \textit{trombone} symmetry. The equations of motion
and supersymmetry variations for these supergravities are given to lowest order
in fermions, and the mass matrices are provided. Then, the theories with gauge
groups contained in a maximal subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^+ \times
\textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ are classified, and a new family of such supergravities
uncovered. For a concrete theory in this class, some supersymmetric anti-de
Sitter vacua are found and their mass spectra computed within the gauged
supergravity. These vacua are argued to be related to superconformal phases of
the M5-brane field theory.

Abstract: Strongly motivated by a mathematical result by Lin and Yamashita
(arXiv:2412.02298), we describe a long exact sequence formed by groups of
equivalence classes of two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}{=}(0,1)$ supersymmetric
quantum field theories (SQFTs) with and without $SU(2)$ symmetry. As an
application, we study chiral fermions in heterotic compactifications with
$SU(2)$ symmetry of level one to four dimensions, and show that each
even-dimensional irreducible representation of $SU(2)$ appears even times,
assuming the conjectural relation between topological modular forms and SQFTs.
This implies the absence of the Witten anomaly, but contains more information
than that.

Abstract: This paper studies novel four-dimensional integrable field theories that are
deformations of self-dual Yang-Mills. They are engineered by considering
holomorphic Chern-Simons and BF type theories on covers of twistor space
obtained by pulling back the vector bundle $\mathcal{O}(1)^2\to\mathbb{CP}^1$
to hyperelliptic or elliptic curves. Compactifying to 4d yields an integrable
theory, which in the examples I study, are determined to leading order. The
form of the higher-order corrections are bootstrapped, and I argue that the
index structure and coefficients of these terms are fixed by integrability. The
celestial chiral algebras of these theories are shown to live on hyper-elliptic
and elliptic curves, respectively. Symmetry reducing these integrable
deformations to 2d yields an example of a hyperelliptic and elliptic integrable
model governing a deformation of Hitchin's equations.

Abstract: Recently, \cite{Cao:2025hio} demonstrated the $2$-split for form factor under
specific kinematic constraints. This factorization is analogous to that
observed in scattering amplitudes. A key consequence of this structure is the
presence of hidden zeros, where the form factors vanish on specific kinematic
loci. We first establish these zeros and a new zero for the form factors of the
composite operators ${\cal O} =\frac{1}{2}\Tr((\partial \phi)^2) + \Tr(\phi^3)$
and ${\cal O} = \Tr(F^2)$, and then employ an inductive proof based on the BCFW
recursion relation to prove the $2$-split factorization for any number of
external particles.

Abstract: An interesting class of time dependent backgrounds in $1+1$ dimensional
string theory involves worldsheet Liouville walls which move in (target space)
time. When a parameter in such a background exceeds a certain critical value,
the speed of the Liouville wall exceeds the speed of light, and there is no
usual S-Matrix. We examine such backgrounds in the dual $c=1$ matrix model from
the point of view of fluctuations of the collective field, and determine the
nature of the emergent space-time perceived by these fluctuations. We show that
so long as the corresponding Liouville wall remains time-like, the emergent
space time is conformal to full Minkowski space with a time-like wall. However,
for the cases where the Liouville wall is superluminal, the emergent space-time
has a {\em space-like boundary} where the collective field couplings diverge.
This appears as a space-like singularity in perturbative collective field
theory. We comment on the necessity of incorporating finite $N$, as well as
finite (double-scaled) coupling, effects to understand the behavior of the
exact theory near this boundary.

Abstract: We perform three T-dualities on previously found, classical $\mathcal{N}=1$
scale-separated AdS$_3$ solutions of massive type IIA supergravity. These
solutions arose from a compactification on a toroidal $G_2$-holonomy space with
smeared O2/D2 and O6/D6 sources. The T-dual backgrounds are classical
$\mathcal{N}=1$ AdS$_3$ solutions of type IIB supergravity with O5/D5 and O9/D9
sources (type I) compactified on a space with $G_2$-structure and non-vanishing
Ricci scalar. We generalize the original solutions in IIA in the T-dual picture
and present on the type IIB side fully classical solutions with parametric
control, scale separation, and integer conformal dimensions for the dual
operators in the corresponding CFT. We also obtain strongly coupled solutions
with the same properties. These are S-dual to parametrically controlled
classical solutions of the heterotic SO(32) string theory.

Abstract: The consideration of timelike boundaries in de Sitter static patches has a
broad motivation, such as the formulation of a well-defined canonical ensemble
and the realization of a natural framework for static patch holography. In this
work we study Jackiw-Teitelboim de Sitter gravity with symmetric timelike
reflecting boundaries, which, in the presence of both cosmological and "black
hole" horizons, naturally separate the spacetime into a "black hole system" and
a "cosmological system". We apply the island formula to compute the
entanglement entropy of conformal matter in both systems. In the "black hole
system" an island appears, causing the entanglement entropy to saturate at the
horizon value and preventing late-time growth. In the "cosmological system" no
island appears, and the entanglement entropy can become arbitrarily large
depending on the position of the boundaries, indicating a tension with
unitarity.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of conserved charges on the dynamics
of spread complexity of quantum states. Building on the notion of
symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity [1], we extend the framework to general
quantum states and analyze the relation between the total spread complexity and
its decomposition into fixed-charge sectors. After exploring a range of
analytical examples and using orthogonal polynomial approach, we identify
conditions under which spread complexity exhibits equipartition across sectors.
Finally, we discuss quantum speed limits that constrain the growth of
complexity in the presence of conserved charges.

Abstract: We investigate loop corrections to the four-point function of identical

holographically dual to AdS with a quartic interaction. We focus on the
universal part of the correlator that, at any order in $1/N$, is completely
determined by tree-level data. We show how this contribution controls the part
of the anomalous dimensions of double-trace operators, that exhibits a
characteristic $\log \ell$ dependence at large spin $\ell$. We resum these
effects to all orders in $1/N$ and show that they admit a natural effective
description in AdS. Finally, by reformulating the problem in Mellin space, we
demonstrate that the same contribution corresponds to consecutive unitarity
cuts of bubble diagrams in the flat space limit.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the properties of the renormalisation group (RG) flow of
two-dimensional sigma models with a generic metric coupling by utilising known
results for the Ricci flow. We point out that on many occasions the RG flow
develops singularities, due to strong coupling behaviour, before it reaches a
UV or an IR fixed point. We illustrate our analysis with several examples. We
give particular emphasis to type I singularities, where the length of the
curvature of the sigma model target space grows at most as $|t-T|^{-1}$ as the
flow parameter $t$ approaches the singularity at $T$. For these, the geometry
near the singularity is described in terms of a shrinking Ricci soliton that
exhibits a cosmological constant even though the original RG flow does not.
  Assuming that the spacetime satisfies an RG flow equation, we use the Ricci
solitons to introduce a cosmological constant in a string theory setting. This
can allow for different cosmological constants at different regions of
spacetime. In particular, we point out how the de-Sitter space is a solution of
the theory. We also raise the question on whether the techniques used to prove
the geometrisation conjecture can be applied to prove the homogeneity and
isotropy of the universe at large scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work introduces a novel mathematical framework for understanding symmetry protected topological phases and their boundaries by combining category theory and quantum field theory.

Method: The authors define $	extbf{Sky}^	au(G)$, analyze its convolution tensor product, and compute S/T-matrices for $G=U(1)$. They also explore the non-abelian case and discuss quasi-coherent sheaves.

Result: The main result is that the Drinfeld center of $	extbf{Sky}^	au(G)$ provides a comprehensive description of the symmetry and boundaries, verified with explicit calculations for $U(1)$ and an outline for $SU(2)$.

Conclusion: This framework successfully categorifies and relates symmetry anomalies to topological boundary conditions in higher dimensions.

Abstract: We define the symmetry category in 1+1d for continuous 0-form $G$-symmetry to
be $\textbf{Sky}^\tau(G)$, the category of skyscraper sheaves of finite
dimensional vector spaces with finite support on the group manifold of $G$,
where $\tau \in H^4(BG,\mathbb{Z})$ is the anomaly. We propose that the
corresponding 2+1d SymTFT is described by the Drinfeld center of
$\textbf{Sky}^\tau(G)$. We show explicitly the way that $\tau$ twists the
convolution tensor product of the objects of $\textbf{Sky}^\tau(G)$. As a
concrete example, we present the $S$ and $T$-matrices for the simple anyons of
the resulting $Z(\textbf{Sky}^\tau(G))$ category for $G = U(1)$, both for the
cases without or with anomaly and discuss the topological boundary conditions
as Lagrangian algebra of $Z(\textbf{Sky}^{\tau}(U(1)))$. We also present the
definition of $\textbf{Sky}^\tau(G)$ and $Z(\textbf{Sky}^\tau(G))$ for the
non-abelian case of $G=SU(2)$, as well as the speculated modular data. We point
out that in order to have a physically relevant center and Lagrangian algebras
it is necessary to generalize $\textbf{Sky}^\tau(G)$ to a larger category,
which we argue to be closely related to the category of quasi-coherent sheaves
on $G_\mathbb{C}$ with convolution tensor product twisted by $\tau$.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new statistical method for analyzing toric bases in F-theory models using base polytopes, displaying a Gaussian distribution in relevant polytopes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of F-theory models benefits from simplifying complex geometries through statistical methods, particularly in understanding the distribution of key geometric elements.

Method: A Monte Carlo approach was developed to randomly sample base polytopes within specified bounds, accounting for statistical weights, and validated against exact data.

Result: The research found approximately 10^85 to 10^90 distinct 3D base polytopes, with a Gaussian distribution in their vertex count and non-Higgsable gauge groups.

Conclusion: This method provides a framework for exploring large classes of F-theory geometries, leveraging statistical distributions to handle complexity.

Abstract: We propose a new statistical ensemble of toric bases for elliptic Calabi-Yaus
used in F-theory models, by focusing on only the convex hull of the base, i.e.,
the base polytope. This physically motivated coarse-graining greatly simplifies
the combinatorial complexity of the part of the 4D F-theory landscape with
toric bases. We develop a Monte Carlo approach that randomly samples the base
polytopes within fixed boxes, with proper statistical weights. We first apply
the algorithm to the set of 2d base polytopes, generating an enlarged set of
toric 2d bases that include certain types of codimension-two (4,6) points, and
we validate our approach against exact numbers. We then explore the set of 3d
base polytopes which fit in a set of ``maximal'' 3d boxes, and estimate the
total number of inequivalent 3d base polytopes to be $\sim 10^{85}$--$10^{90}$.
We provide statistical data such as the distribution of non-Higgsable gauge
groups on these bases. Amusingly, a similar method can also be applied to
generate reflexive polytopes in various dimensions. In both the reflexive and
base polytope cases, the number of relevant polytopes obeys a Gaussian
distribution as a function of the number of vertices, which can be understood
in terms of other results on random polytopes in the math literature.

theories describing a spontaneous symmetry breaking phase in the higher-form

expectation values for global symmetries and (ii) deformed noise constraints in
gauge or gravitational theories.

TL;DR: A new truncation is discovered for four-derivative heterotic supergravity, which precisely preserves the bosonic action of heterotic supergravity with gauge fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper explores truncations of four-derivative heterotic supergravity, which is a specialized topic in theoretical physics, aiming to understand the structure of these gravitational theories with added derivative terms.

Method: The authors use algebraic reduction and symmetry analysis by constraining fields on a toroidal manifold, relying on the properties of O(d+p,d) and O(d+p,d+p) symmetries to achieve truncation.

Result: As an outcome, the paper discovers a new consistent truncation that maintains all vector multiplets, which directly corresponds to the bosonic part of heterotic supergravity with full gauge symmetry.

Conclusion: This advancement aids in comprehending the effective actions of higher-derivative gravity theories and their associated solutions, particularly in\ngravitational multipole moments and thermodynamic properties, by extending known solutions like the Kerr-Sen metric into more general frameworks. The\ndiscovery of distinct multipole structures in different truncations broadens the scope of gravitational solutions in these theories.

Abstract: Four-derivative heterotic supergravity (without gauge fields) reduced on a
$p$-dimensional torus leads to half-maximal supergravity coupled to $p$ vector
multiplets, and it is known that removing the vector multiplets is a consistent
truncation of the theory. We find a new consistent truncation of
four-derivative heterotic supergravity on a torus that keeps the vector
multiplets and precisely reproduces the bosonic action of heterotic
supergravity (with heterotic gauge fields). We show that both truncations have
an $O(d+p,d)$ symmetry when reduced on a $d$-dimensional torus and demonstrate
how this embeds in the $O(d+p,d+p)$ symmetry that one gets from reducing on a
$(d+p)$-dimensional torus without truncation. We then use our new truncation to
obtain four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution and compute
thermodynamic quantities and multipole moments. Finally, we compare the
Kerr-Sen solutions of the actions corresponding to the two different choices of
truncation with the Kerr solution, the Kerr-Newman solution, and each other,
and show that they have distinct four-derivative multipole structures.

Motivation: The increasing complexity of trapped ion-atom interacting systems necessitates more efficient computational methods to allow for real-time analysis and synthesis of simulation data.

Method: A GPU-accelerated MATLAB script called atomiongpu.m was developed, which makes use of an optimized implementation of the Runge-Kutta algorithm, ode45gpu, offering up to 22x speedup compared to standard MATLAB ode45.

Result: The implementation drastically accelerates the simulations, making it feasible to explore a wider range of parameters in trap potentials and assess various atom-ion interactions while providing distributions of observables such as scattering angles and complex lifetimes.

Conclusion: The paper presents a powerful computational tool for studying trapped ion-atom interactions with enhanced performance and wider applicability.

Abstract: We present a MATLAB script which can use GPU acceleration to simulate a
trapped ion interacting with a low-density cloud of atoms. This script, called

trapped ion and an atom starting far away. The script uses ode45gpu, which is
our optimized and specialized implementation of the Runge-Kutta algorithm used
in MATLAB's ODE solver ode45. We first discuss the physical system and show how
ode45gpu can solve it up to 22x faster than MATLAB's ode45. Then, we show how
to easily modify the inputs to atomiongpu.m to account for different kinds of
atoms, ions, atom-ion interactions, trap potentials, simulation parameters,
initial conditions, and computational hardware, so that atomiongpu.m
automatically finds the probability of complex formation, the distribution of
observables such as the scattering angle and complex lifetime, and plots of

Abstract: We present a method for determining the azimuthal phase (angle) of a magnetic
field by exploiting phase matching of laser beams in a ground-state Hanle
effect (GHSE) configuration. This approach is based on the symmetry of the
system's Hamiltonian and the existence of a phase-independent frame, allowing
for direct determination of the field orientation. As a proof of concept, we
performed preliminary experiments using the Fg=1 to Fe=0 transition of the D2
line in 87Rb, with three laser beams to demonstrate the phase (azimuthal)
dependence of the observed Hanle resonance signals. While our current setup
does not include active phase control, the key features predicted by our method
were observed, validating its conceptual foundation. Additionally, we measured
two components of the stray magnetic field in our laboratory as an
illustration. This method leverages the Hanle effect's inherent sensitivity to
both the magnitude and orientation of magnetic fields, as well as the
underlying symmetry properties of the atomic system, and offers a pathway for
precise, calibration-free determination of magnetic field orientation.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate a high-performance surface acoustic wave (SAW)
delay line based on a Scandium alloyed aluminum nitride (AlScN)-on-sapphire
platform operating at 5.9 GHz with an exceptionally high acoustic propagation
Q-factor. An 800 nm AlScN thin film with 40% scandium alloying concentration
was deposited on a thick sapphire substrate to achieve strong acoustic energy
confinement and large electromechanical coupling effect, thereby minimizing the
insertion loss (IL) and propagation loss (PL) of the acoustic delay line (ADL).
The proposed ADL was designed to operate in the Sezawa mode using a
Single-Phase Unidirectional Transducer (SPUDT) electrode configuration for
better unidirectionality. The fabricated ADLs with different delay lengths,
after conjugate matching, exhibited delay times spanning 13 to 214 ns and IL
ranging from 7.6 to 18.3 dB. The extracted PL reached as low as 9.2 dB/mm at

Abstract: Heat generated in gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistors
(HEMTs) is often concentrated in nanoscale regions and must dissipate through
multiple heterostructures. However, the influence of non-uniform heat sources
on the thermal transport of such heterostructures remains unclear. In this
work, a thermal transport model for heterostructures under the non-uniform heat
source is developed by combining first-principles calculations with Monte Carlo
simulations. Temperature, heat flux, and spectral thermal conductance
distributions are compared between uniform and non-uniform heat sources. The
effects of heterostructure height, heat source width, and heat source height on
thermal transfer characteristics are analyzed for four typical
heterostructures: GaN/AlN, GaN/Diamond, GaN/Si, and GaN/SiC. The results reveal
that non-uniform heat sources have little effect on average interfacial thermal
conductance but induce pronounced local non-uniformity when the heterostructure
height is small. The interfacial thermal conductance near the heat source
region is significantly higher than that in other areas. As the heat source
non-uniformity increases, the total thermal resistance of the heterostructure
rises markedly, reaching several times that under uniform heat sources.
Finite-element calculations fail to capture the combined effects of non-uniform
heating and microscale dimensions, leading to a severe underestimation of
heterostructure total thermal resistance. This work reveals the thermal
transport mechanisms of heterostructures under non-uniform heat sources and
provides theoretical guidance for the thermal design of wide-bandgap
semiconductor devices.

### [131] [Morphological and Chemical Changes in Cd-free Colloidal QD-LEDs During Operation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12597)

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: Cd-free colloidal QD-LEDs show bright, saturated color, and high efficiency, but their limited longevity is due to nanoscale morphological changes in their layers during operation. These include interparticle coarsening and layer thinning in the electron transport layer (InP/ZnSe/ZnS and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS), along with compositional oxygen- and hydrogen-radicals that accumulate at the electrode/ETL interface. Acrylate-based resin encapsulation stabilizes the ETL/QD layers by suppressing radical formation, resulting in significant lifetime improvements (8-fold and 5000-fold for InP/ZnSe/ZnS and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS QD-LEDs, respectively). This work establishes causal relationships between morphological degradation, interlayer radical dynamics, and QD-LED instability, providing insights into scalable encapsulation treatments for Cd-free QD-LEDs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of quantum-dot-based light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) has garnered significant attention in recent years primarily due to their potential to replace organic LEDs (OLEDs) in applications such as lighting, where high efficiency and brightness are crucial. However, one major challenge in the field is the limited operational lifetime of QD-LEDs compared to their organic counterparts. This study aims to uncover the underlying mechanisms responsible for this degradation, with the ultimate goal of improving the longevity of Cd-free QD-LEDs through innovative encapsulation techniques.

Method: The authors conducted a series of systematic experiments and employed advanced characterization techniques. The methodology includes: 1) fabricating Cd-free QD-LEDs with InP/ZnSe/ZnS and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS nanoparticles, 2) monitoring morphological changes in the layers via scanning electron microscopy, 3) analyzing the generation and diffusion of compositional oxygen- and hydrogen-radicals through the device, 4) observing the accumulation of radicals at electrode/ETL interfaces, 5) using in situ transmission electron microscopy to visualize electron beam exposure effects, and 6) implementing acrylate-based resin encapsulation to test its effectiveness in mitigating degradation.

Result: The study reveals that interparticle coarsening and layer thinning occur in the electron transport layer (ETL) and QD emissive layer, accompanied by the generation and diffusion of compositional oxygen- and hydrogen-radicals. Oxygen radicals accumulate at the electrode/ETL interface. In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals that electron beam exposure, especially in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates ZnMgO nanoparticle coarsening. Furthermore, acrylate-based resin encapsulation significantly stabilizes the ETL and QD layers by suppressing radical formation, leading to dramatic improvements in lifetime: an 8-fold increase for InP/ZnSe/ZnS QD-LEDs and a 5000-fold increase for ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS QD-LEDs.

Conclusion: This research provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to the instability of Cd-free QD-LEDs. By elucidating the role of morphological changes, interlayer radical dynamics, and the limitations in current encapsulation methods, the study lays the foundation for the development of sustainable and scalable solutions to extend the operational lifetime of Cd-free QD-LEDs. The findings suggest that encapsulation strategies that suppress radical formation could be a promising direction for further improvements in the stability and reliability of QD-LED devices.

Abstract: Heavy metal-free quantum-dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) have
demonstrated remarkable brightness, saturated color, and high efficiencies
across a broad spectral range. However, in contrast to organic LEDs (OLEDs),
QD-LED operational lifetimes remain limited, with the underlying degradation
mechanisms not fully understood. In the present study, we show that
InP/ZnSe/ZnS (red-emitting) and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS (blue-emitting) cadmium-free
colloidal QD-LEDs undergo nanoscale morphological changes during operation.
Specifically,interparticle coarsening and layer thinning are observed in the
electron transport layer (ETL) consisting of ZnMgO nanoparticles (NPs), in the
QD emissive layer, and in the organic hole transport layer. This is accompanied
by the generation and diffusion of compositional oxygen- and hydrogen-radicals
throughout the device, with oxygen accumulating at the electrode/ETL
interfance. Moreover, in situ transmission electron microscopy reveals the
electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates ZnMgO
NPs coarsening. To mitigate these degradation pathway, we show that
acrylate-based resin-encapsulation treatment stabilize the ETL/QD layers by
suppressing the radical formation and halting morphology changes. This approach
achieves dramatic stability enhancements, exhibits an 8-fold and 5000-fold
lifetime improvement on InP/ZnSe/ZnS and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS QD-LEDs, respectively.
Our findings establish the causal relationships between the morphological
degradation, interlayer radical dynamics, and state-of-the-art QD-LEDs
instability, providing new insights into a scalable encapsulation treatment
that enables efficient and long-lived Cd-free QD-LEDs.

*Mingxia Zhang,Wanzhu Chang,Jie Yang,Hong Liang,Yiming Zhao,Houjun Sun,Jianjun Ma*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The article investigates terahertz satellite-to-ground communication with ULEO satellites, analyzing three transmission architectures: direct link, relay ground forwarding, and satellite-to-base station with fiber backhaul. It derives channel modeling and performance metrics considering atmospheric propagation and various channel conditions, concluding that direct satellite-to-ground links are optimal for lower THz frequencies, while relay and hybrid systems face significant loss limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for higher bandwidth and more reliable communication systems for satellite data, particularly in terahertz frequency, which offers superior capabilities compared to optical systems, especially with ULEO satellites. This paper addresses this by evaluating different communication architectures.

Method: The study uses comprehensive channel modeling and performance evaluations, incorporating altitude-resolved atmospheric propagation models validated with meteorological data from high-altitude stations. It employs frequency-dependent absorption models and analyzes channel characteristics under different fading conditions.

Result: The findings reveal that direct satellite-to-ground transmission at lower THz frequencies has the best performance with maximum available bandwidth. In contrast, relay ground forwarding suffers from prohibitive cumulative losses, and satellite-to-base station systems with fiber backhauls face substantial conversion and transmission losses, making them impractical despite favorable atmospheric conditions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while terahertz satellite-to-ground communication shows potential, direct links at lower frequencies are the most practical option without additional infrastructure or technologies to mitigate the losses in relay and hybrid systems.

Abstract: The exponential growth in satellite data traffic demands communication
systems exceeding current microwave capacity limitations, while the terahertz
(THz) frequency band (0.1-10 THz) offers unprecedented bandwidth potential with
superior weather resilience compared to optical systems, particularly when
combined with ultra-low Earth orbit (ULEO) satellite deployments below 300 km
altitude. This article presents comprehensive channel modeling and performance
evaluation for ULEO-THz satellite-to-ground communications, analyzing three
distinct transmission architectures (direct satellite-to-ground,
satellite-relay-ground forwarding, and satellite-to-high altitude base station
with fiber backhaul) through altitude-resolved atmospheric propagation models
validated using year-long meteorological data from four high-altitude stations
in Tibet and Qinghai, China. The analysis incorporates frequency-dependent
atmospheric absorption using ITU-R standards, free-space path loss with curved
atmospheric modeling, and regional atmospheric variations to derive total
channel path loss, available bandwidth capacity, and bit error rate (BER)
performance under both AWGN and Weibull fading conditions across multiple THz
frequencies. Results demonstrate that direct satellite-to-ground transmission
at lower THz frequencies achieves optimal practical performance with maximum
available bandwidth under QPSK modulation, while satellite-relay-ground
forwarding suffers prohibitive cumulative losses from multiple hops, and
satellite-to-high altitude base station configurations, despite favorable
atmospheric channel characteristics, become impractical due to substantial
electro-optical conversion penalties and fiber transmission losses in long-haul
applications.

Conclusion: 通过引入非线性振动，可以在声吸收中实现频率上转换，从而扩展声能的频率覆盖范围。

Abstract: Classical methods of sound absorption present fundamental limits that can be
overcome by using nonlinear effects. Thin clamped plates have been identified
as strongly nonlinear elements, capable of transferring the acoustic power of
an incident air-borne wave towards higher frequencies. Here, we experimentally
show that these plates exhibit different vibrational nonlinear behaviors
depending on the amplitude and frequency of the excitation signal. The lowest
excitation levels achieved lead to harmonic generation in a weakly nonlinear
regime, while higher levels produce quasi-periodic and chaotic regimes. Since
these nonlinear vibration regimes govern the acoustic frequency-up conversion
process, we investigate the influence of relevant physical and geometrical
parameters on the emergence of these nonlinear regimes. A parametric study on
plates of different thicknesses reveals that the frequency-up conversion effect
is mostly guided by the resonance of the plate at its first eigenfrequency,
which depends not only on its thickness but also on a static tension introduced
by the clamping. Finally, a design proposition involving multiple plates with
different properties is presented in order to reach a broadband frequency-up
conversion.

Abstract: Skeletal editing of cyclic molecules has garnered considerable attention in
the context of drug discovery and green chemistry, with notable examples in
solution-phase synthesis. Here, we extend the scope of skeletal editing to the

contraction of an oxygen-containing seven-membered ring on bilayer NaCl films
to generate molecules containing the perylene skeleton. The products were
identified and characterized by atomic force and scanning tunneling
microscopies, which provided access to bond-resolved molecular structures and
orbital densities. Insights into the reaction mechanisms were obtained by
density functional theory calculations. Our work expands the toolbox of
tip-induced chemistry for single-molecule synthesis.

Abstract: Phonon engineering technology has opened up the functional thermal management
of semiconductor-based classical and quantum electronics at the micro- and
nanoscales. However, challenges have remained in designing accurate thermal
characteristics based on quasi-ballistic phonon transport. The quasi-ballistic
thermal transport arises from the combination of wave-like and diffusive phonon
behaviors unlike pure diffusion. The topological nature has been known to be
compatible with both wave and diffusive phenomena. Therefore, topological
phononic crystals have great potential for the development of controllable and
designable thermal transport based on quasi-ballistic phonons. In this study,
we experimentally investigated the thermal behavior at the scale of
quasi-ballistic phonon transport using a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model-based
topological phononic crystal. Quasi-ballistic phonon transport was observed
through change in thermal conductivity depending on the structural parameters
of topological systems using micro-thermoreflectance. Furthermore, using
topological interface states, the experimentally observed thermal behaviors
were found to agree well with the theoretically expected those. Accordingly,
the topological nature is an effective approach for thermal management in
micro- and nanoscale systems with quasi-ballistic phonon transport. Our results
pave the way for a unified control scheme for wave and diffusion phenomena,
such as quasi-ballistic phonons.

Conclusion: 脉冲尾巴长度决定了电子空穴对和单个电子或空穴的局域化转变方向，短尾巴 pulses 致使相反的转变方向，而长尾巴 pulses 则使转变方向相同。

Abstract: We investigate the localization transition in fractionally charged electron
wave packets, which is injected into a quantum conductor by a single voltage
pulse with arbitrary flux quantum. We show that the transition is
unidirectional for individual electrons or holes. They always undergo a
delocalization-to-localization transition as the flux increases. In contrast,
the transition of the neutral electron-hole pairs is bidirectional. As the flux
increases, the transition can be a localization-to-delocalization transition or
vice versa, which is controlled via the long-time tail of the voltage pulse.
The localization-to-delocalization transition occurs in the case of
short-tailed pulses, which decay faster than Lorentzian. In this case, the
directions of the transitions for the neutral eh pairs and individual electrons
or holes are opposite. Certain localized neutral electron-hole pairs can first
evolve into delocalized ones, then split into individual electrons and holes
with localized wave functions, which gives a reentrant localization. The
delocalization-to-localization transition occurs in the case of long-tailed
pulses, which decay slower than Lorentzian. The reentrant localization vanishes
in this case, as the directions of the two transitions are the same. It is also
absent in the case of Lorentzian pulses, where the localized neutral
electron-hole pairs cannot be excited at all.

TL;DR: This paper explores the symmetry classification for quantum feedback control, focusing on non-adaptive measurement sequences and demonstrating how quantum control can be robust against disorders and imperfections.

Motivation: The paper's motivation stems from the need to understand and quantify the robustness of quantum control systems against various perturbations and disorders, particularly in the context of feedback control mechanisms.

Method: The authors employ symmetry classification and mathematical proofs, leveraging the structure of CPTP maps and measurement operators to analyze the classification of quantum feedback control protocols.

Result: The key results include the demonstration that non-adaptive measurements collapse the symmetry classification to the ten-fold AZ$^q{}$ classes. Additionally, the paper shows that allowing general measurements can lead to protocols outside the ten-fold classification, such as a chiral Maxwell's demon with Gaussian errors exhibiting quantized winding numbers.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that quantum feedback control can be systematically classified and designed to handle disorders and measurement imperfections, opening new avenues for robust quantum technologies.

Abstract: We establish a symmetry classification for a general class of quantum
feedback control. For successive feedback control with a non-adaptive sequence
of bare measurements (i.e., with positive Kraus operators), we prove that the
symmetry classification collapses to the ten-fold AZ$^\dagger$ classes,
specifying the allowed topology of CPTP maps associated with feedback control.
We demonstrate that a chiral Maxwell's demon with Gaussian measurement errors
exhibits quantized winding numbers. Moreover, for general (non-bare)
measurements, we explicitly construct a protocol that falls outside the
ten-fold classification. These results broaden and clarify the principles in
engineering topological aspects of quantum control robust against disorder and
imperfections.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling the interaction of light with chiral materials is essential for advancing quantum technologies and manipulating quantum phenomena for applications like quantum computing and sensing.

Method: The researchers used a time-dependent quantum perturbation framework to theoretically analyze and predict the behavior of light-induced magnetic moments in graphene quantum dots under optical vortex illumination.

Result: Through phase-difference analysis and eigenmode decomposition, the team observed that optical angular momentum transfer was significantly less efficient than spin transfer, leading to a phenomenon where counter-rotating currents appeared off the vortex wavefront.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational understanding of OAM-to-magnetization conversion in 2D materials, opening new possibilities for controlling quantum phenomena and designing quantum-engineered systems where light-matter interactions can be precisely tailored for desired functionalities.

Abstract: Chiral photon interactions with two-dimensional (2D) materials enable
unprecedented control of quantum phenomena. In this paper, we report anomalous
inverse Faraday effects (IFE) in graphene quantum dots (GQDs) under linearly
polarized optical vortex illumination, where transferred orbital angular
momentum (OAM) generates light-induced magnetic moments. Employing our recently
developed time-dependent quantum perturbation framework [Phys. Rev. B 110,
085425 (2024)], we demonstrate a counterintuitive observation: some reversed
magnetic moments at off-axis positions occur-manifested as counter-rotating
currents to the vortex helical wavefront. Phase-difference analysis and
eigenmode decomposition resolve this anomaly, revealing that the OAM transfer
efficiency is orders of magnitude weaker than its spin counterpart. This work
establishes a new paradigm for optical OAM-to-magnetization conversion in
quantum-engineered 2D systems.

Abstract: Graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor, where the electrons propagating inside
are described by the ultra-relativistic Dirac equation normally reserved for
very high energy massless particles. In this work, we show that graphene under
a magnetic field in the presence of a minimal length has a hidden $su(1,1)$
symmetry. This symmetry allows us to construct the spectrum algebraically. In
fact, a generalized uncertainty relation, leading to a non-zero minimum
uncertainty on the position, would be closer to physical reality and allow us
to control or create bound states in graphene. Using the partition function
based on the Epstein zeta function, the thermodynamic properties are well
determined. We find that the Dulong-Petit law is verified and the heat capacity
is independent of the deformation parameter.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for exploring nonlinear phenomena in the field of mesoscopic electromechanical resonators and paves the way for future research in this direction.

Abstract: Nanoelectromechanical resonators provide an ideal platform for investigating
the interplay between electron transport and nonlinear mechanical motion.
Externally driven suspended carbon nanotubes, containing an electrostatically
defined quantum dot are especially promising. These devices possess two main
sources of nonlinearity: the electromechanical coupling and the intrinsic
contributions of the resonator that induce a Duffing-like nonlinear behavior.
In this work, we observe the interplay between the two sources across different
driving regimes. The main nonlinear feature we observe is the emergence of
arch-like resonances in the electronic transport when the resonator is strongly
driven. We show that our model is in good agreement with our experimental
electron transport measurements on a suspended carbon nanotube. This
characterization paves the way for the exploration of nonlinear phenomena using
mesoscopic electromechanical resonators.

Abstract: Exotic collective phenomena emerge when bosons strongly interact within a
lattice. However, creating a robust and tunable solid-state platform to explore
such phenomena has been elusive. Dual moir\'e systems$-$compromising two
Coulomb-coupled moir\'e lattices$-$offer a promising system for investigating
strongly correlated dipolar excitons (composite bosons) with electrical
control. Thus far, their implementation has been hindered by the relative
misalignment and incommensurability of the two moir\'e patterns. Here we report
a dual moir\'e system with perfect translational and rotational alignment,
achieved by utilizing twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer to both
generate an electrostatic moir\'e potential and separate MoSe$_{2}$ and
WSe$_{2}$ monolayers. We observe strongly correlated electron phases driven by
intralayer interactions and identify interlayer Rydberg trions, which become
trapped in the presence of the Mott insulating state. Importantly, our platform
is electrostatically programmable, allowing the realization of different
lattice symmetries with either repulsive or attractive interlayer interactions.
In particular, we implement the latter scenario by optically injecting charges,
which form a dipolar excitonic phase. Our results establish a versatile
platform for the exploration and manipulation of exotic and topological bosonic
quantum many-body phases.

Abstract: Transport measurements of hybrid nanowires often rely on the observation of a
zero-bias conductance peak as a hallmark of Majorana bound states (MBSs).
However, such signatures can also be produced by trivial zero-energy Andreev
bound states (ABSs) or by quasi-Majorana bound states (QMBSs), complicating
their unambiguous identification. Here we propose microwave absorption
visibility, extracted from parity-dependent cavity-nanowire susceptibility
measurements, as a complementary probe of MBSs nonlocality. We study a Rashba
spin-orbit nanowire consisting of a proximitized superconducting segment and an
uncovered quantum-dot region, capacitively coupled to a single-mode microwave
cavity. We show that true MBSs yield finite visibility only when both MBSs are
simultaneously coupled to the cavity, reflecting their intrinsic nonlocality.
In contrast, ABSs and QMBSs exhibit visibility extrema even when the cavity
couples only locally to part of the nanowire. We further demonstrate that this
distinction persists in the presence of Gaussian disorder, which may otherwise
generate trivial subgap states. Motivated by recent experiments, we also
analyze ``poor man's" Majoranas in double-quantum-dot setups, where analytical
results confirm the same nonlocal visibility criterion. Finally, we discuss a
cavity-driven scheme for initializing the electronic system in a given parity
state. Our results establish cavity-based visibility as a robust and versatile
probe of MBSs, providing a clear route to distinguish them from trivial
zero-energy states in hybrid superconducting platforms.

Abstract: We develop a semiclassical theory for electron wavepacket dynamics in the
presence of an inhomogeneous AC electric field. While static electric-field
gradients are known to generate charge transport governed by the quantum
metric, we show that AC field gradients induce an additional geometric current
that vanishes in the DC limit. This response originates from a novel
band-geometric quantity, the higher-order connection (HOC) tensor, constructed
from cubic products of interband Berry connections. We derive explicit
expressions for the AC current and identify the symmetry conditions under which
it arises. Remarkably, inhomogeneous AC fields can generate an anomalous
Hall-like response even in nonmagnetic systems. Applying the theory to
Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, we demonstrate that the HOC-induced response
produces a measurable Hall current peaking at band edges. These results
establish inhomogeneous AC fields as a powerful probe of higher-order band
geometric quantities beyond Berry curvature and the quantum metric.

Abstract: Magnetotransport measurements are a sensitive probe of symmetry and
electronic structure in quantum materials. While conventional metals exhibit
longitudinal magnetoconductivity that is even in a magnetic field ($B$) for
small $B$, we show that magnetic materials which intrinsically break
time-reversal symmetry (TRS) show an {\it odd-parity magnetoconductivity}
(OMC), with a leading linear-$B$ response. Using semiclassical transport
theory, we derive explicit expressions for the longitudinal and transverse
conductivities and identify their origin in Berry curvature and orbital
magnetic moment. Crystalline symmetry analysis shows that longitudinal OMC
follows the same point-group constraints as the anomalous Hall effect, while
transverse OMC obeys distinct rules, providing an independent probe of TRS
breaking. In the large $B$ quantum oscillation regime, we uncover both odd- and
even-$B$ contributions, demonstrating OMC beyond the semiclassical picture.
Explicit calculations in valley-polarized gapped graphene show that OMC peaks
near the band edges, vanish in the band gap and follow the temperature
dependence of the magnetic order parameter. Our results explain the odd-parity
magnetoresistance recently observed in magnetized graphene and establish OMC as
a robust transport signature of intrinsic TRS breaking in metals.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in
calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches
rely on access to large, high-quality labeled datasets for training,
benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features in the data.
Obtaining such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data
availability and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an
open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic
synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent
Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to
produce charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling
experiments. With extensive tunable parameters and customizable noise models,
QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development,
benchmarking, and quantum device research.
