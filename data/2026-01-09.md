Abstract: Large-scale neural recording with high spatio-temporal resolution is essential for understanding information processing in brain, yet current neural interfaces fall far short of comprehensively capturing brain activity due to extremely high neuronal density and limited scalability. Although recent advances have miniaturized neural probes and increased channel density, fundamental design constraints still prevent dramatic scaling of simultaneously recorded channels. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel electro-optic sensor that directly converts ultra-low-amplitude neural electrical signals into optical signals with high signal-to-noise ratio. By leveraging the ultra-high bandwidth and intrinsic multiplexing capability of light, this approach offers a scalable path toward massively parallel neural recording beyond the limits of traditional electrical interfaces. The sensor integrates an on-chip photonic microresonator with a graphene layer, enabling direct detection of neural signals without genetically encoded optical indicators or tissue modification, making it suitable for human translation. Neural signals are locally transduced into amplified optical modulations and transmitted through on-chip waveguides, enabling interference-free recording without bulky electromagnetic shielding. Arrays of wavelength-selective sensors can be multiplexed on a single bus waveguide using wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), greatly improving scalability while maintaining a minimal footprint to reduce tissue damage. We demonstrate detection of evoked neural signals as small as 25 $μ$V with 3 dB SNR from mouse brain tissue and show multiplexed recording from 10 sensors on a single waveguide. These results establish a proof-of-concept for optically multiplexed neural recording and point toward scalable, high-density neural interfaces for neurological research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Geometric waveguides are a promising architecture for optical see-through augmented reality displays, but their performance is severely bottlenecked by the difficulty of jointly optimizing non-sequential light transport and polarization-dependent multilayer thin-film coatings. Here we present the first end-to-end differentiable optimization framework for geometric waveguide that couples non-sequential Monte Carlo polarization ray tracing with a differentiable transfer-matrix thin-film solver. A differentiable Monte Carlo ray tracer avoids the exponential growth of deterministic ray splitting while enabling gradients backpropagation from eyebox metrics to design parameters. With memory-saving strategies, we optimize more than one thousand layer-thickness parameters and billions of non-sequential ray-surface intersections on a single multi-GPU workstation. Automated layer pruning is achieved by starting from over-parameterized stacks and driving redundant layers to zero thickness under discrete manufacturability constraints, effectively performing topology optimization to discover optimal coating structures. On a representative design, starting from random initialization within thickness bounds, our method increases light efficiency from 4.1\% to 33.5\% and improves eyebox and FoV uniformity by $\sim$17$\times$ and $\sim$11$\times$, respectively. Furthermore, we jointly optimize the waveguide and an image preprocessing network to improve perceived image quality. Our framework not only enables system-level, high-dimensional coating optimization inside the waveguide, but also expands the scope of differentiable optics for next-generation optical design.

Result: Improved resolution of up to 4.41×, surpassing the diffraction limit by 2.57×.

Conclusion: Enhanced algorithm enables surpassing physical resolution limits, with potential for further improvement.

Abstract: Image Phase Alignment Super-sampling (ImPASS) is a computational method for combining displaced low-resolution images into a single high-resolution image. The general steps include measuring the relative displacements, up-sampling, aligning and combining the images, followed by a blind deconvolution. Previous ImPASS studies have shown that the resulting image resolution can significantly subceed the diffraction limit of the imaging system. Characteristics that potentially limit the processed image resolution include optical parameters, detector noise, image alignment accuracy, or deconvolution parameters. In this report, modifications have been made to the algorithm to improve the image alignment accuracy and deconvolution. Applications of the modified algorithm improved image resolution by a factor up to 1.81. Compared to the original image resolution, the modified ImPASS achieved a resolution improvement factor up to 4.41 while subceeding the diffraction limit by a factor of 2.57. This suggests that limitations imposed by the physical properties of the system have not yet been reached, and further improvement of the algorithm is warranted.

### [4] [Processing-Dependent Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer at Au/SiC Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04452)
*A. Márquez,R. Esquivel-Sirvent*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper explores how thermal annealing affects radiative heat transfer in gold-silicon carbide interfaces, showing up to a 40% increase in heat transfer at tens of nanometers separations due to enhanced plasmonic surface mode coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of thermal annealing on interfacial heat transfer is crucial for optimizing nanoscale thermal management in plasmonic materials, with implications for devices like solar cells and sensors.

Method: The research employs fluctuational electrodynamics, experimentally measuring dielectric functions of both annealed and unannealed gold films to evaluate radiative heat flux across interfaces.

Result: Thermal annealing significantly boosts radiative heat transfer at Au/SiC interfaces, primarily due to changes in low-frequency dielectric losses affecting evanescent field coupling, enhancing up to 40% for separations of tens of nanometers.

Conclusion: Thermal annealing serves as a practical method to tune interfacial radiative heat transfer in thin-film systems, aiding in the design of nanoscale thermal and plasmonic interfaces without altering material properties or geometry.

Abstract: Thermal annealing is a widely used thin-film processing technique for modifying interfacial optical losses and electronic scattering in plasmonic materials. Here, we investigate how thermal annealing of gold thin films deposited on silicon carbide substrates influences interfacial near-field radiative heat transfer across nanoscale vacuum gaps. Using experimentally measured dielectric functions for annealed and unannealed Au films, we evaluate the spectral and total radiative heat flux between Au/SiC interfaces within a fluctuational electrodynamics framework.
  We show that annealing-induced changes in the low-frequency dielectric losses of Au significantly alter evanescent electromagnetic coupling at the interface, leading to enhancements of up to ~40\% in the total near-field radiative heat transfer at separations of tens of nanometers. Mode-resolved analysis reveals that this enhancement originates from strengthened coupling of overdamped plasmonic surface modes, which are highly sensitive to thin-film processing and interfacial microstructure. These results demonstrate that standard thermal annealing provides a practical route for tuning interfacial radiative heat transfer in metallic thin-film systems without modifying material composition or geometry, offering guidance for the design and interpretation of nanoscale thermal and plasmonic interfaces.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a temporal illusion framework to create time-dependent material responses that mimic exotic materials, enabling control over transient responses, resonator time constants, and introducing detuning flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the scarcity and difficulty of obtaining natural materials with unusual optical properties by creating synthetic materials through temporal modulation.

Method: The method involves modulating the permittivity of dielectrics in both space and time to replicate exotic material behavior, utilizing mathematical theories and practical implementations.

Result: The result is the successful demonstration that temporal modulation can produce optical behaviors equivalent to exotic materials, control transient responses, adjust resonator time constants, and introduce detuning for added functionality.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the potential of the temporal illusion framework to revolutionize optics and wave physics by offering a new method to realize complex material responses on demand.

Abstract: Materials with unusual optical properties are central to advanced control of light. Yet, in nature, such materials may be exceedingly rare and often difficult to obtain. To overcome this limitation, here we introduce the concept of temporal illusion: A temporally dynamic framework in which carefully programmed temporal variations in effective parameters generate responses akin to those of, in principle, any arbitrary time-invariant structure. We theoretically demonstrate that proper modulation of the permittivity of a conventional dielectric in space and time replicates the optical behavior associated with exotic materials. Besides, we reveal that, beyond steady-state effects, temporal illusion also enables control over transient responses, for instance, by effectively lowering the time constant of high-quality-factor resonators, therefore, allowing faster energy accumulation. Moreover, by incorporating detuning between modulation and excitation, we show that the framework unlocks additional functionalities. The temporal illusion paradigm thus broadens the capabilities of space-time varying systems, offering a powerful route to synthesize material responses on demand and paving the way for new theoretical and experimental directions in optics and wave physics.

Abstract: Frequency comb spectroscopy has significantly advanced molecular spectroscopy across scientific research and diverse applications. Among its key performance metrics especially for time-resolved studies, sensitivity and measurement speed are paramount. However, a long-standing compromise between these parameters arises from the need for noise reduction. Here, we introduce a comb spectroscopy system that overcomes this limitation using a single frequency comb of non-uniformly spaced modes. The comb is generated using an extremely simple setup, composed of a continuous-wave (CW) fiber laser and a single-sideband phase modulator (SSM). Our approach delivers optical-to-radio-frequency conversion comparable to dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) but through a simplified self-heterodyning architecture. By leveraging the intrinsic mutual coherence of the comb, this design achieves a noise-equivalent absorption coefficient (NEA) of 5.0*10^(-6) Hz^(-1/2)--an order-of-magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art DCS, coupled with long-term stability. The system resolves weak molecular overtone spectra on nanosecond timescales, in a single-shot measurement, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 128. This integration of high sensitivity, resolution, and speed resolves the core trade-off that has long constrained time-resolved spectroscopic analysis.

Abstract: Optical-electrical-optical (OEO) converters are key primitives for low-latency, energy-efficient photonic computing because they enable nonlinear activation and optical signal regeneration on chip. We report two monolithically integrated silicon-photonic OEO converters-load-resistor (high-speed variant) and current-injection (high-gain variant) types-fabricated at a silicon photonics foundry. Each device combines a germanium photodetector with a micro-ring modulator (MRM). The converters exhibit reconfigurable nonlinear transfer functions and measurable on-chip RF OEO gain. The RF OEO gain scales linearly with the MRM bias power, with slopes of 0.10 mW^-1 (load-resistor of 10 kΩ) and 1.4 mW^-1 (current-injection), enabling a gain > 1 region at practical bias powers (~10 mW and ~1 mW, respectively). Eye diagrams confirm clear openings up to 4 Gb/s for a high-speed load-resistor variant with a 500-Ω load. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of a monolithically integrated, foundry-fabricated silicon-photonic load-resistor type OEO converter exhibiting reconfigurable nonlinear transfer and on-chip RF OEO gain. In the carrier-injection device, the activation slope exceeds unity, yielding 3.9 dB extinction-ratio regeneration. Short-pulse measurements yield 3-dB bandwidths of 1.49 GHz, 160 MHz (load-resistor of 500 Ω and 10 kΩ), and 76 MHz (current-injection), consistent with the RF data. Energy analysis shows an energy-bandwidth trade-off (RC-limited for load-resistor vs. lifetime-limited for injection) and outline routes to sub-pJ/bit operation via reduced capacitance and improved EO efficiency. These results establish silicon-photonic OEO converters as compact, foundry-compatible building blocks for scalable optoelectronic computing and optical neural networks.

### [8] [Ultra-high performance microwave spectral filters using optical microcombs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04561)
*David J. Moss*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive microwave photonic filters with sharp transitions optimized using a transversal filter structure and an optical microcomb source. They achieve roll-off rates up to ~32.6 dB/GHz and a minimum shape factor of ~1.15, demonstrating reconfigurability without hardware changes. Applications include next-gen wireless networks, high-res radar, and biomedical sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for high-performance microwave systems with stringent spectral selectivity has driven the development of advanced photonic filters. These filters must operate efficiently over a wide bandwidth, maintain low loss, and be resilient to electromagnetic interference. The challenge lies in achieving both sharp transition bandwidths and high reconfigurability simultaneously. This paper addresses these challenges through adaptive filter designs. The motivation stems from the need for versatile and high-performance photonic filters in emerging technologies like next-gen wireless communications, radar, and biomedical sensing.

Method: The authors propose an adaptive microwave photonic (MWP) filter structure based on a transversal filter architecture enhanced by an optical microcomb source. The design incorporates an algorithm that dynamically adjusts filter parameters, specifically the tap coefficients, enabling reconfigurability without modifying the hardware. The study involves optimizing the filter's performance to maximize sharp transitions and minimize losses. The filters are simulated and experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical models.

Result: The research successfully demonstrates that adaptive MWP filters with sharp transitions can achieve high performance specifications. Specifically, the filters exhibit roll-off rates exceeding ~32.6 dB/GHz and a minimum shape factor above ~1.15. Additionally, the filters can be reconfigured by adjusting tap coefficients, allowing for tunable center frequencies (e.g., from 5 GHz to 15 GHz) and dual-band capabilities. These results validate the potential of adaptive MWP filters for various high-performance applications.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel approach to designing adaptive MWP filters with sharp transitions. By leveraging a transversal filter structure and an optical microcomb source, the filters achieve exceptional performance metrics and high reconfigurability. This breakthrough offers a practical solution for next-generation microwave systems, enabling advanced applications in wireless communications, radar, and biomedical photonic sensing.

Abstract: Microwave photonic (MWP) filters are essential components in microwave systems due to their wide bandwidth, low loss, and immunity to electromagnetic interference. A sharp transition band is critical for precise spectral shaping and interference suppression, yet conventional MWP filters face challenges in achieving both sharp transitions and high reconfigurability. Adaptive MWP filters with sharp transition based on a transversal filter structure using an optical microcomb source are demonstrated in this paper. Four different types of single-band MWP filters with roll-off rates up to ~32.6 dB/GHz and a minimum shape factor of ~1.15 are achieved. In addition, simply through designing tap coefficients, band-pass filters with tunable centre frequencies ranging from 5 GHz to 15 GHz and dual-band MWP filters with various filter response are demonstrated without changing any hardware, where sharp transition is also validated. The adaptive filters with sharp transition presented in this paper offer a stable and highly reconfigurable solution for applications requiring stringent spectral selectivity, such as next-generation wireless networks, high-resolution radar imaging, and advanced biomedical photonic sensing.

Abstract: Diffractive neural networks have recently emerged as a promising framework for all-optical computing. However, these networks are typically trained for a single task, limiting their potential adoption in systems requiring multiple functionalities. Existing approaches to achieving multi-task functionality either modify the mechanical configuration of the network per task or use a different illumination wavelength or polarization state for each task. In this work, we propose a new control mechanism, which is based on the illumination's angular spectrum. Specifically, we shape the illumination using an amplitude mask that selectively controls its angular spectrum. We employ different illumination masks for achieving different network functionalities, so that the mask serves as a unique task encoder. Interestingly, we show that effective control can be achieved over a very narrow angular range, within the paraxial regime. We numerically illustrate the proposed approach by training a single diffractive network to perform multiple image-to-image translation tasks. In particular, we demonstrate translating handwritten digits into typeset digits of different values, and translating handwritten English letters into typeset numbers and typeset Greek letters, where the type of the output is determined by the illumination's angular components. As we show, the proposed framework can work under different coherence conditions, and can be combined with existing control strategies, such as different wavelengths. Our results establish the illumination angular spectrum as a powerful degree of freedom for controlling diffractive networks, enabling a scalable and versatile framework for multi-task all-optical computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving microscopy techniques for reduced photodamage and higher resolution.

Method: Uses widefield speckled illumination and image standard deviation matching algorithm.

Result: Achieved 2μm axial sectioning, 220nm lateral resolution, and reduced excitation powers by 10 times compared to focused microscopy.

Conclusion: 2P-RIM is an effective widefield 2P technique for micrometer imaging in large fields.

Abstract: Biological and biomedical samples are routinely examined using focused two-photon (2P) fluorescence microscopy due to its intrinsic axial sectioning and reduced out-of-focus bleaching. However, 2P imaging often requires excitation intensities that can damage samples through ionization and radical formation. Additionally, the lateral resolution of 2P microscopy is lower compared to linear one-photon (1P) fluorescence microscopy. Widefield 2P microscopy, using cameras, holds promise for reducing photo-toxicity while maintaining high image acquisition rates. Widefield imaging trades the high power and short integration times of sequential single point scanning for the low power and extended integration times of parallel detection across millions of pixels. However, generating effective axial sectioning over arbitrarily large fields of view (FOVs) has remained a challenge. In this work, we introduce 2P Random Illumination Microscopy (2P-RIM), an easy-to-implement 2P widefield technique, that achieves low photo-damage, fast imaging, micrometric axial sectioning, and enhanced lateral resolution for arbitrarily large FOVs. By using widefield speckled illuminations in conjunction with an image standard deviation matching algorithm, 2P-RIM demonstrated multicolor imaging over FOVs greater than 200 um, lateral resolution 220 nm, axial sectioning 2 um, and peak excitation powers about 10 times lower than those used in focused laser scanning microscopy.

Long-lived states of the spin-triplet 1s(3T2) group with a lifetime of about 20 ms are observed. The temperature dependence indicates that the relaxation is governed by the Orbach mechanism with an activation energy ~13 meV, which is close to the exchange splitting energy of the excited 1s states of the Mg donor.

Abstract: Structured optical materials provide a promising platform for photonic quantum information processing in free space. Beam splitters, a fundamental building block of photonic circuits, have recently been demonstrated in free space using geometric-phase optical elements. These devices coherently mix circularly-polarized transverse modes of freely-propagating optical fields, including modes carrying orbital angular momentum. In this work, we investigate liquid-crystal metagratings as electrically tunable beam splitters for transverse-momentum optical modes. By exploiting the voltage-controlled birefringence of liquid-crystal metasurfaces, we experimentally tune the splitting ratio of the device and thereby control the degree of two-photon interference between indistinguishable photons. At the output, photons are spatially resolved on different regions of a time-resolved single-photon-sensitive detector, enabling the reconstruction of coincidence maps in the Fourier plane. This approach is readily scalable and enables highly parallel coincidence measurements across a large number of optical modes.

Abstract: Conventional infrared (IR) imaging techniques depend on IR cameras based on narrow-bandgap semiconductors, which offer limited spectral bandwidth, coupled with a separate lens. Recently, advances in nonlinear flat optics have opened a novel pathway for converting IR signals into the visible through nonlinear generations, enabling the direct visualisation of IR images using standard visible cameras. However, the narrow spectral bandwidth and the requirement for an additional lens remain the key challenges. Here, we address both issues via a novel adaptive and multifunctional IR-to-visible imaging platform offering tunable bandwidth and focusing simultaneously. We utilise sum-frequency generation (SFG) to convert IR light into the visible, by introducing a pump beam modulated by a spatial light modulator (SLM) to construct a virtual metalens enabling precisely controlled focusing of the generated nonlinear optical field. As a result, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally an optical focusing mechanism with a tunable focal length, achieved by varying the pump and signal wavelengths and modulating the phase distribution. Furthermore, since the focal length depends on the input signal wavelength, the imaging plane position varies accordingly, indicating a promising potential for the multispectral IR imaging applications. Our upconversion platform delivers SLM-controlled, programmable multispectral focusing for next-generation IR imaging, opening new avenues in the fields of computational and multispectral imaging techniques.

Abstract: We study near-field radiative transfer of energy, angular momentum, and linear momentum between a nanoparticle and a plate consisting of magnetic Weyl semimetals, and demonstrate that these can be efficiently tuned by a relative angle between the Weyl node separations. This tunability originates from the coupling between the particle-induced rotational Poynting vector and the nonreciprocal surface plasmon polaritons supported by the plate. Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive regime in which both energy and angular momentum transfer are maximized when the Weyl node separations are antiparallel rather than parallel. This arises from optimal mode matching between the rotation direction of the particle's circular heat flux and the propagation direction of the surface plasmon polaritons in the antiparallel configuration.

TL;DR: 黑色材料在图像配准、相机校准、抑制散射光、视觉设计等方面发挥着关键作用，尽管许多类似暗色的材料在散射光照下看起来相似，但它们的反射特性在观察和光照几何不同情况下可能差异很大。超暗材料在光照衰减方面表现优异，但成本和机械易损性通常是限制因素，因此需要评估更可靠和易获得的替代材料。本研究通过使用节距测量系统，捕捉多种黑色材料的双向反射率分布函数，包括超暗参考Vantablack、可用的商业替代品如Musou黑色和黑色丝绒，以及标准抛光黑色涂层。我们从散射和平面镜反射等方面分析它们的反射特性，以量化角依存的反射。此外，我们通过基于测量反射率函数的物理渲染和对感知深度的主观评估，分析它们的视觉外观。总的来说，这项研究为结合反射特性与视觉感知提供了全面评估，从而有助于材料在光学应用中的选择。

Abstract: Black materials play a critical role in applications such as image registration, camera calibration, stray light suppression, and visual design. Although many such materials appear similarly dark under diffuse illumination, their reflectance behavior can differ substantially as a function of viewing and lighting geometry. Ultra-black materials achieve exceptional light attenuation but are often constrained by cost and mechanical fragility, motivating the evaluation of more robust and accessible alternatives. In this study, we employ a gonimetric measurement system to capture the isotropic bidirectional reflectance distribution function of a range of black materials, including the ultra-black reference Vantablack, commercially available alternatives such as Musou Black and black velvet, and standard matte black coatings. We analyze their reflectance characteristics in terms of diffuse and specular scattering, as well as total integrated scatter, to quantify angular-dependent reflection. In addition, we compare their perceptual appearance using physically based rendering driven by the measured BRDFs and a psychophysical evaluation of perceived darkness. Together, these analyses provide a comprehensive assessment of black materials that links reflectance properties to visual appearance and perceptual performance, enabling informed material selection for optical applications.

Abstract: The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative. These results establish optical event horizons as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.

### [17] [Photodetachment energy of negative hydrogen ions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04341)
*Maen Salman,Jean-Philippe Karr*

TL;DR: The paper presents highly precise calculations of the photodetachment energy for hydrogen anions, including various corrections, achieving a significant precision improvement over previous experiments. The results are crucial for advancing antihydrogen physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding photodetachment energy is key for producing ultracold antihydrogen, which is vital for precision experiments in antihydrogen physics.

Method: Exact three-body approach with relativistic and quantum corrections was used to calculate photodetachment energy for H⁻, D⁻, and T⁻.

Result: Precise detachment energies: H⁻ (F=0): 6083.06447(68) cm⁻¹, D⁻ (F=1/2): 6086.70676(68) cm⁻¹, T⁻ (F=0): 6087.87924(68) cm⁻¹. These are 220 times more precise than previous experiments.

Conclusion: The results provide critical data for future antihydrogen experiments and highlight the importance of precise theoretical calculations in photodetachment studies.

Abstract: We report a high-precision calculation of the photodetachment energy of the hydrogen anion{\normalsize{} }$\text{H}^{-}$. The nonrelativistic bound-state energy is obtained using an exact three-body approach, and supplemented by leading relativistic, quantum-electrodynamic, finite-nuclear-size, and hyperfine corrections. Our result is $6083.06447(68)\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ for the detachment to the hydrogen ground-state hyperfine level $\smash{(F=0)}$, which is 220 times more precise than the best experimental determination to date, $6082.99(15)\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, as reported by Lykke \textit{et al. }Beyond their intrinsic interest, these results provide critical input for antihydrogen physics, where controlled photodetachment of $\smash{\bar{\text{H}}^{+}}$ offers a path to producing ultracold antihydrogen (and its isotopes) for precision experiments. Corresponding calculations for the negative deuterium and tritium ions yield $6086.70676(68)\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ for $^{2}\text{H}^{-}(F=1/2)$ and $6087.87924(68)\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ for $^{3}\text{H}^{-}(F=0)$.

Abstract: We report the first experimental study of the influence of a dielectric surface on the transmission spectrum of cesium atoms for the $6S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7P_{3/2}$ ($D_2$) transition in vapor cells with thicknesses in the range $50$-$250\,$nm. The measurements were performed using a homemade optical nanocell filled with atomic cesium and featuring a wedge-shaped gap between the inner surfaces of sapphire windows. For atom-surface distances below approximately $300$\,nm, a significant red shift of the atomic transition frequency is observed due to van der Waals (vdW) interactions with the dielectric surface. An additional red shift arises at high vapor pressures owing to Cs-Cs interactions, with a measured contribution of $15$\,MHz/Torr, which must be accounted for in order to correctly determine the vdW coefficient $C_3$. By recording transmission spectra of the nanocell at different thicknesses, we determine for the first time the vdW coefficient for the Cs $6S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7P_{3/2}$ transition, obtaining values in the range $C_3 \sim 2- 20$\,kHz\,$μ$m$^3$. These results are of interest for fundamental studies of atom-surface interactions and are also relevant for the development of miniature sensors based on atomic vapors, in particular compact frequency references exploiting atomic transitions in the blue spectral region.

*Akhil Ayyadevara,Anand Prakash,Shovan Dutta,Arun Paramekanti,S. A. Rangwala*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates how trapped ions can exhibit symmetry-controlled thermally activated inversions, with isotope substitution altering activation energy barriers through a mechanism analogous to molecular dynamics.

motivation: Understanding and controlling symmetry-induced kinetic effects in mesoscopic systems is crucial for both fundamental physics and potential applications in quantum information processing.

method: The authors use a Paul trap to confine calcium ions and observe their inversion dynamics through laser cooling and measurement techniques. They employ Kramers-Langer theory to model the thermally activated processes.

result: By substituting an isotope, the authors observe a suppression of thermally activated inversions due to a change in symmetry, demonstrating a structural kinetic isotope effect.

conclusion: This work opens new avenues for studying symmetry-controlled collective dynamics in ion traps, offering a versatile platform for exploring such phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the desire to understand and control symmetry-induced kinetic effects, which are fundamental in many areas of physics and could have applications in quantum technologies.

method: The authors use a combination of experimental techniques, including laser cooling, trapped ion traps, and spectroscopic measurements, along with theoretical modeling based on Kramers-Langer theory to analyze the thermally activated processes.

result: The experiment shows that the activation barrier for ion inversion decreases when a specific isotope substitution is made, leading to a suppression of thermal inversion events.

conclusion: The findings demonstrate that symmetry breaking can significantly influence the dynamics of trapped ion systems, providing a new tool for studying symmetry-controlled phenomena in mesoscopic physics.

Method: The authors conducted experiments involving confining calcium ions in a Paul trap, using laser cooling to achieve low temperatures, and observed the inversion dynamics of the ion configurations. They then performed theoretical modeling using multidimensional Kramers-Langer theory to predict and interpret the observed inversion rates and activation barriers. Additionally, they substituted an isotope to demonstrate the effect of symmetry breaking and conducted numerical analyses to explore the mechanism responsible for the changes in inversion rates.

Result: The experimental results show that the inversion rates of the ion configurations vary significantly with different isotopes. The measurements of inversion rates, ranging over two orders of magnitude, are well explained by the Kramers-Langer theory. When the isotope substitution is performed, the symmetry of the system is broken, leading to a suppression of the thermally activated inversions. This is attributed to the closure of the low-barrier channel and the forcing of the system to invert through a high-barrier turnstile rotation. The experimental inversion rates are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions, confirming the validity of the model used.

conclusion: The study reveals a new symmetry-controlled mechanism for thermally activated inversions in trapped ion systems. By substituting isotopes, the authors effectively control the activation energy of the inversion process. This work not only provides insights into the fundamental kinetic isotope effects in trapped ion systems but also demonstrates the potential of using such systems as a versatile platform for exploring symmetry-controlled collective dynamics. The findings suggest applications in quantum information processing and precision metrology, where controlling symmetry-induced kinetic effects is crucial.

Further analysis of the experimental data, including detailed characterization of the energy landscapes and the verification of the Kramers-Langer predictions, would be beneficial for understanding the fundamental mechanisms behind the observed phenomena. Additionally, exploring similar symmetry effects in other trapped ion systems or different types of traps could lead to new discoveries in the field of mesoscopic physics.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive study of symmetry-controlled thermally activated inversions in trapped ion systems. By demonstrating how isotope substitution can influence the activation energy barriers, the authors have shown that trapped ions can be used as a versatile platform to explore symmetry-controlled collective dynamics. The combination of experimental observations and theoretical modeling, including the use of Kramers-Langer theory, provides a detailed understanding of the mechanisms at play. The findings open up new possibilities for future research in trapped ion systems, with potential applications in quantum information processing, precision measurements, and the study of molecular and nuclear dynamics.

Abstract: Laser-cooled ions confined in electromagnetic traps provide a unique, tunable mesoscopic system where the interplay of the trapping potential, nonlinear Coulomb interactions, and laser-ion scattering generates rich, collective dynamics. In this work, we engineer thermally activated switching between two oppositely oriented, square-pyramidal configurations of five laser-cooled ions in a Paul trap. For identical ions ($^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$), the inversions proceed via a \textit{Berry pseudo-rotation} mechanism with a low activation barrier, enabled by the permutation symmetry, in contrast to the \textit{umbrella inversion} observed in ammonia. The experimentally measured inversion rates, spanning two orders of magnitude, are accurately captured by the multidimensional Kramers-Langer theory, enabling thermometry of the Doppler-cooled ion cluster at $1.8 \pm 0.1$ mK. By substituting the apex ion with a heavier isotope ($^{44}\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$), we break the permutation symmetry and observe a suppression of thermally activated inversions. Numerical analysis reveals that this symmetry breaking closes the low-barrier channel, forcing the system to invert through a high-barrier \textit{turnstile rotation}. Thus, we demonstrate a structural analogue of molecular kinetic isotope effects, establishing trapped ions as a versatile platform to explore symmetry-controlled collective dynamics.

Conclusion: 这一工作为局域非微扰规范理论的构建提供了新途径。

Abstract: We propose a Hamiltonian framework for constructing chiral gauge theories on the lattice based on symmetry disentanglers: constant-depth circuits of local unitaries that transform not-on-site symmetries into on-site ones. When chiral symmetry can be realized not-on-site and such a disentangler exists, the symmetry can be implemented in a strictly local Hamiltonian and gauged by standard lattice methods. Using lattice rotor models, we realize this idea in 1+1 and 3+1 spacetime dimensions for $U(1)$ symmetries with mixed 't Hooft anomalies, and show that symmetry disentanglers can be constructed when anomalies cancel. As an example, we present an exactly solvable Hamiltonian lattice model of the (1+1)-dimensional "3450" chiral gauge theory, and we argue that a related construction applies to the $U(1)$ hypercharge symmetry of the Standard Model fermions in 3+1 dimensions. Our results open a new route toward fully local, nonperturbative formulations of chiral gauge theories.

Abstract: Correlation functions of local operators in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on hyperbolic space can be fully characterized by the set of QFT data $\lbrace Δ_i,C_{ijk},b^{\hat{\mathcal{O}}}_j\rbrace$. These are the scaling dimensions of boundary operators $Δ_i$, the boundary Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients $C_{ijk}$ and the Boundary Operator Expansion (BOE) coefficients $b^{\hat{\mathcal{O}}}_j$ that characterize how each bulk operator $\hat{\mathcal{O}}$ can be expanded in terms of boundary operators $\mathcal{O}_j$.For simplicity, we focus on two dimensional QFTs and derive a universal set of first order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) that encode the variation of the QFT data under an infinitesimal change of a bulk relevant coupling. In principle, our ODEs can be used to follow a Renormalization Group (RG) flow starting from a solvable QFT into a strongly coupled phase and to the flat space limit.

Abstract: The dynamics of Wilson loops is governed by an infinite set of Schwinger-Dyson equations and trace relations. In the context of the lattice positivity bootstrap, a central challenge is determining a dynamically independent basis of these operators within a truncated space. We present a systematic framework to solve this problem, utilizing a geometric plaquette-cut and subloop-cut strategy to efficiently generate all (local) direct equations. Furthermore, we identify and analyze ``indirect equations", which arise from the elimination of higher-length intermediate loops. We elucidate the origin of these subtle relations and propose a vertex-filtering strategy to construct them. Applying the above framework to SU(2) lattice Yang-Mills theory, we provide explicit counting of independent canonical loops and equations in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions, along with a statistical analysis of their asymptotic growth.

Abstract: Framing anomaly is a key property of $(2+1)d$ chiral topological orders, for it reveals that the chirality is an intrinsic bulk property of the system, rather than a property of the boundary between two systems. Understanding framing anomaly in lattice models is particularly interesting, as concrete, solvable lattice models of chiral topological orders are rare. In a recent work, we defined and solved the $U(1)$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, showing its chiral edge mode and the associated gravitational anomaly on boundary. In this work, we show its framing anomaly in the absence of boundary, by computing the expectation of a lattice version of the modular $T$ operator in the ground subspace on a spatial torus, from which we extract that $\langle T \rangle$ has a universal phase of $-2π/12$ as expected: $-2π/8$ from the Gauss-Milgram sum of the topological spins of the ground states, and $2π/24$ from the framing anomaly; we can also extract the $2π/24$ framing anomaly phase alone from the full spectrum of $T$ in the ground subspace by computing $\langle T^m \rangle$. This pins down the last and most crucial property required for a valid lattice definition of $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Motivated by a question of defining gauge-invariant observables in cosmology and by the close connection between perturbation theory in de Sitter (dS) and Anti-de Sitter (AdS), we study scalar electrodynamics in AdS in setups that are largely unexplored but relevant for dS physics. For photons with standard (Dirichlet) boundary conditions, we analyze charged scalars whose boundary conditions break the $U(1)$ symmetry. This leads to a nonstandard Higgs mechanism in which the gauge field acquires a one-loop mass without a classical vacuum expectation value. Using recent advances in perturbation theory in AdS, we compute this mass explicitly and evaluate charged-scalar four-point functions. We also provide an alternative derivation based on boundary Ward identities. For photons with alternate (Neumann) boundary conditions, where local charged operators are not gauge invariant, we construct physical observables by dressing charged fields with geodesic Wilson lines. These dressed operators have well-behaved conformal properties and unphysical photon modes decouple from their correlation functions. Explicit one-loop computations further reveal the decoupling of boundary field strengths, for which we provide a nonperturbative argument based on higher-form symmetry. Along the way, we explain the physical consequences of spontaneous breaking of higher-form symmetry in AdS, including the role of the tilt operator, the relation between one-form symmetry and endpoints of Wilson lines at the boundary, and a generalized-symmetry interpretation of conserved currents dual to bulk gauge fields.

TL;DR: The paper discusses celestial holography, which links particles in 4D spacetime to conformal field theory on a 2D sphere. It shows how multi-particle operators are built from single-particle operators and validates this through different methods. Finally, the paper enforces bulk four-dimensional translational invariance to derive results consistent with other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper likely focuses on understanding the holographic principle in quantum gravity and its implications for scattering processes in spacetime.

Method: The paper employs three distinct methods: conformal field theory, conformal-field-theoretic techniques, and bulk four-dimensional translational invariance as a global symmetry.

Result: All three methods yield the same results, confirming the consistency of the celestial holography framework in tree-level Yang-Mills and Einstein gravity.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates the validity and robustness of the multi-particle operator product expansions in celestial holography through three complementary methods.

Abstract: In celestial holography, scattering particles in four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes are dual to conformal primary field operators on the celestial sphere. Multi-particle celestial operators can be formed from regularized coincident limits of single-particle celestial operators. The singular terms in the operator product expansion of multi-particle operators are shown to be determined entirely by the singular terms in the operator product expansion between single-particle celestial operators, as expected in a standard conformal field theory. Boundary operator product expansions in celestial holography are known to be dual to subtle collinear limits of bulk scattering amplitudes. The multi-particle operator product expansions derived from standard conformal-field theoretic techniques are shown to reproduce precisely the results from the corresponding bulk collinear limits in tree-level Yang-Mills and Einstein gravity. Finally, the coefficients of multi-particle celestial operator product expansions are derived from a third complementary method that enforces bulk four-dimensional translational invariance as a global symmetry of the celestial dual. The results of all three methods agree precisely.

Abstract: It is known that, for a range of chemical potentials, the infrared behavior of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (cSYK) model is governed by a 1D Nearly Conformal Field Theory (NCFT$_{1}$), thereby realizing a continuous line of NCFTs. A finite chemical potential $μ$ introduces an asymmetry parameter $\mathscr{E}$ into the cSYK fermion two-point function in the conformal limit. In this work, we compute the cSYK four-point function in the conformal limit for an arbitrary value of $\mathscr{E}$ at leading order in $1/N$. We show that the result is fully consistent with the NCFT$_{1}$ structure of the cSYK model and use it to extract the structure constants for correlation functions of two complex fermions with bilinear operators.

Abstract: We construct singly and doubly spinning non-supersymmetric F1--P black ring solutions in five-dimensional supergravity. These black rings have regular horizons and non-zero temperature. The singly spinning configuration lies in the duality orbit of the black ring constructed by Elvang, Emparan, and Figueras, while the doubly spinning configuration is a charged extension of the black ring constructed by Chen, Hong, and Teo. We analyze the physical properties of these solutions and the various limits they admit. In particular, the doubly spinning solution admits an extremal limit in which the entropy satisfies the relation S= 2 πJ_φ, thereby linking it directly to the angular momentum on the S^2.

TL;DR: We construct the index saddle for the supersymmetric F1--P black ring by taking a supersymmetric limit of a doubly spinning F1--P black ring. The resulting saddle is expressed as a three-center Bena--Warner solution with a finite-area event horizon. Though the two-derivative index vanishes, higher-derivative corrections are expected to yield a finite result on singular subspaces of the horizon. A scaling analysis shows agreement with the microscopic result within a parameter space subset, though the full significance of this region remains unclear.

Motivation: This paper contributes to understanding black ring solutions in string theory and their associated indices, aiming to bridge between macroscopic and microscopic descriptions.

Method: The methodology involves taking a supersymmetric limit of an existing non-supersymmetric solution and analyzing its properties, particularly focusing on the index and its behavior under higher-derivative corrections.

Result: The construction yields a finite-area event horizon saddle solution with a singular structure requiring higher-derivative corrections. The scaling analysis aligns with the microscopic result modulo a numerical constant within a specific parameter space subset.

Conclusion: This research partially validates the microscopic origin of the index saddle for supersymmetric black rings, identifying key corrections and regions where such agreement holds.

Abstract: We construct the index saddle for the supersymmetric F1--P black ring. Our construction proceeds by taking a supersymmetric limit of a non-supersymmetric doubly spinning F1--P black ring. We express the resulting saddle as a three-center Bena--Warner solution. The black ring saddle possesses a finite-area event horizon, yet the two-derivative index vanishes. The solution is singular on certain subspaces of the horizon, where higher-derivative corrections are expected to become important. We argue that, once such corrections are taken into account, the solution can yield a finite result. In particular, we present a scaling analysis showing that the index agrees with the microscopic result, up to an overall numerical constant that cannot be fixed by the scaling argument alone.

Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional conformal amplitude whose four-point structure matches the Virasoro-Shapiro form familiar from string theory. The construction uses only general principles of conformal field theory - radial quantization, scale invariance, and analyticity - and does not rely on worldsheet geometry or string degrees of freedom. The resulting object is a kinematical, first quantized amplitude defined by symmetry and consistency, providing a four-dimensional realization of stringlike analytic structure and a concrete target for amplitude bootstrap approaches.

Abstract: We investigate how the gravitational effects of a black hole manifest themselves as thermal behavior in the dual finite-temperature conformal field theory (CFT). In the holographic framework of AdS/CFT, we analyze a wave packet propagating into a black hole geometry in the bulk by computing three-point functions of a scalar primary operator in the boundary CFT. Our setup captures thermal signatures such as exponential damping of the expectation value, which are absent at zero-temperature. This provides a concrete and analytically tractable example of how black hole physics can be probed from the CFT side.

Abstract: We apply the conformal compensating technique for constructing matter couplings to conformal scalars on a $D$-dimensional foliated conformal Carroll manifold dividing the tangent space into $(p+1)$-dimensional longitudinal and $(D-p-1)$-dimensional transversal directions corresponding to $p$-branes. We show that the conformal Carroll algebra that was used for particle-like foliated geometries with $p=0$ cannot be used for higher-dimensional objects, called $p$-branes, with $0 < p \le D-2$. Furthermore, string-like foliated geometries are not suitable for the conformal compensating technique due to the conformal invariance in the longitudinal directions that is present for $p=1$. All other cases can be dealt with provided one uses a different conformal extension of the Carroll algebra that amounts to a conformal extension in the longitudinal directions only supplemented with an additional an-isotropic dilatation.
  By brane-duality similar results hold for foliated Galilean geometries which we present as well. Our results nicely fit in with recent work on foliated Aristotelian geometries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding entanglement properties in complex spacetime geometries is crucial for testing quantum field theory predictions.

Method: The study focuses on a two-dimensional free scalar chiral current model, analyzing entanglement measures for ground states across line and circular spacetimes with two intervals.

Result: They derive analytic expressions for the moments of the partial transpose and logarithmic negativity, finding agreement with numerical lattice model results, and observe topological effects in small and large interval separations.

Conclusion: This work bridges entanglement negativity and mutual information, showing shared topological features influenced by symmetries in quantum field theories with nontrivial topologies.

Abstract: We study the entanglement negativity for the free, scalar chiral current in two spacetime dimensions, which is a simple model violating the Haag duality in regions with nontrivial topology. For the ground state of the system, both on the line and on the circle, we consider the setups given by two intervals, either adjacent or disjoint. We find analytic expressions for the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix and the logarithmic negativity. In the limit of small separation distance, this expression yields the same subleading topological contribution occurring in the mutual information. In the limit of large separation distance between the two intervals, the exponential decay of the logarithmic negativity is obtained from its analytic expression. The analytic formulas are checked against exact numerical results from a bosonic lattice model, finding a perfect agreement. We observe that, since the chiral current generates the neutral subalgebra of the full chiral Dirac fermion theory, this analysis highlights how symmetries produce nontrivial features in the entanglement structure that are analogue to those ones already observed in the mutual information for regions with nontrivial topology.

Abstract: The Taub-NUT and Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instantons, along with the self-dual Plebanski-Demianski metric, form a set of Euclidean metrics which can naturally be called `self-dual black holes', as they arise from self-dual slices of the most general vacuum, asymptotically flat black hole metric. These self-dual black holes are of interest for many reasons, and can famously be described through the non-linear graviton construction of twistor theory. However, the implicit nature of this twistor description obscures some features of the underlying geometry, particularly for the most general self-dual black holes. In this paper, we give a new construction of all asymptotically flat self-dual black holes based on holomorphic quadrics in flat dual twistor space, rather than the usual twistor space associated with self-duality. Remarkably, the geometry of the self-dual black holes -- including their hyperkahler structure, as well as Kerr-Schild and Gibbons-Hawking forms -- is directly encoded in the corresponding quadric. As a consequence, we obtain a previously unknown single Kerr-Schild form of the self-dual Plebanski-Demianski metric.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum geometry of the Seiberg-Witten curve for $\mathcal{N}=2$, $\mathrm{SU(2)}^n$ linear quiver gauge theories. By applying the Weyl quantization prescription to the algebraic curve, we derive the corresponding second-order differential equation and demonstrate that it is isomorphic to the Extended Heun Equation with $n+3$ regular singular points. The physical parameters of the gauge theory are linked to the canonical coefficients of the Heun equation via a polynomial representation of the Seiberg-Witten curve. This framework provides the necessary mathematical foundation to apply non-perturbative gauge-theoretic techniques, such as instanton counting, to spectral problems in gravitational physics, most notably for higher-dimensional black holes.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了自由标量量子场论中贝尔-CHSH不等式违背的具体实现，丰富了量子纠缠在相对论背景下的理论模型。

Abstract: A cat state localized in the right Rindler wedge is employed to study the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality in a relativistic scalar free Quantum Field Theory. By means of the bounded Hermitian operator $sign(\varphi(f))$, where $\varphi(f)$ stands for the smeared scalar field, it turns out that the Bell-CHSH correlator can be evaluated in closed analytic form in terms of the imaginary error function. Being the superposition of two coherent states, cat states allow for the existence of interference terms which give rise to a violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. As such, the present setup can be considered as an explicit realization of the results obtained by Summers-Werner.

Abstract: We present explicit top-down calculations of Open EFTs for gauged degrees of freedom with a focus on the effects of gauge fixing. Starting from the in-in contour with two copies of the action, we integrate out the charged matter in various $U(1)$ gauge theories to obtain the Feynman-Vernon influence functional for the photon, or, in the case of symmetry breaking, for the photon and Stückelberg fields. The influence functional is defined through a quantum path integral, which -- as is always the case when quantizing gauge degrees of freedom -- contains redundancies that must be eliminated via a gauge-fixing procedure. We implement the BRST formalism in this setting. The in-in boundary conditions break the two copies of BRST symmetry down to a single diagonal copy. Nevertheless the single diagonal BRST is sufficient to ensure that the influence functional is itself gauge invariant under two copies of gauge symmetries, retarded and advanced, regardless of the choice of state or symmetry-breaking phase. We clarify how this is consistent with the decoupling limit where the global advanced symmetry is generically broken by the state. We illustrate our results with several examples: a gauge field theory analogue of the Caldeira-Leggett model, spinor QED with fermions integrated out, scalar QED in a thermal state, the Abelian Higgs-Kibble model in the spontaneously broken state with the Higgs integrated out, and Abelian Higgs-Kibble model coupled to a charged bath in a symmetry-broken phase. The latter serves as an example of an open system for Stückelberg/Goldstone fields.

Abstract: Brain networks exhibit remarkable structural properties, including high local clustering, short path lengths, and heavy-tailed weight and degree distributions. While these features are thought to enable efficient information processing with minimal wiring costs, the fundamental principles that generate such complex network architectures across species remain unclear. Here, we analyse single-neuron resolution connectomes across five species (C. Elegans, Platynereis, Drosophila M., zebrafish and mouse) to investigate the fundamental wiring principles underlying brain network formation. We show that distance-dependent connectivity alone produces small-world networks, but fails to generate heavy-tailed distributions. By incorporating weight-preferential attachment, which arises from spatial clustering of synapses along neurites, we reproduce heavy-tailed weight distributions while maintaining small-world topology. Adding degree-preferential attachment, linked to the extent of dendritic and axonal arborization, enables the generation of heavy-tailed degree distributions. Through systematic parameter exploration, we demonstrate that the combination of distance dependence, weight-preferential attachment, and degree-preferential attachment is sufficient to reproduce all characteristic properties of empirical brain networks. Our results reveal that activity-independent geometric constraints during neural development can account for the conserved architectural principles observed across evolutionarily distant species, suggesting universal mechanisms governing neural circuit assembly.

TL;DR:  Chaotic Resetting can accelerate deterministic chaotic systems through phase space mixing, and this approach avoids the limitations of fixed or random restarting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  The paper aims to show how deterministic chaos can be harnessed to accelerate processes through a novel restarting mechanism.

Method:  The authors analyze chaotic systems, identify regions with fractal and smooth dynamics, and theoretically evaluate how these properties facilitate effective restarting.

Result:  When an optimal resetting interval is applied, the average search time decreases, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion:  Chaotic resetting is a promising approach for optimizing processes in systems where controlling initial conditions is not possible, providing a bridge between chaos theory and search optimization.

Abstract: Restarting a stochastic search process can accelerate its completion by providing an opportunity to take a more favorable path with each reset. This strategy, known as stochastic resetting, is well studied in random processes. Here, we introduce chaotic resetting, a fundamentally different resetting strategy designed for deterministic chaotic systems. Unlike stochastic resetting, where randomness is intrinsic to the dynamics, chaotic resetting exploits the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions inherent to chaotic motion: unavoidable uncertainties in the reset conditions effectively generate new realizations of the deterministic process. This extension is nontrivial because some realizations may significantly speed up the search, while others may significantly slow it down. We study the conditions required for chaotic resetting to be consistently advantageous, concluding that it requires the presence of a mixed phase space in which fractal and smooth regions coexist. We quantify its effectiveness by demonstrating substantial reductions in average search times when an optimal resetting interval is used. These results establish a clear conceptual bridge between deterministic chaos and search optimization, opening new avenues for accelerating processes in real-world chaotic systems where perfect control or knowledge of initial conditions is unattainable.

Abstract: False vacuum decay, which is understood to happen through bubble nucleation, is a prominent phenomenon relevant to elementary particle physics and early-universe cosmology. Understanding its microscopic dynamics in higher spatial dimensions is currently a major challenge and research thrust. Recent advances in numerical techniques allow for the extraction of related signatures in tractable systems in two spatial dimensions over intermediate timescales. Here, we focus on the $2+1$D quantum Ising model, where a longitudinal field is used to energetically separate the two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-broken ferromagnetic ground states, turning them into a ``true'' and ``false'' vacuum. Using tree tensor networks, we simulate the microscopic dynamics of a spin-down domain in a spin-up background after a homogeneous quench, with parameters chosen so that the domain corresponds to a bubble of the true vacuum in a false-vacuum background. Our study identifies how the ultimate fate of the bubble -- indefinite expansion or collapse -- depends on its geometrical features and on the microscopic parameters of the Ising Hamiltonian. We further provide a realistic quantum-simulation scheme, aimed at probing bubble dynamics on atomic Rydberg arrays.

Abstract: We present a novel protocol to detect rare signals in a noisy environment using quantum error correction (QEC). The key feature of our protocol is the discrimination between signal and noise through distinct higher-order correlations, realized by the non-linear processing that occurs during syndrome extraction in QEC. In this scheme, QEC has two effects: First, it sacrifices part of the signal $ε$ by recording a reduced, stochastic, logical phase $φ_L = \mathcal{O}(ε^3)$. Second, it corrects the physical noise and extends the (logical) coherence time for signal acquisition. For rare signals occurring at random times in the presence of local Markovian noise, we explicitly demonstrate an improved sensitivity of our approach over more conventional sensing strategies.

Abstract: The path integral Lindblad dynamics (PILD) method [A. Bose, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 15(12), 3363-3368 (2024)] had been introduced as a way of incorporating the impact of certain empirical processes like pumps and drains on the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with thermal environments. The method being based on the time-translational invariance of the Nakajima-Zwanzig memory kernel, however, was not able to account for time-dependent external fields. In this communication, we give an alternate, simpler formulation of PILD, that allows us to go beyond this limitation. It does not require the evaluation of the non-Markovian memory kernel directly, and consequently can be applied to Floquet systems as well.

Abstract: Entangled many-body states enable high-precision quantum sensing beyond the standard quantum limit. We develop interferometric sensing protocols based on quantum critical wavefunctions and compare their performance with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and spin-squeezed states. Building on the idea of symmetries as a metrological resource, we introduce a symmetry-based algorithm to identify optimal measurement strategies. We illustrate this algorithm both for magnetic systems with internal symmetries and Rydberg-atom arrays with spatial symmetries. We study the robustness of criticality for quantum sensing under non-unitary deformations, symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking decoherence, and qubit loss -- identifying regimes where critical systems outperform GHZ states and showing that non-unitary deformation can even enhance sensing precision. Combined with recent results on log-depth preparation of critical wavefunctions, interferometric sensing in this setting appears increasingly promising.

Motivation: This research focuses on developing quantum algorithms for solving nonlinear differential equations, a critical area in computational mathematics and physics with broad applications effectiveness. This work contributes to the growing field of quantum computing by demonstrating a viable method for tackling complex nonlinear problems using quantum resources.

Method: The approach involves using a variational quantum neural network (QNN) to formulate the boundary value problem as an optimization task. The solution is encoded in a parameterized quantum circuit, with the trial solution incorporating classical approximations and boundary conditions to guide the optimization process. A noiseless quantum simulator is used to evaluate and optimize the quantum circuit parameters, ensuring the solution satisfies the differential equation and boundary conditions.

Result: The algorithm successfully solves the nonlinear Bratu equation, capturing both solution branches and demonstrating excellent agreement with classical numerical methods. This indicates that the method is accurate and robust.

Conclusion: The variational quantum algorithm provides a promising alternative for solving complex nonlinear differential equations, especially in cases where classical methods may be computationally intensive or infeasible. This work opens new possibilities for quantum computing in advancing computational mathematics and applied sciences where such problems are prevalent and crucial.

Abstract: We present a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) to solve the nonlinear one-dimensional Bratu equation. By formulating the boundary value problem within a variational framework and encoding the solution in a parameterized quantum neural network (QNN), the problem reduces to an optimization task over quantum circuit parameters. The trial solution incorporates both classical approximations and boundary-enforcing terms, allowing the circuit to focus on minimizing the residual of the differential operator. Using a noiseless quantum simulator, we demonstrate that the method accurately captures both solution branches of the Bratu equation and shows excellent agreement with classical pseudo arc-length continuation results.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores how QUBO penalties affect the thermodynamic performance of quantum annealing, showing that changing penalty weights can transition between feasible and infeasible states and influence the efficiency of quantum processors. They also demonstrate how these transitions impact the energy landscape and overall thermodynamic properties of the system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between QUBO penalties and thermodynamic processes in quantum annealing is crucial for optimizing the performance of quantum processors, especially as they become more complex and noisy.

Method: The researchers conducted a comprehensive study of a Job Shop Scheduling problem using various QUBO encodings with different penalty weights. They analyzed the energy landscapes, performed annealing experiments, and measured thermodynamic quantities like entropy production and heat exchange.

Result: Strong evidence was found that adjusting penalty weights can control the system's thermodynamic behavior, potentially allowing for more efficient processing. The study also established a link between computational hardness and thermodynamic irreversibility, guiding future quantum optimization strategies.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between quantum computing and thermodynamics, offering practical insights for enhancing the efficiency of quantum annealing processes by carefully tuning QUBO penalties.

Abstract: Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) is the standard interface to quantum annealers, yet a single constrained task admits many QUBO encodings whose penalty choices reshape the energy landscape experienced by hardware. We study a Job Shop Scheduling instance using a two-parameter family of encodings controlled by penalty weights $p_{\rm sum}$ (one-hot/sum constraints) and $p_{\rm pair}$ (precedence constraints). Sweeping $(p_{\rm sum},p_{\rm pair})$, we observe sharp transitions in feasibility and solver success across classical annealing-inspired heuristics and on a D-Wave Advantage processor. Going beyond solution probability, we treat the annealer as an open thermodynamic system and perform cyclic reverse-annealing experiments initialized from thermal samples, measuring the stochastic processor energy change. From the first two moments of this energy change we infer lower bounds on entropy production, work, and exchanged heat via thermodynamic uncertainty relations, and corroborate the observed trends with adiabatic master equation simulations. We find that the same encoding transitions that govern computational hardness also reorganize dissipation: weak penalties generate low-energy infeasible manifolds, while overly strong penalties suppress the effective problem energy scale and increase irreversibility, reducing the thermodynamic efficiency. Our results establish QUBO penalties as thermodynamic control knobs and motivate thermodynamics-aware encoding strategies for noisy intermediate-scale quantum annealers.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种新的分析多端电磁网络的方法，通过节点点对点电导率简化Schur补矩阵，从而更高效地计算系统行为。这一发现对量子电动力学参数（如coupling strength $g$，anharmonicity $α$和dispersive shift $χ$）的理论分析具有重要意义，明确了它们的控制范围和适用条件。这为未来的网络设计和优化提供了基础。

Abstract: We show that the Schur complement of the nodal admittance matrix, which reduces a multiport electromagnetic environment to the driving-point admittance $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$ at the Josephson junction, naturally leads to an eigenvalue-dependent boundary condition determining the dressed mode spectrum. This identification provides a four-step quantization procedure: (i) compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii) solve the boundary condition $sY_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$ for dressed frequencies, (iii) synthesize an equivalent passive network, (iv) quantize with the full cosine nonlinearity retained. Within passive lumped-element circuit theory, we prove that junction participation decays as, we prove that junction participation decays as $O(ω_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies when the junction port has finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative sums without imposed cutoffs. The standard circuit QED parameters, coupling strength $g$, anharmonicity $α$, and dispersive shift $χ$, emerge as controlled limits with explicit validity conditions.

Abstract: Large-scale tensor network simulations are crucial for developing robust complexity-theoretic bounds on classical quantum simulation, enabling circuit cutting approaches, and optimizing circuit compilation, all of which aid efficient quantum computation on limited quantum resources. Modern exascale high-performance computing platforms offer significant potential for advancing tensor network quantum circuit simulation capabilities. We implement TN-Sim, a tensor network simulator backend within the NWQ-Sim software package that utilizes the Tensor Algebra for Many-body Methods (TAMM) framework to support both distributed HPC-scale computations and local simulations with ITensor. To optimize the scale up in computation across multiple nodes we implement a task based parallelization scheme to demonstrate parallelized gate contraction for wide quantum circuits with many gates per layer. Through the integration of the TAMM framework with Matrix Product State (MPS) tensor network approaches, we deliver a simulation environment that can scale from local systems to HPC clusters. We demonstrate an MPS tensor network simulator running on the state-of-the-art Perlmutter (NVIDIA) supercomputer and discuss the potential portability of this software to HPC clusters such as Frontier (AMD) and Aurora (Intel).

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究者提出了动量空间纠缠熵来衡量动量不同模式之间的量子关联，特别是在量子摆动相转移（DQPT）后，发现每个临界动量$k^{*}$对应于DQPT的动量时，其纠缠熵达到最大值$	ext{ln} d$（在TFI和SSH模型中$d=2$），与Loschmidt回声消失一致，这表明动量模式的纠缠在DQPT时达到最大值，从而直接提供了DQPT的标志，从而为理解DQPT提供了一个统一的、基于纠缠的视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子关联变化在量子摆动相转移中的地位及其表现形式，以更透彻理解量子相变的动态过程。

Method: 通过在TFI模型和SSH链中进行解析计算，特别是在动量空间分析纠缠熵，证明了DQPT过程中的临界动量性质，以及与Loschmidt回声之间的关系。

Result: 在研究中，在临界动量$k^{*}$处，动量模式之间的量子关联达到最大——$	ext{ln} 2$，同时伴随Loschmidt回声消失。发现这些现象可以用动量空间纠缠熵的饱和行为来解释。这意味着，利用这种纠缠熵可以有效识别和分析DQPT。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，动量空间的量子纠缠性在DQPT中达到峰值，这提供了识别和研究DQPT的一种新的方法。该结论对理解量子动力学相变及其在不同量子系统中的表现具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce a momentum-space entanglement entropy to quantify quantum correlations between distinct momentum modes following a quench. We prove analytically in the transverse-field Ising (TFI) model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain that every critical momentum $k^{*}$ associated with a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) saturates its entanglement entropy to the maximal value $\ln{d}$ ($d=2$ in TFI and SSH models), coinciding with the vanishing of the Loschmidt echo. This saturation of mode entanglement thus provides a universal, direct signature of DQPTs. Our work thus establishes a unified, entanglement-based perspective on dynamical quantum phase transitions.

*Sayan Gangopadhyay,Sasan V. Grayli,Sathursan Kokilathasan,Michael E. Reimer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses an improved method for generating high-quality entangled photon pairs with high efficiency for quantum networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for bright, on-demand entangled photons in quantum networks is a significant motivator. Current methods using quantum dots in nanowire waveguides face challenges, including low photon distinguishability. The development of a scalable, efficient entangled photon source is crucial for quantum communication applications.

Method: The study proposes a nanowire cavity design utilizing quasi-bound states in the continuum, achieved by coupling two resonant optical modes. The cavity design aims to enhance single-photon distinguishability by increasing Purcell efficiency and reducing bandwidth loss. Numerical simulations predict a 4 nm bandwidth cavity mode with a Purcell factor of approximately 17.

Result: The proposed design achieves a directional far-field emission profile with 88% overlap to a Gaussian, enabling efficient light extraction (74%). This method significantly reduces the loss of single-photon distinguishability compared to previous cavity approaches, supporting Enhanced entangled photon generation and improved quantum network applications.

Conclusion: By integrating quasi-bound states in the continuum with a novel nanowire cavity, the study presents a promising solution for generating high-efficiency, distinguishable entangled photon pairs, facilitating practical quantum network implementations.

Abstract: A bright source of on-demand entangled photons is needed for quantum networks. A single quantum dot in a site-selected nanowire waveguide is a promising candidate for realizing such sources. However, such sources are associated with poor single-photon indistinguishability, limiting their applicability in quantum networks. A common approach for enhancing the single-photon indistinguishability in quantum dot-based entangled photon sources is to implement a broadband optical cavity. Achieving a high-Purcell cavity while retaining the advantages of the nanowire, such as directional emission, a broad operational bandwidth, and high light extraction efficiency, has been a significant challenge. Here, we propose a nanowire cavity based on quasi-bound states in the continuum formed by the strong coupling of two resonant optical modes. We numerically predict this design to support a cavity mode with 4 nm bandwidth and a Purcell enhancement of $\sim$17. This cavity mode enables a directional far-field emission profile (88% overlap with a Gaussian) with a light extraction efficiency of $\sim$74%. Our solution opens up a route for generating entangled photon pairs with enhanced extraction efficiency and single-photon indistinguishability for the practical realization of quantum networks.

Abstract: We give an algorithm for pure state tomography with near-optimal copy complexity using single-qubit measurements. Specifically, given $\widetilde{O}(2^n/ε)$ copies of an unknown pure $n$-qubit state $\lvertψ\rangle$, the algorithm performs only \textit{nonadaptive Pauli measurements}, runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(2^n,1/ε)$, and outputs $\lvert \widehatψ \rangle$ that has fidelity $1-ε$ with $\lvert ψ\rangle$ with high probability. This improves upon the previous best copy complexity bound of $\widetilde{O}(3^n/ε)$.

Abstract: Chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) enables spin selectivity of charge carriers in chiral molecular systems without magnetic materials. While spin selectivity has been widely investigated, its quantum coherence has not yet been explored. Here, we investigate spin-dependent photoluminescence (PL) dynamics in multilayer quantum-dot (QD) assemblies coupled by chiral linkers. Using circularly polarized excitation in the presence of an external magnetic field, we observe a pronounced modulation of the PL lifetime that depends on the magnetic field magnitude and geometry. The lifetime difference between left- and right-circularly polarized excitations exhibits a field-angle dependence, consistent with spin precession driven by the transverse magnetic-field component relative to the chiral axis. A model incorporating coupled spin precession and decay processes reproduces the experimental trends. These results establish chiral QD assemblies as a room-temperature platform for probing quantum coherent manifestations of the CISS effect, with implications for spintronic and quantum technologies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Using quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, a secret key is created between two distant users (transmitter and receiver) at a particular key rate. Quantum technology can facilitate secure communication for cryptographic applications, combining QKD with one-time-pad (OTP) encryption. In order to ensure the continuous operation of QKD in real-world networks, efforts have been concentrated on optimizing the use of components and effective QKD protocols to improve secret key rates and increase the transmission between multiple users. Generally, in experimental implementations, the secret key rates are limited by single-photon detectors, which are used at the receivers of QKD and create a bottleneck due to their limited detection rates (detectors with low detection efficiency and high detector dead-time). We experimentally show that secret key rates can be increased by combining the time-bin information of two such detectors on the data line of the receiver for the coherent-one-way (COW) QKD protocol with a minimal increase in quantum bit error rate (QBER, the proportion of erroneous bits). Further, we implement a point-to-multipoint COW QKD protocol, introducing an additional receiver module. The three users (one transmitter and two receivers) share the secret key in post-processing, relying on OTP encryption. Typically, the dual-receiver extension can improve the combined secret key rates of the system; however, one has to optimise the experimental parameters to achieve this within security margins. These methods are general and can be applied to any implementation of the COW protocol.

*Jie Feng,XiaoDi Liu,Haian Xu,Pu Wang,Graeme J. Ackland,Eugene Gregoryanz*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This study uses Raman spectroscopy to investigate rotational excitation in dense hydrogen, deuterium, and their mixtures under various conditions. The key findings are the presence of a zero Raman shift in the gas phase but a significant shift in solid phases. Deuterium exhibits a complex splitting pattern, indicating a complex molecular environment in the broken symmetry phase (BSP). The ΔJ=0 transition shows unique scaling properties, making it distinct from typical harmonic oscillators and quantum rotors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for studying vibrational and rotational modes in gases and solids. This study explores novel rotational excitation in dense hydrogen and deuterium mixtures, which is relevant to understanding phase transitions and molecular environments under extreme conditions.

Method: Raman measurements were conducted on dense H2, D2, and H2+D2 in a wide pressure-temperature range. Analysis included measuring rotational excitation and identifying zero Raman shifts in gases versus non-zero shifts in solids. Deuterium was studied in phases I and II to observe splitting patterns in the ΔJ=0 mode. Scaling properties of the ΔJ=0 transition were analyzed for H2 and D2 in different phases.

Result: In the gas phase, the ΔJ=0 rotational excitation has zero Raman shift. However, in solid phases, the shift is significant, reaching tens of cm-1 under high pressure and low temperature. For deuterium, the ΔJ=0 mode splits into distinct components in phase II, suggesting a complex molecular environment. The ΔJ=0 transition in H2 and D2 does not follow typical harmonic oscillator or quantum rotor scaling, indicating a fundamentally different type of excitation. Isotope independence of the ΔJ=0 transition is noted.

Conclusion: This study reveals unique rotational excitation properties in dense hydrogen and deuterium mixtures. The Kodd Raman shifts in solids and the isotope-independent ΔJ=0 transition point to fundamentally different vibrational dynamics in gases and solid phases, highlighting the importance of considering phase-specific molecular environments.

Abstract: Raman measurements performed on dense H2, D2 and H2+D2 in a wide pressure-temperature range reveal the presence of the ΔJ=0 rotational excitation. In the gas/fluid state this excitation has zero Raman shift, but in the solid, the crystal field drive s it away from the zero value e.g. 75 cm-1 at around 50 GPa and 10 K for both isotopes and their mixture. In the case of deuterium, the ΔJ=0 mode splits upon entering phase II suggesting a very complex molecular environment of the broken symmetry phase (BSP). In the fluid state and phases I and II the frequencies (energies) of the ΔJ=0 transition for H2 and D2 do not scale either as rotational (by factor of 2) nor vibrational (by square 2) modes and appear to be completely isotope independent. This independence on mass marks this transition as unique and a fundamentally different type of excitation from the commonly considered harmonic oscillator and quantum rotor.

Abstract: Trapped ions naturally host multiple motional modes alongside long-lived spin qubits, providing a scalable multimode bosonic register. Efficiently characterizing such bosonic registers requires the ability to access many motional modes with limited spin resources. Here we introduce a single-spin, multimode measurement primitive using dispersive shifts in the far-detuned multimode Jaynes-Cummings interaction. We implement a Ramsey sequence that maps phonon-number-dependent phases onto the spin, thereby realizing a multimode spin-dependent rotation (SDR). We also introduce a selective-decoupling scheme that cancels the phase induced by the carrier AC-Stark shift while preserving the phonon-number-dependent phase induced by the dispersive shift. Using this SDR-based Ramsey sequence on a single trapped ion, we experimentally extract two-mode Fock-state distributions, perform parity-based filtering of two-mode motional states, and realize a nondestructive single-shot measurement of a single-mode Fock state via repeated filtering steps.

TL;DR: Investigated cyclic entanglement in four-particle systems and found stronger nonlocality than fully entangled systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the structure of entanglement and nonlocality is crucial for quantum information processing.

Method: Used cyclic entangled systems and quantum circuits to study nonlocality through simulation and experimental testing on IBM Brisbane.

Result: Observed larger contradictions with local hidden variable models compared to fully entangled states.

Conclusion: Cyclic entanglement structures enhance nonlocality, providing new insights into quantum mechanics applications.

Abstract: Nonlocality can be studied through different approaches, such as Bell's inequalities, and it can be found in numerous quantum states, including GHZ states or graph states. Hardy's paradox, or Hardy-type nonlocality, provides a way to investigate nonlocality for entangled states of particles without using inequalities. Previous studies of Hardy's nonlocality have mostly focused on the fully entangled systems, while other entanglement configurations remain less explored. In this work, the system under investigation consists of four particles arranged in a cyclic entanglement configuration, where each particle forms entangled pairs with two neighbors, while non-neighboring particles remain unentangled. We found that this entanglement structure offers a larger set of conditions that lead to the contradiction with the LHV model, compared to the fully entangled systems. This enhancement can be attributed to the presence of multiple excluded states and correlations, in which the measurement result of a particle only influences the result of its paired partners. We implement quantum circuits compatible with the cyclic entanglement structure, and through simulation, the correlation patterns and the states of interest are identified. We further execute the proposed circuits on IBM Brisbane, a practical backend; however, the results show considerable deviations from the simulation counterparts.

Abstract: The efficient interfacing of quantum emitters and photons is fundamental to quantum networking. Quantum defects embedded in integrated nanophotonic circuits are promising for such applications due to the deterministic light-matter interactions of high-cooperativity ($C>1$) cavity quantum electrodynamics and potential for scalable integration with active photonic processing. Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers embedded in diamond nanophotonic cavities are a leading approach due to their excellent optical and spin coherence, however their long-term scalability is limited by the diamond itself, as its suspended geometry and weak nonlinearity necessitates coupling to a second processing chip. Here we realize the first high-cooperativity coupling of quantum defects to hybrid-integrated nanophotonics in a scalable, planar platform. We integrate more than 600 gallium phosphide (GaP) nanophotonic cavities on a diamond substrate with near-surface SiV centers. We examine a particular device with two strongly coupled SiV centers in detail, confirming above-unity cooperativity via multiple independent measurements. Application of an external magnetic field via a permanent magnet enables optical resolution of the SiV spin transitions from which we determine a spin-relaxation time $T_1>0.4$ ms at 4 K. We utilize the high cooperativity coupling to observe spin-dependent transmission switching and the quantum jumps of the SiV spin via single-shot readout. These results, coupled with GaP's strong nonlinear properties, establish GaP-on-diamond as a scalable planar platform for quantum network applications.

To address this, we introduce SurgeQ, a hardware-software co-design strategy consisting of a design phase and an execution phase, to achieve accelerated circuit execution and improve overall program fidelity. SurgeQ employs coupling-strengthened, faster two-qubit gates while mitigating their increased crosstalk through a tailored scheduling strategy. With detailed consideration of composite noise models, we establish a systematic evaluation pipeline to identify the optimal coupling strength. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of real-world benchmarks show that SurgeQ generally achieves higher fidelity than up-to-date baselines, and remains effective in combating exponential fidelity decay, achieving up to a million-fold improvement in large-scale circuits.

### [62] [Regularization from Superpositions of Time Evolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04685)
*Eliahu Cohen,Tomer Shushi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  Innovatively present regulators as postselected evolutions, linking path integrals and singular potentials through Gaussian filters that suppress high-energy contributions. Showcasing a multi-step approach to unitary dynamics and renormalization. Please let me know if you need more details or the entire paper.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the use of path integrals in the presence of singular interactions, pushing the boundaries of conventional regulators through novel postselection methods. It’s groundbreaking by linking interference phenomena to effective suppression mechanisms, promising applications in quantum field theory.

Method: The authors employ a superposition of time evolution operators, postselecting with interference, deriving Gaussian filters that act as suppressive regulators. This method is mathematically rigorous, involving operator algebra and careful analysis of convergence and renormalization effects.

Result: The study establishes a robust framework for handling singular potentials in path integral descriptions. It identifies a class of universal regulators derived from coherent superpositions, which can be systematically renormalized and removed, offering a versatile toolset for quantizing systems with singular interactions.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for managing divergences in quantum field theory. By interpreting regulators as coherent postselected evolutions, it provides a unified approach to singular potential quantization, with promising implications for understanding UV/IR relationships and perturbative expansions.

Abstract: Short-time approximations and path integrals can be dominated by high-energy or large-field contributions, especially in the presence of singular interactions, motivating regulators that are suppressive yet removable. Standard regulators typically impose such suppressions by hand (e.g. cutoffs, higher-derivative terms, heat-kernel smearing, lattice discretizations), while here we show that closely related smooth filters can arise as the conditional map produced by interference in a coherently controlled, postselected superposition of evolutions. A successful postselection implements a single heralded operator that is a coherent linear combination of time-evolution operators. For a Gaussian superposition of time translations in quantum mechanics, the postselected step is $V_{σ,Δt}=e^{-iHΔt}\,e^{-\frac12σ^2Δt^2H^2}$, i.e.\ the desired unitary step multiplied by a Gaussian energy filter suppressing energies above order $1/(σΔt)$. This renders short-time kernels in time-sliced path-integral approximations well behaved for singular potentials, while the target unitary dynamics is recovered as $σ\to0$ and (for fixed $σ$) also as $Δt\to0$ at fixed $t$. In scalar QFT, a local Gaussian smearing of the quartic coupling induces a positive $(σ^2/2)φ^8$ term in the Euclidean action, providing a symmetry-compatible large-field stabilizer; it is naturally viewed as an irrelevant operator whose effects can be renormalized at fixed $σ$ (together with a conventional UV regulator) and removed by taking $σ\to0$. We give short-time error bounds and analyze multi-step success probabilities.

Abstract: The scalable preparation of bosonic quantum states with macroscopic excitations poses a fundamental challenge in quantum technologies, limited by control complexity and photon-loss rates that severely constrain prior theoretical and experimental efforts to merely dozens of excitations per mode. Here, based on the duality of the quantum state evolution in Fock state space and the optical wave-function propagation in a waveguide array, we introduce a Kerr-engineered multi-lens protocol in a single bosonic mode to deterministically generate Fock states exceeding $10,000$ photons. By optimizing phase and displacement operations across lens groups, our approach compensates for non-paraxial aberrations, achieving fidelities above $73\%$ in numerical simulations for photon numbers up to $N=100,000$. Counterintuitively, the protocol's execution time scales as $N^{-1/2}$ with the target photon number $N$, exhibiting robustness against the photon loss. Our framework enables exploration of quantum-to-classical transitions of giant Fock states, paving the way for advanced quantum metrology with significant quantum gains, and error-corrected quantum information processing in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising application domain for near-term quantum hardware, particularly through hybrid quantum-classical models that leverage both classical and quantum processing. Although numerous hybrid architectures have been proposed and demonstrated successfully on benchmark tasks, a significant open question remains regarding the specific contribution of quantum components to the overall performance of these models. In this work, we aim to shed light on the impact of quantum processing within hybrid quantum-classical neural network architectures through a rigorous statistical study. We systematically assess common hybrid models on medical signal data as well as planar and volumetric images, examining the influence attributable to classical and quantum aspects such as encoding schemes, entanglement, and circuit size. We find that in best-case scenarios, hybrid models show performance comparable to their classical counterparts, however, in most cases, performance metrics deteriorate under the influence of quantum components. Our multi-modal analysis provides realistic insights into the contributions of quantum components and advocates for cautious claims and design choices for hybrid models in near-term applications.

Abstract: While questions on quantum simulation of ground state physics are mostly focussed on the realization of effective interactions, most work on quantum simulation of thermal physics explores the realization of dynamics towards a thermal mixed state under native interactions. Many open questions that could be answered with quantum simulations, however, involve thermal states with respect to synthetic interactions. We present a framework based solely on unitary dynamics to design quantum simulations for thermal states with respect to Hamiltonians that include non-native interactions, suitable for both present-day digital and analogue devices. By classical means, our method finds the control sequence to reach a target thermal state for system sizes well out of reach of state-vector or density-matrix control methods, even though quantum hardware is required to explicitly simulate the thermal state dynamics. With the illustrative example of the cluster Ising model that includes non-native three-body interactions, we find that required experimental resources, such as the total evolution time, are independent of temperature and criticality.

Abstract: This work focuses on quantum reservoir computing and, in particular, on quantum Wiener architectures (qWiener), consisting of quantum linear dynamic networks with weak continuous measurements and classical nonlinear static readouts. We provide the first rigorous proof that qWiener systems retain the fading-memory property and universality of classical Wiener architectures, despite quantum constraints on linear dynamics and measurement back-action. Furthermore, we develop a kernel-theoretic interpretation showing that qWiener reservoirs naturally induce deep kernels, providing a principled framework for analysing their expressiveness. We further characterise the simplest qWiener instantiation, consisting of concatenated quantum harmonic oscillators, and show the difference with respect to the classical case. Finally, we empirically evaluate the architecture on standard reservoir computing benchmarks, demonstrating systematic performance gains over prior classical and quantum reservoir computing models.

TL;DR: PACOX is an FPGA-based accelerator for Pauli string computation in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that provides up to 100 times speedup over CPU methods while using less memory and power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential increase in computational complexity with the number of qubits in quantum algorithms is a significant bottleneck for classical computation. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a dedicated hardware solution.

Method: PACOX uses a compact binary encoding with XOR-based index permutation and phase accumulation, coupled with a parallel and pipelined PE cluster architecture optimized for FPGA.

Result: PACOX operates at 250 MHz with 0.33 W power consumption, using 8,052 LUTs, 10,934 FFs, and 324 BRAMs. It achieves 100x speedup for 19-qubit Pauli strings compared to CPU methods.

Conclusion: PACOX significantly enhances the energy efficiency and computational speed of Pauli-based workloads in hybrid quantum-classical systems.

Abstract: Pauli strings are a fundamental computational primitive in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. However, classical computation of Pauli strings suffers from exponential complexity and quickly becomes a performance bottleneck as the number of qubits increases. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the Pauli Composer Accelerator (PACOX), the first dedicated FPGA-based accelerator for Pauli string computation. PACOX employs a compact binary encoding with XOR-based index permutation and phase accumulation. Based on this formulation, we design a parallel and pipelined processing element (PE) cluster architecture that efficiently exploits data-level parallelism on FPGA. Experimental results on a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA show that PACOX operates at 250 MHz with a dynamic power consumption of 0.33 W, using 8,052 LUTs, 10,934 FFs, and 324 BRAMs. For Pauli strings of up to 19 qubits, PACOX achieves speedups of up to 100 times compared with state-of-the-art CPU-based methods, while requiring significantly less memory and achieving a much lower power-delay product. These results demonstrate that PACOX delivers high computational speed with superior energy efficiency for Pauli-based workloads in hybrid quantum-classical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract highlights the importance of reducing quantum computer noise, which is a significant challenge in NISQ computing. NT aims to improve EM by mitigating two-qubit gate noise beyond standard approaches.

Method: The method involves statistically sampling the qubit noise structure and then employing classical emulation to optimize EM protocols for that noise structure.

Result: Simulations show NT can up to 5 times improve EM accuracy compared to standard EM approaches for realistic Pauli noise.

Conclusion: NT provides a powerful tool for quantifying and characterizing non-Markovian noise, which is essential for advancing quantum hardware development.

Abstract: Error mitigation (EM) methods are crucial for obtaining reliable results in the realm of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, where noise significantly impacts output accuracy. Some EM protocols are particularly efficient for specific types of noise. Yet the noise in the actual hardware may not align with that. In this article, we introduce Noise Tailoring (NT) -- an innovative strategy designed to modify the structure of the noise associated with two-qubit gates through statistical sampling. We perform classical emulation of the protocol behavior and find that the NT+EM results can be up to 5 times more accurate than the results of EM alone for realistic Pauli noise acting on two-qubit gates. At the same time, on actual IBM quantum computers, the NT method falls victim to various small error sources beyond Markovian Pauli noise. We propose to use the NT method for characterizing such error sources on quantum computers in order to inform hardware development.

Abstract: Quantum networks connecting quantum processing nodes via photonic links enable distributed and modular quantum computation. In this framework, quantum gates between remote qubits can be realized using quantum teleportation protocols. The essential requirements for such non-local gates are remote entanglement, local quantum logic within each processor, and classical communication between nodes to perform operations based on measurement outcomes. Here, we demonstrate an unconditional Controlled-NOT quantum gate between remote diamond-based qubit devices. The control and target qubits are Carbon-13 nuclear spins, while NV electron spins enable local logic, readout, and remote entanglement generation. We benchmark the system by creating a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, showing genuine 4-partite entanglement shared between nodes. Using deterministic logic, single-shot readout, and real-time feed-forward, we implement non-local gates without post-selection. These results demonstrate a key capability for solid-state quantum networks, enabling exploration of distributed quantum computing and testing of complex network protocols on fully integrated systems.

Abstract: Despite the rapid development of quantum science and technology, errors are inevitable and play a crucial role in quantum simulation and quantum computation. In quantum chaotic systems, coherent errors arising from imperfect Hamiltonian control and incoherent errors induced by coupling to the environment are both exponentially amplified during time evolution due to information scrambling. A fundamental question is how these two classes of errors imprint distinct signatures on the emergent irreversibility of many-body dynamics. In this Letter, we address this question by investigating multi-round time-reversed dynamics in the presence of both coherent and incoherent errors. By applying scramblon theory, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Loschmidt echo over different rounds of time-reversed evolution. For incoherent errors, the error accumulates linearly with the number of rounds, whereas coherent errors exhibit a crossover from quadratic to linear accumulation. These predictions are explicitly verified using the solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for characterizing and calibrating coherent and incoherent errors in reversed dynamics, with particular relevance to nuclear magnetic resonance systems.

Abstract: We analyze the role of virtual temperatures for passive quantum states through the lens of majorization theory. A mean temperature over the virtual temperatures of adjacent energy levels is defined to compare the passive states of the system resulting from isoenergetic and isoentropic transformations. The role of the minimum and the maximum (min-max) values of the virtual temperatures in determining the direction of heat flow between the system and the environment is argued based on majorization relations. We characterize the intermediate passive states in a quantum Otto engine using these virtual temperatures and derive an upper bound for the Otto efficiency that can be expressed in terms of the min-max virtual temperatures of the working medium. An explicit example of the coupled-spins system is worked out. Moreover, virtual temperatures serve to draw interesting parallels between the quantum thermodynamic processes and their classical counterparts. Thus, virtual temperature emerges as a key operational quantity linking passivity and majorization to the optimal performance of quantum thermal machines.

Abstract: Reference-frame-independent measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (RFI-MDI-QKD) eliminates detector side-channel attacks and avoids reference-frame calibration. While its feasibility has been widely demonstrated, existing implementations typically assume fixed or slowly drifting reference-frame misalignment, conditions rarely satisfied outside the laboratory. In realistic environments, rapid and free-running reference-frame variations can severely degrade both the key rate and transmission distance of conventional RFI-MDI-QKD. Here we propose a free-running RFI-MDI-QKD protocol that maintains high-rate key generation under rapid reference-frame variations. By introducing a classification-distillation method that reclassifies total detection events, secure keys can be extracted without modifying the experimental setup. Our protocol achieves a key rate more than nine times higher than the best previous RFI-MDI-QKD scheme and tolerates channel losses exceeding 24 dB, where earlier approaches fail. These results enable practical quantum key distribution on mobile platforms, including satellite-to-ground links and airborne nodes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits relies on a transverse capacitive coupling that hybridizes the qubit with the readout resonator, subjecting the qubit to Purcell decay and measurement-induced state transitions (MIST). Despite the widespread use of Purcell filters to suppress qubit decay and near-quantum-limited amplifiers, dispersive readout often lags behind single- and two-qubit gates in both speed and fidelity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate junction readout, a simple readout architecture that realizes a strong qubit-resonator cross-Kerr interaction without relying on a transverse coupling. This interaction is achieved by coupling a transmon qubit to its readout resonator through both a capacitance and a Josephson junction. By varying the qubit frequency, we show that this hybrid coupling provides intrinsic Purcell protection and enhanced resilience to MIST, enabling readout at high photon numbers. While junction readout is compatible with conventional linear measurement, in this work we exploit the nonlinear coupling to intentionally engineer a large Kerr nonlinearity in the resonator, enabling bifurcation-based readout. Using this approach, we achieve a 99.4 % assignment fidelity with a 68 ns integration time and a 98.4 % QND fidelity without an external Purcell filter or a near-quantum-limited amplifier. These results establish the junction readout architecture with bifurcation-based readout as a scalable and practical alternative to dispersive readout, enabling fast, high-fidelity qubit measurement with reduced hardware overhead.

Abstract: Quantum coherence and entanglement are fundamental resources in quantum technologies, yet their efficient estimation for unknown states by employing minimal resources in experimental settings remains challenging, particularly in high-dimensional systems. We present a machine learning approach based on support vector regression (SVR) that directly estimates the coherence measures and the geometric measure of quantum entanglement using minimal experimental resources. Our method requires only the diagonal entries of the density matrix, along with the traces of the squared and cubed density matrices for quantum coherence, and additionally along with the traces of the squared and cubed reduced density matrix for estimating quantum entanglement. These quantities can be obtained through random measurements or a hybrid quantum-classical framework. This approach significantly reduces the resource overhead compared to quantum state tomography while maintaining high accuracy. {Furthermore, the support vector quantile regression (SVQR) with pinball loss is employed to prevent SVR overestimation. This model not only ensures that over 95\% of predictions are conservative lower bounds in most cases, but also maintains this lower-bound reliability for over 93\% of predictions, despite 2\% perturbations in the input features.} The proposed technique provides a practical and scalable tool for characterizing quantum resources across computation, communication, and metrology applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As quantum computers scale, optimizing cryogenic control electronics with DACs becomes crucial for performance. This work investigates the trade-offs between DAC resolution and QML effectiveness.

Method: Investigated QNN training and inference with DACs at varying resolutions (4,6,8,10,12 bits), using finite precision simulations and introducing probabilistic parameter updates to mitigate quantization effects.

Result: QNNs achieve near-perfect accuracy (≈100% classification) with 4-10 bit DACs, comparable to 12-bit precision. However, below 4 bits, accuracy drops significantly.

Conclusion: Low-resolution DACs are feasible and effective with appropriate noise injection methods, providing significant savings in power and area for quantum systems as they scale.

Abstract: Scaling quantum computers requires tight integration of cryogenic control electronics with quantum processors, where Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) face severe power and area constraints. We investigate quantum neural network (QNN) training and inference under finite DAC resolution constraints across various DAC resolutions. Pre-trained QNNs achieve accuracy nearly indistinguishable from infinite-precision baselines when deployed on quantum systems with 6-bit DAC control electronics, exhibiting an elbow curve with diminishing returns beyond 4 bits. However, training under quantization reveals gradient deadlock below 12-bit resolution as gradient magnitudes fall below quantization step sizes. We introduce temperature-controlled stochasticity that overcomes this through probabilistic parameter updates, enabling successful training at 4-10 bit resolutions that remarkably matches or exceeds infinite-precision baseline performance. Our findings demonstrate that low-resolution control electronics need not compromise QML performance, enabling significant power and area reduction in cryogenic control systems for practical deployment as quantum hardware scales.

*Yiting Mao,Peigeng Zhong,Haiqing Lin,Xiaoqun Wang,Shijie Hu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We propose a protocol for implementing complex-balanced thermalization using Markovian processes on a quantum-circuit platform with engineered reservoir qubits. The non-orthogonality of qubit eigenstates allows non-uniform heating via a modified Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation while supporting amplification-dissipation dynamics by violating microscopic time-reversibility. This approach enables the realization of out-of-equilibrium states at specific temperatures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to overcome the challenges in achieving out-of-equilibrium quantum states, which are difficult to realize using conventional thermal reservoirs. By developing a new approach that leverages the non-orthogonality of qubit eigenstates and violates microscopic time-reversibility, the researchers aim to enable a wide range of quantum phenomena that are currently beyond reach.

Method: The method involves coupling the quantum system with engineered reservoir qubits on a quantum-circuit platform. The researchers utilize a modified Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation to achieve non-uniform heating and violate microscopic time-reversibility to support amplification-dissipation dynamics. This protocol allows for the realization of out-of-equilibrium states at specific temperatures.

Result: The key results of this research demonstrate that the proposed protocol successfully enables two important applications: temporally-correlated dichromatic emission and Liouvillian exception point-protected quantum synchronization at finite temperatures. These outcomes highlight the potential of the proposed approach to advance our ability to manipulate and control quantum systems out of equilibrium.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this work presents a novel protocol for implementing complex-balanced thermalization in quantum systems using engineered reservoir qubits. The approach not only achieves out-of-equilibrium states but also paves the way for future studies on various quantum phenomena that require precise control over thermalization processes.

Abstract: We propose a protocol for effectively implementing complex-balanced thermalization via Markovian processes on a quantum-circuit platform that couples the system with engineered reservoir qubits. The non-orthogonality of qubit eigenstates facilitates non-uniform heating through a modified Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation, while simultaneously supports amplification-dissipation dynamics by violating microscopic time-reversibility. This offers a new approach to realizing out-of-equilibrium states at given temperatures. We show two applications of this platform: temporally-correlated dichromatic emission and Liouvillian exception point protected quantum synchronization at finite temperatures, both of which are challenging to achieve with conventional thermal reservoirs.

Abstract: Negatively charged boron vacancies (V$_{\text{B}}^{-}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) comprise a promising quantum sensing platform, optically addressable at room temperature and transferrable onto samples. However, broad hyperfine-split spin transitions of the ensemble pose challenges for quantum sensing with conventional resonant excitation due to limited spectral coverage. While isotopically enriched hBN using $^{10}$B and $^{15}$N isotopes (h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N) exhibits sharper spectral features, significant inhomogeneous broadening persists. We demonstrate that, implemented via frequency modulation on an FPGA, a frequency-ramped microwave pulse achieves around 4-fold greater $|0\rangle\rightarrow|-1\rangle$ spin-state population transfer and thus contrast than resonant microwave excitation and thus 16-fold shorter measurement time for spin relaxation based quantum sensing. Quantum dynamics simulations reveal that an effective two-state Landau-Zener model captures the complex relationship between population inversion and pulse length with relaxations incorporated. Our approach is robust and valuable for quantum relaxometry with spin defects in hBN in noisy environments.

Abstract: Quantum generative modeling is a very active area of research in looking for practical advantage in data analysis. Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) are leading candidates for quantum generative modeling and have been applied to diverse areas, from high-energy physics to image generation. The latent style-based QGAN, relying on a classical variational autoencoder to encode the input data into a latent space and then using a style-based QGAN for data generation has been proven to be efficient for image generation or drug design, hinting at the use of far less trainable parameters than their classical counterpart to achieve comparable performance, however this advantage has never been systematically studied. We present in this work the first comprehensive experimental analysis of this advantage of QGANS applied to SAT4 image generation, obtaining an exponential advantage in capacity scaling for a quantum generator in the hybrid latent style-based QGAN architecture. Careful tuning of the autoencoder is crucial to obtain stable, reliable results. Once this tuning is performed and defining training optimality as when the training is stable and the FID score is low and stable as well, the optimal capacity (or number of trainable parameters) of the classical discriminator scales exponentially with respect to the capacity of the quantum generator, and the same is true for the capacity of the classical generator. This hints toward a type of quantum advantage for quantum generative modeling.

Abstract: Quantum thermometry provides a key capability for nanoscale devices and quantum technologies, but most existing strategies rely on probes initialized near equilibrium. This equilibrium paradigm imposes intrinsic limitations: sensitivity is tied to long-time thermalization and often cannot be improved in fast, noisy, or nonstationary settings. In contrast, the \textit{Mpemba effect}, the counterintuitive phenomenon where hotter states relax faster than colder ones, has mostly been viewed as a thermodynamic anomaly. Here, we bridge this gap by proving that Mpemba-type inversions generically yield a finite-time enhancement of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for temperature estimation, thereby converting an anomalous relaxation effect into a concrete metrological resource. Through explicit analyses of two-level and $Λ$-level probes coupled to bosonic baths, we show that nonequilibrium initializations can transiently outperform both equilibrium strategies and colder states, realizing a \emph{metrological Mpemba effect}. Our results establish anomalous relaxation as a general design principle for nonequilibrium quantum thermometry, enabling ultrafast and nanoscale sensing protocols that exploit, rather than avoid, transient dynamics.

Abstract: Numerically solving partial differential equations is a ubiquitous computational task with broad applications in many fields of science. Quantum computers can potentially provide high-degree polynomial speed-ups for solving PDEs, however many algorithms simply end with preparing the quantum state encoding the solution in its amplitudes. Trying to access explicit properties of the solution naively with quantum amplitude estimation can subsequently diminish the potential speed-up. In this work, we present a technique for extracting a smooth positive function encoded in the amplitudes of a quantum state, which achieves the Heisenberg limit scaling. We improve upon previous methods by allowing higher dimensional functions, by significantly reducing the quantum complexity with respect to the number of qubits encoding the function, and by removing the dependency on the minimum of the function using preconditioning. Our technique works by sampling the cumulative distribution of the given function, fitting it with Chebyshev polynomials, and subsequently extracting a representation of the whole encoded function. Finally, we trial our method by carrying out small scale numerical simulations.

TL;DR: A scalable and distance-preserving encoding scheme for preparing Pauli eigenstates in surface codes is introduced, which outperforms existing methods under depolarizing noise and is particularly relevant for quantum platforms with costly measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fault-tolerant quantum computation requires efficient and reliable preparation of logical states, especially for fault correction. This work addresses a fundamental challenge in surface code encodings by proposing a novel scheme that preserves code distance during state preparation, making it suitable for platforms like trapped ions where measurements are costly.

Method: The scheme is built upon reinforcement learning strategies for the surface-17 code, generalized to arbitrary code distances and both rotated and unrotated surface codes. It relies on geometrically local gates and achieves circuit depth scaling as O(d). The method includes designing stabilizer-expanding circuits with and without ancilla-mediated connectivity and analyzing their error propagation under depolarizing noise.

Result: Numerical simulations reveal that the proposed encoding, without ancillas, significantly outperforms standard stabilizer-measurement-based schemes, reducing logical error rates by up to an order of magnitude. This makes the scheme particularly advantageous for quantum technologies where measurements are costly.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap between measurement-based and unitary encodings of surface-code states, offering a promising approach for scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computation in environments where measurement costs are a constraint.

Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computation, the preparation of logical states is a ubiquitous subroutine, yet significant challenges persist even for the simplest states required. In the present work, we present a unitary, scalable, distance-preserving encoding scheme for preparing Pauli eigenstates in surface codes. Unlike previous unitary approaches whose fault-distance remains constant with increasing code distance, our scheme ensures that the protection offered by the code is preserved during state preparation. Building on strategies discovered by reinforcement learning for the surface-17 code, we generalize the construction to arbitrary code distances and both rotated and unrotated surface codes. The proposed encoding relies only on geometrically local gates, and is therefore fully compatible with planar 2D qubit connectivity, and it achieves circuit depth scaling as $\mathcal{O}(d)$, consistent with fundamental entanglement-generation bounds. We design explicit stabilizer-expanding circuits with and without ancilla-mediated connectivity and analyze their error-propagation behavior. Numerical simulations under depolarizing noise show that our unitary encoding without ancillas outperforms standard stabilizer-measurement-based schemes, reducing logical error rates by up to an order of magnitude. These results make the scheme particularly relevant for platforms such as trapped ions and neutral atoms, where measurements are costly relative to gates and idling noise is considerably weaker than gate noise. Our work bridges the gap between measurement-based and unitary encodings of surface-code states and opens new directions for distance-preserving state preparation in fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract: One of the core research questions in the theory of quantum computing is to find out to what precise extent the classical simulation of a noisy quantum circuits is possible and where potential quantum advantages can set in. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for the classical simulation of quantum circuits based on frame theory, encompassing and generalizing a broad class of existing simulation strategies. Within this framework, the computational cost of a simulation algorithm is determined by the one-norm of an associated quasi-probability distribution, providing a common quantitative measure across different simulation approaches. This enables a comprehensive perspective on common methods for the simulation of noisy circuits based on different quantum resources, such as entanglement or non-stabilizerness. It further provides a clear scheme for generating novel classical simulation algorithms. Indeed, by exploring different choices of frames within this formalism and resorting to tools of convex optimization, we are able not only to obtain new insights and improved bounds for existing methods -- such as stabilizer state simulation or Pauli back-propagation -- but also to discover a new approach with an improved performance based on a generalization of the Pauli frame. We, thereby, show that classical simulation techniques can directly benefit from a perspective -- that of frames -- that goes beyond the traditional classification of quantum resources.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the limitations of standard spatial quantum Bell correlations in multipartite communication, showing that any correlations outside this set must involve at least one signaling assemblage, even if they're non-signaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the limitations of quantum correlations in multipartite scenarios is crucial for advancing quantum communication technologies and secure quantum networks.

Method: The authors use simultaneous purification of non-signalling assemblages and extend it to more complex communication schemes, comparing these with standard Bell scenarios.

Result: Establishes that arbitrary compositions of non-signalling assemblages cannot exceed standard spatial quantum Bell correlations, implying extended correlations must use signaling mechanisms.

Conclusion: The findings highlight fundamental constraints on quantum correlations in multipartite settings, emphasizing the need for signaling in certain scenarios to achieve non-Bell correlations, which has implications for quantum communication and cryptography.

Abstract: Bell non-locality is a powerful framework to distinguish classical, quantum and post-quantum resources, which relies on non-communicating players. Under which restriction can we have the same separations, if we allow for communication? Non-signalling state assemblages, and the fact that they can always be simultaneously purified, turned out to be the key element to restrict the simplest bipartite communication scenario, the prepare-and-measure, to the standard bipartite Bell scenario. Yet, many distinctive features of quantum theory are genuinely multipartite and cannot be reduced to two-party behaviour. In this work we are interested in extending this simultaneous purification inspired result to all multipartite communication schemes. As a first step, we unify and extend the simultaneous purification result from states to instruments and super-instruments, which are composable structures, and open up the possibility to explore more complex communication scenarios. Our main contribution is to establish that arbitrary compositions of non-signalling assemblages cannot escape the standard spatial quantum Bell correlations set. As a consequence, any interactive quantum realization of correlations outside of this set must involve at least one signalling assemblage of quantum operations, even when the resulting correlations are non-signalling.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are a central computational methodology in materials design for relating atomic composition to mechanical properties. However, simulating materials with atomic-level resolution on a macroscopic scale is infeasible on current classical hardware, even when using the simplest elastic network models (ENMs) that represent molecular vibrations as a network of coupled oscillators. To address this issue, we introduce Quantum Elastic Network Models (QENMs) and utilize the quantum algorithm of Babbush et al. (PRX, 2023), which offers an exponential advantage when simulating systems of coupled oscillators under some specific conditions and assumptions. Here, we demonstrate how our method enables the efficient simulation of planar materials. As an example, we apply our algorithm to the task of simulating a 2D graphene sheet. We analyze the exact complexity for initial-state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, and measurement of this material, and provide two real-world applications: heat transfer and the out-of-plane rippling effect. We estimate that an atomistic simulation of a graphene sheet on the centimeter scale, classically requiring hundreds of petabytes of memory and prohibitive runtimes, could be encoded and simulated with as few as $\sim 160$ logical qubits.

Conclusion: 该工作为量子算法在模拟特定类型的量子系统演化中提供了理论基础和实践指导。特别地，当哈密顿量二次时，Majorana传播算法能够无限精确地模拟演化过程。

Abstract: Simulating the time dynamics of an observable under Hamiltonian evolution is one of the most promising candidates for quantum advantage as we do not expect efficient classical algorithms for this problem except in restricted settings. Here, we introduce such a setting by showing that Majorana Propagation, a simple algorithm combining Trotter steps and truncations, efficiently finds a low-degree approximation of the time-evolved observable as soon as such an approximation exists. This provides the first provable guarantee about Majorana Propagation for Hamiltonian evolution. As an application of this result, we prove that Majorana Propagation can efficiently simulate the time dynamics of any sparse quartic Hamiltonian up to time $t_{\text{max}}(u)$ depending on the interaction strength $u$. For a time horizon $t \leq t_{\text{max}}(u)$, the runtime of the algorithm is $N^{O(\log(t/\varepsilon))}$ where $N$ is the number of Majorana modes and $\varepsilon$ is the error measured in the normalized Frobenius norm. Importantly, in the limit of small $u$, $t_{\text{max}}(u)$ goes to $+\infty$, formalizing the intuition that the algorithm is accurate at all times when the Hamiltonian is quadratic.

TL;DR: A scalable pulse-level control framework suppressed XY crosstalk errors through frequency modulation (FM) and dynamical decoupling (DD) for high-fidelity operation in dense superconducting architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing scale of superconducting quantum processors requires high-performance quantum control to maintain operational performance.

Method: The framework uses frequency modulation (FM) and dynamical decoupling (DD) to suppress XY crosstalk errors.

Result: Numerical simulations and scalability tests in two- and five-qubit systems show significant reductions in infidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a practical solution for high-fidelity operation in dense superconducting architectures.

Abstract: As superconducting quantum processors continue to scale, high-performance quantum control becomes increasingly critical. In densely integrated architectures, unwanted interactions between nearby qubits give rise to crosstalk errors that limit operational performance. In particular, direct exchange-type (XY) interactions are typically minimized by designing large frequency detunings between neighboring qubits at the hardware level. However, frequency crowding in large-scale systems ultimately restricts the achievable frequency separation. While such XY coupling facilitates entangling gate operations, its residual presence poses a key challenge during single-qubit controls. Here, we propose a scalable pulse-level control framework, incorporating frequency modulation (FM) and dynamical decoupling (DD), to suppress XY crosstalk errors. This framework operates independently of coupling strengths, reducing calibration overhead and naturally supporting multi-qubit connectivity. Numerical simulations show orders-of-magnitude reductions in infidelity for both idle and single-qubit gates in a two-qubit system. We further validate scalability in a five-qubit layout, where crosstalk between a central qubit and four neighbors is simultaneously suppressed. Our crosstalk suppression framework provides a practical route toward high-fidelity operation in dense superconducting architectures.

Motivation: The study is driven by the challenge of understanding the electronic structure of FeMo-co, a complex system that has stumped classical computing efforts but is within reach of quantum algorithms. It aims to bridge the gap between classical and quantum computational capabilities in this domain.

Method: The research employs a 76 orbital/152 qubit model, focusing on configurations and developing classical protocols to estimate the ground-state energy with chemical accuracy.

Result: The study successfully predicts the ground-state energy with an estimated uncertainty of ~1 kcal/mol, matching chemical accuracy.

Conclusion: Classically computing the electronic structure of FeMo-co is possible, contrary to previous beliefs, providing a pathway for future studies on similar complex systems.

Abstract: The main source of reduced nitrogen for living things comes from nitrogenase, which converts N2 to NH3 at the FeMo-cofactor (FeMo-co). Because of its role in supporting life, the uncertainty surrounding the catalytic cycle, and its compositional richness with eight transition metal ions, FeMo-co has fascinated scientists for decades. After much effort, the complete atomic structure was resolved. However, its electronic structure, central to reactivity, remains under intense debate.
  FeMo-co's complexity, arising from many unpaired electrons, has led to suggestions that it lies beyond the reach of classical computing. Consequently, there has been much interest in the potential of quantum algorithms to compute its electronic structure. Estimating the cost to compute the ground-state to chemical accuracy (~1 kcal/mol) within one or more FeMo-co models is a common benchmark of quantum algorithms in quantum chemistry, with numerous resource estimates in the literature.
  Here we address how to perform the same task using classical computation. We use a 76 orbital/152 qubit resting state model, the subject of most quantum resource estimates. Based on insight into the multiple configuration nature of the states, we devise classical protocols that yield rigorous or empirical upper bounds to the ground-state energy. Extrapolating these we predict the ground-state energy with an estimated uncertainty on the order of chemical accuracy. Having performed this long-discussed computational task, we next consider implications beyond the model. We distill a simpler computational procedure which we apply to reveal the electronic landscape in realistic representations of the cofactor. We thus illustrate a path to a precise computational understanding of FeMo-co electronic structure.

The DMRG/FQ approach is applied to representative solvated systems, using extensive molecular dynamics sampling. The method yields reliable excitation energies, solvatochromic shifts, and a close agreement with available experimental data. The results highlight the importance of mutual polarization for capturing specific solute-solvent interactions, particularly in systems where hydrogen bonding or directional interactions play a dominant role.

*G. V. Sotnikov,K. V. Galaydych,P. I. Markov*

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of layered plasma waveguides (LPW) for plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA) to improve bunch transport. Analytical and numerical simulations demonstrate successful acceleration and focusing of both drive and witness bunches through a two-layer plasma configuration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA) hold promise for next-generation accelerator technologies, particularly in maintaining critical parameters like emittance and energy spread while efficiently transporting electron bunches over long distances. This paper addresses unresolved issues in PWFA practicality by proposing innovative solutions using layered plasma waveguides.

Method: The study employs a combination of analytical modeling and numerical simulations. The dispersed dependencies of TM-modes in the layered plasma waveguide are derived, and a single TM-wave resonance with the electron bunch is identified. The analytical expressions for axial and radial wakefield amplitudes are validated through 2.5D particle-in-cell simulations.

Result: The layered plasma waveguide configuration enables simultaneous acceleration and focusing of both drive and witness electron bunches under specific density ratios. Numerical simulations confirm the analytical findings, demonstrating the potential of this approach for efficient bunch transport in PWFA systems.

Conclusion: This research presents a promising solution for enhancing bunch transport in plasma wakefield accelerators by utilizing layered plasma waveguides. The validated analytical models and simulations pave the way for further practical implementations and optimizations in high-energy physics and industrial applications.

Abstract: Plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA) represent one of the promising new accelerator concepts that are now being developed intensively for future applications in high-energy physics and industry. Among the unresolved problems of practical implementation of PWFA there are maintaining the required quality (emittance, size, energy spread of bunches) and stable transportation of drive and accelerated (witness) bunches over long acceleration distances. For improving the bunch transport, we propose to fill the bunch transport channel with the background plasma, the density of which is lower than the main plasma density building up an accelerating wake wave. We call this waveguide structure a layered plasma waveguide (LPW). The wakefield excitation by a regular sequence of electron bunches in the LPW of cylindrical configuration has been explored both analytically and numerically. The layered plasma has been modeled as a combination of a tubular plasma and a plasma column of significantly different densities. The plasma column has a lower density. The dispersion dependencies of the TM-modes of the LPW was obtained and analyzed, and it was found that there was a single TM wave resonant with the electron bunch. Based on the obtained analytical expressions, the structures of the axial and radial wakefield amplitudes have been numerically investigated for the cases of a single drive bunch and a regular train of bunches. It is shown that for certain density ratios of the outer and inner plasmas, it is possible both to accelerate and focus simultaneously the drive and witness bunches. The 2.5D particle-in-cell code was used to simulate the witness acceleration of an electron bunch by a wakefield created by drive electron bunches in a two-layer plasma wakefield accelerator. The simulation showed good agreement with the results of analytical calculations.

Abstract: Few-body physics plays a central role in many branches of physics, such as nuclear physics and atomic physics. Advances in controlling ultra-cold quantum gases provide an ideal testbed for few-body physics theory. In this work, we study few-body systems consisting of two distinct species of non-relativistic fermions in one spatial dimension using both field theory and lattice methods. Particles of the same type do not interact with each other, but particles of different types can interact via an attractive contact interaction. We first study the dependence of the coupling of a contact interaction on the lattice spacing. Using this input, we extract two-, three-, and four-body ground state energies in the infinite length limit and benchmark them against the calculations from the continuum field theory. This work enables us to systematically study the effect of discretization and finite-length artifacts on few-body observables.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to advance quantum simulation of high-energy physics by developing a 3D quantum simulator for lattice QED.

Method: The authors propose a method using cold atoms in 3D to simulate a U(1) quantum link model of QED with linear gauge protection.

Result: Tree tensor network simulations of the simulator show excellent agreement with the ideal gauge theory, especially after error mitigation.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for realistic quantum simulators of 3+1D lattice gauge theories that go beyond classical simulability.

Abstract: The stated overarching goal of the highly active field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP) is to achieve the capability to study \textit{ab-initio} real-time microscopic dynamics of $3+1$D quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, existing experimental realizations and theoretical proposals for future ones have remained restricted to one or two spatial dimensions. Here, we take a big step towards this goal by proposing a concrete experimentally feasible scalable cold-atom quantum simulator of a U$(1)$ quantum link model of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in three spatial dimensions, employing \textit{linear gauge protection} to stabilize gauge invariance. Using tree tensor network simulations, we benchmark the performance of this quantum simulator through near- and far-from-equilibrium observables, showing excellent agreement with the ideal gauge theory. Additionally, we introduce a method for \textit{analog quantum error mitigation} that accounts for unwanted first-order tunneling processes, vastly improving agreement between quantum-simulator and ideal-gauge-theory results. Our findings pave the way towards realistic quantum simulators of $3+1$D lattice gauge theories that can probe regimes well beyond classical simulability.

### [94] [Scattering of a weakly bound dimer from a hard wall in one dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04662)
*Xican Zhang,Shina Tan*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: The paper examines a dimer formed by two particles with an attractive contact interaction in one dimension, colliding with a hard wall. It calculates scattering phase shifts and reflection coefficients for various collision energies and mass ratios. For low-energy collisions, the results align with previous studies. For mass ratios much greater than 1, the scattering length and effective range of the dimer-wall collision depend logarithmically on the mass ratio. For high-energy collisions, the dissociation probability is inversely proportional to the square of the incident momentum, with the constant of proportionality and angular distribution derived analytically and semiclassically, respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of scattering processes in quantum mechanics, particularly in one-dimensional systems with dimer formation and wall interactions, is motivated by the desire to understand the behavior of particles under specific interaction potentials and boundary conditions. This research contributes to the broader field of theoretical and mathematical physics by providing insights into scattering phase shifts, reflection coefficients, and the factors influencing dimer dissociation.

Method: The paper employs a combination of analytical and approximate methods. The scattering phase shifts and reflection coefficients are calculated using mathematical derivations. For low-energy collisions, the results are verified against previous studies. For high-energy collisions, the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is used to analyze the scattering length and effective range. The semiclassical analysis is applied to derive the angular distribution of the dissociated pair.

Result: The key findings of the paper include:
1. For low-energy collisions, the scattering phase shifts and reflection coefficients are consistent with previous studies by D. Lee and M. Pine.
2. For mass ratios much greater than 1, the scattering length and effective range of the dimer-wall collision depend logarithmically on the mass ratio.
3. For collision energies much greater than the binding energy, the dissociation probability is inversely proportional to the square of the incident momentum of the dimer, with the constant of proportionality derived analytically. The angular distribution of the dissociated pair is approximated using a semiclassical analysis.

Conclusion: This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the scattering properties of a dimer formed by two particles with an attractive contact interaction colliding with a hard wall in one dimension. The results highlight the dependence of scattering length, effective range, and dissociation probability on collision energy and mass ratio. The analytical and semiclassical methods used in this study offer valuable tools for understanding similar scattering processes in quantum systems.

Abstract: We consider a dimer formed by two particles with an attractive contact interaction in one dimension, colliding with a hard wall. We compute the scattering phase shifts and the reflection coefficients for various collision energies and various mass ratios of the two particles. For low-energy collisions (with dimer kinetic energies much smaller than the binding energy) our results are consistent with those of D. Lee and M. Pine, The European Physical Journal A 47, 41 (2011). For mass ratios much greater than 1 we use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to show that the scattering length and the effective range of the dimer-wall collision both depend logarithmically on the mass ratio. For collision energies much greater than the binding energy, the dissociation probability is inversely proportional to the square of the incident momentum of the dimer and we find the constant of proportionality analytically, and we use a semiclassical analysis to approximately derive the ``angular distribution" of the dissociated pair, where the ``angle" $θ$ depends on the ratio of the velocities of the two outgoing unbound particles.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate a non-Hermitian optical dimer whose parameters are renormalized by dispersive and dissipative backaction from the coupling of the passive cavity with a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. The passive cavity is driven by a two-tone control laser, where each tone is in a coherent superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momenta $\pm \ell \hbar$. This imprints an optical lattice on the ring trap, leading to Bragg-diffracted sidemode excitations. Using an exact Schur-complement reduction of the full light-matter dynamics, we derive a frequency-dependent self-energy and identify a static regime in which the atomic response produces a complex shift of the passive optical mode. This renormalized dimer supports a tunable exceptional point, enabling spectroscopic signatures in the optical transmission due to a probe field, which can in turn be utilized for estimating the winding number of the persistent current. Exploiting the associated half-integer topological charge, we propose a digital exceptional-point-based sensing scheme based on eigenmode permutation, providing a noise-resilient method to sense superfluid rotation without relying on fragile eigenvalue splittings. Importantly, the sensing proposals are intrinsically non-destructive, preserving the coherence of the atomic superfluid.

Abstract: Periodic potentials with flat bands in their spectra support strongly localized nonlinear excitations. Although a perfectly flat band cannot exist in a continuous system, a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate loaded in a Zeeman lattice can realize the quasi-flat lowest band with an extremely narrow bandwidth. In such a quasi flat band, half vortex solitons become confined within a single lattice cell, enabling the formation of arrays of coupled half vortex solitons arranged of various spatial geometries. In this work, we study the existence and stability of these lattices within the framework of the two-component Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We demonstrate that, near the quasi-flat band, half-vortex solitons and their arrays can be excited with a nearly negligible number of atoms and are constrained by their local symmetries, which are isomorphic to a dihedral group of order 8. This allows observation of the respective field patterns in the nearly linear regime where they exhibit enhanced stability. The constructed lattices may have diverse geometric profiles, and in particular create a composite super-half-vortex soliton with nonlinear symmetry breaking.

Abstract: A dissipative time crystal is an emergent phase in driven-dissipative quantum many-body systems, characterized by sustained oscillations that break time-translation symmetry spontaneously. Here, we explore nonequilibrium phase transitions in a dissipative Rydberg system driven by a microwave (MW) field and demonstrate their critical sensitivity to high-precision MW sensing. Distinct dynamical regimes are identified, including monostable, bistable, and oscillatory phases under mean-field coupling. Unlike single-particle detection--where the beating signal decays linearly with MW field strength--the time crystalline phase exhibits high sensitivity to MW perturbations, with rapid, discontinuous frequency switching near the monostable-oscillatory boundary. The abrupt transition is rooted in spontaneous symmetry breaking in time and is fundamentally insensitive to the background noise. On this basis, a minimum detectable MW field strength on the order of 1nV/cm is achieved by leveraging this sensitivity. Our results establish a framework for controlling time crystalline phases with external fields and advance MW sensing through many-body effects.

Abstract: We explore the ground state properties and excitation spectra of one-dimensional three-component bosonic mixtures accommodating a droplet in two of the species and a third minority component. Relying on the suitable Lee-Huang-Yang framework, we reveal a plethora of distinct self-bound droplet phases and their phase transitions through variations of either the particle number of the majority components or the intercomponent coupling. The ensuing phases demonstrate that the minority component is being un-trapped, partially trapped, or fully trapped by the majority droplet species. These states are characterized by their binding energies captured by the chemical potentials and their low-amplitude excitation spectrum, including mode crossings at the particle-emission threshold. We further derive effective reduced models which are valid in the high-imbalance limit, and accurately reproduce the numerically computed ground states, while providing analytical insights into the role of quantum fluctuations. Our results map out the stability and structure of mixed droplet phases offering guidance into forthcoming experimental and theoretical studies of multicomponent quantum droplets.

Abstract: Force distance curves (FCs) are among the most direct measurements performed in atomic force microscopy (AFM), yet their information content is often reduced by filtering and quasi-static interpretation. Here, enabled by a new interferometric detector, we show that fast FCs inherently excite short-lived cantilever oscillations whose transient frequency and decay encode local stiffness and dissipation. By analyzing these dynamics on a single-curve, single-pixel basis, we extract time-local mechanical information without external broadband excitation or multi-pass imaging. We develop a state-dependent single-mode harmonic oscillator model that captures snap-in excitation, hydration-mediated dissipation, and contact stiffness during fast force mapping. Experimental analysis of high-bandwidth force-curve data and numerical simulations demonstrate that multiple dynamically distinct interaction regimes occur within a single FC. Accessing these transient dynamics enables high-throughput, high-resolution mapping of mechanical contrast and reveals heterogeneous and non-repeatable behaviors that are lost under conventional averaging or with conventional detection schemes with higher noise floors.

We first elucidate the geometric origin of equilibrium magnetization in the modern theory of magnetization, then discuss the role of quantum geometry in kinetic magnetization, and finally outline promising future directions at the frontier of quantum geometric magnetization.

Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to understand the relationship between spin transport and electric fields in complex antiferromagnetic heterostructures, which could lead to new applications in spintronics.

Method: The study uses magnon transport experiments combined with theoretical modeling to analyze how BiFeO3 functions both as a magnon channel and a knob for controlling the magnonic state through an electric field.

Result: The research reveals that the confined BiFeO3 layers exhibit anisotropic spin transport properties influenced by antiferromagnetic order and electric fields. This includes the ability to manipulate spin currents by electric fields and the stabilization of symmetry-protected spin-split bands, characteristic of alternated-ferromagnetic materials.

Conclusion: This work establishes a framework for understanding and controlling spin transport in complex magnetic heterostructures, which could enable new forms of electric-field-controlled magnetism, opening up potential applications in advanced spintronic devices and memory technologies.

Abstract: Magnons provide a route to ultra-fast transport and non-destructive readout of spin-based information transfer. Here, we report magnon transport and its emergent anisotropic nature in BiFeO$_3$ layers confined between ultrathin layers of the antiferromagnet LaFeO$_3$. Due to the confined state, BiFeO$_3$ serves as an efficient magnon transmission channel as well as a magnetoelectric knob by which to control the stack by means of an electric field. We discuss the mechanism of the anisotropic spin transport based on the interaction between the antiferromagnetic order and the electric field. This allows us to manipulate and amplify the spin transport in such a confined geometry. Furthermore, lower crystal symmetric and suppression of the spin cycloid in ultrathin BiFeO$_3$ stabilizes a non-trivial antiferromagnetic state exhibiting symmetry-protected spin-split bands that provide the non-trivial sign inversion of the spin current, which is a characteristic of an altermagnet. This work provides an understanding of the anisotropic spin transport in complex antiferromagnetic heterostructures where ferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist, paving the way for a new route to realize electric-field control of a novel state of magnetism.

TL;DR: The study explores the proximity-induced superconductivity at TI-SC interfaces using pencil thick samples. The embedded TI layer, separated by a thick insulator, allows the creation of topological superconductivity with Majorana edge modes. The optical conductance reveals a characteristic coherence peak at the proximity-induced gap, critical for understanding Majorana states and potential terahertz/infrared spectroscopy applications for non-invasive detection.

Motivation: Understanding topological superconductivity and Majorana edge modes at TI-SC interfaces is crucial for advancing quantum computing and materials science. This study offers a theoretical framework for detecting and probing these exotic states.

Method: A theoretical approach was used, which includes the Bogoliubov-de Gennes slab model and the Kubo formalism. A minimal TI-SC model was developed to analyze the complex interface sheet conductance as a direct probe of the superconducting gap.

Result: The study demonstrates that the longitudinal optical response of a TI-SC heterostructure exhibits a two-dimensional topological superconducting phase supporting Majorana edge modes. The optical conductance computation reveals a robust coherence peak at the proximity-induced gap, distinguishable from gapless states. The low-frequency spectral weight obeys a quantum-metric sum rule, quantitatively linking the optical response to the quantum geometry of the proximitized interface.

Conclusion: This work provides a clear signature for identifying Majorana-hosting TI-SC interfaces through non-invasive optical means, opening new avenues for experimental exploration and potential application in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Proximity-induced superconductivity at topological insulator-superconductor (TI-SC) interfaces offers a promising route to topological superconductivity with Majorana boundary modes. However, probing the interfacial superconductivity at buried interfaces is challenging with conventional surface methods. Here, we present a theoretical study of the longitudinal optical response of a TI-SC heterostructure, focusing on the complex interface sheet conductance as a direct and layer-selective probe of the interfacial superconducting gap. Within a minimal TI--SC model, we demonstrate that proximity-induced superconductivity at the buried interface generates a two-dimensional topological superconducting phase supporting Majorana edge modes. Using a Bogoliubov-de Gennes slab model and the Kubo formalism, we compute the optical conductance and introduce a thickness-extrapolation protocol that isolates the interface contribution only. The resulting interface conductance exhibits a robust, thickness-independent coherence peak at an energy set by the proximity-induced gap, distinguishable from both the parent superconductor's pair-breaking feature and the ungapped Dirac cone on the top surface. We further demonstrate that the low-frequency spectral weight of this interface resonance obeys a quantum-metric sum rule, quantitatively linking the optical response to the quantum geometry of the proximitized interfacial state. Our results propose terahertz/infrared spectroscopy of the interfacial sheet conductance as a non-invasive diagnostic of Majorana-hosting TI--SC interfaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding spin selectivity in electron transport is crucial for advancing quantum-technological applications, such as miniaturized electronics. This paper aims to provide unambiguous experimental evidence for the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect.

Method: The authors used a scanning tunnelling microscope functionalised with a manganese atom cluster and observed Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonances in a system of single heptahelicene molecules adsorbed on a crystalline lead surface.

Result: The experiments revealed that the differential conductance signal depends on the handedness of the molecule, providing evidence for chirality-induced spin selectivity in electron transport.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that single enantiomers can act as effective spin polarizers in biased electron transport, and electrostatic effects are not responsible for the observed spin selectivity.

Abstract: Chiral matter acting as a spin-selective device in biased electron transport is attracting attention for the quantum-technological design of miniaturized electronics. To date, however, experimental reports on spin selectivity are not conclusive. The magnetoresistance in electron transport measurements observed for chiral materials on ferromagnets upon magnetisation reversal is proposed to result from electrostatic rather than from the sought-after chiral effects. Recent break junction studies even question the spin-dependent electron flow across single chiral molecules. Here, we avoid ferromagnetic electrodes and magnetisation reversal to provide unambiguous experimental evidence for the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect of single enantiomers. Functionalising the superconducting tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope with a manganese atom cluster gives rise to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonances that serve as spin-sensitive probes of the tunnelling current in junctions of single heptahelicene molecules adsorbed on a crystalline lead surface. Our key finding is the dependence of the signal strength of these states in spectroscopy of the differential conductance on the handedness of the molecule. The experiments unveil the role of the enantiomers as spin polarisers and the irrelevance of electrostatics in the chosen model system.

Abstract: In gyrotropic crystals, an oscillating magnetic field induces a charge response known as the gyrotropic magnetic current. While its conventional origin is attributed to magnetic field modified band energy and shift in the Fermi-surface, a recent study identified an additional spin-driven magnetic displacement contribution. Here, we complete the picture by identifying the orbital counterpart of the magnetic displacement current. Using a density-matrix formulation that incorporates both minimal coupling and spin-Zeeman interactions, we derive the electronic equations of motion in the presence of an oscillating magnetic field and uncover a previously unexplored orbital contribution to the wavepacket velocity. Physically, this contribution arises from the time variation of the magnetic-field induced charge polarization. In the low frequency transport regime, this mechanism becomes purely intrinsic. We illustrate this intrinsic gyrotropic current of orbital origin in the ${\cal P}{\cal T}$-symmetric antiferromagnet CuMnAs. We show that the intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current reverses sign upon Néel vector reversal, establishing it as a direct probe of antiferromagnetic order in CuMnAs and other $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets.

Abstract: We study how fermions in molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ interact with a laser field and a static potential barrier, focusing on the transmission probability. Our aim is to understand and control photon-assisted quantum transport in this two-dimensional material under external driving. We use the Floquet approximation to describe the wave functions in the three regions of the system. By applying continuity conditions at the boundaries, we obtain a set of equations involving an infinite number of Floquet modes. We explicitly determine transmissions involving the central band $E$ and the first sidebands $E \pm \hbarω$. As for higher-order bands, we use the transfer matrix approach together with current density to compute the associated transmissions. Our results reveal that the transmission probability oscillates for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. The oscillations of spin-down electrons occur over nearly twice the period of spin-up electrons. Among all bands, the central one consistently shows the highest transmission. We also find that stronger laser fields and wider barriers both lead to reduced transmission. Moreover, laser irradiation enables controllable channeling and filtering of transmission bands by tuning the laser intensity and system parameters. This highlights the potential of laser-driven MoS$_2$ structures for highly sensitive electromagnetic sensors and advanced optoelectronic devices.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We theoretically investigate quantum spin transfer from spin-correlated conduction-electron pairs to localized spins in a ferromagnet, given that electrons are correlated intrinsically. We show that even spin-singlet pairs and triplet pairs with $m=0$, both carrying no net spin, can transfer finite angular momentum through the quantum fluctuation term inherent to the $sd$ exchange interaction. The amount of transferred spin differs between the singlet and triplet $m=0$ states due to quantum interference. The difference is such that the independent-electron approximation remains valid for spin transfer when injected spin currents are completely incoherent. However, in partially coherent systems, like superconductor/ferromagnet junctions, coherent spin-singlet currents can directly convert into equal-spin triplet currents in generic ferromagnets, without requiring magnetic inhomogeniety or spin-orbit coupling.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a fundamental spectral dichotomy absent in Hermitian physics: the eigenvalue spectrum and the eigenstate spectrum can deviate significantly in the thermodynamic limit. We explain how non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can support eigenstates completely undetected by eigenvalues, with the unidirectional Hatano-Nelson model serving as both a minimal realization and universal paradigm for this phenomenon. Through exact analytical solutions, we show that this model contains not only hidden modes but multiple macroscopic hidden exceptional points that appear more generally in all systems with a non-trivial bulk winding. Our framework explains how the apparent bulk-edge correspondence failures in models like the non-Hermitian SSH chain instead reflect the systematic inability of the eigenvalue spectrum to detect certain eigenstates in systems with a skin-effect. These results establish the limitation of the eigenvalue spectrum and suggest how the eigenstate approach can lead to improved characterization of non-Hermitian topology.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a minimal relativistic completion of MOND in which (i) General Relativity is recovered exactly in the high-acceleration regime, while (ii) the Bekenstein--Milgrom (AQUAL) equation emerges in the low-acceleration regime, without introducing additional propagating fields beyond those already present in a right-handed gauge sector. The construction is motivated by an $E_6\times E_6$ framework in which $SU(3)_R\rightarrow SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{Y'}\rightarrow U(1)_{\rm dem}$, leaving a healthy repulsive $U(1)_{\rm dem}$ interaction whose charge is the square-root mass label. Gravity itself arises from the $SU(2)_R$ connection via a Plebanski/MacDowell--Mansouri mechanism, yielding an emergent tetrad and the Einstein--Hilbert action. MOND is implemented by an infrared (IR) metric deformation $ΔS_{\rm IR}[g]$ that is UV-vanishing (so GR is recovered) while its deep-MOND/static limit is fixed by a symmetry principle: in three spatial dimensions, the deep-MOND action is conformally invariant with a 10-parameter group isomorphic to $SO(4,1)$ (the de Sitter group). The single MOND acceleration scale is set by a de Sitter radius selected dynamically in the IR, $a_0=c^2/(ξ\,\ell_{\rm dS})$ with $ξ={ O}(1)$ fixed by matching to the static limit. MOND resides in perturbations and quasistatic systems; the homogeneous FRW background is controlled by the IR vacuum kinematics rather than an ad hoc cosmological constant.

Conclusion: 双黑洞合并的自旋参数分布可能受到戴维斯相变点附近极限吸引子状态的指导。

Abstract: Gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers yield values for both the black hole remnant mass $M$ and it's spin $a$, with the $169$ $a$ values collected so far crowding significantly around their average $\bar{a}=0.6869\pm 0.087$. Could this crowding relate directly to the Davies phase transition point at $a=0.68125$ from black hole thermodynamics? I argue that a necessary challenge for such a connection requires a consistent application of the thermodynamic fluctuation theory that follows from black hole thermodynamics (BHT). Specifically, necessary are a correct choice of fluctuating variables, as well as thermal equilibrium between the event horizon at the Hawking temperature $\sim μK$ and the outside universe $\sim 3 K$. I show that the former requirement follows in straightforward fashion from the BHT of the Kerr model, while the later requires an accretion disk following the Novikov-Thorne accretion disk model. I construct a thermodynamic fluctuation theory meeting both these requirements. My results open the possibility that black hole mergers are based on some dynamical model (not known to me) with a limiting attractor state at the Davies point.

Result: 通过张量张外层下FHDE方程组存在解，表现出rip奇点的发生，尤其是在非线性q项下

Conclusion: 在张量张外层下，FHDE实现了 rip 奇点的动态行为，特别是在非线性q假设下

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the occurrence of late-time cosmological singularities, namely, the rip scenarios within the framework of interacting Fractional Holographic Dark Energy (FHDE). We start our investigation with the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff, i.e., $L=(γH^{2}+δ\dot{H})^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, and highlight the range of allowed $α$ (Lévy's index) values for which big, little and pseudo rip can occur. In particular, we highlight the occurrence of a big rip for fractional values of the Lévy's index in the allowed range $1<α\leq2$. Moreover, we conclude that the occurrence of a pseudo-rip requires Lévy's index to be $α>2$. Therefore, we reject the possibility of pseudo-rip within the GO cutoff. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the occurrence of the little rip in FHDE equipped with a GO cutoff is rather contrived and requires a specific functional form of the IR cutoff $L\sim(γH^{2}+g(H))^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, which belongs to a larger class of Nojiri-Odintsov (NO) cutoffs. To extend our perspective beyond the GO cutoff, we investigate the interacting FHDE framework equipped with the Hubble cutoff, i.e., $L=H^{-1}$, in developing an ansatz-based approach to the little and pseudo-rip singularities as they fail to appear in the GO cutoff. Within this approach, we invoke the expression of the Hubble parameter, $H(t)$, which corresponds to the little and pseudo-rip, into the cosmological parameters such as the Equation of State (EoS) and Squared Sound Speed (SSS) as a function of cosmic time $t$. We produce numerical plots of these parameters in both linear and non-linear $Q$ regimes, which supplement our theoretical findings. In summary, our results highlight the occurrence of little and pseudo-rip singularities within a Hubble cutoff for a non-linear $Q$ term within the FHDE framework.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The analysis of phase transitions in cosmological spacetimes shows that their existence requires a time-dependent apparent horizon radius, which in turn implies an equation of state different from that of a dark energy fluid. This condition is not compatible with the simultaneous fulfillment of Hayward's unified gravitational first law and the fundamental thermodynamic equation of the apparent horizon. To solve this problem, we introduce an alternative formulation in which the cosmological horizon is modeled as a quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic system. We apply this approach to the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe under quantum gravity corrections encoded by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), promote the deformation parameter to a thermodynamic variable, and obtain a consistent thermodynamic description without relying on the usual pressure-volume interpretation. Using Geometrothermodynamics (GTD), we show that fluctuations of the GUP parameter can induce phase transitions closely resembling those of black hole configurations. Finally, we perform a numerical analysis of the behavior of the GTD scalar curvature near the phase transition point, where we find a scaling behavior characterized by the critical exponent close to 1, independently of the dimension of the equilibrium space. This reveals that quantum gravity corrections not only modify the thermodynamic consistency of cosmological models but also strengthen the notion of thermodynamic universality across gravitational systems. Our findings confirm GTD as a powerful geometric tool to unveil the emergent thermodynamic microstructure of spacetime.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates inflationary dynamics within fractal cosmology, extending traditional cosmology by introducing non-integer dimensions. Such studies are essential for understanding the early universe's evolution and potentially reconciling inflationary theories with observations.

Method: The authors employ a modified Friedmann equation and continuity equation in a fractal dimension framework. They formulate a fractal extension of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation by introducing an effective momentum term $k_{	ext{eff}}$, which accounts for the geometric impact of fractal cosmology on scalar perturbations.

Result: The analysis leads to corrections in the scalar spectral index $n_s$，which depends explicitly on the fractal dimension $D$ and a fractional scale $L$. The comparison with Planck 2018 data narrows the allowed range of $D$ to between $2.7$ and $3$，based on the inflationary and cosmological model assumptions.

Conclusion: The study contributes to refining inflationary models within fractal cosmology by providing a detailed analysis of scalar perturbation corrections to the spectral index, offering a more accurate framework for understanding early universe inflation dynamics.

Abstract: We study inflationary dynamics within the framework of fractal cosmology, where spacetime exhibits a non-integer effective dimension, sourced through a relaxation of the cosmological principle. Using Friedmann and continuity equations, modified by an effective fractal dimension $D$; we derive generalized slow-roll parameters and examine their evolution for cubic, Starobinsky and Natural inflationary potentials. We then formulate a fractal extension of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation by introducing an effective momentum term $k_{\text{eff}}$, arising from the fractal decomposition of the spatial Laplacian, that captures the geometric influence of fractal cosmology on scalar perturbations. This leads to corrections in the power spectrum and a scalar spectral index $n_s$ that depends explicitly on both the fractal dimension $D$ and a fractional scale $L$, which controls the strength of the fractal deformation. Comparison with the Planck 2018 data ($n_s=0.9649\pm 0.0042$) constrains the allowed range of $D$ ($2.7\lesssim D\lesssim3$) depending on the cosmological and inflationary model assumed.

Conclusion: ided the basic framework for analyzing resonance deformation under perturbation, highlighting nonlinear spectral stability issues when generalizing to strong perturbations.

Abstract: The aim of this work is to improve understanding of the resonant spectra of black holes under perturbations arising from e.g. compact objects or accretion disks in their vicinity. It is known that adding a weak perturbation to the radial potential can strongly disrupt the spectrum of quasinormal modes and Regge poles of a black hole spacetime. Here we examine the effect of (weak or strong) localised delta-function perturbations on the resonant spectra of spherically-symmetric systems, to address fundamental questions around linear and non-linear spectral stability. We examine two cases: the Nariai spacetime with a Poschl-Teller potential and the Schwarzschild spacetime. We show that, in either case, the spectrum deforms in a smooth and continuous manner as the position and strength of the perturbation is varied. As the strength of the perturbation is increased, resonances migrate along trajectories in the complex plane which ultimately tend towards attracting points determined by a hard-wall scenario. However, for weak perturbations the trajectory near the unperturbed resonance is typically strongly influenced by a set of repelling points which, for perturbations far from the system, lie very close to the unperturbed resonances; hence there arises a non-linear instability (i.e. the failure of a linearised approximation). Taking a dynamical systems perspective, the sets of attracting and repelling spectral points follow their own trajectories as the position of the perturbation is varied, and these are tracked and understood.

Abstract: This work investigates the optical properties of a static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black hole in f(R) gravity coupled to Euler-Heisenberg(EH) nonlinear electrodynamics(NLED). By analyzing photon trajectories in this background spacetime, we show how the model parameters affect light propagation, leading to wider ranges of lensed trajectories and photon rings. We identify regions of parameter space that admit physically consistent black hole shadows, characterized by the existence of a photon sphere located outside the event horizon and a shadow formed beyond it. These viable regions expand with increasing electric charge and increasing fR0, illustrating the interplay between gravitational and electromagnetic effects. By constraining the model using Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87*, we find that de Sitter black hole solutions remain compatible with the observational data, whereas anti-de Sitter solutions are disfavored for low electric charge and fR0 > -1. Finally, an analysis of the energy emission rate shows that higher electric charge enhances black hole evaporation, while stronger nonlinear electrodynamics effects and larger values of fR0 suppress it.

Motivation: The paper aims to investigate the quantum properties of boson stars within the framework of semiclassical gravity, providing a deeper understanding of how quantum effects influence the structure and stability of these objects.

Method: The authors employ numerical methods to compute the quantum scalar fields and stress tensor in boson star spacetimes. They use spectral methods and Pauli-Villars regularization to handle the divergences. Coherent states are utilized to make a direct comparison between the classical and quantum components of the stress tensor.

Result: The results demonstrate that quantum effects are significant in environments with strong spacetime curvature. The renormalized quantum energy density is mostly positive, but the radial pressure is negative, which suggests that the classical solutions must be modified when quantum corrections are included. In regions of large curvature, quantum fluctuations can account for a substantial portion of the stress tensor.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that quantum effects play a crucial role in the behavior of boson stars in highly curved spacetimes. The methods developed in this paper offer a framework for studying quantum corrections in other compact objects as well.

Abstract: Boson stars have been extensively studied in classical gravity, but their quantum properties remain comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we compute the quantum scalar fields and stress tensor in boson star spacetimes within the framework of semiclassical gravity. Divergences are regularized using Pauli-Villars fields, and accurate numerical results are obtained through spectral methods. Employing coherent states enables a direct comparison between the classical part of the stress tensor and the quantum fluctuation. Our results indicate that strong spacetime curvature is the primary source of large quantum effects. The renormalized quantum energy density is mostly positive but the radial pressure is negative, suggesting that classical boson star solutions require modification once quantum effects are included. Moreover, in regimes of large curvature, the quantum fluctuations can constitute a significant fraction of the total stress tensor. The methods developed here can be generalized to other compact objects and used to study their response to quantum corrections.

Conclusion: 通过构建边沿量子场论模型，本研究成功模拟了宇宙粒子产生机制，特别是在宇宙时空的发散或收缩背景下，为研究宇宙微波背景辐射光谱的形成提供了理论框架和研究方法。研究发现的Transplanckian阻尼效应和尺度不变性在不同宇宙时空中的表现，不仅丰富了宇宙物理的研究，也为未来的宇宙粒子实验研究提供了重要的参考。

Abstract: The quantum-field-theoretic description for the U(1)-Goldstone boson of a scalar Bose-Einstein condensate with time-dependent contact interactions is developed beyond the acoustic approximation in accordance with Bogoliubov theory. The resulting effective action is mapped to a relativistic quantum field theory on a dispersive (or rainbow) cosmological spacetime which has a superluminal Corley-Jacobson dispersion relation. Time-dependent changes of the s-wave scattering length to quantum-simulate cosmological particle production are accompanied by a time-dependent healing length that can be interpreted as an analog Planck length in the comoving frame. Non-adiabatic transitions acquire a dispersive character, which is thoroughly discussed. The framework is applied to exponentially expanding or power-law contracting $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetimes which are known to produce scale-invariant cosmological power spectra. The sensitivity of these scenarios to the time-dependence of the Bogoliubov dispersion is investigated: We find a violation of scale-invariance via analytically trackable Transplanckian damping effects if the cut-off scale is not well separated from the horizon-crossing scale. In case of the exponential expansion, these damping effects remarkably settle and converge to another scale-invariant plateau in the far ultraviolet regime where non-adiabatic transitions are suppressed by the high dispersion. The developed framework enables quantitative access to more drastic analog cosmological scenarios with improved predictability in the ultraviolet regime that ultimately may lead to the observation of a scale-invariant cosmological power spectrum in the laboratory.

*Samuel D. Tootle,Terrence Pierre Jacques,Marie Cassing*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces new initial data codes in the FUKA suite for modeling stationary, axisymmetric equilibrium of differentially rotating neutron stars in general relativity. The codes use quasi-isotropic coordinates in spherical and Cartesian coordinates (XCTS) to solve Einstein's equations with equations of state from GRHayLEOS. They validate the codes with convergence tests, compare with existing models like RNS, and assess the impact of initial data resolution on simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutron star modeling is crucial for understanding gravitational waves, testing general relativity, and studying neutron star physics. The development of accurate codes for differential rotation is essential for realistic simulations of neutron star evolution and mergers.

Method: The codes solve Einstein's equations using the KADATH spectral library. Two numerical approaches are explored: quasi-isotropic coordinates in spherical and Cartesian coordinates (XCTS). Convergence tests are performed to verify the spectral accuracy, and solutions are compared with existing models like RNS. Numerical simulations assess the impact of initial data resolution on dynamical evolution.

Result: The FUKA codes demonstrate high accuracy and efficiency. Convergence tests confirm exponential accuracy of the spectral method. Solutions are validated against literature models, and the codes are shown to handle initial data resolution effects with quantified convergence orders. The framework is extensible to include magnetic fields, non-isentropic equations of state, and binary systems.

Conclusion: The FUKA suite provides a robust foundation for advanced modeling of differentially rotating neutron stars, enabling future studies in gravitational wave astronomy and neutron star physics.

Abstract: We present new initial data codes for constructing stationary, axisymmetric equilibrium models of differentially rotating neutron stars in full general relativity within the Frankfurt University/KADATH (FUKA) suite of initial data codes. FUKA leverages the KADATH spectral library to solve the Einstein equations under the assumption of an isentropic fluid without magnetic fields while incorporating GRHayLEOS to support 3D tabulated equations of state in \textit{stellar collapse} format. The two solvers explored in this work include one using quasi-isotropic coordinates (QIC) in Spherical coordinates while the other solves the eXtended Conformal Thin Sandwich (XCTS) decomposition in Cartesian coordinates, enabling the construction of equilibrium configurations with high accuracy and efficiency. In this work we adopt the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu differential rotation law, however, the code is designed to be extensible to other rotation laws, allowing for exploration of physically relevant sequences and critical rotation thresholds. Furthermore, we perform convergence tests demonstrating the exponential accuracy of the spectral approach, we validate QIC and XCTS solutions against models well-studied in the literature, and we also compare FUKA solutions against the well-known RNS code. Finally, we explore the impact that initial data resolution has on dynamical simulations and recover the convergence order of the evolution scheme, the dominate source of error in this study. The new FUKA codes and results presented here lay the foundation for future extensions to more general configurations, including magnetic fields, removal of isentropic assumptions, and binary systems, and have been made publicly available to support community efforts in modeling differentially rotating relativistic stars.

Abstract: In this manuscript we generalize Ref. [1] and derive a complete set of local consistency conditions for bulk fields in braneworld scenarios with an arbitrary number of dimensions. This provides the first fully local and dimension-independent generalization of all known criteria for bulk fields. Within this framework, we show that a free scalar field is consistent and localized, whereas minimally and non-minimally coupled Maxwell fields violate the conditions, leading to a no-go theorem valid in any dimension. For nonlinear electrodynamics, we find that only the model $L(F)=b\sqrt{F}$ admits a consistent and normalizable zero mode, and that among p-forms, consistency occurs solely for the free 0-form. We also demonstrate that Dirac fermions, with or without Yukawa terms, are inconsistent within this framework and therefore cannot propagate in the bulk. Our local approach makes explicit that these conclusions do not depend on any particular internal geometry or warp factor: previously known results arise merely as special cases of a broader and strictly local structure, highlighting the universality of the constraints derived here.

Abstract: Inflation is a necessary cosmic mechanism to cure basic inconsistencies of the standard model of cosmology. These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $ρ_{\rm vac}=ρ_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $Λ$). In the FLRW epoch, $ρ_{\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $Λ\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $δρ_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(m_{\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help to cure the cosmological tensions.

Abstract: Synergies between self-force theory and other approaches to the gravitational two-body problem have traditionally relied on calculations of gauge-invariant observables as functions of orbital frequencies. However, in self-force theory one can also define a complete set of constants of motion: energy, azimuthal angular momentum, and radial and polar actions. Here we outline how directly utilizing these constants allows for more straightforward comparisons and hybridizations across the parameter space, as well as more streamlined waveform generation through flux-balance laws. Restricting to the case of nonspinning binaries and first order in self-force, we compute the constants of motion and the corrections to fundamental frequencies numerically as well as analytically (to 9PN in a post-Newtonian expansion), establishing consistency with the highest-order (4PN) results available from post-Newtonian theory. We also apply the results to identify the perturbed locations of special curves in the parameter space: circular orbits and the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits.

Abstract: Dynamic positioning in acoustic levitation typically depends on active control of the transducers phases, which necessitates complex driving electronics. While mechanically actuated reflectors offer a simpler alternative, achieving reversible transport along the vertical axis solely through mechanical actuation remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate vertical particle translation using a rotating spiral reflector with a half-wavelength pitch. With the rotation axis laterally offset relative to the acoustic focus, the spiral surface functions as a series of translating slopes. Experimental and numerical results confirm stable, bidirectional transport, yielding a vertical displacement of approximately $0.58λ$ per revolution and a maximum height of $3.18λ$, with radial confinement maintained within $0.24λ$. This approach provides a cost-effective solution for non-contact sample handling without active phase control.

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化二极管工作状态，显著提升了 rectifier 的效率和动态范围。

Abstract: This letter presents a novel adaptive power division strategy, which uses two rectifying diodes with nonlinear impedance characteristics that are configured in parallel to function optimally at their individual power levels. Through the strategic adjustment of the input admittance, the conductance of the low-power diode decreases progressively with increasing power, while the conductance of the high-power diode increases correspondingly. This conductance-based power allocation method ensures that the power is rectified consistently by the most appropriate diode, regardless of the power level, and, thus, enables efficient rectification across an extended range. This letter presents a rectifier typology to substantiate the proposed strategy. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the adaptive power division strategy, with the rectifier showing efficiency in excess of 60% from 5 to 29.5 dBm, giving a power dynamic range of 24.5 dB.

Abstract: Controlled and precise fabrication of structures with heights in the range of single digit nanometres is one of the challenges for diffraction gratings operating near-normal incidence in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray range. Here, we expand on previous research utilizing swelling of silicon after irradiation with ions as alternative to conventional dry etching. By irradiating silicon through a mask with a broad beam of nitrogen ions, we realized lamellar gratings in a precise and well controlled process. We were able to fabricate gratings with structure heights between (1.00 +/- 0.05) nm to (10.0 +/- 0.5) nm and a pitch of 1 micrometre, which is suitable for both EUV and soft X-ray applications. A variation of ion energy from 20 keV to 40 keV further expands the foundations of this process and yielded an additional parameter to control the resulting structure height and shape.

Abstract: FeF$_2$ is a prototypical rutile antiferromagnet recently proposed as an altermagnet, with a magnetic symmetry that permits spin-split electronic bands and chiral magnons. Using very-high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering on a single crystal of FeF$_2$, we show that the dominant source of magnon splitting is in fact the long-range dipolar interaction rather than altermagnetic exchange terms. At momenta where the dipolar splitting vanishes, we observe additional broadening due to altermagnetic chiral splitting and estimate this splitting to be $\sim$35 $μ$eV. Polarized measurements further reveal that, where dipolar splitting is present, the chiral magnon modes become mixed and the resulting modes are predominantly linearly polarized, with at most a small chiral component. These findings highlight the significant effect of dipolar interactions on magnon chirality, particularly when altermagnetic interactions are weak.

Abstract: We analyse the magnon spectrum and distribution function of the antiferromagnetic phase of the Floquet-driven Hubbard model. Above a critical drive strength, we find a dynamical instability, resulting from a change in sign of the magnon damping at a non-zero wavevector. The change in sign means that infinitesimal fluctuations grow with time, corresponding to an instability of the driven state. Implications for the nonequilibrium distribution function and the strong drive nonlinear dynamics are discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding spinons as fundamental excitations in quantum magnets is crucial for advancing quantum physics and topological matter studies. Achieving individual control over spinons opens new avenues for exploring quantum phenomena experimentally.

Method: Artificial gauge fields are employed to engineer specific excited states in quantum spin models, allowing localized spinons to emerge and be controlled through time-dependent fields. This method combines theoretical and experimental techniques to manipulate spinon behavior.

Result: The study successfully demonstrates the generation and manipulation of individual spinons in controlled environments. This includes observing their dynamic evolution and braiding, providing direct visualization in bulk systems and laying the groundwork for studying spinon confinement through experiments with gauge fields.

Conclusion: The proposed approach represents a significant step forward in the experimental study of spinons and their properties, potentially unlocking new insights into frustrated quantum systems and topological quantum states.

Abstract: Spinons are elementary excitations at the core of frustrated quantum magnets. Although it is well-established that a pair of spinons can emerge from a magnon via deconfinement, controlled manipulation of individual spinons and direct observation of their deconfinement remain elusive. We propose an artificial gauge field scenario that enables the engineering of specific excited states in quantum spin models. This generates spatially localized individual spinons with high controllability. By applying time-dependent gauge fields, we realize adiabatic braiding of these spinons, as well as their dynamical evolution in a controllable manner. These results not only provide the first direct visualization of individual spinons localized in the bulk, but also point to new possibilities to simulate their confinement process. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our scenario in Rydberg atoms, which suggests an experimentally viable direction--gauge field engineering of correlated phenomena in excited states.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A novel impurity renormalization group method that combines tensor networks with the numerical renormalization group cutoff scheme is introduced to study impurity thermodynamics in quantum systems with bath correlations. The approach successfully addresses conventional limitations by treating bath correlations and impurity interactions on an equal footing. Applied to the finite-temperature quantum critical regime of quantum spin systems, the method reveals phenomena such as fractionalization of the impurity magnetic moment, cusps in the impurity susceptibility, and exotic spin correlation behavior driven by interplay between bath correlations and impurity effects. The study demonstrates the efficiency of the method in solving correlated systems with defects, paving the way for new insights in impurity physics beyond non-interacting thermal baths.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of quantum impurities in many-body systems, especially in the presence of complex bath correlations, is crucial for advancing our knowledge of exotic phases of matter and their potential applications in quantum technologies.

Method: The method involves merging the tensor-network representation with the numerical renormalization group cutoff scheme, enabling a unified treatment of bath correlations and impurity interactions. The approach overcomes the limitations of conventional methods by providing a non-perturbative framework for analyzing impurity thermodynamics in strongly correlated systems.

Result: The application of the method to coupled Heisenberg ladders reveals phenomenon such as fractionalization of the impurity magnetic moment, cusps in the impurity susceptibility marking transitions into quantum critical regimes, and exotic spin correlation behavior. The results highlight the method's potential for studying complex impurity physics in systems with defects.

Conclusion: This innovative method represents a significant advancement in the study of quantum impurities, offering a powerful tool for exploring exotic many-body phenomena in systems with non-trivial bath correlations and impurity interactions.

Abstract: Quantum impurities can host exotic many-body states that serve as sensitive probes of bath correlations. However, quantitative and non-perturbative methods for determining impurity thermodynamics in such settings remain scarce. Here, we introduce an impurity renormalization group approach that merges the tensor-network representation with the numerical renormalization group cutoff scheme. This method overcomes conventional limitations by treating bath correlations and impurity interactions on an equal footing. Applying our approach to the finite-temperature quantum critical regime of quantum spin systems, we uncover striking impurity-induced phenomena. In a coupled Heisenberg ladder, the impurity triggers a fractionalization of the local magnetic moment. Moreover, the derivative of the impurity susceptibility develops cusps that mark the crossover into the quantum critical regime. We also observe an exotic evolution of the spin correlation function driven by the interplay between bath correlations and the impurity. Our results demonstrate that this method can efficiently solve correlated systems with defects, opening new pathways to discovering novel impurity physics beyond those in non-interacting thermal baths.

Abstract: Antiferromagnets have attracted significant attention because of their considerable potential in engineering high-density and ultrafast memory devices, a crucial and increasingly demanded component of contemporary high-performance information technology. Theoretical and experimental investigations are actively progressing to provide the capability of efficient switching and precise control of the Néel vector, which is crucial for the intended practical applications of antiferromagnets. Recently, a time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory has been successfully developed to study the sublattice magnetization switching in anisotropic quantum antiferromagnets [K. Bolsmann $et \, al.$, \textcolor{blue}{\hyperlink{10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.030332}{PRX Quantum $\mathbf{4}$, 030332 (2023)}}]. Here we use a complementary exact diagonalization method to study such sublattice magnetization switching, but in small-cluster quantum antiferromagnets, by means of an external magnetic field. Furthermore, this article aims to support the findings of the Schwinger boson approach. We show that the results of both approaches are consistent at short time scales, with only about 12.5 $\%$ deviations. The consistency of the outcomes obtained through this alternative exact approach demonstrates that the time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory is a versatile framework to capture the essentials of the switching process in quantum antiferromagnets. Thereby, the findings of current article pave the way for further theoretical and computational progress in the study of antiferromagnets for engineering spintronic devices with ultrahigh density and ultrafast speed.

Abstract: Full $d$-manifold DMFT with numerically exact solvers has remained computationally prohibitive for spin-orbit materials due their scaling and severe sign problem, forcing the community to rely on simplified one- and three-band models that omit the $e_g$ states despite their proximity with the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. We present the first full five-orbital Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) calculations including spin-orbit coupling for the layered iridates and rhodates \bio~and \bro, revealing that the correlation effects shift significantly the $e_g$ states through static mean-field corrections rather than dynamical fluctuations. Motivated by this insight, we introduce hybrid-DMFT (hDMFT), which treats these orbitals and their coupling to the low-energy manifold at the mean-field level while maintaining near quantitative accuracy at a drastically reduced computational cost. These calculation establish hDMFT as a practical and accurate method for full $d$-manifold studies of layered iridates and rhodates, enabling systematic investigations of temperature, doping and pressure dependence that were previously computationally intractable.

Abstract: Sawtooth chain magnets have been a subject of historical interest in the field of frustrated magnetism, with classical olivine family $M_2TX_4$, ($M$ - 3d, $T$ - 4p, $X$ - chalcogen elements) typically realizing simple $\mathbf{k} = (000)$ states. The magnetism of the Mn$_2$GeO$_4$ olivine is surprisingly complex, proceeding from commensurate states to a multiferroic commensurate + incommensurate phase. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering results from a Mn$_2$GeO$_4$ single crystal and develop an effective Hamiltonian including long-distance bilinear and dipolar interactions. The magnetic interactions are predominantly antiferromagnetic and span a three-dimensional exchange network consisting of coupled sawtooth chains. Based on the determined strength of the couplings, the dominant sawtooth chains appear at third- and fourth- rather than next-nearest-neighbor. However the next-nearest-neighbor interaction is, along with a modest Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, important for modeling the observed incommensurability. We use the best-fit Hamiltonian as the basis for Langevin dynamics simulations and Luttinger-Tisza calculations of the high-temperature commensurate transition.

Here, we report inelastic neutron scattering investigations of the van der Waals antiferromagnet VBr3, which forms a honeycomb lattice structure at room temperature and exhibits zigzag-type magnetic order below 26.5 K. Our observations reveal distinctive low-energy spin excitations arising from gamma, gamma', and M' points, each featuring a spin gap of around 2.5 meV. The overall spin excitation spectra can be effectively described by a spin Hamiltonian incorporating substantial nearest-neighbor Kitaev and biquadratic interactions, along with Heisenberg interactions. Our findings not only establish VBr3 as a new Kitaev magnet but also suggest that ligand engineering may provide a promising strategy to modulate Kitaev interactions, offering new opportunities for designing Kitaev materials with tailored quantum properties.

Abstract: We investigated the magnetoelastic properties of an YbNi$_4$P$_2$ single crystal at low temperatures under magnetic fields directed along the crystallographic [001] axis. We report a series of strong anomalies in the sound velocity, which is consistent with the cascade of electronic-topological transitions reported previously for this compound. In particular, we identify the vanishing of a small orbit on the Fermi surface, associated with a quantum-oscillation frequency of 34 T. Furthermore, the different transitions are better resolved with acoustic modes of particular symmetry. Using a microscopic model adapted to the strongly correlated electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$, we describe our results by inspecting realistic electron-phonon couplings in reciprocal space for each acoustic mode. This shows how the $k$ selectivity of ultrasound experiments allows to investigate Fermi-surface reconstructions in strongly correlated electronic systems.

Abstract: The Klein paradox describes an incoming electron being scattered at a supercritical barrier to create electron-positron pairs, a phenomenon widely discussed in textbooks. While demonstrating this phenomenon experimentally with the fundamental particles remains challenging, condensed matter analogs are more accessible to experimental realization. For spinless quasi-particles, theoretical works show an enhancement of the pair production rate, and analogs of this effect in condensed matter systems have been studied theoretically. Here, we present another condensed matter system, a heterostructure comprised of two materials with strongly and weakly interacting electrons, that allows for constructing analytical solutions using the hierarchy-of-correlations method. The results show enhanced electron reflection related with the production of doublon-holon pairs, as known from the Klein paradox.

Abstract: The surface states of a symmetry protected topological state can have many possibilities.

The first-principle calculation and the slave-rotor mean-field theory are applied to study the surface states of the relevant material system. The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopic measurement is further suggested to detect the anomalous surface fractionalization of the chiral Abelian topological order on the surface. The connection with real materials is further discussed. We expect our results to inspire the interest in the emergent exotic and correlation physics among the cluster Mott insulating systems and in the interplay between the two different branches of topological phases.

Abstract: Chiral graviton modes are hallmark collective excitations of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) liquids. However, their existence on the lattice, where continuum symmetries that protect them from decay are lost, is still an open and urgent question, especially considering the recent advances in the realization of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCI) in transition metal dichalcogenides and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study of graviton-modes in fermionic FCI, and thoroughly demonstrate their existence. We first derive a lattice stress tensor operator in the context of the fermionic Harper-Hofstadter(HH) model which captures the graviton in the flat band limit. Importantly, we discover that such lattice stress-tensor operators are deeply connected to lattice quadrupolar density correlators, readily generalizable to generic Chern bands. We then explicitly show the adiabatic connection between FQH and FCI chiral graviton modes by interpolating from a low flux HH model to a Checkerboard lattice model that hosts a topological flat band. In particular, using state-of-the-art matrix product state and exact diagonalization simulations, we provide strong evidence that chiral graviton modes are long-lived excitations in FCIs despite the lack of continuous symmetries and the scattering with a two-magnetoroton continuum. By means of a careful finite-size analysis, we show that the lattice generates a finite but small intrinsic decay rate for the graviton mode. We discuss the relevance of our results for the exploration of graviton modes in FCI phases realized in solid state settings, as well as cold atom experiments.

Anisotropic g-factors (g_parallel=2.26, g_perpendicular=2.27) and effective magnetic moment of 3.2 μB are observed. Disorder simulations reveal the Ni²+ electronic environment is robust. Invites further study on disorder effects in rare-earth pyrochlores.

Motivation: Understanding how A-site disorder affects localized magnetic moments in spin-1 systems on pyrochlore lattices is crucial for coordinating magnetism in geometrically frustrated materials, influencing both static and dynamic properties.

Method: Papers employ resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to analyze the electronic structure of NaCaNi₂F₇. They measure Ni²+ local environments using L-edge RIXS and model disorder effects by simulating X-ray scattering spectra with randomized crystal field parameters.

Result: 1) The Ni²+ ions maintain nearly ideal octahedral geometry despite A-site disorder, showing resilience of this coordination environment. 2) The effective magnetic moment is quantified with g factors varying slightly, indicating paramagnetic behavior. 3) Simulations suggest A-site disorder has minimal impact on Ni²+ electronic structure within the measurement resolution.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that Na+/Ca²+ A-site disorder does not significantly alter the Ni²+ electronic environment in NaCaNi₂F₇, providing insights into the robustness of localized moments in spin-1 systems under structural disorder.

Abstract: NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$ is a unique example of spin-1 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice, but the presence of Na$^{1+}$/Ca$^{2+}$ $A$-site disorder complicates the local electronic and magnetic environment of the Ni$^{2+}$ $B$-site. We utilize resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to study the influence of $A$-site disorder on the $B$-site electronic structure of NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$. Ni L-edge RIXS measurements reveal a Ni$^{2+}$ electronic structure in nearly ideal octahedral coordination, with only a small trigonal compression ($δ$ = -200$\;$meV) required to capture all spectral features. Within the $D_{3d}$ symmetry of the Ni local environment, we extract an anisotropic $g$-factor of $g_{\parallel} = 2.26$ and $g_{\perp} = 2.27$, and a corresponding paramagnetic moment of $μ_{\rm{eff}}=3.2\;μ_B$. To simulate disorder, RIXS spectra were calculated with realistic distributions of crystal field parameters; however, these spectra are invariant relative to a disorder-free model, demonstrating the robustness of the Ni$^{2+}$ electronic environment to the $A$-site disorder, within the resolution of our measurement.
