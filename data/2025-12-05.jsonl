At the Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC), high-performance calorimetry is essential for exploring the internal structure of nucleons and studying the dynamics of quarks and gluons within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper presents the optimized design and performance simulation of the EicC ECAL system. The ECAL consists of three specialized sections tailored to distinct detection environments: (1) an electron-Endcap employing high-resolution pure Cesium Iodide (pCsI) crystals, (2) a central barrel, and (3) an ion-Endcap, both adopting a cost-effective Shashlik-style sampling calorimeter with improved light yield. Each segment's geometry and material composition have been systematically optimized through Geant4 simulations to achieve excellent energy and position resolutions as well as strong electron-pion discrimination. The simulated performance indicates that the ECAL can achieve energy resolutions of 2 percent divided by sqrt(E) for pCsI crystals and 5 percent divided by sqrt(E) for Shashlik modules, meeting the design goals of the EicC detector."}

A lower-resistivity (200kΩ) configuration exhibited enhanced charge spread, leading to minor systematic offsets in reconstructed pad centers, yet maintained robust timing and spatial performance. Capacitive charge-sharing architectures improved spatial resolution in some regions but suffered from signal attenuation and nonuniform charge distributions, resulting in slightly degraded timing (33.300 {\\pm} 0.002 ps) and complex localization patterns. Mechanical precision, particularly readout planarity and photocathode alignment, was identified as critical for uniform detector response.

The front compartment consists of a homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter made of high-density crystals, each coupled to a pair of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) providing the simultaneous readout of scintillation and Cherenkov light. To efficiently detect Cherenkov photons in the presence of dominant scintillation signals, an optical filter is placed in front of one of the two SiPMs to suppress photons in the wavelength region corresponding to that of scintillation emission. % In this study, PWO, BGO, and BSO crystals with different dimensions were tested to measure their scintillation light yield and decay time, as well as their transmission and emission spectra.

Collectivity is responsible for intriguing ground state properties, for example, in superconductors. However, collective effects may also govern the non-equilibrium response of quantum systems, not only in condensed matter physics but also in quantum field theories modeling the properties of our universe. Understanding emergent collective dynamics from first principles, in particular in non-perturbative regimes, is therefore one of the central challenges in quantum many-body physics. Here we report on the observation of collective cluster nucleation in 2D quantum Ising systems realized in an atomic Rydberg array. We observe a confined regime in which the steady-state cluster size is energy-dependent and a deconfined regime characterized by kinetically constrained dynamics of cluster nucleation. Our results mark a qualitative leap for quantum simulations with Rydberg arrays and shed light on highly collective non-equilibrium processes in one of the most important textbook models of condensed matter physics with relevance from quantum magnets and the kinetics of glass formers to cosmology."}

For tackling electron flux and metabolic pathway regulation, a hybrid material (nano-capattery (NC)) was developed based on cobalt-iron-nitrogen doped biochar (Co-Fe-NBC). The NC possessed both the capacitor property (287.91 F/g) and battery-like charge storage 38.3 mC/g with the highest energy density of 159.95 mWh/g. These properties existed due to its Fe2+/Fe3+ and Co2+/Co3+ redox cycle ability, a highly porous surface (291.81 m2/g BET surface area) caused by the defects (AD/AG 3.13) and abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) observed through electro paramagnetic resonance. During PFHP, there is an 85% reduction in propionic acid, a 65.3% record electron management efficiency, an improved 1.34 NAD+/NADH ratio, along with a 87% increase in dehydrogenase activity, confirming the superior role of NC in efficient regulation of the metabolic pathway and electron flux management.

Using this result, the element-number dependence of the frequency variation tolerance for 1D and 2D arrays is calculated. In 1D arrays, the frequency variation tolerance decreases inversely proportional to the square root of the element number. In 2D arrays, as the number of columns is increased while keeping the number of elements per column constant, the frequency variation tolerance increases for small number of columns, reaches a maximum at square configuration, and then decreases with increasing number of columns.

Here, we employ a Michelson Interferometer in conjunction with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) for determining the spectral profile of a narrow-band light source. Interestingly, we observe that the fringes across the interferometer output beam are inherently shifted in wavelength even when a constant phase profile is provided to the SLM. We calibrate the spectral shifts as a function of fringe spatial location by measuring the incident light spectrum at various points across the fringe pattern, and observe that the spectral peak traces out a `teardrop' shape, whose width is dependent on the spectral bandwidth of the source, the relative tilt and path difference between the two arms of the interferometer, and the divergence of the beam. Next, we demonstrate that this inherent spectral variation of the fringes can be used to perform fast single-snapshot spectroscopy of narrow-band light sources, while a time-varied phase profile provided to the SLM leads to multi-step spectroscopy with lower noise, higher resolution, and better contrast. Our findings establish that the Michelson Interferometer can be used to perform spectroscopy of any source within a certain spectral range from simple images of the fringe pattern, so as to facilitate exciting applications towards hyperspectral imaging."}

Among various approaches, parametric frequency mixing processes such as four-wave mixing (FWM) offer a promising pathway toward efficient and low-noise transduction. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of coherent quantum state transfer by indirectly verifying high-fidelity wavefunction's phase mapping (>99%) from the input field to the generated output field wave. Using a gas-filled hollow-core capillary fiber, we systematically investigate spectral phase evolution across a broad range, including infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) transitions, as well as conversions from telecom-band (1550 nm) to visible (516 nm) and deep-UV (308 nm) wavelengths. Our results reveal that strong phase coherence can be maintained throughout these diverse conversion regimes. Because quantum properties such as coherence and entanglement are intrinsically encoded in both the amplitude and phase of a photonic wavefunction, preserving spectral phase is essential for faithful quantum information transfer. We further show that efficient and phase-preserving transduction can be achieved by tuning system parameters, offering valuable insights into nonlinear coupling dynamics. These findings establish a promising foundation for advancing FWM-based quantum transduction schemes and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous quantum systems across wide spectral domains within future quantum communication networks."}

In this work, we propose symmetry-preserving deformations of these models, in the presence of a transverse field, and identify special points along the deformations with interesting features: (i) the special point is frustration-free, (ii) its ground states include a product state and the code space of the underlying code, and (iii) it remains gapped in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit. So the special point realises a first-order transition between (or the coexistence of) the trivial gapped phase and the nontrivial gapped phase associated with the code. In addition, if the original model has a non-invertible duality symmetry, then so does the deformed model. In this case, the duality symmetry is spontaneously broken at the special point, consistent with the associated anomaly.\n  A key step in proving the gap is a coarse-graining/blocking procedure on the Tanner graph of the code that allows us to apply the martingale method successfully. Our model, therefore, provides the first application of the martingale method to a frustration-free model, that is not commuting projector, defined on an arbitrary Tanner graph.\n  We also discuss several familiar examples on Euclidean spatial lattice. Of particular interest is the 2+1d transverse field Ising model: while there is no non-invertible duality symmetry in this case, our results, together with known numerical results, suggest the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram."}

Single Differential Cross Sections (SDCS) were calculated for incident energies of 100, 150, 200, and 250 eV. The data obtained indicated a peak in the ionization rates approximately at 200 eV, with the ionization rate decreasing as the incident energy increased further. The diffuse radial nature of the 3s wave function is shown to increase the sensitivity of the ionization dynamics to the incident particle energy. Asymmetries in charge were also detected; specifically, at low energy of the ejected electron, the SDCS values for positrons were greater than the corresponding values for electrons; however, as the energy of the incident particles was increased, these differences disappeared, thereby demonstrating the applicability of the FBA at high energy limits. The residual differences at low energy were due to the omission of exchange and post-collision interactions from the model. The results of this work can be used as benchmarking for the development of more complex distorted wave and multi-scattering theories in excited state ionization processes."}

This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model.

Unfortunately, each switch is costly-adding time and space overhead and increasing the logical error rate. Minimizing the number of switching operations is, therefore, essential for quantum computations using code switching. In this work, we study the problem of minimizing the number of code switches required to run a given quantum circuit. We show that this problem can be solved efficiently in polynomial time by reducing it to a minimum-cut instance on a graph derived from the circuit. Our formulation is flexible and can incorporate additional considerations, such as reducing depth overhead by preferring switches during idle periods or biasing the compilation to favor one code over another. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automated approach for compiling and optimizing code-switching-based quantum computations at the logical level."}

However, the detection of biomolecules at low concentrations is limited by the total photon dose that can be applied before photodamage alters the sample, and photon shot noise sets the minimum achievable noise floor for most microscopes.

In this study, we present a chemical imaging system that integrates THz-TDS with deep learning to enable accurate pixel-level identification and classification of different explosives. Operating in reflection mode and enhanced with plasmonic nanoantenna arrays, our THz-TDS system achieves a peak dynamic range of 96 dB and a detection bandwidth of 4.5 THz, supporting practical, stand-off operation. By analyzing individual time-domain pulses with deep neural networks, the system exhibits strong resilience to environmental variations and sample inconsistencies. Blind testing across eight chemicals, including pharmaceutical excipients and explosive compounds, resulted in an average classification accuracy of 99.42% at the pixel level. Notably, the system maintained an average accuracy of 88.83% when detecting explosives concealed under opaque paper coverings, demonstrating its robust generalization capability. These results highlight the potential of combining advanced terahertz spectroscopy with neural networks for highly sensitive and specific chemical and explosive detection in diverse and operationally relevant scenarios."}

In quantum field theory, the normal-ordered operator $\\hat Q$ represents the difference between the number operators of right- and left-handed photons. Previous studies have shown that its expectation value is not conserved for observers propagating in a gravitational field. Here, we show that this Noether symmetry can also be realized in empty waveguides with duality-preserving boundary conditions, and we quantize the source-free Maxwell theory inside a long, cylindrical waveguide undergoing both linear and rotational acceleration from rest. In the vacuum $|0\\rangle$ associated to inertial observers, we find that the expectation value $\\langle 0| \\hat Q |0\\rangle $ fails to be conserved for observers co-moving with the waveguide. In particular, frame-dragging effects induce a spectral asymmetry between the right- and left-handed field modes at late times. As a consequence, accelerated detectors co-moving with the rotating waveguide can detect photon-pair excitations from the quantum vacuum, exhibiting an imbalance between opposite helicity modes. This is a relativistic quantum effect, which shows that the classical conservation law associated with duality symmetry is broken in the quantum theory even in flat spacetime, provided we work with non-inertial systems. Our analysis provides a concrete proof of concept for testing this effect in analogue gravity platforms."}

In this work, we compute the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different chaotic and non-chaotic orbits by implementing the numerical kludge scheme. We further perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waveforms from such orbits. In particular, we show that when the system is in a chaotic state, the gravitational wave signals are characterized by broader frequency spectra with finite widths, enhanced amplitude and energy emission rate, distinctly differentiating them from the signals generated during the system's non-chaotic state. Through recurrence analysis we also show that the time series of gravitational waveforms strain carry unique information on the motion of chaotic dynamics, which can be used to distinctly differentiate from non-chaotic to chaotic motion of the source. Furthermore, we discuss the potential detectability of these orbits for upcoming observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, emphasizing the significant potential for detecting chaotic imprints in gravitational waves to substantially enhance our understanding of chaotic dynamics in black hole physics and the dark matter environments of galactic nuclei."}

Cells, as the most basic structural and functional units of life, are small in scale but have complex structures, functions, and life activities. Analogous to nature, this article proposes the concept of liquid metal cells, and systematically explores their construction routes, sensing capabilities, motion behaviors, and potential applications. We first construct a multi-phase composite structure with liquid metal as the nucleus, ionic solution as the cytoplasm, and polymer as the cell membrane by developing a layered cryogenic molding method. Furthermore, we reveal that liquid metal cells exhibit inherently versatile responsive characteristics and self-adaptive behaviors to thermal, pressure, chemical, electrical, and magnetic fields, indicating \"small world, vast potential\".

Here we introduce a model for light--Andreev interaction, with distinct features: Electrons transitioning into Andreev levels can sidestep Pauli exclusion, resulting in two optical absorption resonances separated by twice the bound state energy. One resonance populates the Andreev state and the other empties it; pumping both resets the junction and prevents saturation.

The NC possessed both the capacitor property (287.91 F/g) and battery-like charge storage 38.3 mC/g with the highest energy density of 159.95 mWh/g.

During PFHP, there is an 85% reduction in propionic acid, a 65.3% record electron management efficiency, an improved 1.34 NAD+/NADH ratio, along with a 87% increase in dehydrogenase activity, confirming the superior role of NC in efficient regulation of the metabolic pathway and electron flux management. These exceptional properties of biochar-based NC raised the cumulative hydrogen production from 151.03 mL (control) to 589.54 mL, which was an enormous increase of 367%."}

This is achieved in an experimental scenario motivated by the construction appearing in the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem. We derive noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities bounding the conclusiveness of exclusion, and describe a quantum violation of these.

This expression coincides with a Wightman conformal partial wave corresponding to the operator dual to the exchanged particle in the bulk. Further, we discuss and explicitly show how these results can be analytically continued to obtain Euclidean AdS correlators up to contact diagrams and avoid the need to perform any nested bulk point integrals in contrast to the traditional Witten diagram approach. We then translate our results to twistor space taking first steps towards a twistor space reformulation of four point Wightman functions. For conformally coupled scalars interacting with a cubic potential, we obtain a beautiful form for four and five point functions. For the interesting case of Yang-Mills theory and Einstein gravity, we derive a simple double copy relation. This is easiest to see when correlators are expressed in twistor space using Schwinger parameterization where the graviton correlator is simply the square of its gluon counterpart."}

A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation. Other order parameters are also examined, and a certain hierarchy among those that belong to different representations of the exact $O(2N)$ is observed."}

For expansion rate $t^q$, with $0< q<\\frac{1}{2}$ (excluding certain exceptional values), we show that the spatial density decays at the rate $t^{-6q}$ and that, when the spatial average is removed, the density decays at an enhanced rate due to a phase mixing effect. This enhancement is polynomial for Sobolev initial data and super-polynomial, but sub-exponential, for real analytic initial data. We further show that, when the expansion rate is the borderline $t^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ -- the rate which describes a radiation filled universe -- a degenerate phase mixing effect results in a logarithmic enhancement for Sobolev initial data and a super-logarithmic enhancement (in fact, a gain of $\\exp(-μ(\\log t)^ε)$ for some $μ,ε>0$) for analytic initial data. The proof is based on a collection of commuting vector fields, and certain combinatorial properties of an associated collection of differential operators. The vector fields are not explicit, but are shown to have good properties when $t$ is large with respect to the momentum support of the solution. A physical space dyadic localisation is employed to treat non-compactly supported (in particular, non-trivial real analytic) but suitably decaying solutions."}

Our results show that PHPS is most viable in individual heating systems, and in wind-dominated locations, where its low cost per energy capacity enables it to balance long-duration fluctuations. Moreover, waste heat recovery is essential to enhance PHPS competitiveness, allowing it to displace lithium-ion batteries. Conversely, PHPS is largely outcompeted in district heating systems, which favour low-cost centralized energy storage. Sensitivity analysis highlights that PHPS viability depends primarily on achieving low energy capacity costs and maintaining reasonable heat-to-power conversion efficiencies. Overall, while PHPS complements existing storage technologies by providing dispatchable electricity and heat, its potential adoption is highly context-dependent, influenced by climate, heating system configuration, and competing storage costs."}

An unexpected Hall quantum oscillation, distinct from the Weyl-orbit oscillation, coexists with the QHE, along with an unquantized two-terminal magnetoresistance. Moreover, unconventional antichiral transmission enables a peculiar disorder-robust negative longitudinal resistance. Quantization tunable by the lead configuration is further found in this transport geometry. A unique type of nonlocal quantum backscattering channels underlies these phenomena.

We show that the shape of the potential energy surfaces can be engineered and controlled by exploiting the sideband transitions of the crystal vibration and dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg ions in the Lamb-Dicke regime. Using the sideband transition, we realize a sloped conical intersection whose cone axis is only tilted along one spatial axis. When the phonon wavepacket is located in the potential minimum of the lower potential surface, the spin and phonon dynamics are largely frozen owing to the geometric phase effect. When starting from the upper potential surface, the electronic and phonon states tunnel to the lower potential surface, leading to a partial revival of the initial state. In contrast, the dynamics drastically change when the initial wavepackets are away from the conical intersection. The initial state is revived, and is almost entirely irrelevant to whether it is from the lower or upper potential surface. Complete Rabi oscillations of the adiabatic states are found when the wavepacket is initialized on the upper potential surface. The dynamics occur on the microsecond and nanometer scales, implying that Rydberg ions provide a platform for simulating nonadiabatic processes in the vicinity of a sloped conical intersection."}

We demonstrate potentially observable consequences of inflation with a finite initial time in a model in five-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter space, with both a UV and an IR brane present during inflation. Considering an inflaton with an approximately flat potential localized on the UV brane, we derive the resulting brane motion in the bulk and the 4D effective action describing the dynamics. A concrete model allows us to evaluate possible consequences of a starting point of inflation. The background evolution is driven by the fast roll of the radion at early times and the slow roll of the inflaton at late times. We find that the action has the form of a two-field hyperbolic inflation model, the two fields being the radion and the inflaton, both of which have a time-dependent background solution. This setup is holographically dual to an inflaton coupled to a strongly coupled confined sector in which the confinement scale is larger than the Hubble scale, and a confinement scale whose ratio to the 4D Planck scale evolves cosmologically. Focusing on the period when the equation of state becomes that of inflation, we find that the presence of the IR brane leads to deviations from the approximate de Sitter background in addition to those from the slow-roll parameters of the inflaton potential. We quantify the effect of the presence of the IR brane on the two point function of the adiabatic scalar perturbations and tensor perturbations. The dominant deviations occur at large scales: the adiabatic power spectrum has a blue tilt, while the tensor power spectrum shows oscillatory features. We present numerical fits to the shape of the adiabatic power spectrum, and discuss the implications for cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis."}

In this work, we vary the physical thickness of the GBL and TDL, and conduct an in-depth analysis of the energy bands of the gate structure to investigate the physical mechanism behind the RL in FeFETs with the MIFIFIS structure. The physical origin of the RL is that the electric field direction across the TDL reduces the potential barrier provided by the ferroelectric near the silicon substrate. Based on the above physical mechanism, the RL can be reduced to 12% and 0.2% by redesigning the gate structure or reducing the pulse amplitude, respectively.

The reason for this lies not only in the unique nature of these extremely thin samples, but also in the different experimental configurations and data processing methods used. Moreover, since this type of spectroscopy was originally used to characterize the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carriers in chemical compounds, colloidal nanostructures and gas molecules, a purely 'molecular' approach to interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors is often proposed. However, this approach is fundamentally inapplicable to thin-film semiconductors grown or mechanically exfoliated on transparent substrates. This review considers the recent experimental results of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of 2D semiconductors in a wide spectral range from several THz to UV (~1000 THz) based on the 'solid-state' approach to their interpretation. We also highlight typical errors that arise in measuring, processing and interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors."}

Under ambient conditions, the trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 stabilizes in a twinned monoclinic structure with space group P21/c. Upon heating, it undergoes a structural transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at Ts ~ 1030 K, while a second transition associated with the onset of density-weave (DW) ordering emerges upon cooling below TDW ~ 135 K. Here from pressure-temperature x-ray diffraction on high quality flux-grown single crystals we unequivocally demonstrate a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition with no trace of intermediate orthorhombic Bmab phase. Ab initio density-functional theory calculations as a function of pressure fully corroborate the experimental observations. The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure. This is in contrast to Raman measurements that reveal the appearance of additional phonon modes below 130 K, implying a further reduction in symmetry from monoclinic P21/c and thus indicating the presence of a third structural phase associated with the DW ordering in La4Ni3O10."}

Wormholes are viable candidates for exotic compact objects that can mimic some black hole properties. Hence, it is natural to wonder what would happen if the central astrophysical object were a wormhole, instead of a black hole. We investigate the astrophysical environment effect on the absorption of a massless scalar field by a dirty wormhole surrounded by a thick shell of matter. We study null geodesics around these dirty wormholes and analyze under which conditions new pairs of light rings can appear. The presence of new stable light rings allows new quasibound states in the spacetime, apart from the ones trapped near the throat. Thus, the astrophysical environment can introduce deviations in the absorption bands. Remarkably, although heavy and dense distributions of matter are considered surrounding the wormhole, the position of most of the spectral lines in the absorption bands is preserved, indicating that the astrophysical environment cannot hide some fingerprints of the central object."}

It is based on an extension of Kelly's model, a framework derived from information theory and investment theory, applied here to understand macro-financial and climate dynamics. This approach complements traditional Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) by explicitly linking financial dynamics to cumulative emissions, enabling the assessment of policy alignment (or misalignment) with net-zero pathways. We find that injecting debt into the system increases short-term production gains, but at the expense of higher bankruptcy risk and cumulative emissions. Thus, the model reveals a double constraint: financially, debt requires growth to be repaid; ecologically, growth requires energy, and therefore emissions. When the intrinsic growth rate falls below the interest rate, the probability of solvency drops to zero: the economy enters a zone of structural instability. The model then identifies an optimal leverage frontier: beyond a certain threshold, additional debt no longer fuels real wealth; it only increases the risk of bankruptcy and carbon debt. Our model is calibrated using multi-decade macroeconomic and emissions data from several countries, including the United States, China, France, and Denmark. Our results confirm that the correlation between cumulative debt, cumulative GDP, and cumulative emissions remains strong, regardless of the political structure of credit. In our current financial system, credit expansion amplifies GDP growth and associated emissions, thereby locking economies into higher cumulative carbon trajectories, even as energy efficiency improves through innovation."}

This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model. We observe that the FV decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, directly mirroring QFT predictions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even minor deviations from the ideal metastable state can cause a stark departure from this universal scaling law. Extending beyond short-time decay dynamics, we also examine resonant bubble nucleation, a feature distinctive to systems with discrete energy spectra.

A question of both practical and foundational value is: Given some copies of a state with low coherence, can we prepare a more coherent state via coherence non-increasing operations? Here, we study this question in the minimal limiting case: Given two uncorrelated copies of a coherent state, can one, via globally coherence non-increasing unitaries, increase the coherence in a subsystem? We fully solve this problem for qubits, identifying the optimal unitaries and revealing the existence of bound coherence. This is then used to create a completely constructive multi-qubit coherence enhancement protocol, where only effective-qubit unitaries are used. Unexpectedly, in this protocol, we show that there exists states for which the ratio of the input-output coherence can be amplified unboundedly. Extending beyond qubits, we derive two fundamental upper bounds on the amount of local coherence that can be increased and prove a no-go theorem showing that certain global correlations cannot be converted to local coherence."}

Among various approaches, parametric frequency mixing processes such as four-wave mixing (FWM) offer a promising pathway toward efficient and low-noise transduction. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of coherent quantum state transfer by indirectly verifying high-fidelity wavefunction's phase mapping (>99%) from the input field to the generated output field wave. Using a gas-filled hollow-core capillary fiber, we systematically investigate spectral phase evolution across a broad range, including infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) transitions, as well as conversions from telecom-band (1550 nm) to visible (516 nm) and deep-UV (308 nm) wavelengths. Our results reveal that strong phase coherence can be maintained throughout these diverse conversion regimes. Because quantum properties such as coherence and entanglement are intrinsically encoded in both the amplitude and phase of a photonic wavefunction, preserving spectral phase is essential for faithful quantum information transfer. We further show that efficient and phase-preserving transduction can be achieved by tuning system parameters, offering valuable insights into nonlinear coupling dynamics. These findings establish a promising foundation for advancing FWM-based quantum transduction schemes and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous quantum systems across wide spectral domains within future quantum communication networks."}

The influence of on-site and extended Hubbard interactions, disorder, and electron filling on the persistent current is systematically analyzed. To construct the full many-body Hamiltonian, we introduce a linear table formalism, which, to our knowledge, has been rarely used in this context. In ordered rings, the current decreases monotonically with increasing on-site repulsion, while the impact of the extended interaction depends strongly on the filling factor. At low filling, stronger extended interaction suppresses the current, whereas near half-filling, it enhances the current up to a critical ratio, half of the on-site strength, before reducing it. Disorder significantly modifies these behaviors, notably enhancing the current at less than quarter-filling with increasing extended interaction. The localization properties of eigenstates, examined via the inverse participation ratio, further support the crucial roles of filling and the interplay between on-site and extended interactions in governing persistent current."}

Precise control and manipulation of these modes remain critical challenges, particularly in systems where nonlinear multimode dynamics interact with dispersion effects. In this work, we focus on the role of group velocity dispersion (GVD) within optical cavities - a phenomenon traditionally viewed as detrimental but increasingly recognized as a versatile tool for quantum light manipulation. We present a perturbation-theory-based approach to analyze GVD effects in a synchronously pumped dispersive cavity. By comparing perturbative solutions to rigorous steady-state results, we establish the validity region of the perturbative approach and assess its limitations in multimode systems. Our study identifies key parameters governing the breakdown of perturbation theory, such as mode order, dispersion strength, and cavity decay rates."}

However, the detection of biomolecules at low concentrations is limited by the total photon dose that can be applied before photodamage alters the sample, and photon shot noise sets the minimum achievable noise floor for most microscopes.

We show, in the late time limit, that modular flowed correlators of two Majorana fermions, single-sided and two-sided, exhibit non-trivial singularities.

Multimode fibers (MMFs) using space-division multiplexing (SDM) are promising for improved transmission capacity, connection flexibility, and security of data. However, the complex transmission characteristics of MMFs significantly hinder precise mode demultiplexing. Conventional approaches, including holographic measurements, phase retrieval algorithms, photonic lanterns, and multiplane light conversion, are limited by system complexity, size, and flexibility. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time a purely optical, chip-scale AI solution for high-mode isolation, speed-of-light demultiplexing of MMF modes using a three-dimensional diffractive neural network (DNN). The DNN is trained with synthetic modal data and fabricated using two-photon nanolithography. It features a compact size of $120μm \\times 120μm \\times 80μm$ and a diffractive structure size of $1μm^{2}$ for the neurons at the hidden layers of the network. Experimentally, the DNN demultiplexer achieves a relative demultiplexing accuracy of over 80%. The AI approach of DNN allows for flexible design and overcomes the size and performance limitations of digital-optical demultiplexers.

In our work, we have used VQE to identify the phase transition boundary for an infinite order phase transition. We use long-range XXZ (LRXXZ) chain for our study. In order to probe infinite order phase transition, we propose to utilise the ground state energy obtained from VQE. The idea rests on the argument that VQE requires an ansatz circuit; therefore, the accuracy of the VQE will rely on this ansatz circuit. We have designed this circuit such that the estimated ground state energy is sensitive to the phase it is evaluated in. It is achieved by applying the constraint that the net spin remains constant throughout the optimisation process. Consequently, the ansatz works in a certain phase where it gives relatively small random error, as it should, when compared to the error in ground state energy calculations of the other phases, where the ansatz fails. By identifying these changes in the behaviour of the error in ground state energy using VQE, we were able to determine the phase boundaries. Using exact diagonalisation, we also compare the behaviour of the energy gradient and energy gap across both the phase transition boundaries for this model. Further, by increasing the depth of the optimisation circuit, we also accurately evaluate the ground energy of the LRXXZ chain for the value of coupling constant, J equal to -1"}

To overcome these constraints, we introduce dissipation engineering as a dynamic control strategy that temporally separates energy storage and release. By suppressing emission during charging and rapidly enhancing the output coupling during discharging, we realize nanosecond microwave bursts with watt-level peak power. By optimizing three dissipation schemes, we improve work extraction efficiency of the quantum battery by over two orders of magnitude and achieve high power compression factors outperforming the state-of-the-art techniques, establishing dissipation engineering as a pathway toward room-temperature, high-power coherent microwave sources."}

Our construction involves applying different permutations between replicas of the ground state wavefunction in neighboring spatial regions, creating \"permutation defects\" at the boundaries between these regions. We provide general arguments for the robustness of these measures and develop a field-theoretical framework to compute them systematically. While the standard topological field theory prescription misses the chiral contribution, our method correctly identifies it as the chiral conformal field theory partition function on high-genus Riemann surfaces.

Established fundamental adversarial limits for quantum certification using Eve GAN, a generative adversarial network trained to produce classical correlations indistinguishable from quantum. Our central finding: when Eve interpolates her classical correlations with quantum data at mixing parameter, all tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50, equivalent to random guessing. This means an eavesdropper needs only 5% classical admixture to completely evade detection. Critically, we discover that same distribution calibration a common practice in prior certification studies inflates detection performance by 44 percentage points compared to proper cross distribution evaluation, revealing a systematic flaw that may have led to overestimated security claims. Analysis of Popescu Rohrlich (PR Box) regime identifies a sharp phase transition at CHSH S = 2.05: below this value, no statistical method distinguishes classical from quantum correlations; above it, detection probability increases monotonically. Hardware validation on IBM Quantum demonstrates that Eve-GAN achieves CHSH = 2.736, remarkably exceeding real quantum hardware performance (CHSH = 2.691), illustrating that classical adversaries can outperform noisy quantum systems on standard certification metrics.

In these and other systems, a thorough and predictive characterization of how the network geometry correlates with the resulting emission spectrum would be highly important, however such outright description is still lacking. In this work, we take a step toward filling this gap, by using the well-known Steady-State ab Initio Laser Theory (SALT) equations [L. Ge et al., Phys. Rev. A 82, 063824 (2010)] to carry out an extensive set of statistical analyses and establish connections between the random network geometry and their ultimate emission spectrum. Our results show that edge crowding is key to tune the uniformity of the modal intensity distribution of the emission spectrum.

We construct a lattice model with direction-dependent nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings that faithfully reproduces the continuum dispersion and allows controlled rotation of the Fermi contour. Employing a multiterminal geometry and the Büttiker-probe method, we compute the resulting Hall voltage and establish its direct correspondence with the continuum transverse response. The effect increases with the degree of anisotropy and vanishes at rotation angles where mirror symmetry is restored. Unlike the quantum Hall effect, the Hall response predicted here is not quantized but varies continuously with the band-structure parameters. Our results provide a symmetry-based route to engineer Hall-like signals in low-symmetry materials without magnetic fields or topological effects."}

The novelty in our work lies in the implementation of the tightest finite-key security to date for the BBM92 protocol and the design improvements in the primitives of the hybrid system that ensure the processing time scales linearly with the size of secret instructions."}

The geometry of these surfaces depends sensitively on the ratio $η= A/C$, the quotient of the conformal charges characterizing the underlying CFT. We then fully integrate the conformal anomaly near the singularity for a generic Kasner-type metric and obtain the corresponding stress-energy tensor.

To construct the full many-body Hamiltonian, we introduce a linear table formalism, which, to our knowledge, has been rarely used in this context. In ordered rings, the current decreases monotonically with increasing on-site repulsion, while the impact of the extended interaction depends strongly on the filling factor. At low filling, stronger extended interaction suppresses the current, whereas near half-filling, it enhances the current up to a critical ratio, half of the on-site strength, before reducing it. Disorder significantly modifies these behaviors, notably enhancing the current at less than quarter-filling with increasing extended interaction. The localization properties of eigenstates, examined via the inverse participation ratio, further support the crucial roles of filling and the interplay between on-site and extended interactions in governing persistent current."}

Here, we employ a Michelson Interferometer in conjunction with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) for determining the spectral profile of a narrow-band light source. Interestingly, we observe that the fringes across the interferometer output beam are inherently shifted in wavelength even when a constant phase profile is provided to the SLM. We calibrate the spectral shifts as a function of fringe spatial location by measuring the incident light spectrum at various points across the fringe pattern, and observe that the spectral peak traces out a `teardrop' shape, whose width is dependent on the spectral bandwidth of the source, the relative tilt and path difference between the two arms of the interferometer, and the divergence of the beam. Next, we demonstrate that this inherent spectral variation of the fringes can be used to perform fast single-snapshot spectroscopy of narrow-band light sources, while a time-varied phase profile provided to the SLM leads to multi-step spectroscopy with lower noise, higher resolution, and better contrast. Our findings establish that the Michelson Interferometer can be used to perform spectroscopy of any source within a certain spectral range from simple images of the fringe pattern, so as to facilitate exciting applications towards hyperspectral imaging."}

We here develop a general theory to control an arbitrary number of bosonic modes governed by the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. It takes advantage of the gauge potential in the instantaneous frame rather than the energy spectrum of Hamiltonian. In particular, the dynamics of a general non-Hermitian continuous-variable system is analyzed in the instantaneous frame associated with time-dependent ancillary operators that are superpositions of the laboratory-frame operators and irrelevant to the original Hamiltonian. The gauge potential is determined by the unitary transformation between the time-dependent and stationary ancillary frames. The upper triangularization condition for the Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the stationary ancillary frame enables two of the time-dependent ancillary operators to be nonadiabatic Heisenberg passages of the non-Hermitian system. The probability conservation of the system wavefunction can be restored at the end of these passages without artificial normalization. Our theory is exemplified with the perfect and nonreciprocal state transfers in a cavity magnonic system. The former holds for arbitrary initial states and is irrelevant to the parity-time symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the exceptional point of the spectra; and the latter is consistent with the unidirectional perfect absorbtion. Our work essentially extends the universal quantum control (UQC) theory to the non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems, providing a promising approach for their coherent control."}

This very simple setup enhances the laser's performance in terms of threshold current and emitted power. We further prove that the EC configuration positively impacts the laser's noise properties.

We compare the resulting $N=1$ supersymmetric action for eight 3d scalar multiplets to the $N=8$ 3d supersymmetric action describing the $D=11$ supermembrane in the static gauge. The two actions are not equivalent which is related to the fact that the full $N=8$ supersymmetry of the static-gauge $D=11$ supermembrane action can be realised only if the fermions are described by an $SO(8)$ spinor rather than vector. The two actions are still directly related in special dimensions $D=4$ and 5.

Here, we present a 50 GHz repetition rate carrier-envelope offset estabilised millimetre-wave baseband comb source covering the sub-terahertz region, generated from an optical microcomb source. Our microresonator-filtered microcomb enables direct, coherent downconversion via photoconductive antennas, even without external amplification. The metrological-grade optical soliton source produces single-cycle, naturally zero carrier-envelope offset millimetrewave baseband combs. It supports time-domain spectroscopy without any need to temporally align the source and detection pulses, as the ultra-high phase coherence allows significant differences between the optical paths of the source and detection pulses, which we tested over 8m, finding no degradation even in freerunning operation. Finally, the multisoliton operation regime provides a simple way of spectrally tailoring the microwave output by selecting different optical soliton states."}

Quantum linear system solvers have shown potential in accelerating the solution of linear systems arising in IPMs. In this work, we introduce a novel almost-exact quantum IPM, where the Newton system is constructed and solved on a quantum computer, while solution updates occur on a classical machine.

At tree level, Magnus amplitudes are expressed in terms of retarded and advanced propagators, with each diagram weighted by factors that we identify as Murua coefficients. At loop level this structure is augmented by the Hadamard cut function, and we establish remarkable relations between loop- and tree-level Magnus amplitudes. Among these, we find that $n$-point one-loop Magnus amplitudes are entirely determined by phase-space integrals of forward limits of $(n{+}2)$-point tree-level amplitudes, and hence related to Murua coefficients, and we generalise this to a class of higher-loop contributions. Furthermore, in the case of heavy particles interacting via massless mediators, we conjecture that Magnus diagrams that contribute to the classical limit are always given by forward limits of trees, and we show this explicitly in a one-loop example. We derive these results studying theories of scalar fields with cubic interactions, but our methods are applicable to general theories as well as to integral functions appearing in gravitational-wave computations.

After reduction to the centre manifold, the dynamics is governed by two slow geometric modes $(r,z)$: the Hopf amplitude $r$, measuring the kinetic departure from de Sitter, and the slowly drifting Hubble mode $z$. We show that the standard slow--roll parameters follow directly from these unfolding variables, $ε\\sim\\tfrac32 r^{2}$ and $η\\sim z$, so that the spectral tilt, tensor--to--scalar ratio, and scalar amplitude arise as universal functions of $(r,z)$, independently of the choice of potential.

For arbitrary MUBs subsets of $k$ elements in any prime dimension, this method yields a universal analytical upper bound for the amount of MUBs equivalence classes.

We illustrate our general framework through two example systems: superconductivity and perturbative quantum gravity. In both cases, spontaneously broken symmetries imply the existence of unitarily inequivalent Hilbert spaces that play the role of distinct backgrounds relative to which observables are measured. Background independence can be realized by gauging the broken symmetry; extending the algebra of observables for the theory to include new physical processes that intertwine between these disjoint representations. From the point of view of the background independent theory, different backgrounds have an interpretation as different vacuum expectation values of these intertwining operators. In superconductivity, the intertwiners are intimately related to the Josephson effect. In gravity, they are related to geometric fluctuations. We explain how this framework is connected to recent work on generalized symmetries and algebraic extensions. To this end, we close with some remarks about how the operator algebra of a closed universe may arise from a generalized symmetry associated with the inclusion of the causal wedge inside the entanglement wedge by appealing to subregion-subalgebra duality."}

Using a fluctuation electrodynamics framework combined with full-wave numerical simulations, we quantify the near-field radiative heat transfer between such elliptically perforated plates as a function of ellipse orientation, aspect ratio, and separation distance. The results reveal that elliptical perforations enable enhanced spectral and directional control of evanescent mode coupling and surface polariton excitation, leading to significant modulation of the near-field heat flux. These findings highlight the potential of geometrically engineered anisotropy for advanced thermal management and energy conversion applications, and offer new design strategies for the development of thermally functional metamaterials operating in the near-field regime."}

Advances in nanofabrication have allowed precise dispersion engineering, unlocking octave-spanning soliton combs that are essential for applications such as optical atomic clocks, frequency synthesis, precision spectroscopy, and astronomical spectrometer calibration. However, a key challenge hindering their practical deployment is the intrinsic bandwidth-efficiency trade-off: achieving broadband soliton generation requires large pump detuning, which suppresses power coupling and limits pump-to-comb conversion efficiencies to only a few percent. Recent efforts using pulsed pumping or coupled-resonator architectures have improved efficiency to several tens of percent, yet their bandwidths remain below one-tenth of an octave, inadequate for applications demanding wide spectral coverage. Here, we overcome this limitation by harnessing mode interactions between spatial modes within a single microresonator. The mode hybridization creates an additional power-transfer channel that supports large pump detuning while maintaining strong pump-to-resonator coupling, enabling broadband soliton formation at substantially reduced pump power. Using this approach, we demonstrate an octave-spanning soliton microcomb with a record pump-to-comb conversion efficiency exceeding 50%.

Propagation losses and perturbations in the encoded photons' degrees of freedom, such as polarisation or phase, limit both the QKD range and key rate. The maintenance of phase coherence over optical fibres has lately received considerable attention as it enables QKD over long distances, e.g., through phase-based protocols like Twin-Field (TF) QKD. While optical single mode fibres (SMFs) are the current standard type of fibre, recent hollow core fibres (HCFs) could become a superior alternative in the future. Whereas the co-existence of quantum and classical signals in HCF has already been demonstrated, the phase noise resilience required for phase-based QKD protocols is yet to be established. This work explores the behaviour of HCF with respect to phase noise for the purpose of TF-QKD-like protocols. To achieve this, two experiments are performed. The first, is a set of concurrent measurements on 2 km of HCF and SMF in a double asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer configuration. The second, uses a TF-QKD interferometer consisting of HCF and SMF channels. These initial results indicate that HCF is suitable for use in TF-QKD and other phase-based QKD protocols."}

In our work, we have used VQE to identify the phase transition boundary for an infinite order phase transition. We use long-range XXZ (LRXXZ) chain for our study. In order to probe infinite order phase transition, we propose to utilise the ground state energy obtained from VQE. The idea rests on the argument that VQE requires an ansatz circuit; therefore, the accuracy of the VQE will rely on this ansatz circuit. We have designed this circuit such that the estimated ground state energy is sensitive to the phase it is evaluated in. It is achieved by applying the constraint that the net spin remains constant throughout the optimisation process. Consequently, the ansatz works in a certain phase where it gives relatively small random error, as it should, when compared to the error in ground state energy calculations of the other phases, where the ansatz fails. By identifying these changes in the behaviour of the error in ground state energy using VQE, we were able to determine the phase boundaries. Using exact diagonalisation, we also compare the behaviour of the energy gradient and energy gap across both the phase transition boundaries for this model. Further, by increasing the depth of the optimisation circuit, we also accurately evaluate the ground energy of the LRXXZ chain for the value of coupling constant, J equal to -1"}

This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model.

Our construction involves applying different permutations between replicas of the ground state wavefunction in neighboring spatial regions, creating \"permutation defects\" at the boundaries between these regions. We provide general arguments for the robustness of these measures and develop a field-theoretical framework to compute them systematically. While the standard topological field theory prescription misses the chiral contribution, our method correctly identifies it as the chiral conformal field theory partition function on high-genus Riemann surfaces. This feature is a consequence of the bulk-edge correspondence, which dictates that any regularization of the theory at the permutation defects must introduce gapless boundary modes. We numerically verify our results with both free-fermion and strongly-interacting chiral topological states and find excellent agreement.

So the special point realises a first-order transition between (or the coexistence of) the trivial gapped phase and the nontrivial gapped phase associated with the code. In addition, if the original model has a non-invertible duality symmetry, then so does the deformed model. In this case, the duality symmetry is spontaneously broken at the special point, consistent with the associated anomaly.\n  A key step in proving the gap is a coarse-graining/blocking procedure on the Tanner graph of the code that allows us to apply the martingale method successfully. Our model, therefore, provides the first application of the martingale method to a frustration-free model, that is not commuting projector, defined on an arbitrary Tanner graph.\n  We also discuss several familiar examples on Euclidean spatial lattice.

Previous studies have shown that its expectation value is not conserved for observers propagating in a gravitational field. Here, we show that this Noether symmetry can also be realized in empty waveguides with duality-preserving boundary conditions, and we quantize the source-free Maxwell theory inside a long, cylindrical waveguide undergoing both linear and rotational acceleration from rest. In the vacuum $|0\\rangle$ associated to inertial observers, we find that the expectation value $\\langle 0| \\hat Q |0\\rangle $ fails to be conserved for observers co-moving with the waveguide.

As a consequence, accelerated detectors co-moving with the rotating waveguide can detect photon-pair excitations from the quantum vacuum, exhibiting an imbalance between opposite helicity modes. This is a relativistic quantum effect, which shows that the classical conservation law associated with duality symmetry is broken in the quantum theory even in flat spacetime, provided we work with non-inertial systems.

Our study focuses on the analysis of the spectra of the post-merger gravitational-wave signals and on how these are affected by the treatment of thermal effects in the two EOS representations. Our simulations highlight distinct differences in the GW frequency evolution related to the thermal modeling of the EOS, demonstrating that deviations from established quasi-universal relations become significant at late post-merger phases. Furthermore, we investigate the stability of the HMNS against convection. Employing both the Ledoux criterion, necessary condition for the development of convective instabilities, and the Solberg-Høiland criterion, a generalized criterion for axisymmetric perturbations based on a combined analysis of the Brunt-Väisälä frequency and of the epicyclic frequency, we show that differential rotation and thermal stratification in the HMNS give rise to local (yet sustained) convective patterns that persist beyond 100 ms after merger. Those convective patterns, while substantially different between tabulated and hybrid EOS treatments, trigger the the excitation of inertial modes with frequencies smaller than those attained by the fundamental quadrupolar mode, and are potentially within reach of third-generation GW detectors. The late-time excitation of inertial modes, previously reported in studies based on hybrid EOS, is fully supported by the tabulated, finite-temperature EOS simulations presented here, which account for thermal effects in a more consistent way."}

We demonstrate potentially observable consequences of inflation with a finite initial time in a model in five-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter space, with both a UV and an IR brane present during inflation. Considering an inflaton with an approximately flat potential localized on the UV brane, we derive the resulting brane motion in the bulk and the 4D effective action describing the dynamics. A concrete model allows us to evaluate possible consequences of a starting point of inflation. The background evolution is driven by the fast roll of the radion at early times and the slow roll of the inflaton at late times. We find that the action has the form of a two-field hyperbolic inflation model, the two fields being the radion and the inflaton, both of which have a time-dependent background solution. This setup is holographically dual to an inflaton coupled to a strongly coupled confined sector in which the confinement scale is larger than the Hubble scale, and a confinement scale whose ratio to the 4D Planck scale evolves cosmologically. Focusing on the period when the equation of state becomes that of inflation, we find that the presence of the IR brane leads to deviations from the approximate de Sitter background in addition to those from the slow-roll parameters of the inflaton potential. We quantify the effect of the presence of the IR brane on the two point function of the adiabatic scalar perturbations and tensor perturbations. The dominant deviations occur at large scales: the adiabatic power spectrum has a blue tilt, while the tensor power spectrum shows oscillatory features. We present numerical fits to the shape of the adiabatic power spectrum, and discuss the implications for cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis."}

Commensurate driving, where the pulse length is an integer multiple of the drive period, can mitigate errors from residual intra-qubit exchange, including effects from counter rotating terms and off-axis rotations, as well as leakage errors during two-qubit operations. Residual inter-qubit exchange creates crosstalk errors that reduce single-qubit control fidelities. We show that using a single-spin coupler between two resonant singlet-triplet qubits can reduce this crosstalk error by an order of magnitude. Assuming perfect coupler state preparation and realistic charge and hyperfine noise, we predict that coupler-assisted two-qubit gate errors can be below $3\\times10^{-3}$ for gate times as short as $66~\\text{ns}$, even in the presence of residual exchange levels exceeding several hundred kHz.

The geometry of these surfaces depends sensitively on the ratio $η= A/C$, the quotient of the conformal charges characterizing the underlying CFT. We then fully integrate the conformal anomaly near the singularity for a generic Kasner-type metric and obtain the corresponding stress-energy tensor. Its components are expressed in terms of three symmetric polynomials (of degrees $2$, $3$ and $4$) and depend on seven arbitrary constants, which may be interpreted as parameterizing different choices of the quantum state at the singularity. By imposing a set of constraints we reduce this parameter space to a single free constant. Subsequently, we solve, at leading order near the singularity, the modified gravitational equations. Among the admissible solutions, we identify, in particular, those that develop a curvature singularity while remaining geodesically complete."}

At this point the Einstein--scalar system exhibits a codimension--two Hopf--steady--state organising centre whose versal unfolding describes all small deformations of the quadratic model. After reduction to the centre manifold, the dynamics is governed by two slow geometric modes $(r,z)$: the Hopf amplitude $r$, measuring the kinetic departure from de Sitter, and the slowly drifting Hubble mode $z$. We show that the standard slow--roll parameters follow directly from these unfolding variables, $ε\\sim\\tfrac32 r^{2}$ and $η\\sim z$, so that the spectral tilt, tensor--to--scalar ratio, and scalar amplitude arise as universal functions of $(r,z)$, independently of the choice of potential. The two unfolding parameters $(μ_{1},μ_{2})$ classify all perturbations of the quadratic model and can be interpreted physically as controlling the tilt and curvature deformations of generic polynomial inflationary potentials.

This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model. We observe that the FV decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, directly mirroring QFT predictions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even minor deviations from the ideal metastable state can cause a stark departure from this universal scaling law. Extending beyond short-time decay dynamics, we also examine resonant bubble nucleation, a feature distinctive to systems with discrete energy spectra.

Yet, the manifestation of this edge anomaly within the bulk ground-state wavefunction itself remains only partially understood. In this work, we introduce a family of multipartite entanglement measures that probe chirality directly from the bulk wavefunction. Our construction involves applying different permutations between replicas of the ground state wavefunction in neighboring spatial regions, creating \"permutation defects\" at the boundaries between these regions. We provide general arguments for the robustness of these measures and develop a field-theoretical framework to compute them systematically. While the standard topological field theory prescription misses the chiral contribution, our method correctly identifies it as the chiral conformal field theory partition function on high-genus Riemann surfaces. This feature is a consequence of the bulk-edge correspondence, which dictates that any regularization of the theory at the permutation defects must introduce gapless boundary modes. We numerically verify our results with both free-fermion and strongly-interacting chiral topological states and find excellent agreement. Our results enable the extraction of the chiral central charge and the Hall conductance using a finite number of wavefunction replicas, making these quantities accessible to Monte-Carlo numerical techniques and noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices."}

This task, however, poses fundamental challenges due to the exponential scaling of state space with system size. We introduce shadow tomography-based transmission with unequal error protection (STT-UEP), a novel communication protocol that enables efficient transmission of properties of quantum states, allowing decoder-side estimation of arbitrary observables. Unlike conventional approaches requiring the transmission of a number of bits that is exponential in the number of qubits, STT-UEP achieves communication complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of observables, depending on the observable weight. The protocol exploits classical shadow tomography for measurement efficiency, and applies unequal error protection by encoding measurement bases with stronger channel codes than measurement outcomes. We provide theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy as a function of the bit error probability of the classical channel, and validate the approach against several benchmarks via numerical results."}

We first discuss two basic control principles -- coherent control which uses manipulation in frequency or time to design these interferences, and adiabatic following where access to the control target is enabled by tracking the time-dependent ground state. For complex control targets and system dynamics that exceed the scope of these basic principles, optimal control theory provides a powerful suite of tools to design the necessary protocols. A key consideration for the successful application of optimal control theory is a proper choice of the optimization functional.

Empirical evaluations on three datasets, Damped Simple Harmonic Motion, Bessel Function, and Urban Telecommunication, demonstrate that QKAN-LSTM achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalization with a 79% reduction in trainable parameters compared to classical LSTMs. We extend the framework to the Jiang-Huang-Chen-Goan Network (JHCG Net), which generalizes KAN to encoder-decoder structures, and then further use QKAN to realize the latent KAN, thereby creating a Hybrid QKAN (HQKAN) for hierarchical representation learning.

However, finding good variational parameters remains a significant challenge due to the non-convex energy landscape, often resulting in slow convergence and poor solution quality. In this work, we propose a quantum meta-learning framework that trains advanced quantum sequence models to generate effective parameter initialization policies. We investigate four classical or quantum sequence models, including the Quantum Kernel-based Long Short-Term Memory (QK-LSTM), as learned optimizers in a \"learning to learn\" paradigm. Our numerical experiments on the Max-Cut problem demonstrate that the QK-LSTM optimizer achieves superior performance, obtaining the highest approximation ratios and exhibiting the fastest convergence rate across all tested problem sizes (n=10 to 13). Crucially, the QK-LSTM model achieves perfect parameter transferability by synthesizing a single, fixed set of near-optimal parameters, leading to a remarkable sustained acceleration of convergence even when generalizing to larger problems. This capability, enabled by the compact and expressive power of the quantum kernel architecture, underscores its effectiveness. The QK-LSTM, with only 43 trainable parameters, substantially outperforms the classical LSTM (56 parameters) and other quantum sequence models, establishing a robust pathway toward highly efficient parameter initialization for variational quantum algorithms in the NISQ era."}

Our main goal is to identify similarities and differences between models in this family in regard to weak-field solutions. To this end, we use the effective source formalism to compare the related effective delta sources, mass functions, and Newtonian potentials. We obtain a variety of representations for these quantities in terms of series, integrals, and special functions, as well as simple approximations that capture the relevant dependence on the parameters $N_s$ and $μ_s$ - which can be used to explore the weak-field phenomenology of nonlocal gravity. We explain why only for $N_s>1$ the Newtonian potential oscillates and prove that, despite the oscillations, the effective masses are positive. Moreover, we verify that these linearized solutions are regular (without curvature singularities). Finally, we also calculate the form of the leading logarithmic quantum correction to the Newtonian potential in these models. In all our considerations, we assume that $N_s$ is a positive real parameter. The cases of non-integer $N_s$ might be applied beyond nonlocal gravity, in effective approaches to implement quantum corrections in the weak field regime."}

This establishes the universality of irreversible dissipation induced by driving an open quantum system near criticality. Furthermore, in systems described by bosonic Gaussian states, our scaling laws predict that the nonadiabatic entropy production is independent of driving speed to leading order, revealing a distinctive feature of Gaussian dissipative quantum phase transitions. We validate these analytical predictions in the thermodynamic limit of the driven-dissipative Dicke model and via finite-size scaling in the open Kerr model. Our results establish a general framework for understanding universal nonequilibrium response and thermodynamic irreversibility in critical open quantum systems."}

In this work, we propose a pump-free scheme based on color centers that generates time-bin encoded M-O Bell pairs. Our scheme first creates spin-photon entanglement and then converts the spin state into a time-bin-encoded microwave photon using a strongly coupled Purcell-enhanced resonator. In our protocol, the microwave retrieval is heralded by detecting the microwave signal with a three-level transmon. We have analyzed the resulting Bell state fidelity and generation probability of this protocol. Our simulation shows that by combining a state-of-the-art spin-optical interface with our proposed strongly-coupled spin-microwave design, the pump-free scheme can generate M-O Bell pairs at a heralding rate exceeding one kilohertz with near-unity fidelity, which establishes the scheme as a promising source for M-O Bell pairs."}

In this work, we propose symmetry-preserving deformations of these models, in the presence of a transverse field, and identify special points along the deformations with interesting features: (i) the special point is frustration-free, (ii) its ground states include a product state and the code space of the underlying code, and (iii) it remains gapped in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit. So the special point realises a first-order transition between (or the coexistence of) the trivial gapped phase and the nontrivial gapped phase associated with the code. In addition, if the original model has a non-invertible duality symmetry, then so does the deformed model. In this case, the duality symmetry is spontaneously broken at the special point, consistent with the associated anomaly.\n  A key step in proving the gap is a coarse-graining/blocking procedure on the Tanner graph of the code that allows us to apply the martingale method successfully. Our model, therefore, provides the first application of the martingale method to a frustration-free model, that is not commuting projector, defined on an arbitrary Tanner graph.\n  We also discuss several familiar examples on Euclidean spatial lattice. Of particular interest is the 2+1d transverse field Ising model: while there is no non-invertible duality symmetry in this case, our results, together with known numerical results, suggest the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram."}

In quantum field theory, the normal-ordered operator $\\hat Q$ represents the difference between the number operators of right- and left-handed photons. Previous studies have shown that its expectation value is not conserved for observers propagating in a gravitational field. Here, we show that this Noether symmetry can also be realized in empty waveguides with duality-preserving boundary conditions, and we quantize the source-free Maxwell theory inside a long, cylindrical waveguide undergoing both linear and rotational acceleration from rest. In the vacuum $|0\\rangle$ associated to inertial observers, we find that the expectation value $\\langle 0| \\hat Q |0\\rangle $ fails to be conserved for observers co-moving with the waveguide. In particular, frame-dragging effects induce a spectral asymmetry between the right- and left-handed field modes at late times. As a consequence, accelerated detectors co-moving with the rotating waveguide can detect photon-pair excitations from the quantum vacuum, exhibiting an imbalance between opposite helicity modes. This is a relativistic quantum effect, which shows that the classical conservation law associated with duality symmetry is broken in the quantum theory even in flat spacetime, provided we work with non-inertial systems. Our analysis provides a concrete proof of concept for testing this effect in analogue gravity platforms."}

Among various approaches, parametric frequency mixing processes such as four-wave mixing (FWM) offer a promising pathway toward efficient and low-noise transduction. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of coherent quantum state transfer by indirectly verifying high-fidelity wavefunction's phase mapping (>99%) from the input field to the generated output field wave. Using a gas-filled hollow-core capillary fiber, we systematically investigate spectral phase evolution across a broad range, including infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) transitions, as well as conversions from telecom-band (1550 nm) to visible (516 nm) and deep-UV (308 nm) wavelengths. Our results reveal that strong phase coherence can be maintained throughout these diverse conversion regimes. Because quantum properties such as coherence and entanglement are intrinsically encoded in both the amplitude and phase of a photonic wavefunction, preserving spectral phase is essential for faithful quantum information transfer. We further show that efficient and phase-preserving transduction can be achieved by tuning system parameters, offering valuable insights into nonlinear coupling dynamics. These findings establish a promising foundation for advancing FWM-based quantum transduction schemes and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous quantum systems across wide spectral domains within future quantum communication networks."}

We show that the shape of the potential energy surfaces can be engineered and controlled by exploiting the sideband transitions of the crystal vibration and dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg ions in the Lamb-Dicke regime. Using the sideband transition, we realize a sloped conical intersection whose cone axis is only tilted along one spatial axis. When the phonon wavepacket is located in the potential minimum of the lower potential surface, the spin and phonon dynamics are largely frozen owing to the geometric phase effect. When starting from the upper potential surface, the electronic and phonon states tunnel to the lower potential surface, leading to a partial revival of the initial state. In contrast, the dynamics drastically change when the initial wavepackets are away from the conical intersection. The initial state is revived, and is almost entirely irrelevant to whether it is from the lower or upper potential surface. Complete Rabi oscillations of the adiabatic states are found when the wavepacket is initialized on the upper potential surface. The dynamics occur on the microsecond and nanometer scales, implying that Rydberg ions provide a platform for simulating nonadiabatic processes in the vicinity of a sloped conical intersection."}

At tree level, Magnus amplitudes are expressed in terms of retarded and advanced propagators, with each diagram weighted by factors that we identify as Murua coefficients. At loop level this structure is augmented by the Hadamard cut function, and we establish remarkable relations between loop- and tree-level Magnus amplitudes. Among these, we find that $n$-point one-loop Magnus amplitudes are entirely determined by phase-space integrals of forward limits of $(n{+}2)$-point tree-level amplitudes, and hence related to Murua coefficients, and we generalise this to a class of higher-loop contributions. Furthermore, in the case of heavy particles interacting via massless mediators, we conjecture that Magnus diagrams that contribute to the classical limit are always given by forward limits of trees, and we show this explicitly in a one-loop example. We derive these results studying theories of scalar fields with cubic interactions, but our methods are applicable to general theories as well as to integral functions appearing in gravitational-wave computations.

A relatively high optimal Rabi frequency of 5 MHz is achieved, dynamically decoupling the electron spin from its 29-Si environment. Tracking the qubit frequency reduces the impact of low frequency noise in the qubit frequency and improves the $T^{Rabi}$ from 7 to 11 $μ$s at a Rabi frequency of 5 MHz, resulting in Q-factors exceeding 50. Randomized benchmarking returns an average single gate control fidelity of 99.5 $\\pm$ 0.3%. As a result of pulse-area calibration, this fidelity is limited by the Rabi Q-factor. These results show that a fast Rabi frequency, low charge noise, and a feedback protocol enable high fidelity in these Si-MOS devices, despite the low-frequency magnetic noise."}

The spiral inductor's distributed inter-turn capacitance yields distinct resonant modes with varied impedance-matching conditions. By probing a quantum dot across several modes, we extract tunneling rates over a broad frequency range and identify signatures of nearby charge defects. Using one of the higher-order modes, we demonstrate single-shot spin readout via a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (RF-SET), achieving singlet-triplet readout with an integration time of 8 us and a readout fidelity of 98%. These results establish multimode inductance as a scalable and flexible component for fast spin-qubit readout and device-quality characterization."}
