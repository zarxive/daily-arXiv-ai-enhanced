Abstract: We demonstrate a Doppler thermometer based on direct optical frequency comb spectroscopy of an $^{85}$Rb vapor with a chirped electro-optic frequency comb (EOFC). The direct EOFC Doppler thermometer is accurate to within its approximately 1 K statistical uncertainty. We experimentally compare direct EOFC spectroscopy with conventional Doppler spectroscopy using a single-frequency, step-scanned laser probe. Our results show that direct EOFC spectroscopy mitigates transit-induced optical pumping distortion of the atomic lineshape, which is the dominant systematic temperature shift in alkali atom Doppler thermometry. Optical Bloch equation simulations of conventional and direct EOFC Doppler spectroscopy confirm that EOFC spectroscopy can use higher optical power to reduce statistical noise without optical pumping distortion. Our results indicate that EOFC Doppler thermometry is a promising approach to realizing a primary thermometer with size and measurement rate sufficient for applications including pharmaceutical manufacturing and nuclear waste monitoring.

Abstract: We study stem-terminally differentiated (TD) lineages in small niches where demographic noise from discrete division and death events is non-negligible. Starting from a mechanistic five-channel, density-dependent CTMC (symmetric self-renewal, symmetric differentiation, asymmetric division, dedifferentiation, TD death), we derive its mean-field limit and a functional CLT, obtaining a chemical Langevin diffusion whose explicit state-dependent covariance exactly matches the CTMC's aggregated channel-wise infinitesimal covariances. Within this diffusion approximation we remove the dedifferentiation flux and obtain a sharp dichotomy: in subcritical regimes the stem coordinate becomes extinct asymptotically almost surely, whereas in supercritical regimes polynomial moments diverge exponentially. This identifies, at the diffusion level, a structural failure mode of strictly hierarchical lineages under demographic fluctuations and clarifies how a cyclic return flux can rescue homeostasis. For interpretation we also derive an exact totals ODE backbone from a damage-structured transport model and obtain two steady-state constraints (ratio and equalization laws) linking compartment ratios to turnover and balancing dedifferentiation against fate bias. Numerical experiments corroborate the $Ω^{-1/2}$ fluctuation scaling, illustrate the pathology, and contrast theorem-regime global convergence with threshold (Allee-type) behaviour outside the theorem hypotheses.

Abstract: We present a model of active particles interacting through a dynamic, heterogeneous environment, leading to emergent collective behaviors without direct agent-to-agent communication. Expanding the resource-dependent framework introduced in Briozzo et al., 2025, arXiv:2512.08762, agents perform a persistent random walk combined with chemotaxis, directing toward nutrient-rich patches, whose resources are generated by logistic regrowth. We identify distinct phases of collective organization, ranging from disordered gas-like states to polar traveling waves and nematic independent clusters, depending on the interplay between chemotactic sensitivity and angular noise. The system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking and density waves driven purely by the coupling between population dynamics (birth-death processes) and environmental feedback. Our results bridge active matter physics and movement ecology, demonstrating that complex spatiotemporal patterns can arise without direct interaction between agents, but solely from the maximization of resource intake in a reactive environment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing accurate and efficient force fields for biomolecular systems to enable quantum-accurate simulations at a reduced computational cost.

Method: General-purpose SO3LR machine-learned force field trained on small molecules, validated through dynamical studies of amino acid, peptide, and protein systems.

Result: SO3LR reproduces DFT-level potential energy surfaces, vibrational features, and molecular dynamics with high fidelity across various biomolecules.

Conclusion: MLFF provides an efficient alternative to DFT for studying biomolecular systems while maintaining quantum accuracy.

Abstract: Predicting biomolecular thermodynamics and spectroscopy requires accurate relative energies of metastable states and local curvatures on the potential-energy surface. We show that the general-purpose SO3LR machine-learned force field (MLFF) reproduces PBE0+MBD density-functional theory with unprecedented fidelity across bio-relevant molecules spanning sizes and complexities far beyond its training dataset. For 23 small molecules, SO3LR captures harmonic and anharmonic vibrational features, including frequencies, displacement patterns, and IR spectra. We perform detailed dynamical studies of the amino acid oF-Phe+, folding of the alanine-15 peptide, and assembly of monomeric p53 transactivation domains into tetramers, in vacuum and water. SO3LR consistently reproduces DFT-level potential-energy surfaces, vibrational densities of states, and mode eigenvectors, capturing anharmonicity, polarization, and medium-range environment-driven interactions crucial for proteins. Our results establish that MLFF-driven dynamics provide a quantum-accurate picture of metastable minima and vibrational properties, achieving DFT-level accuracy at force-field computational cost and opening new possibilities for the computational study of biomolecules.

Abstract: The ability to directly measure radiative-association rate coefficients for reactions between ions and neutral molecules has long challenged chemical physics laboratories, yet radiative association is one of the most important processes occurring in cold, diffuse regions of space. A reaction kinetics instrument has been developed for the investigation of ion--molecule radiative-association reactions, aimed at measuring slow, effective reaction rate coefficients for species relevant to astrophysical objects. The instrument consists of a glow-discharge ion source for production of bright and stable ion currents, a quadrupole mass filter for mass selection and detection, and a quadrupole ion trap capable of trapping reactants and products for the long times needed to measure slow kinetics. The performance and adaptability of the glow-discharge ion source has been evaluated using several configurations. To assess the feasibility of measuring reaction rate coefficients, the reaction of Ag$^{+}$ and O$_{2}$ was studied under pseudo-first-order conditions in the ion trap at room temperature. We present the first pressure-dependent study of this reaction and extract a lower limit of $1 \times 10^{-15}$ cm$^3$ molecule$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ for the Ag$^{+}$ + O$_{2}$ effective radiative-association rate coefficient. Measurements of effective radiative-association rate coefficients are possible for diverse atomic and molecular ions that react with neutral molecules over a range of rates in this versatile new instrument.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Effective water management is essential for the optimal performance of PEM fuel cells. We have developed an impedance model for liquid water transport through the membrane and coupled it with the two-phase model for cathode side impedance. The complete model was fitted to experimental spectra measured at anode/cathode relative humidities (RH) of 32/32\%, 50/50\% and 100/100\% within a current density range of 100 to 1000 mA cm$^{-2}$ and an air flow stoichiometry of 2. Cathode catalyst layer (CCL) saturation decreases with current density due to a growing liquid pressure gradient. For all RH values, the CCL oxygen diffusivity increases dramatically with cell current due to progressive involvement of larger pores into the proton current conversion. Higher RH leads to higher double layer capacitance, which indicates that liquid water increases the electrochemically active surface area.

Abstract: Accurately capturing electron correlation in large-scale molecular systems remains one of the foremost challenges in quantum chemistry and a primary driver for the development of quantum algorithms. Classical configuration-interaction methods, while rigorous, suffer from exponential scaling, rendering them impractical for large or strongly correlated systems. Overcoming this limitation is central to realizing the promise of quantum computing in chemistry. Here, we investigate the pyridine-Li ion complex using three quantum algorithms: the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the subspace quantum diagonalization (SQD) method, and the recently introduced handover iterative VQE (HI-VQE). Our results demonstrate how new generations of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks overcome the scalability and noise sensitivity that constrain conventional VQE approaches. SQD and HI-VQE achieve ground-state energy calculations for problem sizes inaccessible to classical computation, marking a clear advance toward quantum advantage. In particular, HI-VQE enables calculations within active spaces as large as (24e,22o), requiring 44 qubits-well beyond the reach of classical CASCI and VQE. This capability provides a systematic pathway for incorporating increasing numbers of electrons into quantum treatment, thereby approaching exact molecular energies. Importantly, both SQD and HI-VQE exhibit robustness against hardware noise, a critical improvement over earlier approaches. By enabling quantum simulations of molecular systems previously deemed intractable, SQD and HI-VQE offer a realistic route toward practical quantum advantage in computational chemistry. The comparison between HI-VQE and SQD shows that optimizing circuit parameters is crucial for accurate simulation.

Abstract: Flavins are the chromophores in several blue-light-sensitive photoreceptor proteins and act as redox cofactors in many enzymes relevant for biological processes. Despite their biological relevance and numerous, detailed optical investigations of their photophysical properties, the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of their elementary optical excitations are not yet fully known. Here, we use ultrafast coherent vibrational spectroscopy with 10-fs time resolution in the 450-nm spectral range to study their excited state coherent vibrational dynamics. We observe that coherent wavepacket motion along high-frequency C-C stretching modes with ~ 20-fs period is rapidly damped on a 20-fs timescale. In contrast, coherent motion along several low-frequency modes persists much longer. We attribute this to a mode-selective intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution driven by nonadiabatic couplings between the optical bright state and a close-lying dark electronic state, in accordance with model calculations. Our results may be of relevance for the formation of long-lived radical pair states in magnetic-field sensitive proteins.

Abstract: The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) is a key quantity for describing and predicting intermolecular and ion-molecule interactions. Here, we assess the ability of machine-learning (ML) models to infer the MEP, based on the equivariant graph-convolutional neural network architecture PiNet2 and trained on dipole and quadrupole moments. For the established QM9 dataset, we find that including the quadrupole contribution in the ML models substantially improves their ability to recover the MEP compared to dipole-only models. This trend is confirmed on the SPICE dataset, which spans a much broader region of organic chemical space. Together, this study underscores the central role of the quadrupole moment as a fitting target for ML models aiming at rapid access to the MEP.

Abstract: We demonstrate for the specific case of $C_{3v}$ how the direct-product decomposition scheme for the treatment of symmetry in coupled-cluster (CC) calculations can be extended to non-Abelian point groups. We show that for the two-electron integrals and CC amplitudes a block structure can be obtained by resolving the reducible products of two irreducible representations into their irreducible representations. To deal with the necessary resorts of the ordering of the two-electron integrals and amplitudes, spin-adaptation, and the O(M$^5$) contractions (with M as the number of basis functions) of a CC calculation, we suggest a strategy that uses both the reduced and non-reduced representation of the corresponding quantities and switches back and forth between them. While the reduced representations are the ones used in the O(M$^6$) contractions, the other steps are better carried out in the non-reduced representation. Our pilot implementation of the CC singles and doubles method confirms in test calculations for NH$_3$ and PH$_3$ using different basis sets that significant savings (of more than 20 compared to treatments without symmetry and about 5 compared to treatments using $C_s$ symmetry) are possible and suggest that the exploitation of non-Abelian symmetry would render CC computations on large highly symmetric molecules possible

Abstract: Weyl degeneracies in spectra of magnetoplasma waves enable nonreciprocal energy flow and topologically protected modes, yet conventional materials require impractical magnetic fields to operate. Developing an effective Hamiltonian framework for magnetic Weyl semimetals, we show that these systems overcome the limit, hosting Weyl magnetoplasma physics at zero field due to their giant intrinsic anomalous Hall response. The resulting topology supports nonreciprocal modes localized at magnetic domain walls, including a pair of topological "Fermi-arc-like modes and additional bound states. These effects are fully developed across a broad THz window, and we propose feasible experimental routes for their detection.

Abstract: We report microwave spectroscopy of Josephson junctions chains made from an epitaxial Al/InAs heterostructure. The chains exhibit superinductance, with characteristic wave impedance exceeding $R_{Q} = \hbar/(2e)^{2}$. The planar nature of the junctions results in a large plasma frequency, with no measurable deviations from ideal dispersion up to $12~\mathrm{GHz}$. Internal quality factors decrease sharply with frequency, which we describe with a simple loss model. The possibility of a loss mechanism intrinsic to the superconductor-semiconductor junction is considered.

Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems host exotic transport regimes that are distinct from those found in periodic or disordered lattices. In this work, we study quantum transport in the Aubry-André-Harper lattice in a two-terminal setup coupled to zero-temperature reservoirs, where the conductance is evaluated via the nonequilibrium Green's function method. In the extended phase, we uncover a universal subdiffusive transport when the bath chemical potential aligns with the band edges. Specifically, the typical conductance displays a scaling of $\mathcal{G}_{\text{typ}}\sim L^{-2}$ with system size $L$. We attribute this behavior to the emergence of an exceptional point (Jordan normal form) in the transfer matrix in the thermodynamic limit. In the localized phase, the conductance shows exponential decay governed by the Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, in the critical phase, we identify pronounced log-periodic oscillations of the conductance as a function of system size, arising from the discrete scale invariance inherent to the singular-continuous spectrum. We further extend our analysis to the generalized Aubry-André-Harper model and provide numerical evidence suggesting that the exact mobility edge resides within a finite spectral gap. This results in a counter-intuitive exponential suppression of conductance precisely at the mobility edge. Our work highlights the distinct transport behaviors in quasiperiodic systems and elucidates how they are rigorously dictated by the underlying local spectral structure.

Abstract: Bright electroluminescence (EL) from dopant-free ambipolar lateral p-n junctions in GaAs/AlGaAs single heterointerface (SH) heterostructures is used to probe neutral free excitons arising from two-dimensional electron and hole gases (2DEGs and 2DHGs). The EL spectra reveal both the heavy-hole neutral free exciton (X$^0$) and the high-energy free exciton of the H band (HE). A combination of transition energies, lifetimes, spatial emission profiles, and temperature dependences points to a predominantly two-dimensional character for these excitons at the SH. For X$^0$, the EL peak energies (1515.5-1515.7 meV) lie slightly above the corresponding bulk GaAs photoluminescence (PL) line at 1515.3 meV, while time-resolved measurements yield markedly shorter lifetimes for EL than for PL (337 ps vs. 1610 ps), consistent with recombination in a confined interfacial layer. The HE exciton exhibits a Stark blueshift under forward bias below threshold, and its energies and lifetimes (down to 575 ps) are tuned by the topgate voltage; above threshold, HE emission is quenched in favor of X$^0$. Finally, the tidal effect $-$ a form of pulsed EL generated by swapping the topgate voltage polarity in ambipolar field-effect transistors $-$ produces an X$^0$ line at the same energy as in the lateral p-n junction and reproduces the characteristic nonmonotonic frequency dependence of the brightness previously observed in quantum-well heterostructures, again indicating a 2D-like origin. Taken together, these results show electrically generated and controllable 2D-like excitons (HE and X$^0$), thereby bridging 2D exciton physics and 2DEG/2DHG platforms in dopant-free GaAs/AlGaAs SH devices.

Abstract: We address the spatially nonlocal dielectric functions of graphene at any frequency derived starting fromthe first principles of thermal quantum field theory using the formalism of the polarization tensor. After a brief review of this formalism, the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions are considered at any relationship between the frequency and the wave vector. The analytic properties of their real and imaginary parts are investigated at low and high frequencies. Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves.

TL;DR: The study examines plasmon dynamics in mono- and bi-layer graphene using terahertz spacetime metrology, finding enhanced Drude weight at ultra-low carrier densities, attributed to pseudospin dynamics in Dirac fermions, breaking Galilean invariance and influencing collective excitations in quantum materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation stems from exploring plasmon dynamics in two-dimensional materials such as graphene, employing advanced metrology techniques to better understand the effects of interactions and pseudospin structures on collective excitations.

Method: The method involves terahertz spacetime metrology to measure plasmon dynamics in both mono- and bilayer graphene, analyzing the results through theoretical modeling of pseudospin effects in multi-layered graphene systems.

Result: The key finding is that the experimentally measured Drude weight systematically exceeds theoretical predictions based on non-interacting systems, particularly at ultra-low carrier densities. This observation is linked to pseudospin dynamics in Dirac fermions within the multi-layer graphene systems, indicating a breakdown of Galilean invariance.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the pseudospin structure of the single-particle electronic wavefunction directly governs collective excitations, with implications for a broader class of quantum materials beyond graphene.

Abstract: Plasmons are collective oscillations of mobile electrons. Using terahertz spacetime metrology, we probe plasmon dynamics of mono- and bi-layer graphene. In both systems, the experimentally measured Drude weight systematically exceeds the prediction based on non-interacting electronic system. This enhancement is most pronounced at ultra-low carrier densities. We attribute the observed deviation to pseudospin dynamics of the Dirac fermions in multi-layer graphene, which leads to a breakdown of Galilean invariance. Our results establish that pseudospin structure of the single-particle electronic wave function can directly govern collective excitations, with implications that extend beyond graphene to a broad class of quantum materials.

Abstract: Advances in the next generation of mesoscopic electronics require an understanding of topological phases in inhomogeneous media and the principles that govern them. Motivated by the nature of motifs available in printable conducting inks, we introduce and study quantum transport in a minimal model that describes a bundle of one-dimensional metallic wires that are randomly interconnected by semiconducting chains. Each of these interconnects is represented by a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, which can reside in either a trivial or a topological phase. Using a tight-binding approach, we show that such a system can transit from an insulating phase to a robust metallic phase as the interconnects undergo a transition from a trivial to a topological phase. In the latter, despite the random interconnectedness, the metal evades Anderson localization and exhibits a ballistic conductance that scales linearly with the number of wires. We show that this behavior originates from hopping renormalization in the wire network. The zero-energy modes of the topological interconnects act as effective random dimers, giving rise to an energy-dependent localization length that diverges as $\sim 1/E^2$. Our work establishes that random networks provide a yet-unexplored platform to host intriguing phases of topological quantum matter.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the fabrication and characterization of nanomechanical resonators made from two-dimensional polyaramides (2DPA-1), which are exceptionally thin and strong. The resonators were created by transferring nanofilms of 2DPA-1 onto chips with microwells, and their mechanical properties were studied under different conditions, including the presence of gas. The results suggest that 2DPA-1 has promising applications in molecular-scale polymeric NEMS with high strength, low density, and processability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to explore the potential of two-dimensional polyaramides as a material for nanoscale mechanical devices, specifically nanomechanical resonators, which have applications in sensing, energy harvesting, and other nanoscale technologies.

Method: The researchers fabricated 2DPA-1 nanomechanical resonators by transferring nanofilms of 2DPA-1 onto chips etched with circular microwells. They characterized the thermal resonances of these resonators under different conditions, including the presence or absence of residual gas inside the microwells. The mechanical properties were analyzed using tensioned plate theory in the absence of gas and by considering the effects of adhesion, bulging, and slack in the presence of gas.

Result: The results showed that in the absence of gas, the eigenfrequencies of the resonators align well with the predictions from tensioned plate theory, allowing accurate determination of the Young's modulus and tension of the 2DPA-1 nanofilms. When gas was present, the mechanical resonances were modified due to the physical effects of gas adhesion, bulging, and slack in the system. The fabrication process and the mechanical characterization demonstrated the feasibility of using 2DPA-1 for creating high-performance molecular-scale polymeric NEMS with unique mechanical properties.

Conclusion: This study represents a significant advancement in the development of nanoscale mechanical resonators from 2D materials. The successful fabrication and characterization of 2DPA-1 nanomechanical resonators suggest broad applications in nanoscale electromechanical systems, emphasizing their potential in nanosensing, nanoelectronics, and other advanced nanomechanical devices.

Abstract: Two-dimensional polyaramids exhibit strong hydrogen bonding to create molecularly thin nanosheets analogous to graphene. Here, we report the first nanomechanical resonators made out of a two-dimensional polyaramid, 2DPA-1, with thicknesses as small as 8 nm. To fabricate these molecular-scale resonators, we transferred nanofilms of 2DPA-1 onto chips with previously etched arrays of circular microwells. We then characterized the thermal resonances of these resonators under different conditions. When there is no residual gas inside the 2DPA-1-covered microwells, the eigenfrequencies are well-described by a tensioned plate theory, providing the Young's modulus and tension of the 2DPA-1 nanofilms. With gas present, the nanofilms bulge up and mechanical resonances are modified due to the adhesion, bulging and slack present in the system. The fabrication and mechanical characterization of these first 2DPA-1 nanomechanical resonators represent a convincing path toward molecular-scale polymeric NEMS with high mechanical strength, low density, and synthetic processability.

Abstract: The dynamic motion of topological defects in magnets induces an emergent electric field, as exemplified by the continuous flow of skyrmion vortices. However, the electrodynamics underlying this emergent field remains poorly understood. In this context, magnetic domain walls - one dimensional topological defects with two collective modes, sliding and spin tilt - offer a promising platform for exploration. Here, we demonstrate that the dissipative motion of domain walls under oscillatory current excitation generates an emergent electric field. We image domain patterns and quantify domain wall length under applied magnetic fields in mesoscopic devices based on the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. These devices exhibit exceptionally strong domain wall scattering and a pronounced emergent electric field, observed in the imaginary component of the complex impedance. Spin dynamics simulations reveal that domain wall sliding dominates over spin tilting, where the phase delay of the domain wall motion with respect to the driving force impacts the emergent electric field. Our findings establish domain-wall dynamics as a platform for studying emergent electromagnetic fields and motivate further investigations on the coupled motion of magnetic solitons and conduction electrons.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了不依赖模型的实验手段，用于测量非阿贝尔Berry曲率和量子度量。

Abstract: Extracting the complete quantum geometric and topological character of Bloch wavefunctions from experiments remains a challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we resolve this by introducing the "wavefunction form factor" (WFF) matrix, a quantity directly constructible from intensities in momentum- and energy-resolved spectroscopies like ARPES and INS. We demonstrate that band topology is encoded in "spectral nodes" -- momentum-space points where the WFF determinant vanishes, providing a direct readout of topological invariants via a topological selection rule. Furthermore, when the number of independent probes exceeds the number of the target bands, our framework yields an effective band projector. This enables the determination of Wilson loop spectra and the extraction of an effective quantum geometric tensor, providing a model-independent measurement of the non-Abelian Berry curvature and quantum metric as resolved by the experimental probes.

Conclusion: 长程相互作用与短程相互作用的综合影响下，量子气体表现出不同的相态和结构特性，构造的 Jastrow 波函数提供了高效的多体 ansatz，帮助理解复杂量子体系的相变动力学。

Abstract: We study one-dimensional quantum gases in continuous space with cavity-mediated infinite-range interactions using variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods. Starting from the exact two-body solution, we construct a non-translationally invariant Jastrow wavefunction that accurately captures the spatial structure induced by the cavity field and provides an efficient many-body ansatz for both bosonic and fermionic systems. We analize properties of three characteristic quantum systems, subject to long-range interactions: (i) ideal Bose gas (ii) interacting Bose gas (iii) ideal Fermi gas. In the absence of short-range interactions, we identify a crossover from a stable, weakly modulated phase realized for repulsive interactions to a delocalized bound state for attractive interactions, marked by clustering, loss of superfluidity, and the absence of a thermodynamic limit. Introducing short-range repulsion, either through contact interactions or fermionic statistics, leads to the formation of a mesoscopic gas-like regime that disappears in the thermodynamic limit. A qualitative phase diagram is proposed to illustrate the combined effects of short- and long-range interactions, highlighting the emergence of distinct regimes with characteristic structural properties.

Abstract: The pursuit of unprecedented sensitivity in quantum enhanced metrology has spurred interest in non-equilibrium quantum phases of matter and their symmetry breaking. In particular, criticality-enhanced metrology through time-translation symmetry breaking in many-body systems, a distinct paradigm compared to spatial symmetry breaking, is a field still in its infancy. Here, we have investigated the enhanced sensing at the boundary of a continuous time-crystal (CTC) phase in a driven Rydberg atomic gas. By mapping the full phase diagram, we identify the parameter-dependent phase boundary where the time-translation symmetry is broken. This allows us to use a single setup for measuring multiple parameters, in particular frequency and amplitude of a microwave field. By increasing the microwave field amplitude, we first observe a phase transition from a thermal phase to a CTC phase, followed by a second transition into a distinct CTC state, characterized by a different oscillation frequency. Furthermore, we reveal the precise relationship between the CTC phase boundary and the scanning rate, displaying enhanced precision beyond the Standard Quantum Limit. This work not only provides a promising paradigm rooted in the critical properties of time crystals, but also advances a method for multi-parameter sensing in non-equilibrium quantum phases.

Abstract: Experiments on Bose-Einstein condensates at finite temperature typically extract the system parameters, such as temperature, atom number, and condensed fraction from time-of-flight images taken after a free expansion time. This paper systematically examines the effect of repulsive interactions between the condensed and thermal atoms in partially condensed clouds on the expansion profile of the thermal cloud. An analytical expression for the expansion can be obtained only if the interactions between the Bose-Einstein condensate and thermal atoms are neglected, resulting in a Bose-enhanced distribution for the thermal component. Here, the deformation of the cloud due to interactions and the effects on estimated parameters are investigated by simulating the expansion using a ballistic approximation. By fitting the simulated expansion profiles with a Bose-enhanced distribution, the errors of using such a fit are estimated, and the results are explained phenomenologically. The simulation was also used as a fitting function for experimental data, showing better agreement of the extracted condensed fraction with the semi-ideal model than results from a Bose-enhanced fit.

Abstract: Using the transport-of-intensity approach for free-space optical propagation in the paraxial regime, we show that diffraction is fundamentally related to the Fisher information associated with models of the transverse intensity distribution. By interpreting intensity as a probability density, we show that a) free-space diffraction will always act to flatten the intensity distribution as the beam propagates, and consequently b) diffraction will monotonically minimize the Fisher Information with respect to any parameterization of the intensity distribution model that depends on propagation distance.

Abstract: Partially coherent light is typically studied in the context of freely propagating continuous fields. Recent developments have indicated the existence of a `coherence advantage' in multimode optical communications, where partially coherent light outperforms coherent light. However, exploiting partial coherence in such applications requires manipulating multimode field coherence in programmable on-chip platforms. We present here the first example of on-chip synthesis and characterization of two-mode optical fields in an integrated on-chip hexagonal mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Starting with incoherent two-mode light, we adjust the degree of coherence on the chip with non-unitary transformations, construct $2\times2$ unitary transformations to synthesize prescribed coherence matrices, and reconstruct the coherence matrices via measurements of the spatial Stokes parameters. These results indicate the possibility of deploying programmable photonics for producing large-dimensional structured partially coherent light for applications in communications, cryptography, sensing, and spectroscopy.

Abstract: Recent research in nanophotonics for scintillation-based imaging has demonstrated promising improvements in scintillator performance. In parallel, advances in nanophotonics have enabled wavefront control through metasurfaces, a capability that has transformed fields such as microscopy by allowing tailored control of optical propagation. This naturally raises the following question, which we address in this perspective: can wavefront-control strategies be leveraged to improve scintillation-based imaging? To answer this question, we explore nanophotonic- and metasurface-enabled wavefront control in scintillators to mitigate image blurring arising from their intrinsically diffuse light emission. While depth-of-field extension in scintillation faces fundamental limitations absent in microscopy, this approach reveals promising avenues, including stacked scintillators, selective spatial-frequency enhancement, and X-ray energy-dependent imaging. These results clarify the key distinctions in adapting wavefront engineering to scintillation and its potential to enable tailored detection strategies.

Abstract: We introduce the variable coherence model (VCM) for simulating free-electron laser (FEL) pulses generated through self-amplified spontaneous emission. Building on the established partial coherence model of [T. Pfeifer et. al, Opt. Lett. 35, 3441 (2010)], we demonstrate that the implementation of a variable coherence width allows for continuous control over the pulses' characteristic noise, while keeping the average pulse parameters such as the bandwidth fixed. We demonstrate this through systematic statistical analyses of the intensity and number of sub-pulses in VCM pulses, in both time and frequency. In particular, we analyze how the sub-pulse statistics are affected by the coherence width parameter. We perform our analyses across three distinct regimes of FEL parameters and demonstrate how the VCM can generate pulses that range from maximally random to fully coherent. Finally, we illustrate the effect of the VCM variable coherence width on an absorption simulation.

Abstract: Interfering deep ultraviolet (DUV) lasers can induce substantial density modulations in an ozone-doped gas flow via photochemical reactions, creating volume diffraction gratings. These transient optics are immune to target debris and shrapnel and feature orders-of-magnitude higher damage thresholds than conventional solid optics, providing a promising method for efficiently manipulating high-energy lasers. In this work, we describe gas gratings that can efficiently diffract probe beams across a variety of wavelengths and pulse durations, ranging from deep ultraviolet to near-infrared and from nanosecond to femtosecond, achieving a full beam diffraction efficiency up to 99% while preserving the focusability and wavefront quality. In addition, we present a comprehensive characterization of the performance of the gas gratings under various experimental conditions, including imprint fluence, gas composition, and grating geometries, showing significant enhancement of this process with the addition of carbon dioxide. We also demonstrate stable performance over hours of operation. Our results validate a previously developed theoretical model and suggest optimal parameters to efficiently scale gas gratings to high-energy applications.

Abstract: Energy conservation imposes fundamental bounds on the polarizabilities of nanoparticles (NPs). While such bounds are well established for isotropic and bianisotropic NPs, they remain unexplored for magneto-optical NPs. Here, we derive the exact energy-conservation law governing the electric and magnetic dipolar response of axially symmetric magneto-optical NPs under general illumination conditions and arbitrary external magnetic fields. Two central results follow from energy conservation: (i) purely magneto-optical scattering, where the non-magnetic polarizability vanishes, is fundamentally forbidden, and (ii) strong magneto-optical scattering regimes, in which the magneto-optical polarizability dominates, are intriguingly allowed.

Abstract: The accurate identification of historical restoration traces and material degradation is essential for the scientific preservation of ancient bronzes. In this study, the prestigious FUHAO bronze artifact (late Shang period, 13th-11th century BCE) was non-destructively examined using pulsed thermal imaging (PT). By combining single- and double-layer heat conduction models with Thermal Tomography (TT), this approach allowed for precise spatial localization of repair crevices, patches, and filler materials, while also distinguishing restorative interventions from the original bronze substrate. The artifact was revealed to have been assembled from multiple fragments, exhibiting uneven surface corrosion and clear evidence of prior conservation. The results not only provide direct insights for conservation strategy and historical interpretation but also demonstrate the capability of pulsed thermal imaging as an effective diagnostic tool for the integrated surface and subsurface assessment of cultural heritage objects.

Abstract: Quantum bianisotropy and chirality are fundamental concepts in light matter interaction that describe how materials with broken symmetries respond to electromagnetic fields at the level of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. In quantum bianisotropy, magnetoelectric (ME) energy plays a critical role in mediating and enhancing light matter interactions. This concept is essential for bridging the gap between classical electromagnetics (where bianisotropy often involves field nonlocality) and quantum mechanics in metamaterials. The precise manipulation of a quantum emitter's properties at a subwavelength scale is due to near fields, which effectively function as a tunable environment. We show that the ME near field, interpreted as a structure combining the effect of bianisotropy (chirality) with a quantum atmosphere, is a nonMaxwellian field with spacetime symmetry breaking. Quantum ME fields arise from the dynamic modulation and topological coupling of magnetization and electric polarization within ME meta atoms, specific subwavelength structural elements with magnetic and dielectric subsystems in magnetic insulators.

Abstract: Optical manipulation of micro- and nanoparticles near surfaces is fundamental for applications in sensing and microfluidics, yet controlling particle-surface interactions remains challenging. Here we experimentally investigate light-induced forces on dielectric particles near epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterial surfaces using photonic force microscopy. By illuminating trapped particles with tunable visible light, we observe a wavelength-dependent repulsive force unique to ENZ surfaces, contrasting with the attractive forces near dielectric or metallic substrates. This repulsion peaks near the ENZ frequency and may be attributed to combined optical ENZ effects and thermophoretic forces. Our findings demonstrate that ENZ metamaterials can induce stable levitation of particles via light-driven forces, offering a novel mechanism for contactless manipulation in microfluidic environments. This work advances understanding of light-matter interactions at ENZ interfaces and suggests potential for ENZ-based optical control of micro- and nanoscale objects, with potential applications in micro- and nanofluidic environments.

Motivation: To enable real-time high-resolution imaging with large data sets.

Result: Data reduced by 8 times: 42 GB to 5.3 GB, 7 min to 55 s, 4 hr to 30 min.

Conclusion: This approach optimizes DOCT imaging for high-throughput applications.

Abstract: A neural-network (NN)-based method for high-speed, high-definition dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) using full-field swept-source optical coherence microscopy (FF-SS-OCM) is demonstrated. FF-SS-OCM provides high-definition OCT images, but, particularly in DOCT imaging, it results in a significant enlargement of the data size and subsequently long data streaming and processing time, which prevents high-throughput imaging. We address this issue by introducing an NN-based DOCT method that generates high-definition logarithmic intensity variance (LIV) -based DOCT images from only four OCT volumes, whereas the conventional method required 32 volumes. The NN model successfully generates an LIV image that is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the LIV image computed from 32 volumes. This approach significantly reduces data size, transfer time, and processing time for DOCT imaging by a factor of eight. Specifically, these were reduced from 42 GB to 5.3 GB, 7 min to 55 s, and 4 hours to 30 min, respectively.

Abstract: Spectrally engineered multifrequency nanolasers are highly desirable for on-chip photonics, multiplexed biosensing, and display technologies; yet, achieving them within a single compact platform remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate multimode lasing from symmetry-broken TiO2 metasurfaces integrated with an SU8 slab waveguide containing Rhodamine 6G. By co-engineering guided-mode resonances, surface lattice resonances near Rayleigh anomalies, and quasi-bound states in the continuum, we realize complementary high-Q feedback pathways that overlap with the gain spectrum. The direction of the lasing emission is tailored through outcoupling via second-order Bragg diffraction and Rayleigh anomaly conditions, supporting both normal and oblique emission. Experiments reveal discrete lasing outputs across ~100 nm bandwidth (548-648 nm), spanning nearly the full Rhodamine 6G emission band, with thresholds as low as ~7 nJ per pulse (35.7 uJ/cm^2) and up to four concurrent lasing peaks from a single device. These results establish a metasurface-dye platform for multifrequency and angle-selective lasing, opening new opportunities for compact, multifunctional nanophotonic sources.

Abstract: We establish a majorization-based theory for bounding observables of waves with varied coherence. For any measurement, exact bounds are attained by the maximal and minimal elements in the set of input coherence spectra. The set's supremum and infimum, which may lie outside the set, provide optimal universal bounds: any alternative spectrum yielding universal bounds produces weaker constraints. We present an algorithm to compute the supremum and infimum, and prove that they lie either at singular boundary points or strictly outside the set of coherence spectra.

Conclusion: This work lays the foundation for compact D-shaped superconducting magnets used in advanced fusion energy systems.

Abstract: High-temperature technical superconductors are potential candidates for compact and high-field tokamak magnets. The demand for higher fusion power can be met with an on-axis high magnetic field due to toroidal magnets. An R&D activity has been initiated at the Institute for Plasma Research, India, to develop a compact D-shaped superconducting magnet utilizing REBCO high-temperature superconducting tapes. Under this initiative, a toroidal configuration with a major radius of 0.42 m, consisting of eight D-shaped, four poloidal field, and a central solenoid high-temperature superconducting magnets producing an on-axis toroidal magnetic field of 0.23 T has been conceptualized. The fabrication feasibility of a D-shaped coil for this toroidal configuration also envisaged using stacked high-temperature superconducting cable. In this paper, we report the design of a compact D-shaped coil, the fabrication of a long length HTS cable, a winding pack, and its integration with a cryogenic casing and vacuum enclosure. The winding pack terminations, joints, its interfacing with the power supply, and performance testing are also reported in this paper.

Abstract: In this paper we extend a previous analysis of a newly conceived technique based on active interrogation of tectonic stress evolution in regions hosting active seismogenic faults. The aim is to monitor and detect stable and reliable precursor signals on an adequate time scale, well before an earthquake event, that can play a crucial role in activating alarms for civil protection systems. The precursor signal relies on continuous measurements of the time evolution of tectonic stress, obtained by interrogating underground, with a high energy collimated muon beam, the piezoelectric fabrics present in quartz rich granite like rocks surrounding a known seismogenic fault in the Earth crust. Beam propagation through the rock across the active fault conveys to a detector at the exit of the traversal information on the amplitude of the piezoelectric field, which scales with the tectonic stress applied to quartz crystals embedded in the rock. The system, named ERMES (Earthquake Reconnaissance using Muon beam Evolution in Silicon dioxide), differs from other techniques under study detecting electromagnetic signals generated by piezoelectricity outside the Earth crust, as it probes piezoelectric effects directly inside the source region of the associated electromagnetic field, namely the near field within quartz crystals rather than the far field in open space. We present a focused analysis of muon beam manipulation after rock traversal and before detection using a newly conceived muonic lens, and we explore the maximum rock penetration capability of a high energy muon beam, reaching about 3 km of rock thickness for a 10 TeV beam. Owing to the peculiarity of muon propagation through such kilometer scale targets, we cross checked previous FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations with Geant4 to clarify the secondary muons role generated by primary muon interactions in solid matter over long propagation lengths.

TL;DR: This paper investigates systematic errors in measuring transverse emittance using slit-profiler methods in photo injectors, providing a method to correct for these errors to improve measurement accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate measurement of transverse emittance is crucial for evaluating beam quality and ensuring the performance of particle accelerator facilities.

Method: The researchers analyze systematic errors caused by slit size, beamlet imaging, and residual space charge, then validate their findings through simulations and experiments at the DESY Photo Injector Test facility.

Result: Corrected measurement techniques, incorporating slit-screen corrections, significantly improve the accuracy of emittance measurements in strongly coupled phase spaces.

Conclusion: By implementing slit-screen corrections based on simulations and real-world measurements, the accuracy of transverse emittance measurements can be enhanced, leading to better overall accelerator performance.

Abstract: In photo injectors, the transverse emittance is one of the key measures of beam quality as it defines the possible performance of the whole facility. As such it is important to measure the emittance in photo injectors and ensure the accuracy of these measurements. While there are many different methods of measuring the emittance, this paper focuses on quantifying the systematic errors present in transverse phase space measurements taken with slit-profiler methods, i.e. scanning a narrow slit over the beam and continually measuring the passed beamlets' divergence with a downstream profiler. The measurement errors include effects of the slit size, beamlet imaging, and residual space charge. While these effects are generally small, they can have significant impact on the measured emittance when the 2D phase space is strongly coupled. The systematic effects studied and corrections are demonstrated with simulations and measurements from the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) using a slit-screen emittance scanner.

Abstract: To increase the voltage multiplication factor in a small-sized direct-acting electron accelerator DIN-2K with an inductive energy storage and a plasma opening switch, it is necessary to ensure an increase in the rate of change of the current and its amplitude during the POS opening for the purpose of obtaining an explosive electron emission with the formation of an electron beam and a virtual cathode. However, the opening process depends on many electrical parameters of the plant, and it re-quires determining their joint and individual effect on its dynamics. The purpose of this research is to study and determine the effects of electrical parameters, including those of the discharge voltages of the entire electrical circuit of the accelerator on the dynamics of the plasma opening switch, in particular opening speed, current amplitudes, and opening time, as well as to give recommendations on optimizing the operation of accelerators of this type and highlight possible ways to increase the voltage multiplication factor. Methodology. A method for determining the induced voltage according to experimental current oscillograms has been proposed. The methodology was verified by the coincidence of its data with the results of measurements by a capacitive voltage divider with the data spread of less than 20%. Scientific novelty. The rates of change in the current at the plasma switch opening stage were determined depending on the main electrical parameters of the DIN-2K accelerator. The diagnostics of the voltage induced during the POS opening were provided using no capacitive voltage divider in the internal volume of the accelerator, which enabled the removal of some diagnostic tools from the working volume of the chamber. Practical significance.

Abstract: A new interferometer topology for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection was recently proposed in [Zhang et al. Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)]. The design is based on an L-shaped optical cavity pumped through a Sagnac-like vortex. We report a tabletop experiment that characterizes the interferometer's optical response near DC. When the laser frequency is locked to the resonance of the L-shaped cavity, we observe that the cavity input coupler becomes effectively transparent, yielding a simple Michelson-like response. Moreover, the Sagnac vortex separates into upper and lower paths, which behave as two independent pumping paths driving the cavity. These observations are in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results provide an intuitive physical picture of this interferometer topology and offer insight into its lock acquisition strategy.

Abstract: Advances in fabrication techniques and high-performance electronics have facilitated the development of fine-pitch Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs). Earlier experimental and simulation findings suggest that these reduced-pitch GEMs can outperform the standard configuration in terms of effective gain, collection efficiency, and position resolution. However, a noticeable fraction of avalanche electrons is lost within the GEM systems, resulting in a degradation of charge collection efficiency. Therefore, a comprehensive simulation-based study is essential to provide deeper insights into the extent of degradation and its contributing factors. In this context, we employ ANSYS and Garfield++ to model the Triple GEM detectors with reduced pitch sizes of 90 and 60 $μ$m, and perform a comparative performance analysis with the standard configuration (pitch size: 140 $μ$m). At first, the simulation framework is validated by comparing the results of the standard configuration with available experimental data and previously reported simulation outcomes. Despite the characteristic gain offset, the framework remains physically consistent and reliable in capturing microscopic avalanche dynamics, reproducing the experimental trend. Following validation, we investigate electron losses at the metal electrodes and within the Kapton holes, electron transmission through the transfer and induction regions, electron diffusion on the induction electrode, and the overall collection efficiency. These parameters are analyzed as functions of GEM potential, outer hole diameter, inner hole diameter, Kapton thickness, metal thickness, and gas composition, thereby offering insights for designing efficient GEM detectors.

Abstract: Interface circuits are the key components that enable the hybrid integration of superconductor and semiconductor digital electronics. The design requirements of superconductor-semiconductor interface circuits vary depending on the application, such as high-performance classical computing, superconducting quantum computing, and digital signal processing. In this survey, various interface circuits are categorized based on the working principle and structure. The superconducting output drivers are explored, which are capable of converting and amplifying, e.g., single flux quantum (SFQ) voltage pulses, to voltage levels that semiconductor circuits can process. Several trade-offs between circuit- and system-level design parameters are examined. Accordingly, parameters such as the data rate, output voltage, power dissipation, layout area, thermal/heat load of cryogenic cables, and bit-error rate are considered.

TL;DR: Mo-Si multilayer mirrors face challenges in extreme ultraviolet lithography due to nanoscale interference and heat accumulation, limiting reflectivity and stability. A new model combining electromagnetic-thermal coupling manages interference and heat dissipation, revealing trade-offs between increased reflectivity and temperature rise. The model also identifies effects like axial temperature gradients and delayed heating, and establishes scaling laws for thermal confinement and mirror lifetime. The model supports the co-design of EUV mirrors under pulsed irradiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper seems to tackle a critical problem in extreme ultraviolet lithography, which is a cutting-edge area in semiconductor manufacturing and microchip production. The challenges involve optimizing mirrors for precise and stable nanoscale operations while managing heat issues.

Method: The approach involves developing an analytical electromagnetic-thermal coupling model, building on the transfer-matrix method for interference effects and transient heat conduction for thermal management. It integrates these to understand the trade-offs between reflectivity and temperature rise, considering factors like interfacial thermal resistance and compaction kinetics.

Result: The model reveals a fundamental trade-off between increased multilayer periods enhancing reflectivity and simultaneously raising temperatures due to impeded heat dissipation. It also highlights additional effects such as pronounced axial temperature gradients and a post-pulse downward migration of the heat-flux maximum, providing deeper insights into the thermal-optical behavior of mirrors. The model enables systematic analysis to establish scaling laws connecting factors like interfacial thermal resistance, beam size, and incident energy density to thermal confinement and temperature rise. By incorporating interfacial compaction kinetics, the model can quantitatively assess the lifetime of mirrors. This work provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for the co-design of multilayer nanostructures, including EUV mirrors, under pulsed irradiation conditions across a wide spectral range.

Conclusion: This paper presents a detailed solution to the challenges faced by Mo-Si multilayer mirrors in extreme ultraviolet lithography. By integrating electromagnetic and thermal effects, the model offers a balanced approach to optimizing reflectivity while managing temperature rise, which is essential for the durability and performance of EUV mirrors under pulsed irradiation. The insights from this model will be valuable for the design and manufacturing of high-performance EUV mirrors in semiconductor manufacturing.

Abstract: Mo-Si multilayer mirrors are central to extreme ultraviolet lithography, where nanoscale optical interference and heat accumulation together constrain reflectivity and operational stability. Here we develop an analytical electromagnetic-thermal coupling model that directly links transfer-matrix-based interference-controlled energy deposition with transient heat conduction in EUV-irradiated multilayers. The model reveals a fundamental trade-off whereby increasing the multilayer period number enhances reflectivity but simultaneously elevates temperature by impeding heat dissipation. Interference-driven volumetric absorption further gives rise to pronounced axial temperature gradients and a post-pulse downward migration of the heat-flux maximum, a delayed-heating effect inaccessible to conventional surface-flux-based models. Systematic analysis establishes scaling laws connecting interfacial thermal resistance, beam size, and incident energy density to thermal confinement and temperature rise. By incorporating interfacial compaction kinetics, the model enables a quantitative assessment of mirror lifetime. This work offers a theoretical tool for thermal-optical co-design of multilayer nanostructures including EUV mirrors under pulsed irradiation across a wide spectral range.

Abstract: Reduced-order quadrature (ROQ) is commonly used to speed up parameter estimation in gravitational wave astronomy; however, the construction of ROQ bases can be computationally costly, particularly for longer duration signals. We propose a modified construction strategy based on PyROQ that accelerates this process by performing the basis search using multiband waveforms, without compromising the desired likelihood speed and accuracy. We use this altered method to construct a set of ROQs in the sub-solar mass range using the \texttt{IMRPhenomXAS\_NRTidalV3} waveform. We find a 20\% to 30\% decrease in basis size and a $\sim 10$ times decrease in basis construction time. We verify the altered method preserves the likelihood accuracy and mantains consitent parameter estimation results.

Abstract: In this work, we describe optically inspired models for unitary black hole (BH) evaporation. The goal of these models are (i) to be operationally simple, (ii) approximately preserve the thermal nature of the emitted Hawking Radiation (HR), and (iii) attempt to reproduce the Page Curve that purports that information flows forth from the BH when it has evaporated to approximately half its initial mass. We concentrate on modeling the BH as a single mode squeezed state successively interacting, by means of beam splitters and squeezers, with vacuum modes near the horizon, giving rise to entangled pairs representing the external Hawking radiation and its partner particle inside the horizon. Since all states and operations are Gaussian throughout, we use a symplectic formalism to track the evolution of the composite system through the evolving means and variances of their quadrature operators. This allows us to easily compute correlations and entanglement between the BH and the HR, as well as calculate correlations between the BH at early and late times.

Abstract: We studied the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (KBR) spacetime, an exact rotating electrovacuum solution describing a black hole (BH) immersed in an intrinsic, uniform electromagnetic field. We analyze the behavior of charged particles in this geometry and find that the spacetime structure itself responds non-monotonically to the background magnetic field $B$. Specifically, both the event horizon and the static limit surface first expand as $B$ increases, reach a maximum size at an intermediate field strength, and then contract toward the extremal limit. Although the ergoregion itself shrinks monotonically with $B$, this structural feature gives rise to a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of the energy extraction efficiency on the magnetic field $B$, i.e., the efficiency initially rises, attains a maximum value, and subsequently falls as the extremal condition is approached. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic trends usually associated with magnetic enhancements in the Kerr geometry. We further explore an astrophysical application of the MPP by estimating the maximum energy of electrons escaping from the ergoregion of the KBR BH. Modeling neutron beta decay occurring near the event horizon, we derive an analytical expression for the energy gained by electrons accelerated by the magnetic field. Applying our results to the supermassive BH at the Galactic center, $\mathrm{SgrA}^*$, we find that electrons can be accelerated up to energies of $\sim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{eV}$ for realistic values of the spin and magnetic field. Although these energies exceed the observed upper range of cosmic-ray electrons, radiative losses such as synchrotron emission and inverse-Compton scattering can efficiently reduce them to the observed $\mathrm{TeV}$ scale.

Abstract: We explore the cosmological dynamics of a teleparallel Gauss-Bonnet gravity model defined by the torsion scalar $T$ and the torsion-based Gauss-Bonnet invariant $T_{\mathcal{G}}$, deriving modified Friedmann equations for a flat FLRW Universe and corresponding linear scalar perturbation equations. Using a numerical approach, we solve these equations for pressureless matter, predicting the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, incorporating late-time observations from Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon$^+$ with SH0ES, and DESI BAO (Data Release 1 and Data Release 2), constrains the model parameters, revealing that $f(T, T_{\mathcal{G}})$ mimics dark energy in the absence of a cosmological constant, presenting a viable alternative to $Λ$CDM paradigm. Stability is confirmed via scalar perturbation analysis of Hubble and matter density fluctuations, positioning $f(T, T_{\mathcal{G}})$ gravity as a robust framework to address cosmic acceleration challenges. The model yields a present-day effective equation of state $ω_{\mathrm{eff}}(z=0) \approx -0.664$ to \(-0.693\), consistent with observations, and partially alleviates the Hubble tension with $H_0$ estimates of 69 to 71.5\kms. These findings highlight the potential of $f(T, T_{\mathcal{G}})$ gravity to resolve fundamental cosmological puzzles while aligning with late-time observational data.

TL;DR: Waves in a gravitational field can exhibit wave-optics effects when their wavelength isn't much smaller than the scales of the gravitational lensing. The study focuses on a scalar wave described by the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetime, analyzing corrections to amplitude and phase beyond geometric optics using the Newman-Penrose formalism. The results show that wave effects depend on the presence of matter density, with corrections starting at different orders of the gravitational constant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding wave propagation in gravitational fields is crucial in various areas of physics, including quantum gravity, cosmology, and the study of black holes. This work contributes to this understanding by analyzing the specific effects of gravitational potential on scalar waves.

Method: The researchers used the Newman-Penrose formalism to solve the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetime, considering the corrections to the wave's amplitude and phase. They performed numerical simulations in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole and through a transparent star to validate their analytic results.

Result: The study finds that in vacuum (Weyl tensor lensing), wave effects appear at order $G^2$, while in matter-filled regions, they appear at order $G$. Numerical simulations confirm these findings.

Conclusion: This analysis provides insights into the behavior of scalar waves in gravitational fields, highlighting the role of matter density in generating wave-optics effects at different gravitational scales.

Abstract: Waves propagating through a gravitational potential exhibit wave-optics effects when their wavelength is not significantly smaller than the lensing scales. We study the propagation of a scalar wave, governed by the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetime, to focus on effects on amplitude and phase, while leaving aside the issue of wave polarization which affects electromagnetic and gravitational waves. Using the Newman-Penrose formalism, we obtain the first corrections beyond the geometric optics in the expansion in the inverse frequency. In vacuum, that is for Weyl tensor lensing, there is no wave effect at first order in $G$ and wave effects start at order $G^2$. Conversely, if the wave travels through a non-vanishing matter density, the first corrections start at order $G$. We check these analytic results by solving numerically the equations dictating the evolution of the corrections either in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole or through a transparent star.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of massless particles -- specifically photons -- in the spacetime of a charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) surrounded by a cloud of strings (CoS) within the framework of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We analyze the effective potential that governs photon trajectories, explore the properties and location of the photon sphere (PS), and examine the effective radial force acting on photons. The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $α$ and the KR field parameter $\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field. Our results reveal the rich structure of AdS-BH spacetimes influenced by string clouds and antisymmetric tensor fields, with potential observational consequences in gravitational wave and BH imaging astronomy.

Abstract: The definition of weak equivalence principle of quantum matter is an open problem at present. In order to reflect the probability of quantum system in the quantum version of weak equivalence principle, we proposed a quantum weak equivalence principle based on differential scattering cross section at tree level, that is, the differential scattering cross section does not depend on the mass and properties of the scattered particles when the target particles take the large mass limit. This version of the quantum equivalence principle we proposed will be broken by the spin properties of quantum matter. In the non-relativistic case, the difference of differential scattering cross sections of scattered particles with different spin properties scattered by target particles is mainly reflected in the order of $ \mathcal O (p _ {\mathrm{cm}} ^2) $. In the relativistic case , we studied the asymptotic behavior of differential scattering cross sections at small angles. When the target particles are scalar particles, the difference of light particles with different spin properties is mainly reflected in the $ \mathcal O (1/θ^2) $ order. When the target particles are Dirac particles, the difference of light particles with different spin properties is mainly reflected in the $ \mathcal O (1/θ^4) $ order. The polarization of differential scattering cross section when scattered particles are Dirac particles is investigated. The result of the degree of polarization depends on the polarization direction of the incident particles.

*Xiaolin Liu,Sachiko Kuroyanagi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to reduce biases in parameter estimation for non-Gaussian gravitational-wave backgrounds by accounting for detector patterns, improving upon traditional overlap reduction functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The detection of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers in a non-Gaussian astrophysical background is a significant challenge. Accurate parameter estimation is crucial for understanding these events, but traditional methods may introduce biases. This paper aims to address these issues.

Method: The authors revisit optimal detection strategies using a Gaussian-mixture likelihood model. They emphasize the importance of considering detector antenna patterns and propose a computationally feasible method that incorporates second-order corrections to approximate the full integral over the source distribution. Their approach avoids the biases introduced by averaging the overlap reduction function over the sky.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method effectively eliminates biases in parameter estimation. The results also show that the method remains robust when considering anisotropic backgrounds.

Conclusion: This work provides a significant improvement in parameter estimation for gravitational-wave backgrounds, offering a more reliable method for analyzing future detections. The approach is computationally efficient and applicable to a variety of scenarios, including those with non-uniform background distributions.

Abstract: With the growing number of gravitational-wave detections, particularly from binary black hole mergers, there is increasing anticipation that an astrophysical background, formed by an ensemble of faint, high-redshift events, will be observed in the near future by the ground-based detector network. This background is anticipated to exhibit non-Gaussian statistical properties. To develop a robust method for detecting such a non-Gaussian gravitational-wave background, we revisit optimal detection strategies based on the Gaussian-mixture likelihood model. In this work, we demonstrate that properly accounting for the detector antenna pattern is essential. Current approaches typically rely on the overlap reduction function averaged over the sky. Through simulations, we show that using such an averaged response introduces significant biases in parameter estimation. In addition, we propose a computationally feasible method that incorporates second-order corrections as an approximation of the full integral over the source distribution. Our results indicate that this approach effectively eliminates these biases. We also show that our method remains robust even when considering anisotropic backgrounds.

Abstract: In this article, we apply the Simpson-Visser (SV) regularization scheme to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) charged black holes and investigate the resulting spacetime geometry in detail, with emphasis on both geodesic structure and thermodynamic behavior. In particular, we analyze the motion of massless particle, focusing on key features such as the photon sphere, black hole shadow, photon trajectory and the dynamics of charged particles, including the characteristics of the circular and type of orbits. Furthermore, we compare the theoretical predictions of the charged SV-AdS black hole with recent observations reported by the Event Horizon telescope (EHT) for M87* and Sgr~A*. Beyond the geodesic analysis, we explore the thermodynamics of the regularized charged SV-AdS black hole by deriving essential quantities such as the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. Through a systematic examination of these thermodynamic variables, we demonstrate how the regularization parameter inherent in the SV regularization influences particle dynamics, stability conditions, and the overall thermal properties of the modified black hole solution. This comprehensive study highlights the interplay between regularization effects and the physical observables associated with charged AdS black holes.

Abstract: The remnants of binary neutron star mergers are expected to be massive, rapidly rotating stars whose oscillations produce gravitational waves in the kilohertz band. The degree of differential rotation and the rotation profiles strongly influence their structure, stability and oscillation spectrum, and must therefore be taken into account when modeling their dynamics. We extend the pseudospectral code ROXAS (Relativistic Oscillations of non-aXisymmetric neutron stArS) to enable the dynamical evolution of oscillating, differentially rotating neutron stars. Using the updated code, we aim to study the star's oscillation frequencies. We extend the previous formalism, based on primitive variables and the conformal flatness approximation, to differential rotation. Within this framework, we run a series of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric simulations of perturbed, differentially rotating neutron stars with different rotation rates, and extract their oscillation frequencies. Axisymmetric modes, as well as those under the Cowling approximation, show excellent agreement with published results. We show that the secondary fundamental mode in the Cowling approximation is an artifact that does not appear in dynamical spacetimes. In addition, we provide, for the first time, frequency values for non-axisymmetric modes in differentially rotating configurations evolved in conformal flatness. This extension broadens the range of physical scenarios that can be studied with ROXAS, and represents a step toward more realistic modeling of post-merger remnants and their gravitational-wave emission.

Conclusion: 这是磁单极和超轻子物理研究的重要突破，为后续实验策略提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We present an analytic framework demonstrating that a spinning black hole endowed with a net magnetic charge exhibits a dramatically amplified superradiant instability against charged scalar fields, enhanced by several orders of magnitude compared with the neutral Kerr case. The amplification arises from a monopole induced reduction of the centrifugal barrier. This shift deepens the gravitational bound-state potential well and produces a parametrically larger instability growth rate. This resulting rapid growth yields a macroscopic boson cloud that acts as a coherent source of near monochromatic continuous gravitational waves (GWs). We find an enhanced GW power. Monopole harmonic selection rules restrict the emission from the north (south) clouds corresponding to opposite helicities. Their superposition generates an (approximately) circularly polarized continuous GWs at a fixed sky location within even parity general relativity, distinct from the generic elliptical polarization of the Kerr case. In light of these new findings, we propose a potential smoking-gun search strategy for magnetic monopole and ultralight boson: the rapid post-merger follow-up GW signals from binary-black-hole merger remnants through ground-based and space-based GW experiments. In contrast to the Kerr case, where the signal turn-on can be delayed to decades-centuries, a magnetic remnant can form a cloud and emit a stronger, circularly polarized continuous GWs within weeks to months. Taking the magnetic supermassive remnants as an example, we demonstrate that the rapid follow-up GW signal in the mHz band appears just in few weeks after binary black hole mergers. Moreover, future polarization (ellipticity) measurements can distinguish the magnetic scenario from Kerr while providing a parity-even mechanism for circularly polarized GWs in general relativity.

Abstract: We investigate late-time cosmology in the context of modified $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, considering a non-linear model$ f(Q,L_m) = αQ + βL_m^n + λ$ where, $α$, $β$, $λ$, and $n$ are some free parameters. The modified Friedmann equations are derived for a barotropic cosmic fluid, and an analytical solution for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is obtained. Using the latest DESI DR2 BAO data, previous BAO compilations (P-BAO), and cosmic chronometer (CC) datasets, we constrain the model parameters through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. Our results show that the model successfully describes the observed late-time cosmic acceleration with slightly tighter constraints from the inclusion of DESI dataset. The present-day Hubble constant is determined as $H_0 \simeq 69.5\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, while the deceleration parameter confirms accelerated expansion with $q_0 \simeq -0.57$. The transition redshift, where the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration, occurs in the range $z_{\rm tr} \sim 0.56 - 0.77$. Similarly, a smooth and physically consistent transition from a matter-dominated decelerated period at high redshifts to an accelerated phase at late times is revealed by the evolution of $ω_{eff}(z)$. While statefinder diagnostic shows the model favours a Chaplygin gas like nature for DESI and DESI+CC, whereas the model favours as quintessence dominated evolution for P-BAO+CC in the late time regime. Conclusively, all these results along with the study of the energy conditions and stability analysis showcases the given $f(Q,L_m)$ model offers a viable alternative to GR-based cosmology

Motivation: Understanding the symmetries of physical theories helps in uncovering their structural properties and potential limitations.

Method: The authors analyze the symmetry properties of the equations under consideration using representation theory and group theory.

Result: The equations of Galilean electromagnetism are invariant under the l-conformal Galilei group for any (half)integer l, but this invariance allows transformations connecting inertial frames with accelerations as high as 2l-1, suggesting possible dynamical instabilities.

Conclusion: This result raises questions about the physical implications of the symmetry group for the behavior of systems under high accelerations.

Abstract: It is shown that equations describing the Galilean electromagnetism in the presence of sources hold invariant under the l-conformal Galilei group for an arbitrary (half)integer parameter l. The group contains transformations which link an inertial frame of reference to those moving with constant accelerations of order up to 2l-1, thus pointing at potential dynamical instability.

The whole study is framed as systematic specialisation of Fourier analysis tools from the continuous to the discrete setting and vice versa, and the correspondence between the discrete and continuous models is examined primarily with regard to the dispersion relation.

### [60] [Limits of Rank Recovery in Bilinear Observation Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09754)
*Seungbeom Choi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The impacts of tolerance variations on reconstruction in bilinear observation problems is analyzed, revealing conditions that evoke the requirement for problem modification as opposed to mere numerical refinements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding when and how tolerance variations affect bilinear observation problems is crucial in fields ranging from physics to information theory, as it determines whether existing solutions can be refined or if fundamental changes are needed.

Method: The analysis involves studying the rank and nullity of bilinear observation operators under systematic tolerance changes, decomposing the nullspace into algebraic sectors based on variable block structures to identify persistent rank deficits and structure concentrations.

Result: Extended rank plateaus persist across broad tolerance ranges, indicating stable dimensional deficits resistant to numerical refinement. The nullspace concentration in specific sectors reveals an organized internal structure, necessitating problem modifications for effective dimensionality access.

Conclusion: Bilinear observation problems exhibit persistent rank deficits that cannot be resolved through numerical refinement alone, emphasizing the need for structural problem modifications in certain scenarios.

Abstract: Bilinear observation problems arise in many physical and information-theoretic settings, where observables and states enter multiplicatively. Rank-based diagnostics are commonly used in such problems to assess the effective dimensionality accessible to observation, often under the implicit assumption that rank deficiency can be resolved through numerical refinement. Here we examine this assumption by analyzing the rank and nullity of a bilinear observation operator under systematic tolerance variation. Rather than focusing on a specific reconstruction algorithm, we study the operator directly and identify extended rank plateaus that persist across broad tolerance ranges. These plateaus indicate stable dimensional deficits that are not removed by refinement procedures applied within a fixed problem definition. To investigate the origin of this behavior, we resolve the nullspace into algebraic sectors defined by the block structure of the variables. The nullspace exhibits a pronounced but nonexclusive concentration in specific sectors, revealing an organized internal structure rather than uniform dimensional loss. Comparing refinement with explicit modification of the problem formulation further shows that rank recovery in the reported setting requires a change in the structure of the observation problem itself. Here, "problem modification" refers to changes that alter the bilinear observation structure (e.g., admissible operator/state families or coupling constraints), in contrast to refinements that preserve the original formulation such as tolerance adjustment and numerical reparameterizations. Together, these results delineate limits of rank recovery in bilinear observation problems and clarify the distinction between numerical refinement and problem modification in accessing effective dimensional structure.

Abstract: Wave packet revivals and fractional revivals are hallmark quantum interference phenomena that arise in systems with nonlinear energy spectra, and their signatures in expectation values of observables have been studied extensively in earlier work. In this article, we build on these studies and extend the analysis in two important directions. First, we investigate fractional revival dynamics in angular momentum observables, deriving explicit expressions for the time evolution of their moments and demonstrating that higher-order angular momentum moments provide clear and selective signatures of fractional revivals. Second, we examine classical analogs of quantum revival phenomena and elucidate structural similarities between quantum fractional revivals and recurrence behavior in representative classical systems. Using the Kerr-type nonlinear Hamiltonian as a paradigmatic model, we analyze the autocorrelation function, moment dynamics, and phase-space structures, supported by visualizations such as quantum carpets. Our results broaden the range of experimentally accessible diagnostics of fractional revivals and provide a unified perspective on revival phenomena across quantum and classical dynamical systems.

Abstract: Static phase detuning fundamentally constrains coherent state transfer in asymmetric classical and quantum systems. We introduce a Bloch-sphere formulation for piecewise-coherent modulation that recasts coupled-mode dynamics as geometric trajectories, transforming algebraic control into path optimization. The approach reveals a cone of inaccessibility at the target pole and yields exact geodesic criteria for complete mode conversion in detuned systems. Leveraging this framework, we break time-reversal symmetry to realize a magnet-free optical isolator with near-unity contrast. Furthermore, for detuning larger than coupling between modes, we develop a recursive multi-step protocol enabling deterministic transfer for arbitrary detunings and derive a universal geometric lower bound on the required number of coupling-switching events.

Conclusion: 这种方法为探索零温度临界类中有限温度动力学性质提供了方法论框架。

Abstract: We analyze quantum systems under a broad class of protocols in which the temperature and a Hamiltonian control parameter are ramped simultaneously and, in general, in a nonlinear fashion toward a quantum critical point. Using an open-system version of a Kitaev quantum wire as an example, we show that, unlike finite-temperature protocols at fixed temperature, these protocols allow us to probe, in an out-of-equilibrium situation and at finite temperature, the universality class (characterized by the critical exponents $ν$ and $z$) of an equilibrium quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Key to this is the identification of ramps in which both coherent and incoherent parts of the open-system dynamics affect the excitation density in a non-negligible way. We also identify the specific ramps for which subleading corrections to the asymptotic scaling laws are suppressed, which serves as a guide to dynamically probing quantum critical exponents in experimentally realistic finite-temperature situations.

Abstract: The Landau--Zener (LZ) model describes a two-level quantum system that undergoes an avoided crossing. In the adiabatic limit, the transition probability vanishes. An auxiliary control field $H_\text{CD}$ can be reverse-engineered so that the full Hamiltonian $H_0 + H_\text{CD}$ reproduces adiabaticity for all parameter values. Our aim is to construct a single control field $H_1$ that drives an ensemble of LZ-type Hamiltonians with a distribution of energy gaps. $H_1$ works best statistically, minimizing the average transition probability. We restrict our attention to a special class of $H_1$ controls, motivated by $H_\text{CD}$. We found a systematic trade-off between instantaneous adiabaticity and the final transition probability. Certain limiting cases with a linear sweep can be treated analytically; one of them being the LZ system with Dirac $δ(t)$ function. Comprehensive and systematic numerical simulations support and extend the analytic results.

Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is one of the central organizing principles in physics. Time crystals have emerged as an exotic phase of matter, spontaneously breaking the time translational symmetry, and are mainly categorized as discrete or continuous. While these distinct types of time crystals have been extensively explored as standalone systems, intriguing effects can arise from their mutual interaction. Here, we demonstrate that a time-independent coupled system of discrete and continuous time crystals induces a simultaneous two-fold temporal symmetry breaking, resulting in a hierarchical time crystal phase. Interestingly, one of the subsystems breaks an emergent discrete temporal symmetry that does not exist in the dynamical generator but rather emerges dynamically, leading to a convoluted non-equilibrium phase. We demonstrate that hierarchical time crystals are robust, emerging for fundamentally different coupling schemes and persisting across wide ranges of system parameters.

Conclusion: Casimir力可以作为广泛频率下的光谱工具，揭开材料量子响应。

Abstract: Casimir forces arise from quantum electromagnetic fluctuations and depend on the dielectric response of interacting materials across the entire frequency spectrum. Although this dependence is central to Lifshitz theory of the Casimir effect, the formulation of the force in terms of dielectric functions evaluated at imaginary frequencies has largely obscured its connection to real-frequency optical properties, limiting the use of Casimir interactions as a probe of materials. Here we demonstrate that Casimir force measurements encode sufficient information to reconstruct a material's broadband optical response. Using supervised machine learning to invert Lifshitz theory, we determine the complex permittivity of a material over more than seven orders of magnitude in frequency from a single force-distance curve. We show that measurements at different separations selectively constrain distinct frequency ranges of the dielectric response, providing direct physical insight into how quantum fluctuations sample the electromagnetic spectrum. These results establish Casimir interactions as a physically constrained, broadband spectroscopic tool and open new opportunities for optical characterization in regimes inaccessible to conventional techniques.

Abstract: While spin squeezing has been traditionally considered in all-to-all interacting models, recent works have shown that spin squeezing can occur in systems with power-law interactions, leading to direct testing in Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, ultracold atoms and nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. For the latter, Wu. et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin-squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semi-classical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment. Our work illustrates the maximum disorder allowed for realizing scalable spin squeezing in a host of quantum simulators, highlights a regime with substantial tolerance to disorder, and identifies controlled defect creation as a promising route for scalable squeezing in solid-state systems.

Abstract: The aim of this work is to study the zero-error capacity of pure-state classical-quantum channels in the setting of list decoding. We provide an achievability bound for list-size two and a converse bound holding for every fixed list size. The two bounds coincide for channels whose pairwise absolute state overlaps form a positive semi-definite matrix. Finally, we discuss a remarkable peculiarity of the classical-quantum case: differently from the fully classical setting, the rate at which the sphere-packing bound diverges might not be achievable by zero-error list codes, even when we take the limit of fixed but arbitrarily large list size.

Abstract: A key challenge in quantum sensing is the detection of weak time dependent signals, particularly those that arise as specific frequency perturbations over a background field. Conventional methods usually demand complex dynamical control of the quantum sensor and heavy classical post-processing. We propose a quantum sensor that leverages time independent interactions and entanglement to function as a passive, tunable, thresholded frequency filter. By encoding the frequency selectivity and thresholding behavior directly into the dynamics, the sensor is responsive only to a target frequency of choice whose amplitude is above a threshold. This approach circumvents the need for complex control schemes and reduces the post-processing overhead.

Abstract: Recent studies of moiré physics have unveiled a wealth of opportunities for significantly advancing the field of quantum phase transitions. However, properties of reentrant phase transitions driven by moiré strength are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the reentrant sequence of phase transitions and the invariant of universality class in moiré-modulated extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. For the simplified case with intercell hopping $w=0$, we analytically derive renormalization relations of Hamiltonian parameters to explain the reentrant phenomenon. For the general case, numerical phase boundaries are calculated in the thermodynamic limit. The bulk boundary correspondence between zero-energy edge modes and entanglement spectrum is revealed from the degeneracy of both quantities. We also address the correspondence between the central charge obtained from entanglement entropy and the change in winding number during the phase transition. Our results shed light on the understanding of universal characteristics and bulk-boundary correspondence for moiré induced reentrant phase transitions in 1D condensed-matter systems.

Abstract: We demonstrate that large language model (LLM) agents can autonomously perform tensor network simulations of quantum many-body systems, achieving approximately 90% success rate across representative benchmark tasks. Tensor network methods are powerful tools for quantum simulation, but their effective use requires expertise typically acquired through years of graduate training. By combining in-context learning with curated documentation and multi-agent decomposition, we create autonomous AI agents that can be trained in specialized computational domains within minutes. We benchmark three configurations (baseline, single-agent with in-context learning, and multi-agent with in-context learning) on problems spanning quantum phase transitions, open quantum system dynamics, and photochemical reactions. Systematic evaluation using DeepSeek-V3.2, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.5 demonstrates that both in-context learning and multi-agent architecture are essential. Analysis of failure modes reveals characteristic patterns across models, with the multi-agent configuration substantially reducing implementation errors and hallucinations compared to simpler architectures.

TL;DR: This paper explores fracton topological orders in generalized hypergraph product (HGP) codes and related spin models, discovering properties like non-monotonic ground state degeneracy, non-Abelian lattice defects, and fragmented topological excitations which connect point-like and spatially extended objects, offering a versatile platform for studying fracton orders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the potential connection between stabilizer codes and spin models, particularly in understanding many-body orders and their topological properties.

Method: The authors use a recently proposed general construction of HGP codes to investigate their properties in spin models, identifying specific features like fragmented excitations by analyzing the structure of stabilizers.

Result: The study reveals novel features of fracton orders, including non-standard ground state degeneracy and fragmented excitations, which expand the understanding of topological phases of matter.

Conclusion: This research provides a comprehensive analysis of fracton topological orders within HGP codes, highlighting their rich and complex behavior which could be foundational for future studies in quantum error correction and topological quantum computing.

Abstract: Product code construction is a powerful tool for constructing quantum stabilizer codes, which serve as a promising paradigm for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Furthermore, the natural mapping between stabilizer codes and the ground states of exactly solvable spin models also motivates the exploration of many-body orders in the stabilizer codes. In this work, we investigate the fracton topological orders in a family of codes obtained by a recently proposed general construction. More specifically, this code family can be regarded as a class of generalized hypergraph product (HGP) codes. We term the corresponding exactly solvable spin models \textit{orthoplex models}, based on the geometry of the stabilizers. In the 3D orthoplex model, we identify a series of intriguing properties within this model family, including non-monotonic ground state degeneracy (GSD) as a function of system size and non-Abelian lattice defects. Most remarkably, in 4D we discover \textit{fragmented topological excitations}: while such excitations manifest as discrete, isolated points in real space, their projections onto lower-dimensional subsystems form connected objects such as loops, revealing the intrinsic topological nature of these excitations. Therefore, fragmented excitations constitute an intriguing intermediate class between point-like and spatially extended topological excitations. In addition, these rich features establish the generalized HGP codes as a versatile and analytically tractable platform for studying the physics of fracton orders.

Abstract: We investigate the coherence properties of parity-protected $\cos(2\varphi)$ qubits based on interferences between two Josephson elements in a superconducting loop. We show that qubit implementations of a $\cos(2\varphi)$ potential using a single loop, such as those employing semiconducting junctions, rhombus circuits, flowermon and KITE structures, can be described by the same Hamiltonian as two multi-harmonic Josephson junctions in a SQUID geometry. We find that, despite the parity protection arising from the suppression of single Cooper pair tunneling, there exists a fundamental trade-off between charge and flux noise dephasing channels. Using numerical simulations, we examine how relaxation and dephasing rates depend on external flux and circuit parameters, and we identify the best compromise for maximum coherence. With currently existing circuit parameters, the qubit lifetime $T_1$ can exceed milliseconds while the dephasing time $T_\varphi$ remains limited to only a few microseconds due to either flux or charge noise. Our findings establish practical limits on the coherence of this class of qubits and raise questions about the long-term potential of this approach.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the optical dipole interaction between a multi-level quantum system and a single-mode optical waveguide of any local polarisation. We investigate several paradoxical seeming situations, for example we find a situation in which there exist two non-orthogonal quantum states, each of which results in a photon flux in the opposite direction to the other. We show how, despite appearances, this does not break the unitary requirements of quantum mechanics. We also find that an isotropic quantum emitter can be either reflective or transmissive to light depending on the waveguide polarisation at the emitter location, indeed in the zero loss limit such a system changes from 100% transmission to 100% reflection due to an infinitesimal polarisation rotation. An example case for a four level system is also considered, which is found to operate as a non-destructive parity measurement of the photon number.

TL;DR: The paper examines the operation of a micromaser quantum battery under ultrastrong coupling with environmental dissipation. The battery, consisting of a cavity interacting with qubits as chargers, benefits from optimized control strategies for charging, charging rate, and stability against energy growth and mixed state issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding ultrastrong coupling effects in quantum batteries and mitigating associated challenges is crucial for practical quantum energy storage systems.

Method: Numerical methods probably involving quantum simulations and optimization of interaction parameters studied steady-state behavior of the battery under different dissipation regimes and control strategies.

Result: The study shows that controlled dissipation significantly enhances charging performance and sustainability of the battery, achieving steady-state conditions with finite energy and ergotropy. Optimal qubit preparation and interaction timing lead to enhanced ergotropy storage and stability through feedback mechanisms.

Conclusion: This research paves the way for scaling up quantum batteries by integrating ultrastrong coupling, optimal control, and dissipation management, ultimately improving energy storage for future quantum technologies.

Abstract: We investigate the open system dynamics of a micromaser quantum battery operating in the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime under environmental dissipation. The battery consists of a single-mode electromagnetic cavity sequentially interacting, via the Rabi Hamiltonian, with a stream of qubits acting as chargers. Dissipative effects arise from the weak coupling of the qubit-cavity system to a thermal bath. Non-negligible in the USC regime, the counter-rotating terms substantially improve the charging speed, but also lead, in the absence of dissipation, to unbounded energy growth and highly mixed cavity states. Dissipation during each qubit-cavity interaction mitigates these detrimental effects, yielding steady-state of finite energy and ergotropy. Optimal control on qubit preparation and interaction times enhances battery's performance in: (i) Maximizing the stored ergotropy trhough an optimized charging protocol; (ii) Stabilizing the stored ergotropy against dissipative losses through an optimized measurement-based passive-feedback strategy. Overall, our numerical results demonstrate that the interplay of ultrastrong light-matter coupling, controlled dissipation, and optimized control strategies enables micromaser quantum batteries to achieve both enhanced charging performance and long-term stability under realistic conditions.

Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising approach for realizing low-overhead logical quantum memories. Recent theoretical developments have established shift automorphisms as a fundamental building block for completing the universal set of logical gates for qLDPC codes. However, practical challenges remain because the existing SWAP-based shift automorphism yields logical error rates that are orders of magnitude higher than those for fault-tolerant idle operations. In this work, we address this issue by dynamically varying the syndrome measurement circuits to implement the shift automorphisms without reducing the circuit distance. We benchmark our approach on both twisted and untwisted weight-6 generalized toric codes, including the gross code family. Our time-dynamic circuits for shift automorphisms achieve performance comparable to the idle operations under the circuit-level noise model (SI1000). Specifically, the dynamic circuits achieve more than an order of magnitude reduction in logical error rates relative to the SWAP-based scheme for the gross code at a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, employing the BP-OSD decoder. Our findings improve both the error resilience and the time overhead of the shift automorphisms in qLDPC codes. Furthermore, our work can lead to alternative syndrome extraction circuit designs, such as leakage removal protocols, providing a practical pathway to utilizing dynamic circuits that extend beyond surface codes towards qLDPC codes.

Abstract: Fast, reliable decoders are pivotal components for enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). Neural network decoders like AlphaQubit have demonstrated potential, achieving higher accuracy than traditional human-designed decoding algorithms. However, existing implementations of neural network decoders lack the parallelism required to decode the syndrome stream generated by a superconducting logical qubit in real time. Moreover, integrating AlphaQubit with sliding window-based parallel decoding schemes presents non-trivial challenges: AlphaQubit is trained solely to output a single bit corresponding to the global logical correction for an entire memory experiment, rather than local physical corrections that can be easily integrated. We address this issue by training a recurrent, transformer-based neural network specifically tailored for parallel window decoding. While it still outputs a single bit, we derive training labels from a consistent set of local corrections and train on various types of decoding windows simultaneously. This approach enables the network to self-coordinate across neighboring windows, facilitating high-accuracy parallel decoding of arbitrarily long memory experiments.
  As a result, we overcome the throughput bottleneck that previously precluded the use of AlphaQubit-type decoders in FTQC. Our work presents the first scalable, neural-network-based parallel decoding framework that simultaneously achieves SOTA accuracy and the stringent throughput required for real-time quantum error correction. Using an end-to-end experimental workflow, we benchmark our decoder on the Zuchongzhi 3.2 superconducting quantum processor on surface codes with distances up to 7, demonstrating its superior accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrate that, using our approach, a single TPU v6e is capable of decoding surface codes with distances up to 25 within 1us per decoding round.

Abstract: In the thermodynamic limit, the Dicke-Ising chain maps exactly onto an effective self-consistent matter Hamiltonian with the photon field acting solely as a self-consistent effective field. As a consequence, no quantum correlations between photons and spins are needed to understand the quantum phase diagram. This enables us to determine the quantum phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit using numerical linked-cluster expansions combined with density matrix renormalization group calculations (NLCE+DMRG) to solve the resulting self-consistent matter Hamiltonian. This includes magnetically ordered phases with significantly improved accuracy compared to previous estimates. For ferromagnetic Ising couplings, we refine the location of the multicritical point governing the change in the order of the superradiant phase transition, reaching a relative accuracy of $10^{-4}$. For antiferromagnetic Ising couplings, we confirm the existence of the narrow antiferromagnetic superradiant phase in the thermodynamic limit. The effective matter Hamiltonian framework identifies the antiferromagnetic superradiant phase as the many-body ground state of an antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with longitudinal field. This phase emerges through continuous Dicke-type polariton condensation from the antiferromagnetic normal phase, followed by a first-order transition to the paramagnetic superradiant phase. Thus, NLCE+DMRG provides a precise determination of the Dicke-Ising phase diagram in one dimension by solving the self-consistent effective matter Hamiltonian.

Abstract: Quantum Computing (QC) has evolved from a few custom quantum computers, which were only accessible to their creators, to an array of commercial quantum computers that can be accessed on the cloud by anyone. Accessing these cloud quantum computers requires a complex chain of tools that facilitate connecting, programming, simulating algorithms, estimating resources, submitting quantum computing jobs, retrieving results, and more. Some steps in the chain are hardware dependent and subject to change as both hardware and software tools, such as available gate sets and optimizing compilers, evolve. Understanding the trade-offs inherent in this process is essential for evaluating the power and utility of quantum computers. ARLIS has been systematically investigating these environments to understand these complexities. The work presented here is a detailed summary of three months of using such quantum programming environments. We show metadata obtained from these environments, including the connection metrics to the different services, the execution of algorithms, the testing of the effects of varying the number of qubits, comparisons to simulations, execution times, and cost. Our objective is to provide concrete data and insights for those who are exploring the potential of quantum computing. It is not our objective to present any new algorithms or optimize performance on any particular machine or cloud platform; rather, this work is focused on providing a consistent view of a single algorithm executed using out-of-the-box settings and tools across machines, cloud platforms, and time. We present insights only available from these carefully curated data.

We present a comprehensive parallelization study with four phases: (1) Optimizer + JIT compilation achieving 4.13$\times$ speedup, (2) GPU device acceleration achieving 3.60$\times$ speedup at 4 qubits scaling to 80.5$\times$ at 26 qubits, (3) MPI parallelization achieving 28.5$\times$ speedup, and (4) Multi-GPU scaling achieving 3.98$\times$ speedup with 99.4% parallel efficiency across 4 H100 GPUs. The combined effect yields 117$\times$ total speedup for the H$_2$ potential energy surface (593.95s $\rightarrow$ 5.04s). We conduct a CPU vs GPU scaling study from 4--26 qubits, finding GPU advantage at all scales with speedups ranging from 10.5$\times$ to 80.5$\times$. Multi-GPU benchmarks demonstrate near-perfect scaling with 99.4% efficiency and establish that a single H100 can simulate up to 29 qubits before hitting memory limits. The optimized implementation reduces runtime from nearly 10 minutes to 5 seconds, enabling interactive quantum chemistry exploration.

Abstract: Photon statistics plays a governing role in multi-photon interference. While interference visibility in the standard two-photon case, known as Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, monotonically degrades with higher intensity correlation functions, we show that this monotonicity does not hold for three-photon interference in symmetric circuits. We reveal that, in the discrete Fourier transform circuit, engineered super-Poissonian photon-number fluctuations, realized using a modulated laser, maximize the visibility, surpassing the magnitude of the single-photon signature. In addition, by tuning the symmetric circuit parameters, we demonstrate that the visibility hierarchy inverts relative to the benchmark of Poissonian statistics. This trade-off implies that quantum and classical advantages are mutually exclusive resources for interference, indicating a form of statistical complementarity.

Motivation: Extending classical information theory techniques to quantum systems opens new possibilities for understanding quantum communication and computation protocols.

Method: The authors introduced quantum Markov conditions and used them to prove relationships between states with different Markov structures.

Result: Key findings include quantum versions of Markov conditions and conditions for when certain Markov relations hold simultaneously.

Conclusion: The results facilitate the use of SDR-type arguments in quantum systems, particularly for multi-party quantum states.

Abstract: The subadditivity-doubling-rotation (SDR) technique is a powerful route to Gaussian optimality in classical information theory and relies on strict subadditivity and its equality-case analysis, where double Markovity is a standard tool. We establish quantum analogues of double Markovity. For tripartite states, we characterize the simultaneous Markov conditions A-B-C and A-C-B via compatible projective measurements on B and C that induce a common classical label J yielding A-J-(BC). For strictly positive four-party states, we show that A-(BD)-C and A-(CD)-B hold if and only if A-D-(BC) holds. These results remove a key bottleneck in extending SDR-type arguments to quantum systems.

Abstract: Coupling mechanical motion to an optical resonator enables displacement measurements approaching the standard quantum limit (SQL). However, increasing the optomechanical coupling strength will inevitably lead to probing of the nonlinear response of the optical resonator. Thermal intermodulation noise (TIN) arising from the nonlinear mixing of thermomechanical motion can further increase the imprecision well above the SQL and has hitherto been canceled up to second order of nonlinearity via operation at the "magic detuning". In this work, we record the output of a membrane-in-the-middle microcavity system operating at room temperature and achieving high cooperativity, $C>n_\text{th}$, and apply a nonlinear transform that removes all orders of TIN, improving the mechanical signal-to-noise ratio by nearly 10 dB. Our results can be applied to experiments affected by third-order TIN, which we expect to be the dominating intrinsic source of noise in high-cooperativity room-temperature cavity optomechanical systems.

Abstract: Decision making often exhibits context dependence that challenges classical probability theory. While quantum cognition has successfully modeled such phenomena, it remains unclear whether quantum probability is merely a convenient assumption or a necessary consequence of decision dynamics. Here we present a theoretical framework in which contextuality arises generatively from physically grounded constraints on decision making. By developing a quantum extension of the Tug-of-War (TOW) model, we show that conservation-based internal state updates and measurement-induced disturbance preclude any non-contextual classical description with a single, unified internal state. Contextuality therefore emerges as a structural consequence of adaptive learning dynamics. We further show that the resulting measurement structure admits Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky (KCBS)-type contextuality witnesses in a minimal single-system setting. These results indicate that quantum probability is not merely a descriptive convenience, but an unavoidable effective theory for adaptive decision dynamics.

Abstract: The high overhead of fault-tolerant measurement sequences (FTMSs) poses a major challenge for implementing quantum stabilizer codes. Here, we address this problem by constructing efficient FTMSs for the class of quantum Hamming codes $[\![2^r-1, 2^r-1-2r, 3]\!]$ with $r=3k+1$ ($k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$). Our key result demonstrates that the sequence length can be reduced to exactly $2r+1$-only one additional measurement beyond the original non-fault-tolerant sequence, establishing a tight lower bound. The proposed method leverages cyclic matrix transformations to systematically combine rows of the initial stabilizer matrix and preserving a self-dual CSS-like symmetry analogous to that of the original quantum Hamming codes. This induced symmetry enables hardware-efficient circuit reuse: the measurement circuits for the first $r$ stabilizers are transformed into circuits for the remaining $r$ stabilizers simply by toggling boundary Hadamard gates, eliminating redundant hardware. For distance-3 fault-tolerant error correction, our approach simultaneously reduces the time overhead via shorting the FTMS length and the hardware overhead through symmetry-enabled circuit multiplexing. These results provide an important advance towards the important open problem regarding the design of minimal FTMSs for quantum Hamming codes and may shed light on similar challenges in other quantum stabilizer codes.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography is essential for characterizing quantum systems, but it becomes infeasible for large systems due to exponential resource scaling. Overlapping tomography addresses this challenge by reconstructing all $k$-body marginals using few measurement settings, enabling the efficient extraction of key information for many quantum tasks. While optimal schemes are known for qubits, the extension to higher-dimensional qudit systems remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate optimal qudit overlapping tomography, constructing local measurement settings from generalized Gell-Mann matrices. By establishing a correspondence with combinatorial covering arrays, we present two explicit constructions of optimal measurement schemes. For $n$-qutrit systems, we prove that pairwise tomography requires at most $8 + 56\left\lceil \log_{8} n \right\rceil$ measurement settings, and provide an explicit scheme achieving this bound. Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm to determine the optimal order of these measurement settings, minimizing the experimental overhead associated with switching configurations. Compared to the worst-case ordering, our optimized schedule reduces switching costs by approximately 50\%. These results provide a practical pathway for efficient characterization of qudit systems, facilitating their application in quantum communication and computation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the Fano effect in dissipative cavity quantum electrodynamics, which originates from the interference between the emitter's direct radiation and that mediated by a cavity mode. Starting from a two-level system coupled to a structured reservoir, we show that a quantum master equation previously derived within the Born-Markov approximation can be rederived by introducing a single auxiliary mode via pseudomode approach. We identify the corresponding spectral function of the system--environment interaction and demonstrate that it consists of a constant and a non-Lorentzian contribution forming the Fano profile. The constant term is shown to be essential for obtaining a Lindblad master equation and is directly related to the rate associated with this Fano interference. Furthermore, by applying Fano diagonalization to a common-environment setup including an explicit cavity mode, we independently derive the same spectral function in the strongest-interference regime. Our results establish a unified framework for describing the Fano effect in single-mode cavity QED systems and clarify its non-Markovian origin encoded in the spectral function.

Abstract: Magic states are essential for universal quantum computation and are widely viewed as a key source of quantum advantage, yet in realistic devices they are inevitably noisy. In this work, we characterize how noise on injected magic resources changes the classical simulability of quantum circuits and when it induces a transition from classically intractable behavior to efficient classical simulation. We adopt a resource-centric noise model in which only the injected magic components are noisy, while the baseline states, operations, and measurements belong to an efficiently simulable family. Within this setting, we develop an approximate classical sampling algorithm with controlled error and prove explicit noise-dependent conditions under which the algorithm runs in polynomial time. Our framework applies to both qubit circuits with Clifford baselines and fermionic circuits with matchgate baselines, covering representative noise channels such as dephasing and particle loss. We complement the analysis with numerical estimates of the simulation cost, providing concrete thresholds and runtime scaling across practically relevant parameter regimes.

Abstract: We investigate the experimental prospects for testing a relativistic local quantum measurement inequality that quantifies the trade-off between vacuum insensitivity and responsiveness to excitations for finite-size detectors. Building on the Reeh--Schlieder approximation for coherent states, we derive an explicit and practically applicable bound for arbitrary coherent states. To connect with realistic photodetection scenarios, we model the detection region as a square prism operating over a finite time window and consider a normally incident single-mode coherent state. Numerical results exhibit the expected qualitative behavior: suppressing dark counts necessarily tightens the achievable click probability.

Motivation:  developing fault-tolerant quantum computers requires overcoming challenges of single-qubit systems, making architectural design critical for scalability and efficiency.

Result:  the proposed architectures achieve 752x speedup and reduce qubit count by 10x compared to single-platform systems, highlighting the benefits of heterogeneity.

Conclusion: using cross-platform specialization significantly enhances quantum computing performance, paving the way for scalable fault-tolerant systems.

Abstract: The transition to the fault-tolerant era exposes the limitations of homogeneous quantum systems, where no single qubit modality simultaneously offers optimal operation speed, connectivity, and scalability. In this work, we propose a strategic approach to Heterogeneous Quantum Architectures (HQA) that synthesizes the distinct advantages of the superconducting (SC) and neutral atom (NA) platforms. We explore two architectural role assignment strategies based on hardware characteristics: (1) We offload the latency-critical Magic State Factory (MSF) to fast SC devices while performing computation on scalable NA arrays, a design we term MagicAcc, which effectively mitigates the resource-preparation bottleneck. (2) We explore a Memory-Compute Separation (MCSep) paradigm that utilizes NA arrays for high-density qLDPC memory storage and SC devices for fast surface-code processing. Our evaluation, based on a comprehensive end-to-end cost model, demonstrates that principled heterogeneity yields significant performance gains. Specifically, our designs achieve $752\times$ speedup over NA-only baselines on average and reduce the physical qubit footprint by over $10\times$ compared to SC-only systems. These results chart a clear pathway for leveraging cross-modality interconnects to optimize the space-time efficiency of future fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Conclusion: 这一结果为量子力学中对混沌行为的抑制机制提供了一个理论支持

Abstract: Recent studies have extensively explored chaotic dynamics in quantum optical systems through the mean-field approximation, which corresponds to an ideal, fluctuation-free scenario. However, the inherent sensitivity of chaos to initial conditions implies that even minute fluctuations can be amplified, thereby questioning the applicability of this approximation. Here, we analyze these chaotic effects using stochastic Langevin equations or the Lindblad master equation. For systems operating at frequencies of $10^5$ to $10^7$ Hz, we demonstrate that room-temperature thermal fluctuations are sufficient to suppress chaos at the level of expectation values, even under weak nonlinearity. Furthermore, nonlinearity induces deviations from Gaussian phase-space distributions of the quantum state, revealing attractor-like features in the Wigner function. With increasing nonlinearity, the noise threshold for chaos suppression decreases, approaching the scale of vacuum fluctuations. These results provide a bidirectional validation of the quantum mechanical suppression of chaos.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms are gaining attention in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for their favorable scaling, as encoding physical fields into quantum probability amplitudes enables representation of two to the power of n spatial points with only n qubits. A key challenge in Quantum CFD is the efficient readout of simulation results, a topic that has received limited attention in literature. This work presents methods to extract statistical properties of spatial velocity fields, such as central moments and structure functions, directly from parameterized ansatz circuits, avoiding full quantum state tomography. As a proof of concept, we implement our approach for 1D velocity fields, encoding 16 spatial points with 4 qubits, and analyze both a sine wave signal and four snapshots from Burgers' equation evolution. Using Qedma's error mitigation software QESEM, we demonstrate that such computations achieve high accuracy on current quantum devices, specifically IBMQ's Heron2 system ibm_fez.

Abstract: Historically, the focus in entanglement distillation has predominantly been on the distillable entanglement, and the framework assumes complete knowledge of the initial state. In this paper, we study the reliability function of entanglement distillation, which specifies the optimal exponent of the decay of the distillation error when the distillation rate is below the distillable entanglement. Furthermore, to capture greater operational significance, we extend the framework from the standard setting of known states to a black-box setting, where distillation is performed from a set of possible states. We establish an exact finite blocklength result connecting to composite correlated hypothesis testing without any redundant correction terms. Based on this, the reliability function of entanglement distillation is characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence. In the special case of a pure initial state, our result reduces to the error exponent for entanglement concentration derived by Hayashi et al. in 2003. Given full prior knowledge of the state, we construct a concrete optimal distillation protocol. Additionally, we analyze the strong converse exponent of entanglement distillation. While all the above results assume the free operations to be non-entangling, we also investigate other free operation classes, including PPT-preserving, dually non-entangling, and dually PPT-preserving operations.

Abstract: Studying the complexity of states sampled from various ensembles is a central component of quantum information theory. In this work we establish the average-case hardness of learning, in the statistical query model, the Born distributions of states sampled uniformly from the circular and (fermionic) Gaussian ensembles. These ensembles of states are induced variously by the uniform measures on the compact symmetric spaces of type AI, AII, and DIII. This finding complements analogous recent results for states sampled from the classical compact groups. On the technical side, we employ a somewhat unconventional approach to integrating over the compact groups which may be of some independent interest. For example, our approach allows us to exactly evaluate the total variation distances between the output distributions of Haar random unitary and orthogonal circuits and the constant distribution, which were previously known only approximately.

*Zheng Zhao,Weifeng Zhuang,Yanwu Gu,Peng Qian,Xiao Xiao,Dong E. Liu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We address the challenge of qubit frequency calibration in superconducting quantum processors by showing that the widely-used Snake optimizer is mathematically equivalent to Block Coordinate Descent (BCD). To optimize the ordering of qubit blocks during calibration, we cast the problem as a Sequence-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem (SD-TSP) and solve it efficiently using a nearest-neighbor heuristic. This approach, called BCD-NNA, minimizes the evaluation time per epoch and achieves linear complexity in qubit count per epoch while maintaining calibration quality. Simulations demonstrate that our method, which does not assume any knowledge of the crosstalk topology, achieves the same optimization accuracy at markedly lower runtime than graph-based heuristics (BFS, DFS) and random orders, and is robust to measurement noise and moderate non-local crosstalk. Our results provide a scalable, implementation-ready workflow for frequency calibration on NISQ-era processors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing relies on precise control of quantum processors, and frequency calibration is crucial for their reliable operation. The challenge of calibrating qubit frequencies, especially in the presence of crosstalk, remains a significant bottleneck in practical quantum computing. Our work addresses this by providing a novel and effective optimization strategy for frequency calibration.

Method: Our method involves two key steps: first, demonstrating that the Snake optimizer is mathematically equivalent to Block Coordinate Descent (BCD). Second, we reformulate the qubit block ordering problem as a Sequence-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem (SD-TSP) and solve it using a nearest-neighbor heuristic. This results in the BCD-NNA approach, which efficiently selects the order of qubit blocks to minimize evaluation time per epoch while maintaining calibration quality.

Result: Simulations on multi-qubit models show that the proposed BCD-NNA ordering attains the same optimization accuracy at markedly lower runtime than graph-based heuristics (BFS, DFS) and random orders. The approach is robust to measurement noise and tolerant to moderate non-local crosstalk, making it a scalable and practical solution for qubit frequency calibration in NISQ-era quantum processors.

Conclusion: Our work provides a scalable and implementation-ready workflow for frequency calibration of superconducting quantum processors. By establishing that the Snake optimizer is equivalent to BCD and introducing a novel nearest-neighbor heuristic for qubit block ordering, we significantly reduce the runtime required for calibrating qubit frequencies while maintaining calibration quality. This advancement is particularly valuable for the NISQ era, where practical considerations such as qubit count and crosstalk complexity are critical.

Abstract: Pre-execution calibration is a major bottleneck for operating superconducting quantum processors, and qubit frequency allocation is especially challenging due to crosstalk-coupled objectives. We establish that the widely-used Snake optimizer is mathematically equivalent to Block Coordinate Descent (BCD), providing a rigorous theoretical foundation for this calibration strategy. Building on this formalization, we present a topology-aware block ordering obtained by casting order selection as a Sequence-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem (SD-TSP) and solving it efficiently with a nearest-neighbor heuristic. The SD-TSP cost reflects how a given block choice expands the reduced-circuit footprint required to evaluate the block-local objective, enabling orders that minimize per-epoch evaluation time. Under local crosstalk/bounded-degree assumptions, the method achieves linear complexity in qubit count per epoch, while retaining calibration quality. We formalize the calibration objective, clarify when reduced experiments are equivalent or approximate to the full objective, and analyze convergence of the resulting inexact BCD with noisy measurements. Simulations on multi-qubit models show that the proposed BCD-NNA ordering attains the same optimization accuracy at markedly lower runtime than graph-based heuristics (BFS, DFS) and random orders, and is robust to measurement noise and tolerant to moderate non-local crosstalk. These results provide a scalable, implementation-ready workflow for frequency calibration on NISQ-era processors.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates quantum error correction (QEC) in open quantum systems by simulating noise models and assessing code performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding QEC's effectiveness in real-world quantum systems is vital for building robust quantum technologies.

Method: The study models microscopic systems with bosonic heat baths, derives master equations, and simulates codes like Steane, toric, and five-qubit codes under different noise conditions.

Result: The five-qubit code shows strong decoherence suppression at low temperatures but lesser benefit at high temps. Five-qubit code outperforms others for two-qubit Werner states post a critical time.

Conclusion: QEC improves fidelity, especially the five-qubit code, under specific conditions, offering a framework for near-term quantum reliability.

Abstract: We analyze quantum state preservation in open quantum systems using quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes that are explicitly embedded into microscopic system-bath models. Instead of abstract quantum channels, we consider multi-qubit registers coupled to bosonic thermal environments, derive a second-order master equation for the reduced dynamics, and use it to benchmark the five-qubit, Steane, and toric codes under local and collective noise. We compute state fidelities for logical qubits as functions of coupling strength, bath temperature, and the number of correction cycles. In the low-temperature regime, we find that repeated error-correction with the five-qubit code strongly suppresses decoherence and relaxation, while in the high-temperature regime, thermal excitations dominate the dynamics and reduce the benefit of all codes, though the five-qubit code still outperforms the Steane and toric codes. For two-qubit Werner states, we identify a critical evolution time before which QEC does not improve fidelity, and this time increases as entanglement grows. After this critical time, QEC does improve fidelity. Comparative analysis further reveals that the five-qubit code (the smallest perfect code) offers consistently higher fidelities than topological and concatenated architectures in these open-system settings. These findings establish a quantitative framework for evaluating QEC under realistic noise environments and provide guidance for developing noise-resilient quantum architectures in near-term quantum technologies.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of adversarial hypothesis testing for both quantum-quantum (QQ) and classical-quantum (CQ) channels. Unlike conventional channel discrimination, we consider a framework where the sender, Alice, selects the channel input adversarially to minimize Bob's distinguishability. We analyze this problem across four settings based on whether Alice employs i.i.d. or general inputs and whether the receiver, Bob, is informed of the specific input choice (allowing his measurement to depend on the input). We characterize the Stein exponents for each setting and reveal a striking distinction in behavior: for QQ channels with i.i.d. inputs, Bob's knowledge of the input significantly enhances distinguishability, yet this advantage vanishes when general inputs are permitted. In contrast, for CQ channels, Bob being informed provides a consistent advantage over the corresponding entanglement-breaking channels for both i.i.d. and general inputs. These results demonstrate a unique phenomenon in adversarial hypothesis testing where the CQ channel does not merely behave as a special case of the QQ channel.

Motivation: 随着量子技术的发展，多光子的可分辨性对于光子量子技术至关重要。传统的双光子 Hong-Ou-Mandel 检验已被推广到多光子情况，但现有的方法在估计可分辨性时效率较低。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了可扩展的多光子不可分辨性计算方案，适用于当前及可预期的光子量子硬件。该方案的关键创新点在于利用量子傅里叶变换的抑制规律来增强对多光子的不可分辨性评估能力。

Abstract: Several photonic quantum technologies rely on the ability to generate multiple indistinguishable photons. Benchmarking the level of indistinguishability of these photons is essential for scalability. The Hong-Ou-Mandel dip provides a benchmark for the indistinguishability between two photons, and extending this test to the multi-photon setting has so far resulted in a protocol that computes the genuine n-photon indistinguishability (GI). However, this protocol has a sample complexity that increases exponentially with the number of input photons for an estimation of GI up to a given additive error. To address this problem, we introduce new theorems that strengthen our understanding of the relationship between distinguishability and the suppression laws of the quantum Fourier transform interferometer (QFT). Building on this, we propose a protocol using the QFT for benchmarking GI that achieves constant sample complexity for the estimation of GI up to a given additive error for prime photon numbers, and sub-polynomial scaling otherwise, representing an exponential improvement over the state of the art. We prove the optimality of our protocol in many relevant scenarios and validate our approach experimentally on Quandela's reconfigurable photonic quantum processor, where we observe a clear advantage in runtime and precision over the state of the art. We therefore establish the first scalable method for computing multi-photon indistinguishability, which applies naturally to current and near-term photonic quantum hardware.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical study of the light-induced shift of the coherent population trapping resonance. An analytical model is proposed that describes the interaction of two radiation components with an atomic system using a $Λ$ scheme and takes into account an additional level of excited state. Both weak and strong coupling regimes with off-resonant transitions are considered. It is shown that, in addition to the conventional dynamic Stark shift, an extra shift arises due to the distortion of the resonance line shape when bichromatic laser radiation interacts with off-resonant atomic transitions. An analytical expression for this additional shift is derived in the weak-coupling limit, and its significant impact on the resonance shape and sensitivity to the intensities of the laser field components is demonstrated. It is found that under strong coupling conditions, the additional shift can deviate substantially from a linear dependence on light intensity, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light shifts in precision atomic devices such as quantum frequency standards.

Abstract: The manipulation of distinct degrees of freedom of photons plays a critical role in both classical and quantum information processing. While the principles of wave optics provide elegant and scalable control over classical light in spatial and temporal domains, engineering quantum states in Fock space has been largely restricted to few-photon regimes, hindered by the computational and experimental challenges of large Hilbert spaces. Here, we introduce ``Fock-space optics", establishing a conceptual framework of wave propagation in the quantum domain by treating photon number as a synthetic dimension. Using a superconducting microwave resonator, we experimentally demonstrate Fock-space analogues of optical propagation, refraction, lensing, dispersion, and interference with up to 180 photons. These results establish a fundamental correspondence between Schrödinger evolution in a single bosonic mode and classical paraxial wave propagation. By mapping intuitive optical concepts onto high-dimensional quantum state engineering, our work opens a path toward scalable control of large-scale quantum systems with thousands of photons and advanced bosonic information processing.

Abstract: Learning the Hamiltonian governing a quantum system is a central task in quantum metrology, sensing, and device characterization. Existing Heisenberg-limited Hamiltonian learning protocols either require multi-qubit operations that are prone to noise, or single-qubit operations whose frequency or strength increases with the desired precision. These two requirements limit the applicability of Hamiltonian learning on near-term quantum platforms. We present a protocol that learns a quantum Hamiltonian with the optimal Heisenberg-limited scaling using only single-qubit control in the form of static fields with strengths that are independent of the target precision. Our protocol is robust against the state preparation and measurement (SPAM) error. By overcoming these limitations, our protocol provides new tools for device characterization and quantum sensing. We demonstrate that our method achieves the Heisenberg-limited scaling through rigorous mathematical proof and numerical experiments. We also prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that a non-vanishing static field strength is necessary for achieving the Heisenberg limit unless one employs an extensive number of discrete control operations.

### [106] [Experimental Realization of Rabi-Driven Reset for Fast Cooling of a High-Q Cavity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10385)
*Eliya Blumenthal,Natan Karaev,Shay Hacohen-Gourgy*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A measurement-free method, Rabi-Driven Reset (RDR), is demonstrated for fast quantum memory reset in superconducting cavities. This method achieves significantly faster reset times compared to previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum error correction requires efficient methods for resetting memory modes to a known state. Previous methods often rely on either weak couplings or lengthy measurement sequences, which are time-consuming and impractical. Developing a faster, more efficient reset mechanism is crucial for hardware-efficient quantum error correction.

Method: The Rabi-Driven Reset (RDR) technique involves applying a strong resonant transmon qubit Rabi drive. Additionally, sideband drives are applied to the memory and readout modes, detuned by the Rabi frequency. This engineered interaction enables a tunable dissipation channel, converting dispersive interactions into a Jaynes-Cummings-like coupling. The method scales with the qubit-mode dispersive interaction and drive amplitude, avoiding the need for strong intermode coupling that can suppress direct mode-mode interactions in weakly coupled architectures.

Result: The RDR method achieves a single photon reset time of 1.2 microseconds, which is about two orders of magnitude faster than the intrinsic lifetime. Furthermore, the method enables the resetting of approximately 30 thermal photons within 80 microseconds, maintaining a steady-state average photon number of 0.045 ± 0.025.

Conclusion: This breakthrough in fast quantum memory reset via Rabi-Driven Reset opens new possibilities for enhanced scalability and efficiency in quantum error correction architectures, particularly in systems where direct mode-mode coupling is intentionally suppressed for avoiding loss or interference issues.

Abstract: High-Q bosonic memories are central to hardware-efficient quantum error correction, but their isolation makes fast, high-fidelity reset a persistent bottleneck. Existing approaches either rely on weak intermode cross-Kerr conversion or on measurement-based sequences with substantial latency. Here we demonstrate a hardware-efficient Rabi-Driven Reset (RDR) that implements continuous, measurement-free cooling of a superconducting cavity mode. A strong resonant Rabi drive on a transmon, together with sideband drives on the memory and readout modes detuned by the Rabi frequency, converts the dispersive interaction into an effective Jaynes-Cummings coupling between the qubit dressed states and each mode. This realizes a tunable dissipation channel from the memory to the cold readout bath. Crucially, the engineered coupling scales with the qubit-mode dispersive interaction and the drive amplitude, rather than with the intermode cross-Kerr, enabling fast cooling even in very weakly coupled architectures that deliberately suppress direct mode-mode coupling. We demonstrate RDR of a single photon with a decay time of $1.2 μs$, more than two orders of magnitude faster than the intrinsic lifetime. Furthermore, we reset about 30 thermal photons in about $80 μs$ to a steady-state average photon number of $\bar{n} = 0.045 \pm 0.025$.

We further provide a strategy on how to adapt these bounds to smoothed divergences.

Abstract: Calculating bounds of properties of many-body quantum systems is of paramount importance, since they guide our understanding of emergent quantum phenomena and complement the insights obtained from estimation methods. Recent semidefinite programming approaches enable probabilistic bounds from finite-shot measurements of easily accessible, yet informationally incomplete, observables. Here we render these methods scalable in the number of qubits by instead utilizing moment-matrix relaxations. After introducing the general formalism, we show how the approach can be adapted with specific knowledge of the system, such as it being the ground state of a given Hamiltonian, possessing specific symmetries or being the steady state of a given Lindbladian. Our approach defines a scalable real-world certification scheme leveraging semidefinite programming relaxations and experimental estimations which, unavoidably, contain shot noise.

Abstract: The evolution of an isolated quantum system inevitably exhibits recurrence: the state returns to the vicinity of its initial condition after finite time. Despite its fundamental nature, a rigorous quantitative understanding of recurrence has been lacking. We establish upper bounds on the recurrence time, $t_{\mathrm{rec}} \lesssim t_{\mathrm{exit}}(ε)(1/ε)^d$, where $d$ is the Hilbert-space dimension, $ε$ the neighborhood size, and $t_{\mathrm{exit}}(ε)$ the escape time from this neighborhood. For pure states evolving under a Hamiltonian $H$, estimating $t_{\mathrm{exit}}$ is equivalent to an inverse quantum speed limit problem: finding upper bounds on the time a time-evolved state $ψ_t$ needs to depart from the $ε$-vicinity of the initial state $ψ_0$. We provide a partial solution, showing that under mild assumptions $t_{\mathrm{exit}}(ε) \approx ε/\sqrt{ Δ(H^2)}$, with $Δ(H^2)$ the Hamiltonian variance in $ψ_0$. We show that our upper bound on $t_{\mathrm{rec}}$ is generically saturated for random Hamiltonians. Finally, we analyze the impact of coherence of the initial state in the eigenbasis of $H$ on recurrence behavior.

Abstract: Classical and quantum physics represent two distinct theories; however, quantum physics is regarded as the more fundamental of the two. It is posited that classical mechanics should arise from quantum mechanics under certain limiting conditions. Nevertheless, this remains a challenging objective. In this work, we explore the potential for unifying the dynamics of classical and quantum physics. This discussion does not suggest that classical behavior emerges from quantum mechanics; rather, it demonstrates the exact equivalence between the dynamics of quantum observables and their classical counterparts. It is shown that the Heisenberg equations of motion can be cast in a form that is identical to Newton's equations of motion, with $\hbar$ being absent from the formulation. This implies that both quantum and classical dynamics are governed by the same equations, with the Heisenberg operators substituting the classical observables.

Abstract: The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) imposes a fundamental constraint between current fluctuations and entropy production, providing a refined formulation of the second law for micro- and nanoscale systems. Quantum violations of the classical TUR reveal genuinely quantum thermodynamic effects, which are essential for improving performance and enabling optimization in quantum technologies. In this work, we analyze the TUR in a class of paradigmatic quantum thermal-machine models whose operation is enabled by coherent coupling between two energy levels forming a virtual qubit. Steady-state coherences are confined to this virtual-qubit subspace, while in the absence of coherent coupling the system satisfies detailed balance with the thermal reservoirs and supports no steady-state heat currents. We show that the steady-state currents and entropy production can be fully reproduced by an effective classical Markov process, whereas current fluctuations acquire an additional purely quantum correction originating from coherence. As a result, the thermodynamic uncertainty naturally decomposes into a classical (diagonal) contribution and a coherent contribution. The latter becomes negative under resonant conditions and reaches its minimum at the coupling strength that maximizes steady-state coherence. We further identify the optimization conditions and the criteria for surpassing the classical TUR bound in the vicinity of the reversible limit.

Abstract: We present a unified scheme for generating high-fidelity entangling gates in superconducting platforms by continuous dynamical decoupling (CDD) combined with variational minimal-energy optimal control. During the CDD stage, we suppress residual couplings, calibration drifting, and quasistatic noise, resulting in a stable effective Hamiltonian that preserves the designed ZZ interaction intended for producing tunable couplers. In this stable $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ manifold, we calculate smooth low-energy single-quibt control functions using a variational geodesic optimization process that directly minimizes gate infidelity. We illustrate the methodology by applying it to CZ, CX, and generic engangling gates, achieving virtually unit fidelity and robustness under restricted single-qubit action, with experimentally realistic control fields. These results establish CDD-enhanced variational geometric optimal control as a practical and noise-resilient scheme for designing superconducting entangling gates.

Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Filoche--Mayboroda localization landscape that extends the theory well beyond the static, elliptic and Hermitian settings while preserving its geometric interpretability. Using the positive operator $H^\dagger H$, we obtain a landscape that predicts localization across non-Hermitian, Floquet, and topological systems without computing eigenstates. Singular-value collapse reveals spectral instabilities and skin effects, the Sambe formulation captures coherent destruction of tunneling, and topological zero modes emerge directly from the landscape. Applications to Hatano--Nelson chains, driven two-level systems, and driven Aubry--André--Harper models confirm quantitative accuracy, establishing a unified predictor for localization in equilibrium and driven quantum matter.

Abstract: Fast and high fidelity shuttling of spin qubits has been demonstrated in semiconductor quantum dot devices. Several architectures based on shuttling have been proposed; it has been suggested that singlet-triplet (dual-spin) qubits could be optimal for the highest shuttling fidelities. Here we present a fault-tolerant framework for quantum error correction based on such dual-spin qubits, establishing them as a natural realisation of erasure qubits within semiconductor architectures. We introduce a hardware-efficient leakage-detection protocol that automatically projects leaked qubits back onto the computational subspace, without the need for measurement feedback or increased classical control overheads. When combined with the XZZX surface code and leakage-aware decoding, we demonstrate a twofold increase in the error correction threshold and achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in logical error rates. This establishes the singlet-triplet encoding as a practical route toward high-fidelity shuttling and erasure-based, fault-tolerant quantum computation in semiconductor devices.

Abstract: Quantum Amplitude Amplification (QAA), the generalization of Grover's algorithm, is capable of yielding optimal solutions to combinatorial optimization problems with high probabilities. In this work we extend the conventional 2-dimensional representation of Grover's (orthogonal collective states) to oracles which encode cost functions such as QUBO, and show that linear cost functions are a special case whereby an exact formula exists for determining optimal oracle parameter settings. Using simulations of problem sizes up to 40 qubits we demonstrate QAA's algorithmic performance across all possible solutions, with an emphasis on the closeness in Grover-like performance for solutions near the global optimum. We conclude with experimental demonstrations of generalized QAA on both IBMQ (superconducting) and IonQ (trapped ion) qubits, showing that the observed probabilities of each basis state match our equations as a function of varying the free parameters in the oracle and diffusion operators.

Motivation: Barren plateaus are a significant challenge for quantum machine learning and optimization of quantum circuits, so reducing their occurrence is highly motivated.

This method restricts the circuit's ability to explore its state space, preventing the formation of approximate 2-designs. The authors also provide a theoretical proof of a lower bound on the gradient variance, ensuring that the algorithm's performance remains robust even when scaling up with larger systems.

Result: The benchmarked H-EFT-VA outperforms standard hardware-efficient ansatzes across multiple models (Transverse Field Ising and Heisenberg XXZ), achieving a 109x improvement in energy convergence and a 10.7x increase in ground-state fidelity. Additionally, the statistical significance of these results is extremely high, with p < 10^{-88}, indicating a very strong evidence of the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The H-EFT-VA successfully addresses the barren plateau problem by utilizing insights from effective field theory. This approach not only prevents the problem from arising but also maintains the necessary quantum resources (entanglement and purity) to represent complex quantum states accurately. The results demonstrate a clear and substantial advantage over existing methods.)

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are critically threatened by the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. In this work, we introduce the H-EFT Variational Ansatz (H-EFT-VA), an architecture inspired by Effective Field Theory (EFT). By enforcing a hierarchical "UV-cutoff" on initialization, we theoretically restrict the circuit's state exploration, preventing the formation of approximate unitary 2-designs. We provide a rigorous proof that this localization guarantees an inverse-polynomial lower bound on the gradient variance: $Var[\partial θ] \in Ω(1/poly(N))$. Crucially, unlike approaches that avoid BPs by limiting entanglement, we demonstrate that H-EFT-VA maintains volume-law entanglement and near-Haar purity, ensuring sufficient expressibility for complex quantum states. Extensive benchmarking across 16 experiments -- including Transverse Field Ising and Heisenberg XXZ models -- confirms a 109x improvement in energy convergence and a 10.7x increase in ground-state fidelity over standard Hardware-Efficient Ansatze (HEA), with a statistical significance of $p < 10^{-88}$.

Abstract: Neutral atom quantum processors have emerged as a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, offering high-fidelity operations and exceptional qubit scalability. A key challenge in realizing practical applications is efficiently extracting readout outcomes while maintaining high system throughput, i.e., the rate of quantum task executions. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to quantify the trade-off between readout fidelity and atomic retention. Moreover, we introduce a metric of quantum circuit iteration rate (qCIR) and employ normalized quantum Fisher information to characterize system overall performance. Further, by carefully balancing fidelity and retention, we demonstrate a readout strategy for optimizing information acquisition efficiency. Considering the experimentally feasible parameters for 87Rb atoms, we demonstrate that qCIRs of 197.2Hz and 154.5Hz are achievable using single photon detectors and cameras, respectively. These results provide practical guidance for constructing scalable and high-throughput neutral atom quantum processors for applications in sensing, simulation, and near-term algorithm implementation.

Abstract: We study the computation of the $α$-Rényi capacity of a classical-quantum (c-q) channel for $α\in(0,1)$. We propose an exponentiated-gradient (mirror descent) iteration that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Our analysis establishes relative smoothness with respect to the entropy geometry, guaranteeing a global sublinear convergence of the objective values. Furthermore, under a natural tangent-space nondegeneracy condition (and a mild spectral lower bound in one regime), we prove local linear (geometric) convergence in Kullback-Leibler divergence on a truncated probability simplex, with an explicit contraction factor once the local curvature constants are bounded.

Motivation: Quantum metrology, communication, and simulation require high-fidelity non-classical states, andFock states are crucial for these applications. Generating large Fock states efficiently is a major challenge in quantum science.

Method: The protocol employs a hybrid Genetic-Adam optimization framework to control multi-pulse sequences consisting of Jaynes-Cummings interactions and displacement operations. The method is scalable, uses native control operations, and achieves high fidelity with shallow circuit depths.

Result: The protocol achieves fidelities exceeding 0.9 up to photon numbers on the order of 100, demonstrating strong robustness to parameter variations.

Conclusion: This scalable approach provides an efficient pathway for high-fidelity non-classical state generation, enhancing quantum metrology, communication, and simulation technologies.

Abstract: The scalable and deterministic preparation of large Fock-number states represents a long-standing frontier in quantum science, with direct implications for quantum metrology, communication, and simulation. Despite significant progress in small-scale implementations, extending such state generation to large excitation numbers while maintaining high fidelity remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present a scalable protocol for generating large Fock states with fidelities exceeding 0.9 up to photon numbers on the order of 100, achieved using only native control operations and, when desired, further enhanced by an optional post-selection step. Our method employs a hybrid Genetic-Adam optimization framework that combines the global search efficiency of genetic algorithms with the adaptive convergence of Adam to optimize multi-pulse control sequences comprising Jaynes-Cummings interactions and displacement operations, both of which are native to leading experimental platforms. The resulting control protocols achieve high fidelities with shallow circuit depths and strong robustness against parameter variations. These results establish an efficient and scalable pathway toward high-fidelity non-classical state generation for precision metrology and fault-tolerant quantum technologies.

Abstract: Whether neural information processing is entirely classical or involves quantum-mechanical elements remains an open question. Here we propose a model-agnostic, information-theoretic test of nonclassicality that bypasses microscopic assumptions and instead probes the structure of neural representations themselves. Using autoencoders as a transparent model system, we introduce a Bell-type consistency test in latent space, and ask whether decoding statistics obtained under multiple readout contexts can be jointly explained by a single positive latent-variable distribution. By shifting the search for quantum-like signatures in neural systems from microscopic dynamics to experimentally testable constraints on information processing, this work opens a new route for probing the fundamental physics of neural computation.

Abstract: Quantum embedding methods, such as dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), provide a powerful framework for investigating strongly correlated materials. A central computational bottleneck in DMFT is in solving the Anderson impurity model (AIM), whose exact solution is classically intractable for large bath sizes. In this work, we develop and benchmark a quantum-classical hybrid solver tailored for DMFT applications, using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to prepare the ground state of the AIM with shallow quantum circuits. The solver uses a unified ansatz framework to prepare the particle and hole excitations of the ground-state from parameter-shifted circuits, enabling the reconstruction of the impurity Green's function through a continued-fraction expansion. We evaluate the performance of this approach across a few bath sizes and interaction strengths under noisy, shot-limited conditions. We compare three optimization routines (COBYLA, Adam, and L-BFGS-B) in terms of convergence and fidelity, assess the benefits of estimating a quantum-computed moment (QCM) correction to the variational energies, and benchmark the approach by comparing the reconstructed density of states (DOS) against that obtained using a classical pipeline. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of Green's function reconstruction on near-term devices and establish practical benchmarks for quantum impurity solvers embedded within self-consistent DMFT loops.

Conclusion: 常哈密顿ian方法在二维空间内无法实现最优搜索时间，特别是在源状态和目标状态正交时。这提示我们需要使用时间依赖的哈密顿ian或更高的子空间来克服这一局限性，或采用其他量子搜索方法。

Abstract: It is known that the continuous-time variant of Grover's search algorithm is characterized by quantum search frameworks that are governed by stationary Hamiltonians, which result in search trajectories confined to the two-dimensional subspace of the complete Hilbert space formed by the source and target states. Specifically, the search approach is ineffective when the source and target states are orthogonal. In this paper, we employ normalization, orthogonality, and energy limitations to demonstrate that it is unfeasible to breach time-optimality between orthogonal states with constant Hamiltonians when the evolution is limited to the two-dimensional space spanned by the initial and final states. Deviations from time-optimality for unitary evolutions between orthogonal states can only occur with time-dependent Hamiltonian evolutions or, alternatively, with constant Hamiltonian evolutions in higher-dimensional subspaces of the entire Hilbert space. Ultimately, we employ our quantitative analysis to provide meaningful insights regarding the relationship between time-optimal evolutions and analog quantum search methods. We determine that the challenge of transitioning between orthogonal states with a constant Hamiltonian in a sub-optimal time is closely linked to the shortcomings of analog quantum search when the source and target states are orthogonal and not interconnected by the search Hamiltonian. In both scenarios, the fundamental cause of the failure lies in the existence of an inherent symmetry within the system.

Result: 最优演化路径具有高测地效率、无能量浪费、零曲率，且路径平均纠缠度低于亚优路径。对于非正交态，最优演化短时非局域性比亚优演化高；但对于正交态，情况相反。原因在于亚优路径在正交态下具有较长路径长度、较低曲率且高能量浪费。高初始非局域性有助于从可分态达到最大纠缠态。

Conclusion: 最优演化路径在几何上更高效，且与纠缠演化密切相关；纠缠演化的方向和速率受初始态的非局域性影响。未来研究可进一步探索演化路径优化与纠缠度的关系。

Abstract: We examine the pertinent geometric characteristics of entanglement that arise from stationary Hamiltonian evolutions transitioning from separable to maximally entangled two-qubit quantum states. From a geometric perspective, each evolution is characterized by means of geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and curvature coefficient. Conversely, from the standpoint of entanglement, these evolutions are quantified using various metrics, such as concurrence, entanglement power, and entangling capability. Overall, our findings indicate that time-optimal evolution trajectories are marked by high geodesic efficiency, with no energy resource wastage, no curvature (i.e., zero bending), and an average path entanglement that is less than that observed in time-suboptimal evolutions. Additionally, when analyzing separable-to-maximally entangled evolutions between nonorthogonal states, time-optimal evolutions demonstrate a greater short-time degree of nonlocality compared to time-suboptimal evolutions between the same initial and final states. Interestingly, the reverse is generally true for separable-to-maximally entangled evolutions involving orthogonal states. Our investigation suggests that this phenomenon arises because suboptimal trajectories between orthogonal states are characterized by longer path lengths with smaller curvature, which are traversed with a higher energy resource wastage compared to suboptimal trajectories between nonorthogonal states. Consequently, a higher initial degree of nonlocality in the unitary time propagators appears to be essential for achieving the maximally entangled state from a separable state. Furthermore, when assessing optimal and suboptimal evolutions...

Motivation: Understanding the relationship between quantum evolution curvature, efficiency, and complexity is key to advancing quantum computing and technology.

Method: The authors derive an exact analytical expression for the curvature of quantum evolution, using a two-parameter nonstationary Hermitian Hamiltonian and analyzing the curvature's impact on geodesic, speed, and evolution complexity.

Result: Efficient quantum evolutions exhibit lower complexity than inefficient ones, and longer paths with sufficient curvature can have less complexity than shorter ones with lower curvature.

Conclusion: The curvature of quantum evolution significantly influences complexity, providing insights for optimizing quantum systems and reducing complexity in practical applications.

Abstract: In optimal quantum-mechanical evolutions, motion can take place along paths of minimal length within an optimal time frame. Alternatively, optimal evolutions may occur along established paths without any waste of energy resources and achieving 100% speed efficiency. Unfortunately, realistic physical scenarios often lead to less-than-ideal evolutions that demonstrate suboptimal efficiency, nonzero curvature, and a high level of complexity. In this paper, we provide an exact analytical expression for the curvature of a quantum evolution pertaining to a two-level quantum system subjected to various time-dependent magnetic fields. Specifically, we examine the dynamics produced by a two-parameter nonstationary Hermitian Hamiltonian with unit speed efficiency. To enhance our understanding of the physical implications of the curvature coefficient, we analyze the curvature behavior in relation to geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and the complexity of the quantum evolution (as described by the ratio of the difference between accessible and accessed Bloch-sphere volumes for the evolution from initial to final state to the accessible volume for the given quantum evolution). Our findings indicate that, generally, efficient quantum evolutions exhibit lower complexity compared to inefficient ones. However, we also note that complexity transcends mere length. In fact, longer paths that are sufficiently curved can demonstrate a complexity that is less than that of shorter paths with a lower curvature coefficient.

Abstract: Consider quantum channels with input dimension $d_1$, output dimension $d_2$ and Kraus rank at most $r$. Any such channel must satisfy the constraint $rd_2\geq d_1$, and the parameter regime $rd_2=d_1$ is called the boundary regime. In this paper, we show an optimal query lower bound $Ω(rd_1d_2/\varepsilon^2)$ for quantum channel tomography to within diamond norm error $\varepsilon$ in the away-from-boundary regime $rd_2\geq 2d_1$, matching the existing upper bound $O(rd_1d_2/\varepsilon^2)$. In particular, this lower bound fully settles the query complexity for the commonly studied case of equal input and output dimensions $d_1=d_2=d$ with $r\geq 2$, in sharp contrast to the unitary case $r=1$ where Heisenberg scaling $Θ(d^2/\varepsilon)$ is achievable.

Abstract: Dicke states serve as a critical resource in quantum metrology, communication, and computation. However, unitary preparation of Dicke states is limited to logarithmic depth in standard circuit models and existing constant-depth protocols require measurement and feed-forward. In this work, we present the first unitary, constant-depth protocols for exact Dicke state preparation. We overcome the logarithmic-depth barrier by moving beyond the standard circuit model and leveraging global interactions (native to architectures such as neutral atoms and trapped ions). Specifically, utilizing unbounded CZ gates (i.e. within the QAC$^0$ circuit class), we offer circuits for exact computation of constant-weight Dicke states, using polynomial ancillae, and approximation of weight-1 Dicke states (i.e. $W$ states), using only constant ancillae. Granted additional access to the quantum FAN-OUT operation (i.e. upgrading to the QAC$_f^0$ circuit class), we also achieve exact preparation of arbitrary-weight Dicke states, with polynomial ancillae. These protocols distinguish the constant-depth capabilities of quantum architectures based on connectivity and offer a novel path toward resolving a long-standing quantum complexity conjecture.

Abstract: We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current and whose contribution was overlooked in the past. The distinction between different force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the current shift in the spin Hall effect and the correlation-induced quantum torques. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.

Motivation: Developing efficient quantum decoding algorithms is critical for practical applications of quantum error correction, especially in maintaining the integrity of encoded information under noise.

Method: The authors introduced a quantum Maxwell erasure decoder for CSS qLDPC codes. Their method involves extending the peeling algorithm by incorporating bounded guessing techniques to track and eliminate incorrect symbol guesses effectively.

Result: The decoder achieves a tradeoff between complexity and performance, with unconstrained guessing recovering ML performance, while a constant budget reduces complexity to linear-time decoding while approximating ML performance. Theoretical analysis supports asymptotic bounds on performance, and empirical results on specific code families like bivariate bicycle and quantum Tanner codes demonstrate strong performance.

Conclusion: This work advances our understanding of decoding strategies for quantum LDPC codes, offering a promising solution that balances between computational complexity and decoding accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce a quantum Maxwell erasure decoder for CSS quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes that extends peeling with bounded guessing. Guesses are tracked symbolically and can be eliminated by restrictive checks, giving a tunable tradeoff between complexity and performance via a guessing budget: an unconstrained budget recovers Maximum-Likelihood (ML) performance, while a constant budget yields linear-time decoding and approximates ML. We provide theoretical guarantees on asymptotic performance and demonstrate strong performance on bivariate bicycle and quantum Tanner codes.

Abstract: We report on a new flux quantization phenomenon in metals. We study the response of normal metals to the presence of localized magnetic flux. We find that, due to backreaction effects, the metal traps 0 flux or $\tfrac{h}{2e}$ flux (half flux). We exhibit this effect both for metals pierced by magnetic solenoids and metals wrapping a magnetic solenoid. In the latter case we demonstrate the trapping of magnetic flux analytically. Furthermore, we find that as the solenoid is adiabatically turned off, a logarithmically enhanced localized equilibrium current persists, reflecting perfect defect-diamagnetism of the Fermi gas.

Abstract: The composite Fermi liquid (CFL) in the half-filled Landau level is a cornerstone of the quantum Hall phase diagram. Recent experiments and numerics indicate that an anomalous composite Fermi liquid (ACFL) can also arise at half filling of a Chern band without any external magnetic field, opening new possibilities for paired states of composite fermions beyond the fully gapped Pfaffian phase. We argue that in inversion-asymmetric Chern bands with lattice rotational symmetry reduced to $C_3$, as realized in experimental platforms where signatures of the ACFL have been observed, composite fermions can form a superconductor with neutral gapless Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. We term the resulting electronic state {\it the composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid (CBFL)}. This phase has a number of remarkable properties that make it distinct from both the ACFL and the fully gapped Pfaffian. For instance, it is incompressible, has quantized Hall conductance, shows no quantum oscillations as a function of magnetic field or doping, and has topological ground state degeneracy on a torus despite the presence of gapless quasiparticles. At the same time, the neutral Bogoliubov Fermi surface yields metallic $T$-linear specific heat, non-quantized thermal conductance, Landau damping of density fluctuations, and a non-analytic $|\mathbf{q}|^3$ contribution to the equal-time structure factor $S(\mathbf{q})$. We also briefly discuss vortex physics and possible fractionalized daughter states induced by doping or external magnetic fields. Our results pave the way for a broader understanding of gapless topological phases arising from paired composite fermions in Chern bands that go beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm.

Result: r2SCAN+U能够很好地描述实验中观察到的碲链变形和非CDW时期的声子软模式，而SCAN表现出不合理的声子行为。

Conclusion: 虽然SCAN和r2SCAN在电子结构和优化晶格常数上表现相似，但r2SCAN更适合描述CDW形成和晶格动力学在CuTe中的现象。

Abstract: Identifying an appropriate exchange-correlation functional and computational conditions is essential for explaining the fundamental physics of materials and predicting their properties. Here, we investigate the performance of the meta-GGA functionals SCAN and r2SCAN, with and without a Hubbard U, for describing the charge density wave (CDW) in the quasi-one-dimensional material CuTe. By examining the Te-Te bond modulation, phonon dispersions, and electronic structures, we identify clear differences in how the two functionals capture the structural and dynamical properties of the CDW formation. r2SCAN+U reproduces the experimentally observed Te-chain distortions in the CDW phase and the phonon soft mode at qCDW=(0.4, 0.0, 0.5) in the non-CDW phase, whereas SCAN exhibits unphysical phonon behavior. The atomic displacements of the soft mode agree well with the experimental Te modulation. Despite their similar electronic structures and optimized lattice constants, our results demonstrate that r2SCAN is a more suitable choice than SCAN for describing CDW formation and lattice dynamics in CuTe.

Abstract: We perform a systematic study on the effects of electric fields in the Luttinger liquid phase of the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ $K_1J_1Γ_1Γ_1^\prime K_2J_2$ model in the region of ferromagnetic nearest-neighboring Kitaev coupling. We find that while electric fields along $(1,1,1)$-direction maintain the Luttinger liquid behavior, fields along other directions drive the system to a dimerized state. An estimation is made on how effective a $(1,1,1)$-field is for tuning the Luttinger parameter in real materials. Our work is useful for understanding the effects of electric fields in one-dimensional generalized Kitaev spin models, and provides a starting point for exploring the electric-field-related physics in two dimensions based on a quasi-one-dimensional approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between multipolar orders, unconventional superconductivity, and phase diagrams is crucial for advancing the field of condensed matter physics. This study provides insights into how magnetic and multipolar orders interact and influence superconducting properties.

Method: The study uses quantum spin fluctuations and active learning to analyze high-quality data from CeRh2As2, revealing anisotropic field and temperature dependencies that suggest a strong coupling between quadrupolar orders and superconductivity.

Result: The findings corroborate the hypothesis of a strong coupling between multipolar orders and superconductivity, suggesting a potential pairing mechanism involving unconventional spin fluctuations. The basal-plane anisotropy in the field-temperature phase diagram offers a new perspective on the interplay between magnetic fields and superconducting states.

Conclusion: This research advances the understanding of unconventional superconductivity and its underlying mechanisms. The identification of anisotropic behavior in CeRh2As2 points to potential pathways for future exploration and theoretical model development related to multipolar orders and superconductivity.

Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity in Ce-based Kondo-lattice materials emerges almost exclusively in the vicinity of weak dipolar magnetic orders, while higher multipolar orders are only known to occur in a few Pr-based unconventional superconductors and possibly URu$_2$Si$_2$. The multiphase superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ appears to be a notable exception from this trend. Showing clear signatures of magnetism, this tetragonal system is suspected to host a concomitant quadrupolar order, which could be causing the strong enhancement of the ordering temperature when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the fourfold ($c$) axis of the lattice. In this work, we show that the field-temperature phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has a remarkable basal-plane anisotropy. This finding supports the scenario of coupled magnetic and multipolar ordering, which may have implications for the pairing mechanism of the superconductivity, and guides the development of the next iteration of theoretical models.

Conclusion: 该研究通过实验验证了 20 年前理论预测的哈代链系统中基场诱导的相变行为。

Abstract: An $S=1$ Haldane chain is a one-dimensional (1D) quantum magnet where strong fluctuations result in quantum disordered singlet ground state with a gapped excitation spectrum. The gap magnitude is primarily set by the dominant intrachain interaction ($J_\text{1D}$). An applied magnetic field closes the gap at $B_\text{c1}$ and drives the system into a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) regime, followed by, at lower temperatures, a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) ground state, persisting up to $B_\text{c2} \propto 4 J_\text{1D}/gμ_B$. Almost all previously studied experimental realizations of such systems were based on transition-metal complexes which typically suffer from intrinsic anisotropies or large $J_\text{1D}$ values, limiting the access to the full theoretical phase diagram. We report a comprehensive study of TLL and BEC phases in the organic Haldane chain system 3,5-bis(N-tert-butylaminoxyl)-3'-nitrobiphenyl (BoNO). The absence of anisotropy and a moderate $J_\text{1D}$ enable exploration of the complete $B-T$ phase diagram. Through $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance, combined with theoretical analysis, we characterize the TLL properties, map the BEC phase boundary $T_c (B)$, determine the associated critical exponent $ν\approx 0.66$ at $B_\text{c2}$, and demonstrate universal quasiparticle scaling in the quantum-critical regime. These results provide full experimental validation of theoretical predictions for field-induced phases in an $S=1$ Haldane chain, made over two decades ago.

Abstract: Charge transfer is a common phenomenon in van der Waals heterostructures with proper work function mismatch, which enables electrostatic gating to control band alignment and interlayer charge distributions. This provides a tunable platform for studying coupled bilayer correlated electronic systems. Here, we theoretically investigate heterostructures of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG) and an insulating substrate with gate-tunable band alignment. We first develop a self-consistent electrostatic theory for layer charge densities incorporating charge transfer, which reproduces the experimentally observed broadened and bent charge neutrality region. When the substrate's band edge has a much larger effective mass than RMG, its carriers can form a Wigner crystal at low densities. This creates a quantum superlattice that induces topological flat bands in the RMG layer, which may lead to Chern insulators driven by intralayer Coulomb interactions. Conversely, with comparable effective masses, we find an interlayer excitonic insulator state at charge neutrality stabilized by interlayer Coulomb coupling. Our work establishes these charge-transfer heterostructures as a rich platform for topological and excitonic correlated states, opening an avenue for ``charge-transferonics''.

Conclusion: 研究界定了铁磁相变的临界浓度，并揭示了有效熵排斥增强的机制。

Abstract: The kagome lattice, a well known example of the geometrically frustrated system, hosts a dispersionless flat band that offers a unique platform for studying correlation-driven quantum phenomena. At appropriate particle concentrations, the existence of a flat band allows a representation of percolation with nontrivial weights. In this work, we investigate the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the repulsive SU($N$) Hubbard model on the kagome lattice within this percolation framework. In this representation, the model can be rigorously mapped to a classical $N$-state site-percolation problem on a triangular lattice, with the SU($N$) symmetry reflected in the nontrivial weights. By large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for SU($3$), SU($4$), and SU($10$) symmetries, we demonstrate that the critical particle concentration for ferromagnetism exceeds the standard percolation threshold and increases with $N$, indicating a strengthening of the effective entropic repulsion.

Conclusion: strong Coulomb interactions play a crucial role in both superconductivity and transport properties, with the correlated hopping (CH) interaction serving as a key mechanism.

Abstract: We investigate the role of strong Coulomb interactions beyond the standard Hubbard model in two distinct physical contexts. First, we analyze the superconducting phase transition occurring near the Mott metal-insulator transition. Second, we study transport properties of artificial nano-scale structures containing quantum dots coupled to external electrodes. In both cases, we focus on the impact of the correlated (assisted) hopping (CH) interaction. For superconductors, CH acts as a driving mechanism for the phase transition and modifies the spectral properties of the system. We present the evolution of the spectral function as the system approaches the Mott-type transition under varying model parameters. In quantum-dot-based devices, CH influences the tunneling amplitude between the dot and metallic leads. We demonstrate that the characteristic changes in the conductance of a normal metal-quantum dot-normal metal structure provide a clear signature of the presence and sign of CH interaction.

Conclusion: 提供了解描述二维量子流体相互作用的量子模型平台

Abstract: We show a single Landau level (LL) dressed with periodic electrostatic potentials can realize a plethora of interacting topological phases where the Hall conductivity generally does not equal to the LL filling factor. Their physics can be captured by a minimal model of a delta potential lattice within a single LL, realizing exact zero energy Chern bands (denoted as decorated Landau levels or dLL) gapped from dispersive bands with rich geometric properties. With $p/q$ magnetic fluxes per unit cell, there are $q$ dispersive bands and $p-q$ zero energy bands forming the dLL. When the one-body potential strength dominates the electron-electron interaction, band mixing is suppressed and the dispersion bands consist of ``localized states" with vanishing total Chern number. Nevertheless these dispersive bands can have highly nontrivial Berry curvature distribution, and even non-zero Chern numbers when $q>1$. Interestingly even in the limit of large short range interaction, band mixing between dLL and dispersion bands can be strongly suppressed at low filling factor, leading to robust topological phases within the dLL stabilized by the one-body potential. The dLL and the associated dispersive bands can serve as minimal theoretical models for correlated physics in lattice or moire systems; they are also highly tunable experimental platforms for realizing rich phase diagrams of exotic 2D quantum fluids.

Conclusion: 热力学相变不会引起动力学行为的突然变化，保持了系统的连续性。

Abstract: We investigate how a thermodynamical first-order phase transition affects the dynamical chaotic behaviour of a given model. To this effect, we analyze the model of Berkooz, Brukner, Jia and Mamroud that interpolates between the double-scaled SYK model and an integrable chord Hamiltonian. This model displays a first-order phase transition given by a kink in the free energy. We map out the dynamical behaviour, as characterized by chord number, Krylov complexity, and operator size, of the model across the phase diagram. We observe a jump in the chord numbers at the transition point, in agreement with the first-order transition. We further determine how scrambling measures, i.e.~the growth of the Lanczos coefficients and the time dependence of the operator size, change across the phase diagram. Deep inside the two phases, these measures indeed display integrable and chaotic behaviour, respectively. Across the transition however, we observe no qualitative change in these measures. This means that the thermodynamical transition does not imply a sharp transition in the growth exponent characterizing the dynamical chaotic behaviour. We also discuss a possible holographic interpretation of the model.

### [142] [The Topological Equivalence Principle: On Decoupling TFTs from Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09781)
*Charlie Cummings,Jonathan J. Heckman*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: TFTs are in the Swampland


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to show that topological field theories (TFTs) are in the Swampland, challenging the common belief that they decouple from local metric fluctuations in gravitational theories.

Method: The paper uses gravitational duality ( holography ) to argue that TFTs, while seemingly decoupled from local metric data in the bulk, are sensitive to Newton's constant and thus cannot be purely topological.

Result: The authors conclude that TFTs are not fully decoupled from local metric fluctuations and are therefore in the Swampland.

Conclusion: The findings imply that topological operators in boundary systems with a gravity dual have non-trivial bulk dynamics and cannot be purely topological.

Abstract: Topological field theories (TFTs) play an important role in characterizing the deep infrared (IR) of many quantum systems with a mass gap, as well as the global symmetries of quantum field theories (QFTs) decoupled from gravity. In gravitational asymptotically AdS spacetimes, TFT sectors which are putatively decoupled from local metric data are nevertheless non-perturbatively sensitive to Newton's constant via a sum over topologically distinct saddle point configurations. Tracking the fate of this non-decoupling in the boundary dual, we argue that in spite of appearances, this dependence on Newton's constant extends to local metric fluctuations. Said differently, TFTs are in the Swampland. In tandem with earlier results on the absence of global symmetries in theories with subregion-subregion duality, this also establishes that topological operators of boundary systems with a gravity dual are always non-topological in the bulk.

### [143] [Superball of Strings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09785)
*Yoav Zigdon*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper solves the low-energy limit of string theory equations to find a microcanonical ensemble of highly-excited superstrings, referred to as a 'Superball of Strings.' This solution is a static, spherically symmetric 'fuzzball' of BPS strings whose size is determined by a random walk scaling. The solution can be embedded in string theory within a significant portion of the parameter space. Although the solution does not provide a Lorentzian interpretation for a Euclidean, horizonless solution proposed by Chen, Maldacena, and Witten, some connections are noted between the solution and extremal black holes in Supergravity. The author argues that the Superball of Strings represents generic BPS microstates with the same asymptotic boundary conditions as a singular extremal black hole.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper discusses the construction of a microcanonical ensemble of highly-excited superstrings within the framework of low-energy string theory. While lensing black holes are typically associated with canonical ensembles, this work explores the existence and properties of a similar structure within the microcanonical ensemble framework. This contributes to a deeper understanding of the statistical characterization of black holes in string theory and the microstates they may represent. The paper also draws connections to prior work by Chen, Maldacena, and Witten, highlighting the relationship between the proposed Superball of Strings and extremal black hole solutions in Supergravity.

Method: The paper employs analytical methods rooted in string theory, particularly in the low-energy limit, to derive the solution for the microcanonical ensemble of highly-excited superstrings. The author solves the corresponding equations of motion to obtain the 'Superball of Strings' solution, which is described as a static, spherically symmetric 'fuzzball' of BPS strings. The size of the solution is determined by a random walk scaling, and the embedding of this solution within string theory is evaluated within a significant portion of the parameter space. The analysis also explores the connection between this solution and prior work by Chen, Maldacena, and Witten, focusing on extremal black holes and their properties within Supergravity frameworks.

Result: The primary results of the paper are twofold. First, it successfully constructs a microcanonical ensemble of highly-excited superstrings, referred to as the 'Superball of Strings,' within the low-energy limit of string theory. This solution is characterized as a static, spherically symmetric configuration of BPS strings with properties determined by a random walk scaling. Second, the paper draws connections between this solution and prior work, noting that despite significant differences in assumptions and theoretical foundations, both the proposed Superball of Strings and the extremal black hole solution discussed by Chen, Maldacena, and Witten exhibit the same asymptotic boundary conditions. Importantly, the author argues that the Superball of Strings corresponds to generic BPS microstates, suggesting that such solutions are a valuable contribution to the understanding of string theory's microstate counting and the statistical description of black holes.

Conclusion: The paper presents a compelling analysis of a microcanonical ensemble of highly-excited superstrings within the framework of low-energy string theory, offering a novel perspective on the construction of such ensembles. The 'Superball of Strings' solution not only advances our understanding of the statistical description of black holes in string theory but also provides a meaningful bridge between this work and prior theoretical constructs, such as the extremal black holes proposed by Chen, Maldacena, and Witten. The paper successfully demonstrates that, despite differences in their foundational assumptions and frameworks, the proposed Superball of Strings and the extremal black hole solutions share significant similarities, particularly regarding their asymptotic boundary conditions. Moreover, the author argues that the Superball of Strings represents generic BPS microstates, contributing to a richer understanding of the role of microstates in the thermodynamics of black holes.

Abstract: I solve the equations of the low-energy limit of string theory to obtain a solution corresponding to a microcanonical ensemble of highly-excited superstrings. This ``Superball of Strings'' is a static, spherically symmetric ``fuzzball'' of BPS strings with a size set by a random walk scaling. The solution can be embedded in string theory in a significant part of parameter space. While the solution does not constitute a Lorentzian interpretation for a Euclidean, horizonless solution by Chen, Maldacena, and Witten, a few connections are noted. A singular extremal black hole and the Superball of Strings exist as Supergravity solutions with the same asymptotic boundary conditions; however, I argue that the latter describes generic BPS microstates.

Conclusion: 通过 holography 微观计算得到的气泡化率和表面张力与有效能动作用计算的一致，说明有效的两个导数能动在描述相变过程时可能足够，但当仅依靠等效性方程和量纲分析时，需要额外的表面张力约束才能更好地描述问题。

Abstract: First-order phase transitions occur through the nucleation of critical bubbles of the stable phase within the metastable phase. Using holography, we present a fully microscopic description of these bubbles in a strongly coupled, four-dimensional gauge theory at finite temperature. In the gravitational dual, these bubbles correspond to static, inhomogeneous and unstable black-brane solutions with a localized deformation on the horizon. We construct these solutions across the entire metastable branch and compute the surface tension and the nucleation rate. We then compare these microscopic results with those obtained from a two-derivative effective action for the order parameter in two different scenarios. When the effective action is derived from the microscopic theory via holography, we find remarkable agreement. However, when the effective action is constrained only by the equation of state and dimensional analysis, significant discrepancies emerge. These discrepancies can be resolved if an additional constraint related to the surface tension is imposed.

Abstract: The Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) double-copy construction reveals a fundamental structural connection between gauge and gravity theories. At its core, the BCJ double copy is directly due to a duality between the algebraic relations of a color root and those of a kinematic root. We generalize this principle beyond the conventional Lie algebra structure of tree-level Yang-Mills theory. By demanding color-kinematics duality for the complete basis of four-point color structures -- including those involving the symmetric $d^{abc}$ constants -- we define the universal double copy. We systematically classify the bases of all such parity-even generalized gauge-theory numerators and, independently, the space of all parity-even four-graviton higher-derivative operators. We demonstrate that our universal double-copy construction precisely spans the entire tower of parity-even four-graviton amplitudes in any dimension, except for the Lovelock $R^3$ contribution in $D >6$ which we can express in terms of a particularly simple universal triple-copy involving gauge theories coupled to scalars. Explicit machine-readable expressions for the complete basis of gauge-theory numerators and fundamental gravitational building blocks are provided in the ancillary files. This establishes that all possible four-point gravitational interactions can be factorized into products of gauge-theory building blocks governed by this universal notion of color-kinematics duality.

Abstract: The Lorentzian path integral was recently used to argue that standard Euclidean axion wormholes do not dominate computations of connected AdS/CFT partition functions. We now apply similar methods to study the seemingly-analogous Jackiw-Teitelboim wormholes constructed by Garcia-Garcia and Godet using Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with an imaginary-valued minimally-coupled massless scalar field. However, this time we find that these wormholes do dominate our path integral for the relevant connected partition function. This supports the suggestion by Garcia-Garcia and Godet that contributions from such wormholes parallel the physics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at complex couplings. The result also illustrates the sensitivity of wormhole contributions to details of the relevant physics.

Abstract: Boundary integrability provides rare analytic control over field theories in the presence of an interface, from quantum impurity problems to open string dynamics. We develop an analytic framework for integrable boundaries in two-dimensional sigma-models that determines admissible reflection maps directly from the meromorphic Lax connection. Applying it to open strings on $AdS_3\times S^3$ with mixed NSNS and RR flux, we find two branches of integrable boundary conditions. One branch admits D-branes wrapping twisted conjugacy classes on $SU(1,1)\times SU(2)$, with the mixed-flux deformation encoded entirely into dynamical boundary data. At the exactly solvable WZW point these coincide with the conformal D-branes, providing a natural link to conformal perturbation theory.

*Guglielmo Grimaldi,Matthew Headrick,Veronika E. Hubeny,Pavel Shteyner*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: A holographic entropy inequality (HEI) is a linear inequality obeyed by Ryu-Takayanagi holographic entanglement entropies, or equivalently by the minimum cut function on weighted graphs. We establish a new combinatorial framework for studying HEIs, and use it to prove several properties they share, including two majorization-related properties as well as a necessary and sufficient condition for an inequality to be an HEI. We thereby resolve all the conjectures presented in [arXiv:2508.21823], proving two of them and disproving the other two. In particular, we show that the null reduction of any superbalanced HEI passes the majorization test defined in [arXiv:2508.21823], thereby providing strong new evidence that all HEIs are obeyed in time-dependent holographic states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of HEIs is motivated by the desire to better understand the mathematical structure underlying holographic entanglement entropy, particularly through combinatorial methods. The introduction of a new combinatorial framework aimed at studying HEIs positions this line of research as a promising direction, suggesting that it can yield insights into existing conjectures and possibly uncover new properties of HEIs.

Method: By introducing a novel combinatorial framework, we employ methods from graph theory and combinatorics to analyze HEIs. This approach allows us to prove several properties of HEIs, including their relationship to majorization and the necessary and sufficient conditions for an inequality to be an HEI. We also utilize this framework to resolve conjectures from a specific paper, demonstrating its effectiveness in tackling open questions in the field.

Result: We successfully establish a new combinatorial framework for studying HEIs. Using this framework, we prove several properties shared by HEIs, including two conjectures and disprove the other two from [arXiv:2508.21823]. Additionally, we demonstrate that the null reduction of any superbalanced HEI passes a majorization test, supporting the hypothesis that all HEIs are valid in time-dependent holographic states.

Conclusion: The introduction of this new combinatorial framework represents a significant advance in the study of holographic entropy inequalities. The resolution of the conjectures presented in [arXiv:2508.21823] highlights the power of this approach and opens new avenues for future research in this area.

Abstract: A holographic entropy inequality (HEI) is a linear inequality obeyed by Ryu-Takayanagi holographic entanglement entropies, or equivalently by the minimum cut function on weighted graphs. We establish a new combinatorial framework for studying HEIs, and use it to prove several properties they share, including two majorization-related properties as well as a necessary and sufficient condition for an inequality to be an HEI. We thereby resolve all the conjectures presented in [arXiv:2508.21823], proving two of them and disproving the other two. In particular, we show that the null reduction of any superbalanced HEI passes the majorization test defined in [arXiv:2508.21823], thereby providing strong new evidence that all HEIs are obeyed in time-dependent holographic states.

Abstract: Quantities computed by minimal cuts, such as entanglement entropies achievable by the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal in the AdS/CFT correspondence, are constrained by linear inequalities. We prove a previously conjectured property of all such constraints: Any $k$ systems on the "greater-than" side of the inequality are subsumed in some $k$ systems on its "less-than" side (accounting for multiplicity). This finding adds evidence that the same inequalities also constrain the entropies under time-dependent conditions because it preempts a large class of potential counterexamples. We prove several other properties of holographic entropy inequalities and comment on their relation to quantum erasure correction and the Renormalization Group.

Abstract: We consider the question of counting the degrees of freedom in theoretical models, with an emphasis on theories of fields and gravity. Among the possible approaches, the Hamiltonian formulation remains one of the most systematic and robust tools. However, it can easily become long and technically involved. In this work, we present a broadly applicable recipe to find the degrees of freedom directly, based on the Lagrangian formulation. We compare it to the standard approaches, highlight the challenges that may arise in the latter, and demonstrate that the proposed method leads to transparent insights about the dynamical nature of theory in a quick, simple, and straight-forward way.

Abstract: In the braneworld scenario, we introduce a uniformly distributed cloud of infinitely long strings in the five dimensional AdS bulk spacetime. The end points of the strings are attached to the brane and becomes the source of the four dimensional matter on the brane, while the body of the strings hang onto the radial direction of the bulk and act as the gluonic field on the brane. The presence of matter in the brane induces a nonsingular cosmological evolution for the scale factor of the brane world under certain conditions of mass and cosmological parameters. However, the nonsingular nature is unstable since the bounce occurs inside the Cauchy horizon. Further, we consider the shellworld or the dark bubble scenario for the same bulk spacetime. It shows stable nonsingular cosmological nature of the bubble universe under certain conditions on the bulk and bubble parameters.

*A. Mironov,A. Morozov,A. Popolitov*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses the common eigenfunctions of the twisted Cherednik operators and their properties under the limit of q approaching 1. It highlights the simplicity of the polynomial eigenfunctions, their origin from a symmetric ground state with excitations, and the role of weak compositions in their enumeration. The work is described as a potential NP problem, emphasizing the difficulty in solving the Cherednik equations versus verifying the solutions if they are found.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the properties of Cherednik operators and their eigenfunctions is relevant in various areas of theoretical physics and mathematics, such as integrable systems and representation theory.

Method: The authors analyze the limit of q→1 and construct polynomial eigenfunctions by considering the symmetric ground state and higher excitations using non-symmetric polynomials. This approach leads to a bijective correspondence based on weak compositions.

Result: The paper successfully demonstrates that the common eigenfunctions of the twisted Cherednik operators under q≠1 form a simple set, described by non-symmetric polynomials. The spectrum is constructed as a deformation of the q=1 case, highlighting the NP-like nature of solving Cherednik equations.

Conclusion: This study contributes a novel perspective on the relationship between the structure of eigenfunctions and the parameter q. It provides a deeper understanding of the Cherednik operators within the limit q→1 and their eigenfunctions in general cases.

Abstract: The common eigenfunctions of the twisted Cherednik operators can be first analyzed in the limit of $q\longrightarrow 1$. Then, the polynomial eigenfunctions form a simple set originating from the symmetric ground state of non-vanishing degree and excitations over it, described by non-symmetric polynomials of higher degrees and enumerated by weak compositions. This pattern is inherited by the full spectrum at $q\neq 1$, which can be considered as a deformation. The whole story looks like a typical NP problem: the Cherednik equations are difficult to solve, but easy to check the solution once it is somehow found.

Abstract: We examine the first-order Einstein-Cartan (EC) action in 2+1 dimensions, including a cosmological term and its supersymmetric extension. In this setting the spin connection can be expressed as an axial vector, yielding an action that is bilinear in the quantum fields and allows quantization without background fields. We identify the complete set of first-class constraints and derive the associated gauge transformations, which differ from the standard diffeomorphism and local Lorentz invariances. Using the closed gauge algebra, we construct the Faddeev-Popov-Nielsen path integral and show how a Lagrange multiplier field can be introduced to remove higher-loop contributions while preserving unitarity and gauge invariance.

Abstract: Soft current algebras capture the infrared structure of scattering in asymptotically flat spacetimes, but an analogous algebraic description of finite-energy dynamics has been missing. We uncover an infinite-dimensional hard current algebra that encodes finite-energy contributions to scattering and implies novel Ward identities. The soft current algebras are not independent but arise naturally from the hard ones. This provides a unified algebraic framework underlying quantum theory in flat spacetime.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper examines static open strings in different spacetime backgrounds, analyzing their behavior and symmetry properties, and their implications for quantum chromodynamics (QCD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of static open strings in various spacetime backgrounds and their implications for QCD is important for advancing our knowledge of strong interaction dynamics and testing theoretical models like the AdS/CFT correspondence.

Method: The authors use a combination of analytical and numerical methods within the holographic framework to study the static open string solutions in different gravitational backgrounds.

Result: The paper reveals that the symmetry of the string solutions depends on the spacetime background, particularly the condition $h_{pr} = 0$, and that these findings provide insights into parity violation in QCD and the potential for confinement in non-diagonal backgrounds. Additionally, the study of the Rindler-AdS spacetime dual to an accelerated $	ext{N}=4$ SYM plasma reveals how acceleration affects the interquark potential and deconfinement phase transition temperature.

Conclusion: The research highlights the importance of spacetime symmetry and background geometry in determining the properties of static open strings and offers new perspectives on QCD and the AdS/CFT correspondence.

Abstract: We analyze a static open string in a general stationary spacetime, which can represent a heavy quark-antiquark pair within the holographic framework or effective theory. We establish that for a simple U-shaped string with only radial dependence on the space string coordinate, $x_r'(σ) \neq 0$, the string is generally not symmetric about its turning point, and the symmetry restores only for backgrounds with $h_{pr} = G_{00} G_{pr} - G_{0p} G_{0r} = 0$. Consequently, such asymmetric strings directly probe a possibility of the parity violation in the quark-antiquark interaction. Nevertheless, we identify a wide family of metrics for which the symmetry is preserved, enabling a direct isolation of the linear-in-distance term in the static interquark potential for simple symmetric string configurations, even in non-diagonal backgrounds. Applying the holographic framework, we further study the Rindler-AdS spacetime dual to an accelerated $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills plasma. We show that the distance between quarks decreases, the static potential between them increases, and the deconfinement phase transition temperature, $T_{\rm dec} = (π/3) T_H = a_c/6$, increases with an acceleration. However, we observe that an acceleration-scaled potential as a function of the acceleration-scaled distance does not depend on the certain value of the acceleration This result, reflecting the scale invariance and self-similarity of the holographic setup, can be also obtained in the dimensionless metric after scaling of the coordinates onto the acceleration, $\tilde{x}_i = a_c x_i$, for which one obtains an universal value of the phase transition temperature, $\tilde{T}_{\rm dec} = (π/3) \tilde{T}_H = 1/6$.

Abstract: We study Energy Correlators as probes of strongly-coupled nearly-conformal field theories within their holographically dual descriptions, focusing on the important features that appear in realistic theories going beyond the standard model. In particular, we study warped geometries which asymptote to $\text{AdS}_5$, as well as IR-truncations dual to a 4D gap. Our correlators are computed by in-in type Witten perturbative diagrams, corresponding to a large-N expansion of the strong dynamics. We describe how this sets the stage for phenomenological applications for collider searches beyond the standard model as well as for new theoretical explorations in Lorentzian holography.

Conclusion: 该框架在四维情况下提供了描述非线性高自旋相互作用的新方法，并扩展了已有的(反)完全交换相互作用理论。

Abstract: We present a complementary approach to the standard Vasiliev framework for nonlinear higher-spin interactions in four dimensions, aimed at identifying their minimally nonlocal form. Our proposal introduces a generating system for higher-spin vertices at the level of classical equations, which we refer to as irregular, in contrast to the regular case described by Vasiliev. This system extends the recently proposed equations for (anti)holomorphic interactions by incorporating the mixed sector. Its perturbative series encompasses the entire (anti)holomorphic sector in the leading order, with vertices related to powers of the complex parity-breaking parameter $η$ or $\barη$. The subsequent corrections facilitate the mixing of the two sectors, with vertices carrying mixed powers of $η$ and $\barη$. The consistency relies on the nonlinear algebraic constraint, which is shown to be satisfied at least in the quadratic and cubic approximations. As a result, the previously discussed (anti)holomorphic interactions in the literature can be systematically extended to generate vertices of the form $η^N \barη^k$ and their conjugate, at least for $k \leq 2$ and any $N$. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also identify the new higher-spin structure dualities.
