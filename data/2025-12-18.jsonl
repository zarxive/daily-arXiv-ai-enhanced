Recasting parallel transport in a null Frenet--Serret frame yields a single scalar evolution law for the electric-vector position angle. On the observer's screen, the Kerr-minus-Schwarzschild pattern on the direct critical curve is nonzero, strictly odd under spin reversal after a half-turn azimuth relabelling, and tightly confined to a thin annulus. Using backward-shot, Carter-separated geodesics with midpoint RK2 transport, we achieve second-order convergence and degree-scale amplitudes that grow monotonically with spin and inclination (RMS $\\simeq 0.5$--$2^\\circ$ for $a/M\\gtrsim 0.8$, $i\\gtrsim 60^\\circ$). Three independent constructions -- Frenet--Serret line integral, explicit Levi--Civita transport of the polarization vector, and the phase of the Walker--Penrose constant -- agree ray by ray. We then define a parity-odd ring estimator that is intrinsically achromatic after standard wavelength-squared regression, symmetry-protected against common even-parity systematics, and compressed into low azimuthal modes. This yields a minimal two-parameter template (spin and inclination) for mm/sub-mm polarimetry of horizon-scale rings in sources such as M87$^\\ast$ and Sgr~A$^\\ast$.

The MoS$_2$ is illuminated by a femtosecond laser, while a tunable near-infrared (NIR) continuous-wave laser probes the microresonator resonance. The NIR light polarization can be adjusted to either transverse electric (TE, parallel to the 2D material) or transverse magnetic (TM, perpendicular), a configuration that is impossible to achieve with conventional normal-incidence pump-probe techniques. By capturing the transmitted signal on a fast oscilloscope, we detect transient optical shifts with unprecedented sensitivity, observing phenomena over time scales ranging from picoseconds to microseconds. Our results reveal both a rapid, carrier-induced nonlinear optical shift in the resonance, and a slower thermo-optic transient. The ability to simultaneously measure these fast and slow dynamics offers new insight into the complex optoelectronic behavior of 2D materials when integrated with microresonators. This method provides a significant advance over traditional pump-probe approaches, enabling the detection of exceedingly small transient signals and opening new avenues for exploring the optical properties of atomically thin materials. Our findings highlight the potential of this approach for investigating polarization-dependent nonlinear effects, with applications in photonics, sensing, and optoelectronics."}

Recently, the first room-temperature spintronic Poisson bolometer based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) was proposed and demonstrated as a promising infrared detector. Unlike conventional bolometers, the spintronic Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, where the response is governed by resistance fluctuations arising from thermally activated magnetization transitions. Spontaneous transitions between two metastable magnetic states occur even in the absence of incident light, and the transition probability increases under illumination. In this work, we experimentally study the statistical properties of the optical response of the spintronic Poisson bolometer under illumination. We demonstrate that transitions in spintronic Poisson bolometers, both in the absence and presence of light, exhibit Poissonian behavior, with transition rates and interarrival times modulated by incident radiation. Under illumination, we observe a 153% increase in the count rate accompanied by a 70% reduction in interarrival time. These results establish spintronic Poisson bolometers as a promising platform for probabilistic, high-speed, and high-sensitivity infrared detection at room temperature."}

These systems are technically robust and reflect the cumulative integration of solutions built and adapted across decades. One of the regular, unfortunate casualties of provisional accelerator control system updates is their human-system interfaces (HSIs) which often lag behind modern usability and design standards. An additional challenge is that although there is a multitude of established human factors (HF), and user experience (UX) principles for everyday digital applications, there are very few (if any) established principles for complex and safety-critical applications for an accelerator. This paper argues for the importance of established HF and UX principles (herein referred to as human-centered design principles) into the development of accelerator HSIs, emphasizing the need for clarity, consistency, responsiveness, and cognitive accessibility. Drawing from HF/UX best practices and human-centered design, this paper discusses how these approaches can enhance operator performance, reduce human error, and improve accelerator personnel collaboration. Case studies from Accelerator Control Operations Research Network (ACORN) at Fermilab are explored to demonstrate how interfaces built with human-centered design principles can scale with system complexity while remaining intuitive and efficient for diverse user roles including operators, machine experts, and engineers. By bridging the gap between traditional control system design and modern human-centered design methods, this paper provides a roadmap for evolving accelerator HSIs into more usable, maintainable, and effective tools."}

Recently, various SSP concepts have been proposed, aiming to efficiently harvest gigawatts of solar power over Earth geostationary orbit and transmit it to the Earth wirelessly. Based on the multirotary joints solar power satellite MR SPS concept proposed in 2014, this article presents an updated modular MR SPS concept, together with the challenges and design considerations. The primary objective is to address the challenges associated with long distance dc electric power transmission and exceptionally high precision microwave power transmission. The MMR SPS employs multiple modules, each further including a solar subpanel and an antenna subpanel. The solar subpanel and antenna subpanel in each module are connected with each other via conductive rotary joints with a much shorter distance compared with that in the MR SPS concept. As a result, lower voltage in electric power transmission is allowed, which significantly reduces the complexity of the system and increases its reliability. Retroreflective beamforming is employed to ensure the accurate steering of the microwave power beam to the ground receiving aperture. For the first time, this article analyzes and validates the performance of using retroreflective beamforming to compensate for antenna position deviations through a numerical calculation model that includes near field effects. Additionally, this article outlines the transportation and assembly methods, along with the considerations of the full life cycle cost for an MMR SPS."}

We map how interaction strength, lattice depth, lattice wavenumber, and pulse duration reshape the diffraction pattern, leading to an interaction-dependent population redistribution in real and momentum-space. By comparing the exact dynamics to an impulsive sudden-approximation description, we delineate the parameter regimes where it remains accurate and those, notably at strong attraction and small lattice wavenumber, where it fails. Our results provide a controlled few-body benchmark for interacting Kapitza-Dirac scattering and quantitative guidance for Kapitza-Dirac-based probes of ultracold atomic systems."}

Beyond the inherently large relativistic effects associated with a high proton number $Z$, an increased molecular charge can further enhance the electronic sensitivity to symmetry-violating nuclear effects, including nuclear Schiff moments. Experimental investigations of multiply charged actinide molecules are challenging because the high charges severely destabilize chemical bonds, leading to spontaneous Coulomb explosion. We demonstrate a method to systematically generate and detect molecular ions at the edge of chemical stability. By applying high-fluence laser ablation to a depleted uranium metal foil, we produce atomic uranium ions U$^{z+}$ and uranium monoxide cations UO$^{z+}$ with $z = 1$--4. Among them, we observe UO$^{3+}$ and UO$^{4+}$, which exhibit comparatively simple electronic structures and are therefore promising for precision spectroscopy. The experiments are supported by relativistic density functional theory calculations of equilibrium bond lengths, charge distributions, and binding energies of all observed molecules. Calculations of symmetry-violating properties suggest a pronounced sensitivity of UO$^{3+}$ to hadronic $CP$ violation. This approach opens a pathway for high-precision investigations of fundamental symmetries and the exploration of relativistic actinide chemistry in previously inaccessible regimes."}

For such systems to be effective, two objectives must be met: (i) accurate point forecasts of the time series must be produced, and (ii) the long-term statistical behaviour of the underlying data-generating process must be replicated. The latter objective, often referred to as learning the climate, is closely related to the task of producing accurate distribution forecasts. Empirical evidence shows that distribution forecasts are far more stable than point forecasts, which are sensitive to initial conditions. In this work, we rigorously study this phenomenon for state-space systems. The main result shows that, if the underlying data-generating process is structurally stable and possesses a mixing or an attracting measure, then a sufficiently regular initial probability distribution remains close to the true future distribution at arbitrarily long time horizons when forecasted by a $C^1-$close state-space proxy. Thus, under these conditions, learning the climate of a dynamic process with a universal family of state-space systems is feasible with arbitrarily high accuracy."}

In these geometries, the warp factors, dilaton and other fields depend non-trivially on the 'quiver coordinate' (denoted by $η$ in this paper). This $η$-coordinate encodes the color and flavor data of the dual theories. As a consequence, a massive probe following a holographic geodesic necessarily moves simultaneously in the radial AdS direction and along the 'quiver direction'. This produces new contributions to the proper momentum and hence to the rate of Krylov complexity growth, which is absent in bottom-up AdS models. We show that the $η$-motion is generically damped, with a time-scale governed by the UV cutoff of the geodesic problem, and modifies the early-time evolution of complexity in a quiver-dependent way. At late times, the $η$-dynamics freezes and the growth becomes universal, matching pure Poincare AdS predictions.

The entangled squeezed graviton states are produced by both, conventional General-Relativity (GR) type axion-gravity interactions, and gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) anomalous terms coupled to axions, which are non-trivial in the presence of rotating BHs. The two kinds of terms have different-symmetry contributions to the entangled squeezed states. The squeezing parameter is estimated in a weak-quantum-gravity framework. Some phenomenology with respect to current and future interferometric detection devices is discussed. Importantly, current data from LIGO/Virgo Experiments can impose upper-bound constraints on the value of the squeezing parameter and, thus, on the lifetime of the axionic clouds. In addition to the above rather direct-detection possibility of squeezed gravitons, there is also the possibility of indirect detection of quantum gravitons in Cosmology, given that chiral quantum gravitational-wave (GW) perturbations in the primordial Universe may imply condensation of gCS terms.

Radiation loss can be engineered through structural design, enabling control of the imaginary part of the complex frequency and allowing relatively high $Q$ factors. This approach is compatible with widely used absorption-free silicon-slab photonic crystals. We developed a measurement system that can measure photonic bands along arbitrary lines in $k$-space. Our measurements demonstrated direct observation of the NHPG in photonic crystals, and the reversal of non-Hermitian topology through the flip of loop rotation in a complex plane.

Pros and cons of the used fabrication approaches were identified and understood, and the performance of longitudinally sliced painted cavity design demonstrated considerable practicality of 3D-printing approach in designing rf systems."}

Recently, the first room-temperature spintronic Poisson bolometer based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) was proposed and demonstrated as a promising infrared detector. Unlike conventional bolometers, the spintronic Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, where the response is governed by resistance fluctuations arising from thermally activated magnetization transitions. Spontaneous transitions between two metastable magnetic states occur even in the absence of incident light, and the transition probability increases under illumination. In this work, we experimentally study the statistical properties of the optical response of the spintronic Poisson bolometer under illumination. We demonstrate that transitions in spintronic Poisson bolometers, both in the absence and presence of light, exhibit Poissonian behavior, with transition rates and interarrival times modulated by incident radiation. Under illumination, we observe a 153% increase in the count rate accompanied by a 70% reduction in interarrival time. These results establish spintronic Poisson bolometers as a promising platform for probabilistic, high-speed, and high-sensitivity infrared detection at room temperature."}

Recently, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), a counterintuitive relaxation phenomenon, has attracted considerable attention and has been extensively studied in systems with global symmetries. Here, we study the QME in gauge theories with massive local gauge symmetries. In the lattice Schwinger model, we demonstrate that the gauge structure of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem is entirely determined by the initial state and remain unchanged during the time evolution. We then investigate whether gauge symmetry can be dynamically restored following a symmetric quench. Analytical and numerical results show that when the Maxwell term is zero, gauge symmetry restoration fails due to the emergence of a peculiar conservation law. However, for any finite Maxwell term, subsystem gauge symmetry is restored in the thermodynamic limit. Based on these results, we systematically construct a families of initial states exhibiting the QME. We further explore the QME in the quantum link model-a truncated lattice Schwinger model, which has been realized in experiments. Moreover, we propose an experimentally accessible order parameter that correctly captures the QME. Our work demonstrates the generality of the quantum Mpemba effect even in the local gauge symmetries, and are directly relevant to ongoing quantum simulation experiments of gauge theories."}

Considering cavity and thin film geometries, we find that the spectrum and spatial structure of the stray magnetic noise provide a sharp qualitative signature of the underlying electrodynamics. The predicted stray-field noise power lies comfortably within the detection range of present-day solid-state defect magnetometry."}

While the theoretical quantum speed-up from T_cl=2^{57.8} (classical) to T_qu = 2^{28.9} (quantum) is mathematically sound, the practical implementation overhead is so extreme that attacks remain wholly infeasible in both resource and runtime dimensions. Using Qiskit-based circuit synthesis, we derive that a 3-round Keccak quantum oracle requires: 9,600 Toffoli gates (with uncomputation for reversibility); 3,200 logical qubits (1,600 state + 1,600 auxiliary); 7.47 * 10^{13} total 2-qubit gates (full Grover search); 3.2 million physical qubits (with quantum error correction)PROHIBITIVE; 0.12 years (43 days) to 2,365+ years execution time, depending on machine assumptions. These barriers -- particularly the physical qubit requirements, circuit depth, and error accumulation -- render the quantum attack infeasible for any foreseeable quantum computer. Consequently, SHA-3 security is not threatened by quantum computers for preimage attacks. We emphasize the critical importance of hardware-aware complexity analysis in quantum cryptanalysis: the elegant asymptotic theory of Grover's Algorithm hides an engineering overhead so prohibitive that the quantum approach becomes infeasible from both resource and implementation perspectives."}

The localized active space self-consistent field method (LASSCF) uses a product of fragment active spaces as a variational space, with the Schrödinger equation solved exactly in each fragment and the fragment active-space orbitals defined in a self-consistent manner. LASSCF is accurate for systems with strong intra-fragment and weak inter-fragment correlation, and its computational cost is combinatorial with respect to the size of the individual fragment active spaces, rather than their product. However, exactly solving the Schrödinger equation in each fragment remains a substantial bottleneck. Here, we address the possibility of solving the fragment active space Schrödinger equation with approximate methods, particularly sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD). SQD is a technique that uses a quantum computer to sample configurations from a chemically motivated quantum circuit and a classical computer to mitigate errors and solve the Schrödinger equation in a subspace of the configuration space. We apply the proposed method, LASSQD, to the [Fe(H$_2$O)$_4$]$_2$bpym$^{4+}$ compound and the [Fe$^{\\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\\mathrm{II}}$($μ$$_3$-O)-(HCOO)$_6$] complex for calculating the intermediate-spin ground state energies. We observe that LASSQD can tackle fragment sizes intractable by LASSCF, achieves within 1kcal/mol agreement to LASSCF, and delivers results that are competitive with alternative classical methods to solve the Schrödinger equation, and thus can be used as a starting point for a perturbative treatment (LASSQD-PDFT) to recover correlation external to the active space."}

The exploration has been successfully guided by the paradigm of ideal flat Chern bands, which mimic Landau levels in both band topology and local quantum geometry. Yet, given the near-infinite possibilities for Bloch bands in lattices, it remains a major open question whether FQAH states can emerge in scenarios fundamentally different from this paradigm. Here we turn to a class of gapless flat bands, featuring divergent quantum geometry at singular band touching, non-integer Berry flux threading the Brillouin zone (BZ), and ill-defined band topology. Our exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations unambiguously demonstrate FQAH phase that is virtually independent of the interaction strength, persisting from the weak-interaction to the strong-interaction limit. We find the stability of the FQAH states does not uniquely correlate with the singularity strength or the BZ-averaged quantum geometric fluctuations. Instead, the many-body topological order can adapt to the singular and fluctuating quantum geometric landscape by spontaneously developing an inhomogeneous carrier distribution, while its quenching accompanies the drop in the occupation-weighted Berry flux. Our work reveals a profound interplay between quantum geometry and many-body correlation, and significantly expands the design space for exploring FQAH effect and flat-band correlation phenomena in general."}

We begin by introducing a classification problem: enumeration of birational classes of toric varieties, which is equivalent to enumeration of certain triangulations/fans. We consider this problem from the complementary perspectives of triangulation theory and toric geometry, reviewing both theories in detail; this culminates in an explanation of how to generate all fine regular triangulations of a vector configuration (i.e., fine regular simplicial fans). We then apply this theory to the Kreuzer--Skarke (KS) database, where we encounter both FRSTs and vex triangulations. We study the non-weak-Fano toric varieties arising from vex triangulations, along with their CY hypersurfaces. In particular, we show that all fine regular triangulations of a fixed 4D reflexive polytope give rise to smooth birational CY hypersurfaces, extending Batyrev's result from FRSTs to vex triangulations. We exhaustively enumerate all $24,023,940$ fine regular triangulations in the KS database with $h^{1,1}\\leq 7$, of which over $70\\%$ are vex triangulations, and provide an upper bound of $10^{979}$ for fine regular triangulations in the entire KS database.

Beyond the common statement that Rayleigh scattering is the primary mechanism behind the multiple colored appearances of the sky, it appears that the relationship between material parameters and the colors that appear in different observation conditions has not been thoroughly explored so far. The present study aims to offer a general overview of the structural colors accessible by Rayleigh scattering as a function of the material parameters, alongside a scalable and environment-friendly process to realize solid composite materials with targeted structural colors in reflection and transmission. Monte Carlo light transport simulations are performed to compute the structural color palette of disordered colloids -- dielectric particles in a nonscattering matrix -- in different observation modes. In particular, we provide a range of physical parameters in which the materials exhibit the same blue color in diffuse reflection and transmission. We also show that, as may be counterintuitive at first, the addition of black absorbents to the matrix of a white (opaque) material can lead to the emergence of a blue coloration in diffuse reflection, thanks to the interplay between multiple light scattering and light absorption. These predictions are validated by optical experiments on colloidal suspensions of Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (ZrO$_2$:Y$_2$O$_3$) nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The potential of Rayleigh-scattering materials for visual arts and design is further supported by realizing solid-state composites based on abundant materials, namely borosilicate clays and hybrid silica-based glasses, using soft chemistry at room temperature."}

In this study, we examine the dissociation of H$_2$ on a large octahedral Ag nanoshell under varying field intensity, frequency, and duration, and we explore the possibility of identifying optimal modeling conditions accessible with current TDDFT simulations.

The switching is governed by two main sources of current transients: i) spin currents pumped by the reference layer, and ii) spin-polarized currents due to non-equilibrium hot electrons excited by the laser pulse. In particular, an initial superdiffusive forward flow of electrons, polarized by the free layer, is generated. This drives parallel to antiparallel switching of the free layer through accumulation of minority spins at the reference layer. A diffusive backward flow of electrons, repolarized by the reference layer, follows the initial superdiffusive flow as the charge distribution re-equilibrates.

Strong lensing will produce multiple identical copies of the GW signal arriving at different times. Jana et al.~\\cite{Jana_2023} recently proposed a method to constrain cosmological parameters using strongly lensed GW events detected by next-generation (XG) detectors. The idea is that the number of strongly lensed GW events and the distribution of their lensing time delays encode imprints of the cosmological parameters. From the observed number of lensed GW events (tens of thousands) and their time delay distribution, this method can provide a new probe of cosmology, obtaining information at intermediate redshifts. In this work, we explore the possibility of doing lensing cosmography using upcoming observations of the upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. This requires incorporating the detector network selection effects in the analysis, which was neglected earlier. We expect dozens of lensed GW events to be detected by upgraded LVK detectors, potentially enabling modest constraints on cosmological parameters. Even with relatively modest numbers of lensed detections, we demonstrate the potential of lensing cosmography. For XG detectors, our revised forecasts are consistent with with the earlier forecasts that neglected the selection effects."}

This is shown to hold in the opposite manner to which it is routinely assumed, because in fact the fidelity a state has to an ideal GKP state is only upper bounded by the stabilizer expectation values.

Existing predictive models typically infer scalar kinetic parameters at a full SOC or a few discrete SOC levels, preventing them from capturing the continuous SOC dependence that governs exothermic behavior during abuse conditions. To address this, we apply the Kolmogorov-Arnold Chemical Reaction Neural Network (KA-CRNN) framework to learn continuous and realistic SOC-dependent exothermic cathode-electrolyte interactions. We apply a physics-encoded KA-CRNN to learn SOC-dependent kinetic parameters for cathode-electrolyte decomposition directly from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. A mechanistically informed reaction pathway is embedded into the network architecture, enabling the activation energies, pre-exponential factors, enthalpies, and related parameters to be represented as continuous and fully interpretable functions of the SOC. The framework is demonstrated for NCA, NM, and NMA cathodes, yielding models that reproduce DSC heat-release features across all SOCs and provide interpretable insight into SOC-dependent oxygen-release and phase-transformation mechanisms. This approach establishes a foundation for extending kinetic parameter dependencies to additional environmental and electrochemical variables, supporting more accurate and interpretable thermal-runaway prediction and monitoring."}

There, being able to apply operations probabilistically (stochastic LOCC) does not increase the Schmidt number. Our findings show that certain non-entangling operations become entangling when selecting on specific measurement outcomes.

Our construction interpolates between the 1/2-BPS D3-D3 system and its field theory dual at one end, and the holographic duality presented in arXiv: 2506.14505 at the other. On the gravity side, the defect is realised by a novel D5 probe brane embedded in the $AdS_5\\times S^5$ geometry. The symmetry of the induced on the D5 brane metric is $AdS_3\\times S^1\\times S^2$. At a certain limit the D5 brane becomes singular and resembles the D3-D3 system. Consistency requires the presence of two D7 branes on which the D5 brane terminates. The existence of boundaries induces a gauge anomaly for the D5 brane which is cancelled through anomaly inflow from the D7 branes. The full system of the D5 and D7 branes is, thus, anomaly free. Also it does not have any tachyonic instabilities for a certain range of its parameters. On the field theory side, we determined the classical solution of the ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM equations of motion which we conjecture to describe the defect dual to the D5-D7 system and comment on the identification of the parameters appearing at the two sides of the duality."}

Gen. Phys. 27, 37 (1943)] and by Hodgkin-Katz [J. of Physio 108, 37 (1949)] derived the foundational framework for interpreting electro-physiological measurements in what is commonly termed the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) theory for the membrane potential. Both seminal papers postulate a constant/uniform electric field within the ion channel. Using a uniform electric field allows for a simple, straightforward calculation of the ionic fluxes and the transmembrane potential, which yields the famous GHK potential. The use of this framework is so widely accepted that one can find a plethora of works that no longer cite the original works and GHK has perhaps become the universal and indisputable descriptor of the underlying physics and biology. In recent works [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 228401 (2025) and Phys. Rev. E 111, 064408 (2025)], we revisited GHK and its assumption of a uniform field. Non-approximated numerical simulations showed that the electric field is not always uniform. To understand this discrepancy, it is important to understand that the governing equations can be solved using two different approaches: the GHK approach of assuming a constant electric field or postulating that the system is electroneutral. Each approach yields drastically different non-commutative results. The purpose of this report is to provide a non-mathematical summary of the results and to inform the broader community that GHK is not as universal as previously thought. We will discuss these two newer works, with some emphasis on how they can potentially revolutionize the interpretation of electro-physiological measurements. Importantly, we show that this new framework, which utilizes the mathematical tools developed by the electrodialysis community, also serves as a bridge linking the electrophysiology community and the electrodialysis community."}

The theory allows for interaction terms between the two tetrads, whose structure displays some similarities with ghost-free bigravity. The extra gravitational degrees of freedom survive in the commutative limit. We show the effective action obtained in this limit, discuss its symmetries, and compare it with other bigravity theories.

Current methods of fabricating devices in polariton microcavities largely involve patterning the devices via e-beam lithography before the cavity is completed, which offers less flexibility in device creation and reduces the maximum possible refractive index contrast. Moreover, the momentum and spatial distributions of the condensate are highly dependent on the host platform, and it has been difficult to preserve the desired behavior when modifying a given cavity. Here we introduce a method that addresses both of these challenges with the creation of polaritonic circuits of arbitrary forms etched via Focused Ion Beam into an organic microcavity based on Rhodamine 3B Perchlorate within a Small Molecule Ionic Isolation Lattices complex. We demonstrate room temperature condensation and propagation of polaritons in rectangular and trapezoidal waveguides by analyzing spatial and angle-resolved photoluminescence. We also discuss the blue-shifting and non-zero momentum of the condensate and show that it is strongly confined up to several higher energy levels. As an example, we report the spatial profiles of condensation in custom devices, such as a ring waveguide, a Y-splitter, and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

We use the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm to extract the ground states of an 18-leg cylindrical strip geometry, making the diameter significantly wider than in previous works. This approach allows us to map out the range of possible stripe filling fractions on the electron versus hole-doped side. We find good agreement with established results, suggesting that the spread of filling fractions observed in the literature is governed by the physics of a single stripe. Taking a microscopic look at stripe formation, we reveal two separate regimes - a high-filling regime captured by a simplified squeezed-space model and a low-filling regime characterized by the structure of individual pairs of dopants. Thereby, we trace back the phenomenology of the striped phase to its microscopic constituents and highlight the different challenges for observing the two regimes in quantum simulation experiments."}

Interpolating AA with other quasiperiodic potentials reveals competing gap-opening mechanisms, ranging from AA-dominated gaps at small interpolation parameters to a robust half-filling gap generated by the competing disorders at large parameters. Entanglement entropy follows the area law at low and high magnetic fields but shows pronounced deviations at intermediate fields, with opposite trends for strong AA versus other quasiperiodic potentials.

We track these resources in a subsystem of a one-dimensional qubit chain evolved by random brickwall circuits. For resource-generating gates, evolution from low-resource states exhibits a universal rise-peak-fall behavior, with the peak time scaling logarithmically with subsystem size and the resource eventually decaying as the subsystem approaches a maximally mixed state. Circuits whose gates do not create the resource but entangle neighboring qubits, give rise to a ballistic spreading of quantum resource initially confined to a region of the initial state.

Despite extensive study, the frictional forces and energetics governing its torque generation remain poorly understood. Here, we combine single-molecule rotation measurements with stochastic thermodynamics to quantitatively estimate its effective torque, viscous drag and activation energy barriers. We present three complementary methods based on solutions to the Smoluchowski equation for overdamped diffusion in a tilted periodic potential, which use as input the steady-state angular velocity and rotational diffusion data from individual \\textit{E. coli} motors spanning different dynamical regimes. Crucially, these three methods require neither active external torque control, nor prior knowledge of the system's viscous drag or the motor's torque output. The first method assumes as input a model-dependent sinusoidal potential (single Fourier mode), albeit with unknown periodicity, yielding closed-form results in the low- and high-tilt limits, whereas the last two methods use a full Fourier-based reconstruction to output the now model-independent potential landscape. These approaches yield consistent estimates of the potential periodicity ($\\approx$ 26-fold symmetry), energy barrier height ($\\approx 2\\!-\\!4 k_{\\rm B}T$), and internal friction coefficient ($\\approx 0.1$ pN nm s rad$^{-2}$).

We find a rich phase diagram: in one spatial dimension, charge is always easy to learn, while dipole moment can be either easy or hard. In two dimensions, we find three phases: for frequent measurements, both charge and dipole moment are easy to learn; as the measurement rate is decreased, first dipole moment and then charge become hard.

We give a constructive method to generate a large class of such extreme WPS, which combines the following steps: (i) we characterize the phase-invariant extreme points of the superset of Wigner-positive quasi-states (WPQS); (ii) we introduce a new quantum map, named Vertigo map, which maps extreme WPQS to extreme WPS while preserving phase invariance; (iii) we identify families of extremality-preserving maps and use them to obtain extreme WPS while relaxing phase invariance. Our construction generates all extreme WPS of low dimension, starting from a specific kind of WPS known as beam-splitter states. Our results build upon new mathematical properties of the set of WPS derived in a companion paper and unveil the remarkable structure of mixed states with non-negative Wigner functions."}

We perform an explicit one-loop computation in the theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions, using for the case study the divergent part of the action on a background with non-trivial shift vector; the background spatial metric is taken to be flat and the background lapse function is set to 1. No truncations are assumed at the level of perturbations, for which we develop a diagrammatic technique and a version of the heat-kernel method. We isolate dangerous linear-in-frequency divergences in the two-point function of the shift, which can lead to spatial non-localities, and explicitly verify their cancellation. This leaves a fully local expression for the divergent part of the quadratic effective action, from which we extract the beta functions for the Newton constant and the essential coupling $λ$ in the kinetic term of the metric. We formulate the questions that need to be addressed to prove perturbative renormalizability of the non-projectable Hořava gravity."}

To address the curse of dimensionality, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed as a baseline dimensionality reduction technique. The optimal number of principal components was determined to be two, retaining more than 99% of the total variance. This selection was supported by the analysis of the covariance matrix, eigenvalue distribution, and the scree plot. Projecting the data onto the first two principal components enabled improved visualization and interpretability compared to the original high-dimensional feature space. The reduced representation also revealed a clearer separation of target values, effectively decreasing data complexity. To evaluate the impact of dimensionality reduction on predictive performance, a Random Forest regression model was trained to estimate soil moisture from the PCA-transformed data.

We show that this does not have to be the case: under restricted operational access, classical correlations can appear nonseparable when expressed in the formalism of quantum mechanics. If an observer is limited to a constrained set of measurements and transformations, certain classical phase-space distributions can mimic entanglement-like behaviours. Imposing positivity of the associated Hilbert space operator as a physicality requirement removes some of these representational artifacts, revealing a regime in which nonseparability is genuine but still reproducible by classical models. Only when the operational restrictions on the observer are lifted further--allowing operational tests of measurement incompatibility or other nonclassical signatures--does one obtain entanglement that can no longer be captured by any classical description. This operational hierarchy distinguishes classical artifacts, classically reproducible nonseparability, and genuine entanglement."}

From the temporal profiles of the nonlinear pump-probe and photon-echo signals, we found that the bright mode relaxation time is almost twice the time for the coherent exchange of energy between the two coupled resonators.

We demonstrate this behavior using classical and quantum simulations with Haar-random and phase-flip noise, respectively, on a spin-1/2 chain with a local Hamiltonian. Our non-integrable model sees ~3.5x faster thermalization in the presence of noise, while our integrable model, which would not otherwise thermalize, reaches a thermal state due to noise. Since certifying a local Gibbs state is relatively easy on a quantum computer, our approach provides a new practical solution to a key problem in quantum computing. More broadly, these results establish a new paradigm in which noise can be harnessed on quantum computers, enabling practical advantages before the years of fault-tolerance."}

It enables us to manipulate single modes in nonlinear interactions with precision at the quantum level without involved setups. This setting is useful in the field of analogue gravity (AG), where gravitational phenomena are investigated in accessible analogue lab setups. These lecture notes provide an account of this AG framework and applications. Although light in nonlinear dielectrics is discussed in textbooks, the involved modelling often includes many assumptions that are directed at optical communications, some of which are rarely detailed. Here, we provide a self-contained and sufficiently detailed description of the propagation of light in fibers, with a minimal set of assumptions, which is relevant in the context of AG. Starting with the structure of a step-index fiber, we derive linear-optics propagating modes and show that the transverse electric field of the fundamental mode is well approximated as linearly polarized and of a Gaussian profile. We then incorporate a cubic nonlinearity and derive a general wave envelope propagation equation. With further simplifying assumptions, we arrive at the famous nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which governs fundamental effects in nonlinear fibers, such as solitons. As a first application in AG, we show how intense light in the medium creates an effective background spacetime for probe light akin to the propagation of a scalar field in a black hole spacetime. We introduce optical horizons and particle production in this effective spacetime, giving rise to the optical Hawking effect. Furthermore, we discuss two related light emission mechanisms. Finally, we present a second optical analogue model for the oscillations of black holes, the quasinormal modes, which are important in the program of black hole spectroscopy."}

In addition to its significance for emission control, the model emphasizes the bosonic characteristics of plasmonic quasi-particles, which are coherent many-electron excitations of the states of quasi-normal modes. Unlike conventional cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED), where the emitter and cavity exist as separate systems, a plasmonic quasi-particle functions as a quantum emitter embedded within a self-created resonant near-field nano-cavity of confined radial fields, sharing the spectral characteristics of the surface transverse-magnetic (TM) modes, which include nonradiative damping effects resulting from, e.g., ohmic losses in a metal. This work extends Fermi's Golden Rule to include the coupling between the emission process and the self-generated cavity impact.

We use the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm to extract the ground states of an 18-leg cylindrical strip geometry, making the diameter significantly wider than in previous works. This approach allows us to map out the range of possible stripe filling fractions on the electron versus hole-doped side.

Despite the attractive self-interaction, which is necessary for producing the bullets (bright solitons), and which readily leads to the collapse in the 3D setting as well as to spontaneous splitting of vortex modes, we find a critical value of the trapping depth securing the stabilization of the vortex bullets. We identify experimental conditions for the creation of these topological modes in the context of coherent optical and matter waves. Collisions between the bullets moving in the unconfined direction are found to be elastic. These findings contribute to the understanding of self-trapping in nonlinear multidimensional systems and suggest new possibilities for the stabilization and control of 3D topological solitons."}

The exploration has been successfully guided by the paradigm of ideal flat Chern bands, which mimic Landau levels in both band topology and local quantum geometry. Yet, given the near-infinite possibilities for Bloch bands in lattices, it remains a major open question whether FQAH states can emerge in scenarios fundamentally different from this paradigm. Here we turn to a class of gapless flat bands, featuring divergent quantum geometry at singular band touching, non-integer Berry flux threading the Brillouin zone (BZ), and ill-defined band topology. Our exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations unambiguously demonstrate FQAH phase that is virtually independent of the interaction strength, persisting from the weak-interaction to the strong-interaction limit. We find the stability of the FQAH states does not uniquely correlate with the singularity strength or the BZ-averaged quantum geometric fluctuations. Instead, the many-body topological order can adapt to the singular and fluctuating quantum geometric landscape by spontaneously developing an inhomogeneous carrier distribution, while its quenching accompanies the drop in the occupation-weighted Berry flux. Our work reveals a profound interplay between quantum geometry and many-body correlation, and significantly expands the design space for exploring FQAH effect and flat-band correlation phenomena in general."}

While calcium imaging has been firmly established as a workhorse technique for monitoring neuronal activity, its limited temporal resolution and indirect measurement restrict its ability to capture rapid inhibitory and excitatory events and subthreshold voltage oscillations. In contrast, voltage imaging directly measures membrane potential fluctuations, providing a comprehensive and precise representation of neuronal circuit dynamics. Recent advancements in voltage-sensitive dyes and, particularly, genetically encoded voltage indicators have significantly enhanced the feasibility of voltage imaging, prompting the development of advanced fluorescence microscopy methods optimized for high-speed acquisition. However, achieving millisecond-scale temporal resolution remains challenging due to inherent trade-offs among imaging speed, spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio. Conventional raster-scanning approaches, including confocal microscopy, are fundamentally limited by their slow frame rates, precluding the capture of rapid neuronal events from multiple neurons simultaneously. Alternative techniques such as random-access scanning, spatiotemporal multiplexing, and computational optical imaging have successfully addressed these constraints, enabling kilohertz-level imaging of neuronal activity in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional contexts.

We perform an explicit one-loop computation in the theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions, using for the case study the divergent part of the action on a background with non-trivial shift vector; the background spatial metric is taken to be flat and the background lapse function is set to 1. No truncations are assumed at the level of perturbations, for which we develop a diagrammatic technique and a version of the heat-kernel method. We isolate dangerous linear-in-frequency divergences in the two-point function of the shift, which can lead to spatial non-localities, and explicitly verify their cancellation. This leaves a fully local expression for the divergent part of the quadratic effective action, from which we extract the beta functions for the Newton constant and the essential coupling $λ$ in the kinetic term of the metric.

For solving the inverse problem of designing new metasurfaces that transform EM fields in a desirable manner, it is often necessary to explore large design spaces through full-wave simulations that can be computationally demanding. In this work, we demonstrate that neural operators, which are artificial neural network architectures designed to learn operators between function spaces, can effectively approximate the differential operators underlying Maxwell's equations, enabling their use as fast and accurate 3D surrogate models that can predict 3D EM fields transformed by metasurfaces. To calibrate neural operators, we generate synthetic training data consisting of 3D metasurface geometries together with their associated 3D EM fields obtained by numerically solving Maxwell's equations. Using the generated synthetic data, we train physics-informed neural operators to minimize physical inconsistencies of predicted EM fields by incorporating residuals that capture deviations from Maxwell's equations. We observe that a training dataset consisting of fewer than 5000 examples already suffices to achieve reasonable results. In particular, our experiments show that the resulting 3D surrogate model achieves high predictive performance across a wide range of metasurface geometries, including types of structures not encountered during training. Notably, it predicts diffraction efficiencies with relative errors of 3.9 % and provides a 67-fold speedup compared to conventional 3D simulations. Overall, once trained, our 3D surrogate model can rapidly predict EM fields for previously unseen metasurface geometries, which can facilitate efficient gradient-based design of nanostructured materials for EM wave control."}

The above off-shell nilpotent symmetry transformations are nothing but the BRST, co-BRST, anti-BRST and anti-co-BRST, under which, the Lagrangian densities transform to the total spacetime derivatives. The proof of the uniqueness of the above bosonic symmetry transformation operator crucially depends on the validity of all the four Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions that exist on our theory. We highlight the importance of these CF-type restrictions, at various levels of our theoretical discussions, in the context of the unique bosonic transformation. We compare this observation against the backdrop of the three CF-type restrictions that appear in the requirements of the absolute anticommutativity of the specific set of nilpotent symmetries."}

In this study, we examine the dissociation of H$_2$ on a large octahedral Ag nanoshell under varying field intensity, frequency, and duration, and we explore the possibility of identifying optimal modeling conditions accessible with current TDDFT simulations. We show that using this large nanoshell that consists in the outer layer of the Ag$_{231}$ cluster, it is still possible to disentangle the role of the plasmon from strong-field effects at applied field intensities as high as $(2-8) \\times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. In particular, although strong-field effects are always present at these intensities, we find that the excited plasmon dominates the dissociation process at the lowest applied intensity of $2 \\times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, at the highest intensity, at which strong-field effects become dominant, the plasmon contributes to accelerating the dissociation of the molecule.

It enables us to manipulate single modes in nonlinear interactions with precision at the quantum level without involved setups. This setting is useful in the field of analogue gravity (AG), where gravitational phenomena are investigated in accessible analogue lab setups. These lecture notes provide an account of this AG framework and applications. Although light in nonlinear dielectrics is discussed in textbooks, the involved modelling often includes many assumptions that are directed at optical communications, some of which are rarely detailed. Here, we provide a self-contained and sufficiently detailed description of the propagation of light in fibers, with a minimal set of assumptions, which is relevant in the context of AG. Starting with the structure of a step-index fiber, we derive linear-optics propagating modes and show that the transverse electric field of the fundamental mode is well approximated as linearly polarized and of a Gaussian profile. We then incorporate a cubic nonlinearity and derive a general wave envelope propagation equation. With further simplifying assumptions, we arrive at the famous nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which governs fundamental effects in nonlinear fibers, such as solitons. As a first application in AG, we show how intense light in the medium creates an effective background spacetime for probe light akin to the propagation of a scalar field in a black hole spacetime. We introduce optical horizons and particle production in this effective spacetime, giving rise to the optical Hawking effect. Furthermore, we discuss two related light emission mechanisms. Finally, we present a second optical analogue model for the oscillations of black holes, the quasinormal modes, which are important in the program of black hole spectroscopy."}

In the context of multistate Landau-Zener models -- $N$-state quantum systems with linearly time-dependent Hamiltonians -- the theory of integrability provides a framework for identifying new solvable cases. In particular, it was proved that the integrability of a specific class known as the multitime Landau-Zener (MTLZ) models guarantees their exact solvability. A key finding was that an $N$-state MTLZ model can be represented by data defined on an $N$-vertex graph. While known host graphs for MTLZ models include hypercubes, fans, and their Cartesian products, no other families have been discovered, leading to the conjecture that these are the only possibilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic graph-theoretical search for integrable models within the MTLZ class. By first identifying minimal structures that a graph must contain to host an MTLZ model, we formulate an efficient algorithm to systematically search for candidate graphs for MTLZ models. Implementing this algorithm using computational software, we enumerate all candidate graphs with up to $N = 13$ vertices and perform an in-depth analysis of those with $N \\le 11$. Our results corroborate the aforementioned conjecture for graphs up to $11$ vertices. For even larger graphs, we propose a specific family, termed descendants of ``$(0,2)$-graphs'', as promising candidates that may violate the conjecture above. Our work can serve as a guideline to identify new exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models in the future."}

Despite many theoretical models, decoherence remains a severe challenge and practical platforms are still rare. Here we propose the QB based on the degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO), using the signal field as the energy-storage unit. We carefully separate the ergotropy into coherent and incoherent components and find that the coherent part decays roughly half as slowly as the incoherent part. More importantly, the coherent ergotropy and the average charging power reach their respective maxima at essentially the same moment, i.e., $γ_s t \\approx 10$. This coincidence defines the optimal instant to switch off the pump. Finally, coupling the QB to a two-level system (TLS) as the load, we demonstrate an efficient discharge process of the QB. Our work establishes a realistic and immediately-implementable QB architecture on a mature optical platform."}

The entangled squeezed graviton states are produced by both, conventional General-Relativity (GR) type axion-gravity interactions, and gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) anomalous terms coupled to axions, which are non-trivial in the presence of rotating BHs. The two kinds of terms have different-symmetry contributions to the entangled squeezed states. The squeezing parameter is estimated in a weak-quantum-gravity framework. Some phenomenology with respect to current and future interferometric detection devices is discussed. Importantly, current data from LIGO/Virgo Experiments can impose upper-bound constraints on the value of the squeezing parameter and, thus, on the lifetime of the axionic clouds. In addition to the above rather direct-detection possibility of squeezed gravitons, there is also the possibility of indirect detection of quantum gravitons in Cosmology, given that chiral quantum gravitational-wave (GW) perturbations in the primordial Universe may imply condensation of gCS terms. This, in turn, leads to inflation of running vacuum type, with in principle observable patterns in the profile of the GW produced during the post-inflationary early radiation era, as well as the potential of alleviating cosmic tensions in the current era."}

While various methods have been proposed to solve this problem, each has their drawbacks in terms of inefficiency or sensitivity to control errors. Here, we modify Grover's algorithm to eliminate the oscillatory dynamics, such that the search proceeds as an exponential decay into the solution states. The basic idea is to convert the solution states into a reservoir by using ancilla qubits such that the initial state is nonreflectively absorbed. Trotterizing the continuous algorithm yields a quantum circuit that gives equivalent performance, which has the same quadratic quantum speedup as the original algorithm."}

Recently, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), a counterintuitive relaxation phenomenon, has attracted considerable attention and has been extensively studied in systems with global symmetries. Here, we study the QME in gauge theories with massive local gauge symmetries. In the lattice Schwinger model, we demonstrate that the gauge structure of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem is entirely determined by the initial state and remain unchanged during the time evolution. We then investigate whether gauge symmetry can be dynamically restored following a symmetric quench. Analytical and numerical results show that when the Maxwell term is zero, gauge symmetry restoration fails due to the emergence of a peculiar conservation law. However, for any finite Maxwell term, subsystem gauge symmetry is restored in the thermodynamic limit. Based on these results, we systematically construct a families of initial states exhibiting the QME. We further explore the QME in the quantum link model-a truncated lattice Schwinger model, which has been realized in experiments. Moreover, we propose an experimentally accessible order parameter that correctly captures the QME. Our work demonstrates the generality of the quantum Mpemba effect even in the local gauge symmetries, and are directly relevant to ongoing quantum simulation experiments of gauge theories."}

Typical approaches for detecting coherence employ {\\it coherence witnesses} -- observable quantities whose expectation value can be used to certify the presence of coherence. By design, coherence witnesses are only able to detect coherence for some, but not all, possible states of a quantum system. In this work we construct protocols capable of detecting the presence of coherence in an {\\it unknown} pure quantum state $|ψ\\rangle$.

Alternatively, wavefunction collapse can be interpreted as double-bracket gradient flows determined by derivatives of (stochastic) potentials defined in terms of observables with direct physical interpretations. The gradient flows minimize the variance of the monitored observable. Our derivations hold for general monitoring described by non-Hermitian jump processes.

This shortest gate time, expected to lie on the nanosecond scale, is inferred from job execution times measured in seconds by employing gate-time amplification. We apply the method to IBM's superconducting quantum processor and estimate the energy scales associated with single-, two-, and three-qubit gates. The order of estimated energy is consistent with typical drive energies in superconducting qubit systems, suggesting that current gate operations approach the quantum speed limit.

The accumulated cost of these transitions acts as a threshold that prunes the search space (up to 60% reduction for certain examples). The subsequent global stage, based on this threshold, refines the solution. Both stages utilize variants of the Grover-adaptive-search algorithm. To achieve scalability and robustness, we draw on principles from control theory and embed QuantGraph's global stage within a receding-horizon model-predictive-control scheme. This classical layer stabilizes and guides the quantum search, improving precision and reducing computational burden.

In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum states, called $A_α$-graph states, which are constructed from either unweighted or weighted graphs by taking the normalised convex combination of the degree matrix $D$ and the adjacency matrix $A_G$ of a graph $G$. The constructed states are different from the standard graph states arising from stabiliser formalism. Our approach is also different from the approach used by Braunstein et al. This class of states depend on a tunable mixing parameter $α\\in (0,1]$. We first establish the conditions under which the associated operator $ρ_α^{A_G}$ is positive semidefinite and hence represents a valid quantum state. We then derive a positive partial transposition (PPT) condition for $A_α$-graph states in terms of graph parameters. This PPT condition involves only the Frobenius norm of the adjacency matrix of the graph, the degrees of the vertices and the total number of vertices. For simple graphs, we obtain the range of the parameter $α$ for which the $A_α$-graph states represent a class of entangled states. We then develop a graph-theoretic formulation of a moments-based entanglement detection criterion, focusing on the recently proposed $p_3$-PPT criterion, which relies on the second and third moments of the partial transposition. Since the estimation of these moments is experimentally accessible via randomised measurements, swap operations, and machine-learning-based protocols, our approach provides a physically relevant framework for detecting entanglement in structured quantum states derived from graphs.

For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to trillions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood inference. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements."}

We generalize this construction to arbitrary symmetries: for any group G of unitaries, we construct a quantum channel that maps states contained in the algebra generated by G to random purifications obtained by twirling over G. In addition to giving a surprisingly concise proof of the original random purification theorem, our result implies the existence of fermionic and bosonic Gaussian purification channels. As applications, we obtain the first tomography protocol for fermionic Gaussian states that scales optimally with the number of modes and the error, as well as an improved property test for this class of states."}

In this formulation, complexity is defined as the length of the minimal geodesic in a suitably constructed geometric space associated with the Lie group of relevant operators. Despite its conceptual appeal, determining geodesic distances on Lie group manifolds is generally challenging, and existing treatments often rely on perturbative expansions in the structure constants. In this work, we circumvent these limitations by employing a finite-dimensional matrix representation of the generators, which enables an exact computation of the geodesic distance and hence a precise determination of the complexity. We focus on the $\\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ Lie algebra, relevant for quantum scalar fields evolving on homogeneous and isotropic cosmological backgrounds. The resulting expression for the complexity is applied to de Sitter spacetime as well as to asymptotically static cosmological models undergoing contraction or expansion."}

The localized active space self-consistent field method (LASSCF) uses a product of fragment active spaces as a variational space, with the Schrödinger equation solved exactly in each fragment and the fragment active-space orbitals defined in a self-consistent manner. LASSCF is accurate for systems with strong intra-fragment and weak inter-fragment correlation, and its computational cost is combinatorial with respect to the size of the individual fragment active spaces, rather than their product. However, exactly solving the Schrödinger equation in each fragment remains a substantial bottleneck. Here, we address the possibility of solving the fragment active space Schrödinger equation with approximate methods, particularly sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD). SQD is a technique that uses a quantum computer to sample configurations from a chemically motivated quantum circuit and a classical computer to mitigate errors and solve the Schrödinger equation in a subspace of the configuration space. We apply the proposed method, LASSQD, to the [Fe(H$_2$O)$_4$]$_2$bpym$^{4+}$ compound and the [Fe$^{\\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\\mathrm{II}}$($μ$$_3$-O)-(HCOO)$_6$] complex for calculating the intermediate-spin ground state energies. We observe that LASSQD can tackle fragment sizes intractable by LASSCF, achieves within 1kcal/mol agreement to LASSCF, and delivers results that are competitive with alternative classical methods to solve the Schrödinger equation, and thus can be used as a starting point for a perturbative treatment (LASSQD-PDFT) to recover correlation external to the active space."}

We map how interaction strength, lattice depth, lattice wavenumber, and pulse duration reshape the diffraction pattern, leading to an interaction-dependent population redistribution in real and momentum-space. By comparing the exact dynamics to an impulsive sudden-approximation description, we delineate the parameter regimes where it remains accurate and those, notably at strong attraction and small lattice wavenumber, where it fails. Our results provide a controlled few-body benchmark for interacting Kapitza-Dirac scattering and quantitative guidance for Kapitza-Dirac-based probes of ultracold atomic systems."}

The emitters exhibit bright, highly polarized emission that couples efficiently into WS$_2$ waveguides. Under resonant p-shell excitation, we observe high-purity, waveguide-coupled single-photon emission, measured using both an off-chip Hanbury Brown-Twiss configuration ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.003^{+0.030}_{-0.003}$) and an on-chip configuration ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.076\\pm0.023$). For a single output, the out-coupled single-photon count rate at the first lens reaches approximately 320 kHz under continuous-wave p-shell excitation, corresponding to an estimated waveguide-coupled rate of 1.7 MHz. These results demonstrate an efficient, integrated single-photon source and establish a pathway toward scalable photonic quantum information processing centered around nanoengineered van der Waals materials."}

In this framework spacetime has an intrinsic non-locality, rendering the standard linear superposition principle only an approximation valid in the absence of gravitational effects. We then invert the logic by assuming the validity of linear superposition and demonstrate that such superpositions inevitably become unstable once gravity is included. The resulting wave-function collapse arises from a fundamental tension between the equivalence principle and the quantum superposition principle in a semiclassical spacetime background. We further show that wave functions computed in inertial and freely falling frames differ by a gravitationally induced phase shift containing linear and cubic time contributions along with a constant global term. These corrections produce a global phase change and lead to a spontaneous, model-independent collapse time inversely proportional to the mass of the system."}

To elucidate the unified origin of this anomaly, we further study the dynamics of defect production at topologically distinct QCPs in free-fermion models and demonstrate similar anomalous universal scaling exclusive to topological criticality. These findings establish the existence of anomalous dynamical scaling arising from the interplay between topology and driven dynamics, challenging standard paradigms of quantum critical dynamics."}

We introduce a photonics-based method that augments graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with PEs derived from light propagation on synthetic frequency lattices whose couplings match the input graph. We simulate propagation and readout to obtain internode intensity correlation matrices, which are used as PEs in GCNs to provide global structural information. Evaluated on Long Range Graph Benchmark molecular datasets, the method outperforms baseline GCNs with Laplacian based PEs, achieving $6.3\\%$ lower mean absolute error for regression and $2.3\\%$ higher average precision for classification tasks using a two-layer GCN as a baseline. When implemented in high repetition rate photonic hardware, correlation measurements can enable fast feature generation by bypassing digital simulation of PEs.

It enables us to manipulate single modes in nonlinear interactions with precision at the quantum level without involved setups. This setting is useful in the field of analogue gravity (AG), where gravitational phenomena are investigated in accessible analogue lab setups. These lecture notes provide an account of this AG framework and applications. Although light in nonlinear dielectrics is discussed in textbooks, the involved modelling often includes many assumptions that are directed at optical communications, some of which are rarely detailed. Here, we provide a self-contained and sufficiently detailed description of the propagation of light in fibers, with a minimal set of assumptions, which is relevant in the context of AG. Starting with the structure of a step-index fiber, we derive linear-optics propagating modes and show that the transverse electric field of the fundamental mode is well approximated as linearly polarized and of a Gaussian profile. We then incorporate a cubic nonlinearity and derive a general wave envelope propagation equation. With further simplifying assumptions, we arrive at the famous nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which governs fundamental effects in nonlinear fibers, such as solitons. As a first application in AG, we show how intense light in the medium creates an effective background spacetime for probe light akin to the propagation of a scalar field in a black hole spacetime. We introduce optical horizons and particle production in this effective spacetime, giving rise to the optical Hawking effect. Furthermore, we discuss two related light emission mechanisms. Finally, we present a second optical analogue model for the oscillations of black holes, the quasinormal modes, which are important in the program of black hole spectroscopy."}

This phase is particularly challenging to study numerically due to finite-size effects. By investigating the formation of long, isolated stripes, we offer a perspective complementary to typical finite-doping phase diagrams. We use the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm to extract the ground states of an 18-leg cylindrical strip geometry, making the diameter significantly wider than in previous works. This approach allows us to map out the range of possible stripe filling fractions on the electron versus hole-doped side. We find good agreement with established results, suggesting that the spread of filling fractions observed in the literature is governed by the physics of a single stripe. Taking a microscopic look at stripe formation, we reveal two separate regimes - a high-filling regime captured by a simplified squeezed-space model and a low-filling regime characterized by the structure of individual pairs of dopants. Thereby, we trace back the phenomenology of the striped phase to its microscopic constituents and highlight the different challenges for observing the two regimes in quantum simulation experiments."}
