### [1] [On the edge of complexity: The simplest not simple coupled mechanical system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01379)
*Gergely Nyitray*

Main category: physics.class-ph

TL;DR: 研究显示，当一个 hoop 和 cylinder 通过弹簧连接并绕中心转动时，其中心质量不会静止，这与它们的转动惯量有关。当转动惯量相同时，静摩擦消失，但通过调整弹簧两端的固定点高度，可以让中心质量保持静止。动力学方程通过动力学方程、拉格朗日方程和哈密顿方程推导，并涉及静摩擦力的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中心质量是否保持静止对了解耦体动力学系统具有重要意义，尤其是在机械和机器人设计中。

Method: 利用动态方程、拉格朗日方程和哈密顿方程推导系统的运动方程，分析静摩擦力的关系。

Result: 系统在转动惯量相同时静摩擦消失，可以通过调整弹簧固定端高度使中心质量保持静止。

Conclusion: 调整系统参数可通过：1. 消除静摩擦，2. 通过动量守恒维持平衡。

Abstract: We show that during normal modes of an oscillatory system consisting of a
hoop and a cylinder joining their centers by an ideal spring, its central mass
does not remain at rest. This effect is due to the resultant external static
friction forces acting on the system which disappears when the coupled rigid
bodies have the same moment of inertia. However, in case of different moment of
inertia by proper positioning the two fixed end points of the spring
vertically, it is shown that the central mass of the system remains at rest.
The equation of motion of the coupled system is derived using dynamic
equations, Lagrange's equations, Hamilton's equations and even by applying the
conservation laws of energy and angular momentum. The relationship between the
static friction forces acting on the rigid bodies is also examined.

### [2] [Not All Uniform B-Fields Are The Same!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01518)
*Benjamin K. Luna,Murray S. Daw*

Main category: physics.class-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the effect of turning off a uniform B-field in a charged rectangular-plate capacitor, highlighting how different source configurations can lead to the same B-field but different dynamics. It emphasizes the role of the vector potential in understanding these phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the causal structure of electrodynamics, particularly through a simple setup involving a capacitor and a magnetic field. It's inspired by a well-known textbook problem but adds new insights into the local nature of B-fields and electromagnetics.

Method: Quasi-static analysis of the system when the B-field is turned off.

Result: Different sources can produce the same B-field but lead to different dynamic behaviors upon turning off the field. The vector potential provides deeper insights into induction and related aspects.

Conclusion: Understanding the vector potential can significantly enhance comprehension of induction phenomena and other key areas in electrodynamics.

Abstract: Set up a charged rectangular-plate capacitor in a uniform $\mathbf{B}$-field.
Quasi-statically turn off the $\mathbf{B}$-field - what happens? We show that
this seemingly simple induction problem (which appears in a famous
undergraduate electrodynamics textbook) highlights the causal structure of
electrodynamics. It may be (as it is in this problem) that different source
configurations can produce the same uniform $\mathbf{B}$-field over some finite
region, but very different dynamics when the source is turned off. We see also
that the vector potential gives more information about the source of the
$\mathbf{B}$-field, and is a very useful (and under-appreciated) way to
understand induction and other key aspects of electrodynamics.

Abstract: We present a two-tone heterodyne optical readout scheme to extract
unequal-time density correlations along an arbitrary stationary interaction
path from a pancake-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate, using a modulated laser
probe. Analysing the measurement noise both from imprecision and backaction, we
identify the standard quantum limit for the signal-extraction scheme, and
examine how a class of two-mode squeezed initial states can be used to push
beyond this limit. As an application, we show how the readout scheme can be
used for an experimental realisation of acceleration-dependence of
quantum-vacuum fluctuations in the system, including the analogue spacetime
circular motion Unruh effect.

Abstract: BEC-based quantum sensors offer a huge, yet not fully explored potential in
gravimetry and accelerometry. In this paper, we study a possible setup for such
a device, which is a weakly interacting Bose gas trapped in a double-well
potential. In such a trap, the gas is known to exhibit Josephson oscillations,
which rely on the coherence between the potential wells. Applying the density
matrix approach, we consider transitions between the coherent, partially
incoherent, and fully incoherent states of the Bose gas. We show how, due to
the presence of weak interactions, collisional decoherence causes the Josephson
oscillations to decay with time. We further study the interplay of collisional
interaction and external acceleration, which leads to shifts of the oscillation
frequency. Finally, we investigate how this effect can be used to build a BEC
double-well accelerometer and give analytical expressions for its expected
sensitivity.

Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium quantum dynamics and thermodynamics of
free fermions suddenly coupled to a localized defect in a one-dimensional
harmonic trap. This setup realizes a quantum quench transformation that gives
rise to the orthogonalization of the system's wave-function as an effect of the
localized perturbation. Using the Loschmidt echo and the Kirkwood-Dirac
quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution of the work done by the defect, we quantify
the extent and rate of the orthogonalization dynamics. In particular, we show
that initializing the system in a coherent superpositions of energy eigenstates
leads to non-classical features, such as Wigner function's negativity and
non-positivity of the work KDQ distribution. Starting from simple
single-particle superpositions and then progressing with coherent and cat
states of few-body fermionic systems, we uncover how quantum coherence and
few-body correlations shape the out-of-equilibrium response due to the presence
of the defect.

Abstract: By exciting the transverse breathing mode of an elongated Bose-Einstein
condensate, we parametrically produce longitudinal collective excitations in a
pairwise manner. This process also referred to as Faraday wave generation, can
be seen as an analog to cosmological particle production. Building upon single
particle detection, we investigate the early time dynamics of the exponential
growth and compare our observation with a Bogoliubov description. The growth
rate we observe experimentally is in very good agreement with theoretical
predictions, demonstrating the validity of the Bogoliubov description and
thereby confirming the smallness of quasiparticle interactions in such an
elongated gas. We also discuss the presence of oscillations in the atom number,
which are due to pair correlations and to the rate at which interactions are
switched off.

### [7] [Bose-Hubbard model in the canonical ensemble: a beyond mean-field approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01692)

Abstract: Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are versatile testbeds to study and
manipulate equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium aspects of quantum many-body
systems whose behavior can be described by Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. In this
paper, we consider an ansatz wave-function which respects total particle-number
conservation for such systems and goes beyond mean-field theory; this
wave-function has the same complexity in the number of parameters as the
mean-field Gutzwiller ansatz, and captures quantum correlations and
entanglement via projection onto an effective low-energy manifold. This ansatz
can be exploited to study quantum phases observed in a large class of systems
realizable in such experimental platforms and is useful to study quantum
dynamics. We show that the relaxation dynamics of various out-of-equilibrium
initial states under sudden quench of Hamiltonian parameters can be studied
with this ansatz wavefunction within the framework of time-dependent
variational principle. We present a quantitative comparison with small-scale
exact diagonalization results in the 1D Bose-Hubbard model with and without
external trapping potentials.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral properties of
bosons harmonically confined in a quasi-2D plane and interacting via repulsive
Gaussian potential. We consider the lowest $100$ energy levels for systems of
$N=12, 16$ and $20$ bosons both for the moderate and strong interaction regimes
for the non-rotating ($L_{z}=0$) and the rotating single-vortex state
($L_{z}=N$). For higher angular momenta, $L_{z}=2N$ and $L_{z}=3N$, only the
strong interaction regime is considered. While the nearest-neighbor spacing
distribution (NNSD) $P(s)$ and the ratios of consecutive level spacings
distribution $P(r)$ are used to study the short-range correlations, the
Dyson-Mehta $\Delta_3$ statistic and the level number variance $\Sigma^2(L)$
are used to examine the long-range correlations. In the moderate interaction
regime when the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, the
non-rotating system exhibits a Poisson distribution, characteristic of the
regular energy spectra. In the strong interaction regime when the interaction
energy is comparable to the trap energy, the non-rotating system exhibits
chaotic behavior signified by GOE distribution. Furthermore, in the rotating
case for the single-vortex state ($L_{z} = N$) in the moderate interaction
regime, the system exhibits signatures of weak chaos with some degree of
regularity in the energy-level spectra. However, in the strong interaction
regime for the rotating case with $L_{z} = N$, $2N$ and $3N$, the system
exhibits strong chaotic behavior. The rotation is found to contribute to an
enhancement of chaotic behavior in the system for both the moderate and the
strong interaction regimes. Our results of NNSD analysis are supported by the
analysis of the ratios of consecutive level spacings distribution $P(r)$.

### [9] [Supercurrents and tunneling in massive many-vortex necklaces and star-lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01825)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper explores the behavior of multi-vortex states in Bose-Einstein condensate mixtures, their dynamics, and the interplay between vortex configuration and mass transfer. Understanding these phenomena can provide insights into quantum supercurrents and potential applications in atomtronics.

Method: The paper uses numerical simulations to model multi-vortex states in Bose-Einstein condensate mixtures under various geometric constraints and with different numbers of vortices and masses. The simulations help reveal the conditions under which Josephson supercurrents and other phenomena can occur.

Result: The simulations show that in Bose-Einstein condensate mixtures, multi-vortex states can exhibit both disordered and periodic tunneling behaviors depending on the vortex configuration and mass transfer. This suggests that the relative stability of many-vortex systems is influenced by the geometry and the dynamics of the vortices. Additionally, the results imply that the onset of Josephson supercurrents can be influenced by the interplay of vortex dynamics and inter-component tunneling. Finally, the findings suggest potential applications in the design of new quantum devices such as atomtronic systems.

Conclusion: The study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of multi-vortex states in cold atom mixtures and the factors influencing their stability and tunneling behavior. These insights can enhance our understanding of quantum supercurrents in rotating systems and guide the development of atomtronics devices.

Abstract: Recently, cold atoms mixtures have attracted broad interest due to their
novel properties and exotic quantum effects with respect to single-component
systems. In this paper the focus is on massive many-vortex states and their
dynamics. Vortex configurations characterized by the same discrete rotational
symmetry are investigated when confined within topologically nonequivalent
geometries, and the relative stability properties at varying number of vortices
and infilling mass are highlighted. It is numerically shown how massive
many-vortex systems, in a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates, can host the
bosonic tunneling of the infilling component both in a disordered way, with
tunneling events involving two or more close vortices, or in an almost-periodic
way when the vortices are organized in persisting necklaces or star-lattices.
The purpose is to explore a variety of situations involving the interplay
between the highly-nonlinear vortex dynamics and the inter-vortex atomic
transfer, and so to better understand the conditions for the onset of Josephson
supercurrents in rotating systems, or to reveal phenomena that could be of
interest for a future application e.g. in the context of atomtronics.

Abstract: The Monte Carlo (MC) trajectory sampling of stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) based on the quasiprobabilities, such as the Glauber-Sudarshan P,
Wigner, and Husimi Q functions, enables us to investigate bosonic open quantum
many-body dynamics described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad
(GKSL) equation. In this method, the MC samplings for the initial distribution
and stochastic noises incorporate quantum fluctuations, and thus, we can go
beyond the mean-field approximation. However, description using SDEs is
possible only when the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation has a
positive-semidefinite diffusion matrix. In this work, we analytically derive
the SDEs for arbitrary Hamiltonian and jump operators based on the
path-integral formula, independently of the derivation of the Fokker-Planck
equation (FPE). In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral
representation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability,
which systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by
changing the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that
we employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral,
and its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition
of the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness
condition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE. In the benchmark calculations, we
confirm that the MC simulations of the obtained SDEs well reproduce the exact
dynamics of physical quantities and non-equal time correlation functions of
numerically solvable models, including the Bose-Hubbard model. This work
clarifies the applicability of the approximation and gives systematic and
simplified procedures to obtain the SDEs to be numerically solved.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解自旋介导体在包含环路电荷条件下的行为提供了新的视角，尤其是在量子效应下的电荷积累。这为未来实验和理论研究提供了指导。

Abstract: We investigate coupled dynamics of spinless fermions on a one-dimensional
lattice and spins on the links. When the hopping integral and the on-site
potential of the fermions depend on the direction of the link spins, the
low-energy effective theory predicts that the link spins behave as a dynamical
axion field in 1+1 dimensions. The axion field $\theta$ is coupled to the
electric field $E$ as $\theta E$, through which the link spins rotate in
response to the applied electric field or the chemical potential gradient for
charge-neutral fermions. This is the inverse phenomenon of Thouless pumping in
the Rice-Mele model. After analyzing the dynamics by approximating the link
spins with the classical ones and utilizing the axion Lagrangian, we show the
full-quantum dynamics using the tensor network method. Even though we do not
explicitly introduce the axion Lagrangian in solving the fermion-spin coupled
many-body dynamics, the full-quantum results agree well with those with the
classical spin approximation, including the dynamics of the axion field and
fermion transport. In addition, we find that the quantum correlation between
spins accelerates the dynamics of axion fields as the suppression of the
expectation values of the link spins allows them to rotate easily. We also
propose a possible experimental setup for cold-atomic systems to implement the
Hamiltonian in this study.

### [12] [Identifying and anticipating the threshold bifurcation of a complex laser with permutation entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01000)
*Juan Gancio,Cristina Masoller,Mathias Marconi*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Abstract describes a study on using permutation entropy to detect threshold bifurcation in a complex laser system. PE shows a decrease just below threshold and a sharp minima at threshold, indicating abrupt increase in temporal correlations. PE outperforms lag-1 autocorrelation in identifying the bifurcation point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The interests are in complex systems and nonlinear dynamics, particularly in identifying critical transitions such as bifurcations. Applications in laser systems imply prominent importance in fields like laser technology, optics, and possibly in understanding other nonlinear optical phenomena.

Method: The study uses permutation entropy as a tool to quantify the complexity of the laser's intensity dynamics. The experimental setup involves a cavity with a long roundtrip time, allowing high statistical sampling. They analyze how permutation entropy behaves near and at the bifurcation threshold, pointing out specific changes that indicate abrupt shifts in temporal correlations.

Result: The main finding is that permutation entropy effectively identifies and anticipates the threshold bifurcation. It shows a decrease just below the threshold and a marked minimum at threshold, capturing nonlinear correlations, which is more accurate than traditional lag-1 autocorrelation.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates permutation entropy's utility in detecting critical transitions in complex systems, specifically in laser dynamics, providing a new method for identifying bifurcations in nonlinear systems where traditional methods may fall short.

Abstract: The permutation entropy (PE) is a statistical indicator that allows to
quantify the complexity of a signal. Here we show that it is able to {identify
and anticipate} the threshold bifurcation of a complex laser, where thousands
of modes compete for gain at the onset of lasing. In our experimental setup,
the cavity roundtrip time is several orders of magnitude longer than the
temporal resolution of the detection system, which enables a high statistical
sampling of the intensity dynamics per roundtrip. We show that the permutation
entropy experiences a clear decrease far below the threshold and reaches a
sharp minimum at the threshold bifurcation point, which reveals an abrupt
increase of the temporal correlations. The evolution of the entropy is compared
with standard quantifiers of approaching bifurcations. While lag-1
autocorrelation gradually grows as the threshold is approached, PE shows a
steep decrease that captures the emergence of nonlinear correlations and thus,
it allows a clearer identification of the threshold.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of transient holography in mid-infrared photothermal microscopy, addressing key limitations and opening new possibilities for future imaging advancements in the nanosecond time window.

Abstract: Mid-infrared photothermal microscopy is a highly promising imaging technique
that enables spatially resolved vibrational fingerprinting. The combination of
infrared induced heating with optical readout at visible wavelengths provides
excellent spatial resolution while retaining the spectral observations of
conventional infrared imaging. Most current implementations rely on
long-duration illumination periods, to ensure sufficient heating and hence
large signals. However, undesirable processes such as heat-diffusion degrade
spatial resolution and the interplay between heat-induced refractive index
changes and sample expansion adds additional uncertainties. Fundamentally,
these issues stem from the difficulties associated with separating
non-equilibrium and photoacoustic contributions from purely thermal signals.
Highly time-resolved observations hold great promise for addressing these
issues and are imperative for enabling future imaging modalities in this
exciting temporal window. Here, we provide this much needed insight by
employing widefield phototransient holography to phase-resolve optical
responses from pico- to tens of nanoseconds following vibrational overtone
excitation. We observe rapid transient-induced phase shifts, followed by
heat-induced coherent expansion and thermalisation dynamics. Our observations
provide a direct link between the photoacoustic and photothermal realms, thus
not only offering much-needed insight for rationally optimising these exciting
technologies but also avenues towards future all-optical stiffness and
super-resolution imaging modalities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to demonstrate how a freestanding structure can be used to enhance light-matter interactions for 2D materials in various applications.

Method: The researchers created a freestanding membrane photonic platform using monolayer WSe2 and observed enhanced light interactions via quasi-BIC and SHG measurements.

Result: The platform achieved significant enhancement in photoluminescence and SHG, sustained over a large area, and provided insights into material structure through polarization mapping.

Conclusion: This platform supports scalable integration of 2D materials into optoelectronic and quantum technologies.

Abstract: Two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit strong excitonic
responses, direct bandgaps, and remarkable nonlinear optical properties, making
them highly attractive for integrated photonic, optoelectronic, and quantum
applications. Here, we present a large area freestanding membrane photonic
platform that achieves exceptional enhancement of light matter interactions in
monolayer WSe2 via quasi bound states in the continuum. The freestanding
architecture effectively suppresses radiative losses and supports high Q
optical resonances, leading to enhanced light matter interactions. This results
in significant photoluminescence emission and second harmonic generation
enhancement factors of 1158 and 378, respectively, with spatial uniformity
sustained across a 450 times 450 um2 area. This uniform SHG enhancement further
enables polarization resolved mapping of crystal orientation and grain
boundaries, offering a practical method for large area structural
characterization of 2D materials. Moreover, femtosecond pumped SHG spectra
reveal multiple narrowband peaks originating from distinct quasi BIC modes
providing direct spectral evidence of resonantly enhanced nonlinear coupling.
The combined attributes of strong optical enhancement, spectral selectivity,
and wafer scale compatibility establish this platform as a scalable interface
for 2D semiconductor integration in next generation optoelectronic, nonlinear,
and quantum photonic technologies.

### [15] [The essential spectrum of periodically stationary pulses in lumped models of short-pulse fiber lasers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01133)
*Vrushaly Shinglot,John Zweck*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of pulse breathing in short-pulse fiber lasers by developing a new method for quantifying the growth of continuous wave perturbations using the monodromy operator. It provides essential spectrum conditions based on periodic pulse properties and notes the method's broad applicability to other laser models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The analysis of pulse breathing is essential for accurate modeling and design in fiber lasers, and this paper offers a detailed quantitative approach to ensure stability and growth evaluation.

Method: The authors employ a periodic pulse model and analyze the monodromy operator through the asymptotic operator's spectrum, relating it to the Fourier domain as a multiplication operator to derive essential spectrum formulas.

Result: A formula for the essential spectrum of the monodromy operator is established, allowing quantitative assessment of perturbation growth in periodic pulses, with potential application to various laser models.

Conclusion: The paper provides a robust framework for assessing pulse dynamics in lumped models, improving the understanding and design of short-pulse fiber lasers by addressing pulse breathing effectively.

Abstract: In modern short pulse fiber lasers there is significant pulse breathing over
each round trip of the laser loop. Consequently, averaged models cannot be used
for quantitative modeling and design. Instead, lumped models, which are
obtained by concatenating models for the various components of the laser, are
required. Since the pulses in lumped models are periodic rather than
stationary, their linear stability is evaluated with the aid of the monodromy
operator obtained by linearizing the round trip operator about the periodic
pulse. Conditions are given on the smoothness and decay of the periodic pulse
which ensure that the monodromy operator exists on an appropriate Lebesgue
function space. A formula for the essential spectrum of the monodromy operator
is given which can be used to quantify the growth rate of continuous wave
perturbations. This formula is established by showing that the essential
spectrum of the monodromy operator equals that of an associated asymptotic
operator. Since the asymptotic monodromy operator acts as a multiplication
operator in the Fourier domain, it is possible to derive a formula for its
spectrum. Although the main results are stated for a particular experimental
stretched pulse laser, the analysis shows that they can be readily adapted to a
wide range of lumped laser models.

### [16] [Impacts of Phase Noise on M-ary QAM THz Wireless Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01291)
*Bowen Liu,Takasumi Tanabe*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of phase noise in terahertz (THz) sources on wireless communication systems using QAM modulation. It identifies how phase noise affects system performance through constellation diagrams and explores the tolerance under various M-ary modulations. A key finding is the linear relationship between instantaneous phase noise and Error Vector Magnitude (EVM), which defines an error-free boundary. The study also highlights microcomb-based THz links as a promising solution for error-resilient communication systems under advanced QAM formats, offering practical insights for system design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to improve the reliability of THz-based wireless communication systems, which are key for next-generation networks. The authors focus on a critical parameter, phase noise, which affects the performance of these systems. They need to understand how to mitigate phase noise's impact to enable robust communication.

Method: The authors model phase noise and its effects on QAM-based systems, using constellation diagrams to visualize impacts. They analyze different M-ary modulations, derive a linear relationship between instantaneous phase noise and EVM, and evaluate the microcomb-driven scheme.

Result: The paper reveals that phase noise significantly affects QAM systems, with constellation points moving, especially under varying M-ary schemes. They find that higher phase noise pushes points towards errors, particularly in higher-order modulations. The linear relationship between phase noise and EVM suggests an error boundary, guiding design to avoid exceeding it. Microcombs show promise as they enable systems to stay within this boundary, enhancing reliability under advanced QAM formats.

Conclusion: The study concludes that while phase noise is a challenge, careful design using the identified boundaries and promising solutions like microcomb-based THz links can lead to reliable communication systems, supporting next-gen wireless networks.

Abstract: THz technology is positioned as a key enabler for next-generation wireless
links due to the extensive untapped bandwidth and inherent compatibility with
silicon photonics. Here, the phase noise of THz sources is modeled to
characterized its impacts on a QAM-based wireless communication system.
Particularly, common and instantaneous phase errors are unveiled and presented
via constellation diagrams. In addition, tolerance of phase noise under
different M-ary modulation formats is explored. Meanwhile, a linear correlation
between instantaneous component and EVM is revealed to define the error-free
boundary, where microcomb-driven scheme is highlighted as a highly promising
candidate for error-resilient THz links under advanced M-QAM formats. The
results intuitively illustrate the impacts of phase noise and offer practical
insights for refining technical details on physical-layer protocols.

Abstract: Nanoscale potential wells provide a powerful means to engineer energy
landscapes in low dimensional materials, enabling control over quantum states,
carrier dynamics, and optoelectronic responses. Such confinement governs
phenomena including charge localization, transport anisotropy, band structure
modulation, and light matter interaction strength. However, realizing clean and
well defined nanostructures remains technically challenging, as fabrication
techniques such as focused ion beam (FIB) milling and electron beam lithography
frequently introduce structural disorder, residual contamination, or
detrimental interactions with the underlying substrate. Here, we develop a
femtosecond laser direct writing technique to create sub 10 nm wide dielectric
nanochannels with smooth, continuous boundaries on hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN) substrates, without using resists or chemical etchants. As a
demonstration, these nanochannels are employed to define programmable
dielectric landscapes in monolayer molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), forming
excitonic energy funnels that suppress scattering and significantly extend the
exciton transport distance. Transport is reshaped from isotropic diffusion with
submicron range to directional super diffusion exhibiting quasi ballistic
transport exceeding 5 um, more than 20 times longer than in unpatterned
systems. The smooth dielectric boundaries further enable precise control over
exciton trajectories, allowing for programmable transport pathways. This dry,
scalable, and substrate compatible approach offers a robust platform for
exciton engineering and integrated quantum photonic devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces a method to create topological edge states with specific quasienergies, which could enable new types of quantum operations through period-multiplied dynamics.

Method: A Floquet extended SSH model is constructed using two-step periodic driving and next-nearest-neighbor coupling, and a photonic waveguide array is used for numerical simulation.

Result: The model exhibits three-periodic edge state behavior with quasienergies at ±π/3T and ±2π/3T, offering insights into designing topological quantum devices.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for designing quantum systems with period-multiplied dynamics and could lead to new applications in quantum computation and technology.

Abstract: Periodic driving can induce the emergence of topological pi modes, and their
superposition with zero modes leads to two-period dynamics. Introducing
long-range couplings enables the realization of larger topological winding
numbers, which correspond to multiple pairs of degenerate edge states under
open boundary conditions. In this work, we construct a Floquet extended
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model by introducing a two-step periodic driving and
next-nearest-neighbor coupling into the static SSH chain simultaneously.
Remarkably, we identify anomalous edge states with quasienergies -+pi/3T and
-+2pi/3T. In order to reveal the dynamical features of these anomalous edge
states, we elaborately adjust the optical parameters and ultimately achieve a
successful mapping of the model onto a photonic waveguide array. Subsequently,
through numerical simulation of the wave equation, we observe the unique
behavior of three-period evolution. Our work may serve as a reference for
realizing period-multiplied dynamics, and the anomalous edge states discussed
here might also find applications in quantum computation.

Abstract: All optical wavelength converters (AOWCs) that can effectively and flexibly
switch optical signals between different wavelength channels are essential
elements in future optical fiber communications and quantum information
systems. A promising strategy for achieving high-performance AOWCs is to
leverage strong three-wave mixing processes in second-order nonlinear
nanophotonic devices, specifically thin-film periodically poled lithium niobate
(TF-PPLN) waveguides. By exploiting the advantages of sub-wavelength light
confinement and dispersion engineering compared with their bulk counterparts,
TF-PPLN waveguides provide a viable route for realizing highly efficient and
broadband wavelength conversion. Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely on
a single TF-PPLN device to perform both frequency doubling of the telecom pump
and the wavelength conversion process, resulting in significant crosstalk
between adjacent signal channels. Here, we address this challenge by
demonstrating a two-stage TF-PPLN nonlinear photonic circuit that integrates a
second-harmonic generation module, a signal wavelength conversion module, and
multiple adiabatic directional coupler-based pump filters, on a single chip. By
decoupling the two nonlinear processes and leveraging the high pump-filtering
extinction ratio, we achieve low-crosstalk AOWC with a side-channel suppression
ratio exceeding 25 dB, substantially surpassing the performance of single-stage
devices. Furthermore, our device exhibits an ultra-broad conversion bandwidth
of 110 nm and a relatively high conversion efficiency of -15.6 dB, making it an
attractive solution for future photonic systems. The two-stage AOWC design
shows promise for low-noise phase-sensitive amplification and quantum frequency
conversion in future classical and quantum photonic systems.

Abstract: The realization of robust quantum storage devices relies on the ability to

Abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) is a fundamental light-matter interaction in which
absorbed photons are re-emitted, playing a key role in science and engineering.
It is commonly modeled by introducing a non-zero chemical potential into
Planck's law to capture its deviation from thermal emission. In this work, we
establish, for the first time to our knowledge, a fundamental relationship that
expresses the chemical potential as a function of temperature, material
properties, and excitation conditions, enabling a treatment of PL analogous to
Planck's law with thermal radiation. This formulation allows for the analysis
of temperature-dependent PL properties, including spectral emission, entropy,
temporal coherence, and photon statistics, capturing the transition from
narrowband pump-induced to broadband thermal emission. Notably, we identify a
temperature range where the emission rate is quasi-conserved, associated with
the previously reported blueshift. This is followed by a rapid transition to
thermal behavior, reflected in both the chemical potential and entropy.
Conversely, the coherence time and photon statistics evolve smoothly across the
entire temperature range. Alongside its scientific contribution, this framework
provides a foundation for designing temperature-tunable light sources, enabling
control over coherence length and photon statistics.

Abstract: Modern photon-counting sensors are increasingly dominated by Poisson noise,
yet conventional Feature-Specific Imaging (FSI) is optimized for additive
Gaussian noise, leading to suboptimal performance and a loss of its advantages
under Poisson noise. To address this, we introduce DeepFSI, a novel end-to-end
optical-electronic framework. DeepFSI "unfreezes" traditional FSI masks,
enabling a deep neural network to learn globally optimal measurement masks by
computing gradients directly under realistic Poisson and additive noise
conditions. Our simulations demonstrate DeepFSI's superior feature fidelity and
task performance compared to conventional FSI with predefined masks, especially
in Poisson-Noise-dominant environments. DeepFSI also exhibits enhanced
robustness to design choices and performs well under additive Gaussian noise,
representing a significant advance for noise-robust computational imaging in
photon-limited applications.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique boundary phenomena absent in their
Hermitian counterparts, most notably the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). In
this work, we explore a lattice model consisting of two coupled non-reciprocal
chains, focusing on the interplay between system size, inter-chain coupling,
and spectral topology. Using both analytical and numerical approaches, we
systematically examine the evolution of the complex energy spectra and spectral
winding numbers under periodic and open boundary conditions. Our results
uncover a variety of size-dependent localization transitions, including the
emergence and instability of concurrent bipolar skin effects (CBSE) in the
$W=0$ region, and their crossover to unipolar and conventional bipolar NHSE as
the system size increases. Notably, we demonstrate that these size-dependent
behaviors persist even beyond the weak-coupling regime, highlighting their
universality in non-Hermitian systems with complex spectral structures. This
study provides new insights into the mechanisms governing skin effects and
offers practical guidelines for engineering non-Hermitian topological phases in

to SW-NIR (approximately 450 nm to 1000 nm), mode-hop-free tuning about 1.6 nm
at about 738 nm and amplification at about 532.3 nm was achieved. This work
transitions SiN from conventional passive photonic material to ultrawide-band
active medium, by leveraging the maturity, cost-effectiveness, and CMOS
compatibility of SiN photonics.

Abstract: We present a study of second harmonic generation (SHG) and third harmonic
generation (THG) in lithium triborate (LBO) crystals using a high-energy,
10-J-class, 10 Hz Yb:YAG laser system. We achieved high conversion efficiencies
of 75\% for SHG and 56\% for THG for Gaussian-like temporal pulse shapes and
top-hat-like beam profiles. The angular and temperature dependence of the LBO
crystals were measured and validated through numerical simulations. The SHG
process exhibited an angular acceptance bandwidth of 1.33 mrad and a
temperature acceptance bandwidth of 2.61 K, while the THG process showed 1.19
mrad and 1.35 K, respectively. Additionally, long term stability measurements
revealed RMS energy stabilities of 1.3\% for SHG and 1.24\% for THG. These
results showcase the reliability of LBO crystals for high-energy,
high-average-power harmonic generation. The developed system offers automated
switching between harmonics provided at the system output. The system can be
easily adapted to Nd:YAG based pump lasers as well.

### [29] [The analytically tractable zoo of similarity-induced exceptional structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02565)
*Anton Montag,Jordan Isaacs,Marcus Stålhammar,Flore K. Kunst*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper discusses the investigation of multiband EPns and their emergence under generalized similarities, revealing new properties and constraints. They found that existing symmetric configurations can lead to lower-dimensional EPm-manifolds and show that EPns aren't isolated. Instead, many EPms can connect directly to EPns, leading to richer structures, including EPs beyond the expected counting. They tested this with toy models and suggest broad applications in physics and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalized exceptional points ( EPns ) in multiband systems and their spectral dependencies under similarity transformations are crucial for understanding complex quantum and classical systems. The study aims to unravel how these structures emerge and their topological properties, which could have applications in designing future devices and systems. Understanding the behavior of EPs beyond simple pairwise cases adds complexity and depth to the field. It can inform the engineering of systems with non-Hermitian features, such as topological insulators or optical systems with losses.

Method: They employed a combination of analytical and numerical methods. The analytical approach involved examining the conditions under which generalized similarities lead to certain spectral symmetries in the complex plane. Complex-plane symmetry considerations were key. They used toy models, such as periodic systems, to concretely map out the relationships between EPms and EPns. Simulations were likely conducted to verify the theoretical predictions and visualize the emergence of these structures in specific scenarios.

Result: The number of constraints for EPns isn't sufficient on their own because generalized symmetries in the eigenvalue plane can make these points align with lower-dimensional manifold structures. This led to the discovery that certain spectral symmetries can allow for higher connectivity of EPs in multiband systems, forming specific types of EP clusters. Additionally, the emergence of EPs is influenced by how thoseEPms are embedded into the n-band system. The findings revealed that while similarity transformations impose constraints, they also lead to deviations from naive expectations, providing a more nuanced understanding which leads to richer and more complex structures than previously thought. 

Conclusion: The paper explains how non-Hermitian exceptional points in multiband systems form intricate networks due to generalized similarity transformations and specific spectral symmetries. These networks aren't isolated but are interconnected, with centers at EPns. Topological properties emerge from these connections, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding the structure and behavior of EPs in larger systems. These findings augment existing knowledge in quantum mechanics and open up new possibilities for applications in designs where EPs are advantageous, such as in optics, topological circuits, and open quantum systems. The results should help in the design of future systems that leverage these unique properties of EPs in multiband scenarios.

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies marking a
simultaneous coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Despite the fact that
multiband $n$-fold EPs (EP$n$s) generically emerge as special points on
manifolds of EP$m$s, where $m<n$, EP$n$s as well as their topological
properties have hitherto been studied as isolated objects. In this work we
address this issue and carefully map out the emerging properties of multifold
exceptional structures in three and four dimensions under the influence of one
or multiple generalized similarities, revealing diverse combinations of EP$m$s
in direct connection to EP$n$s. We find that simply counting the number of
constraints defining the EP$n$s is not sufficient in the presence of
similarities; the constraints can also be satisfied by the EP$m$-manifolds
obeying certain spectral symmetries in the complex eigenvalue plane, reducing
their dimension beyond what is expected from counting the number of
constraints. Furthermore, the induced spectral symmetries not always allow for
any EP$m$-manifold to emerge in $n$-band systems, making the plethora of
exceptional structures deviate further from naive expectations. We illustrate
our findings in simple periodic toy models. By relying on similarity relations
instead of the less general symmetries, we simultaneously cover several
physically relevant scenarios, ranging from optics and topolectrical circuits,
to open quantum systems. This makes our predictions highly relevant and broadly
applicable in modern research, as well as experimentally viable within various
branches of physics.

Abstract: Frequency-agile lasers operating in the ultraviolet-to-blue spectral range
(360-480 nm) are critical enablers for a wide range of technologies, including
free-space and underwater optical communications, optical atomic clocks, and
Rydberg-atom-based quantum computing platforms. Integrated photonic lasers
offer a compelling platform for these applications by combining low-noise
performance with fast frequency tuning in a compact, robust form factor through
monolithic integration. However, realizing such lasers in the blue spectral
range remains challenging due to limitations in current semiconductor materials
and photonic integration techniques. Here, we report the first demonstration of
a photonic integrated blue laser at around 461 nm, which simultaneously
achieves frequency agility and low phase noise. This implementation is based on
the hybrid integration of a gallium nitride-based laser diode, which is
self-injection locked to a high-Q microresonator fabricated on a low-loss
silicon nitride photonic platform with 0.4 dB/cm propagation loss. The laser
exhibits a sub-30 kHz linewidth and delivers over 1 mW of optical output power.
In addition, aluminum nitride piezoelectric actuators are monolithically
integrated onto the photonic circuitry to enable high-speed modulation of the
refractive index, and thus tuning the laser frequency. This enables
mode-hop-free laser linear frequency chirps with excursions up to 900 MHz at
repetition rates up to 1 MHz, with tuning nonlinearity below 2%. We showcase
the potential applications of this integrated laser in underwater communication
and coherent aerosol sensing experiments.

Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene systems with different number of layers feature an
abundance of correlated phases and superconducting states in experimental
measurements with different doping and displacement fields. Some of the
superconducting pockets can emerge from - or close to - one of the correlated
states. Therefore, studying the phase diagram of the correlated phases for
varying number of layers could be useful to interpret the experimental
observations. To achieve this, systematic Hartree-Fock calculations have been
performed to build the phase diagram of rhombohedral (ABC-stacked) graphene for
different number of layers, in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions.
By varying the external displacement field and carrier density, a cascade of
metallic partially-isospin-polarized phases that spontaneously break spin
and/or valley (flavor) symmetries is found. In addition, these states can
present nematicity, stabilized by electron-electron interactions, exhibiting
rich internal complexity. Polarized states are more stable for electron doping,
and they are found for systems with up to 20 layers. Moreover, the tunability
of the phase diagram via substrate screening and spin-orbit coupling proximity
effects has been studied. Our results offer new insights into the role of
correlations and symmetry breaking in graphitic systems which will motivate
future experimental and theoretical works.

Abstract: The interplay of topology and correlations defines a new playground to study
boundary criticality in quantum systems. We employ large scale auxiliary field
quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study a two-dimensional Kane-Mele-Hubbard

to the three-dimensional XY bulk critical point. Upon varying the Hubbard-U
term on the edge we observe a boundary phase transition from an ordinary phase
with a helical Luttinger liquid edge decoupled from the critical bulk to an
extraordinary-log phase characterized by a logarithmically diverging spin
stiffness. We find that the spectral functions exhibit distinct features in the
two phases giving potential experimental signatures.

Abstract: The low-energy properties of transition metal oxides (TMOs) are governed by
the electrons occupying strongly correlated $d$-orbitals that are hybridized
with surrounding ligand oxygen $p$ orbitals to varying degrees. Their physics
is thus established by a complex interplay between the transition-metal
(TM)-ligand hopping $t$, charge transfer energy $\Delta_\mathrm{CT}$, and
on-site TM Hubbard repulsion $U$. Here, we study the spectral properties of a
one-dimensional (1D) analog of such a $pd$ system, with alternating TM $d$ and
ligand anion $p$ orbitals situated along a chain. Using the density matrix
renormalization group method, we study the model's single-particle spectral
function, x-ray absorption spectrum, and dynamical spin structure factor as a
function of $\Delta_\mathrm{CT}$ and $U$. In particular, we present results
spanning from the Mott insulating ($\Delta_\mathrm{CT} > U$) to negative charge
transfer regime $\Delta_\mathrm{CT} < 0$ to better understand the ground and
momentum-resolved excited state properties of these different regimes. Our
results can guide new studies on TMOs that seek to situate them within the
Mott-Hubbard/charge transfer insulator classification scheme.

Abstract: Epitaxial strain in transition-metal oxides can induce dramatic changes in
electronic and magnetic properties. A recent study on the epitaxially strained
SrCoO$_3$ thin films revealed persistent ferromagnetism even across a
metal-insulator transition. This challenges the current theoretical
predictions, and the nature of the local spin state underlying this robustness
remains unresolved. Here, we employ high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray
scattering (RIXS) at the Co-$L_3$ edge to probe the spin states of strained
SrCoO$_3$ thin films. Compared with CoO$_6$ cluster multiplet calculations, we
identify a ground state composed of a mixed high- and low-spin configuration,
distinct from the previously proposed intermediate-spin state. Our results
demonstrate that the robustness of ferromagnetism arises from the interplay
between this mixed spin state and the presence of ligand holes associated with
negative charge transfer. These findings provide direct experimental evidence
for a nontrivial magnetic ground state in SrCoO$_3$ and offer new pathways for
designing robust ferromagnetic systems in correlated oxides.

TL;DR: The paper successfully models the electronic structure of high-temperature superconducting cuprates using a two-component fermion model, integrating data from QPI and ARPES. This model explains fractionalization and aligns with experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding high-temperature superconductivity and the complex behavior of cuprates is crucial. The paper's approach of combining two spectroscopic techniques provides deeper insights into their electronic structure.

Method: Used experimental data from QPI and ARPES, modeled it with a two-component fermion model, and integrated the data theoretically to validate the model.

Result: The model explains fractionalization and reconciles seemingly conflicting data, successfully reproducing key features of experimental results.

Conclusion: The work confirms electron fractionalization in cuprates and highlights the importance of combining spectroscopic methods for studying strongly correlated systems.

Abstract: Electronic structure of high-temperature superconducting cuprates is studied
by analyzing experimental data independently obtained from two complementary
spectroscopies, one, quasiparticle interference (QPI) measured by
scanning-tunneling microscopy and the other, angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) and by combining these two sets of data in a unified
theoretical analysis. Through explicit calculations of experimentally
measurable quantities, we show that a simple two-component fermion model (TCFM)
representing electron fractionalization succeeds in reproducing various
detailed features of these experimental data: ARPES and QPI data are
concomitantly reproduced by the TCFM in full energy and momentum spaces. The
measured QPI pattern reveals a signature characteristic of the TCFM, distinct
from the conventional single-component prediction, supporting the validity of
the electron fractionalization in the cuprate. The integrated analysis also
solves the puzzles of ARPES and QPI data that are seemingly inconsistent with
each other. The overall success of the TCFM offers a comprehensive
understanding of the electronic structure of the cuprates. We further predict
that a characteristic QPI pattern should appear in the unoccupied high-energy
part if the fractionalization is at work. We propose that
integrated-spectroscopy analyses offer a promising way to explore challenging
issues of strongly correlated electron systems.

Result: The review highlights the theoretical and experimental progress made in understanding complex transport phenomena in quantum dots under nonequilibrium conditions.

Conclusion: The paper identifies open problems and future research directions in the field, emphasizing the need for further development in theoretical frameworks and experimental techniques.

Abstract: Quantum dots are versatile systems for exploring quantum transport, electron
correlations, and many-body phenomena such as the Kondo effect. While
equilibrium properties are well understood through methods like the numerical
renormalization group and density matrix renormalization group, nonequilibrium
transport remains a major theoretical challenge. From the experimental point of
view, recent advances in nanofabrication and measurement techniques have
enabled the investigation of far-from-equilibrium regimes. These conditions
give rise to new transport phenomena, where strong correlations and
nonequilibrium dynamics interplay in complex ways; beyond the reach of
conventional linear response theory. To meet these challenges, new approaches
such as nonequilibrium Green's functions, real-time NRG, and time-dependent
DMRG have emerged. This work reviews the established results for quantum dot
transport in and beyond the linear regime, highlights recent theoretical and
experimental advances, and discusses open problems and future prospects.

Abstract: The effect of the Hund's J terms in various DFT+U+J corrections to semi-local

coordinated Fe(II) spin-crossover molecules spanning the covalent end of the

valence atomic subspaces and relevant spin states in these molecules. We then
methodically apply them via simplified rotationally-invariant Hubbard

energy differences with respect to those obtained using CASPT2/CC. The observed
failure of canonical, positively-signed Hund's J terms in furthering the
already robust capacity of DFT+U to obtain accurate energetics prompts an
evaluation of their limitations when seeking to account for the static

momenta. Furthermore, we find that the RSGA can be applied to other eigenstates
of the Lieb lattice in an approximate manner. Numerical simulations reveal that
there exist sets of eigenstates, which obey a quasi-RSGA. These states act as
energy towers within the low-lying excited spectrum, indicating that they are

Abstract: We formulate a path-integral Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating lattice
systems consisting of fictitious particles governed by a generalized exchange
statistics. This method, initially proposed for continuum systems, introduces a
continuous parameter $\xi$ in the partition function that interpolates between
bosonic ($\xi = 1$) and fermionic ($\xi = -1$) statistics. We generalize this
approach to discrete lattice models and apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard
model of fictitious particles, including the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models as
special cases. By combining reweighting and $\xi$-extrapolation techniques, we
access both half-filled and doped regimes. In particular, we demonstrate that
the method remains effective even in strongly correlated, doped systems where
the fermion sign problem hinders conventional quantum Monte Carlo approaches.
Our results validate the applicability of the fictitious particle framework on
lattice models and establish it as a promising tool for sign-problem mitigation
in strongly interacting fermionic systems.

Abstract: This article reviews theoretical methods for analyzing Floquet engineering
(FE) phenomena in open (dissipative) quantum or classical systems, with an
emphasis on our recent results. In many theoretical studies for FE in quantum
systems, researchers have used the Floquet theory for closed (isolated) quantum
systems, that is based on the Schr\"odinger equation. However, if we consider
the FE in materials driven by an oscillating field like a laser, a weak but
finite interaction between a target system and an environment (bath) is
inevitable. In this article, we describe these periodically driven dissipative
systems by means of the quantum master (GKSL) equation. In particular, we show
that a nonequilibrium steady state appears after a long driving due to the
balance between the energy injection by the driving field and the release to
the bath. In addition to quantum systems, if we try to simply apply Floquet
theory to periodically driven classical systems, it failed because the equation
of motion (EOM) is generally nonlinear, and the Floquet theorem can be applied
only to linear differential equations. Instead, by considering the distribution
function of the classical variables (i.e., Fokker-Planck equation), one can
arrive at the effective EOM for the driven systems. We illustrate the essence
of the Floquet theory for classical systems. On top of fundamentals of the
Floquet theory, we review representative examples of FEs (Floquet topological
insulators, inverse Faraday effects in metals and magnets, Kapitza pendulum,
etc.) and dissipation-assisted FEs.

*Okan Köksal*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper investigates Rashba spin splitting in SrHfO3-based buckled heterostructures by examining the competition between symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling. Using DFT and Wannier-based TB models, they find that near the M and K points, pronounced Rashba splitting occurs with a helical in-plane spin texture due to the non-centrosymmetric P1 phase. The extracted Rashba coefficient of 0.34 eV·Å and energy of 29 meV indicate moderate strength in oxide Rashba materials. The Γ-phonon calculations support the dynamical stability of the P1 structure, highlighting the role of symmetry breaking, inter-orbital hybridization, and enhanced imaginary second-nearest-neighbor hopping in enabling Rashba effects. Results suggest SrHfO3-based heterostructures as promising for spintronic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work is crucial for advancing spintronic devices, particularly in Rashba spintronic materials, which have wide-ranging applications in quantum computing, sensors, and memory devices. The understanding of their spin-splitting mechanisms is vital for device design and optimization.

Method: The study uses a combination of DFT calculations with a Hubbard U term and a Wannier-based tight-binding (TB) model. They analyze the competition between symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling in both non-centrosymmetric (P1) and centrosymmetric (P321) phases. The Wannier-based TB Hamiltonian is extended to include on-site spin-orbit coupling, which is essential for reproducing the DFT results accurately.

Result: The research successfully extracts a Rashba coefficient (αR = 0.34 eV·Å) and energy (ER = 29 meV) from the DFT band structure. The system shows pronounced Rashba splitting near the M and K points, accompanied by helical in-plane spin textures in the non-centrosymmetric P1 phase. The centrosymmetric P321 phase remains spin-degenerate, indicating that symmetry breaking is a key factor in enabling strong Rashba effects. The Wannier-based TB model accurately captures the electronic structure, with enhanced imaginary second-nearest-neighbor hoppings and Berry curvature playing significant roles in Rashba effects.

Conclusion: SrHfO3-based buckled heterostructures offer a promising platform for engineering Rashba effects in oxide spintronic devices. The findings emphasize the importance of symmetry breaking, inter-orbital hybridization, and enhanced imaginary second-nearest-neighbor hopping, providing a foundation for further exploration and design of oxide-based spintronic systems.

Abstract: Harnessing the interplay of symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling, we
investigate Rashba spin splitting in buckled honeycomb
(SrHfO$_3$)$_2$/(LaAlO$_3$)$_4$(111) superlattices using density functional
theory (DFT) calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term and a Wannier-based
tight-binding (TB) model. In the non-centrosymmetric $P1$ phase, pronounced
Rashba-type splitting emerges near the $M$ and $K$ points accompanied by a
helical in-plane spin texture, while the centrosymmetric $P321$ phase remains
spin-degenerate. A Wannier-based tight-binding Hamiltonian, extended
analytically with on-site spin-orbit coupling, reproduces the DFT results. A
Rashba coefficient of $\alpha_R = 0.34$ eV$ \cdot$ Angstrom and energy $E_R =
29$ meV are extracted directly from the DFT band structure placing the system
among moderately strong oxide Rashba materials. $\Gamma$-phonon calculation
confirms the dynamical stability of the $P1$ structure and the results reveal
the critical role of symmetry breaking and inter-orbital hybridization in
enabling Rashba effects, supported by enhanced imaginary
second-nearest-neighbor hoppings and Berry curvature. These findings establish
SrHfO$_3$-based buckled heterostructures as a promising platform for
engineering Rashba effects in oxide-based spintronic devices.

Abstract: We report inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on the magnetically
frustrated $S=\frac12$ sawtooth-chain compound atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$
featuring inequivalent Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites. Transverse to the sawtooth
chains, INS reveals two dispersive spin-wave modes and a gap of at least 0.75
meV. This behavior is rationalized within a zigzag-chain model of Cu(2) spins
in an effective magnetic field of Cu(1) spins. The model is compatible with
first-principles calculations and accounts for INS dispersions within linear
spin-wave theory calculations. Our results reveal a unique case of an effective
separation of energy scales between two differently oriented one-dimensional
chains, with the zigzag-chain model being essential to fully characterize
atacamite's low-energy magnetism.

### [43] [A theory of strange metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02221)
*Simone Fratini*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper presents a theory of strange metals with three key assumptions: loss of wavelike coherence at each atomic hop, independent carrier motion, and correspondence principle for quantum and classical diffusion. The theory explains linear resistivity with Planckian scattering rates and Drude peaks, and may solve the dielectric relaxation problem in insulators. However, the explanation is vague and lacks specific details or experimental validations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The author is introducing a new theory aimed at explaining the unique properties of strange metals, which are materials with unconventional electrical and optical behaviors, such as linear temperature dependence in resistivity and peaks in optical absorption. The paper suggests that their theory incorporates quantum-classical correspondence and independence of carrier motion, which may unify various experimental observations.

Method: The method involves developing a theoretical framework based on three main assumptions: loss of coherence, independent motion of carriers, and correspondence between quantum and classical diffusion. The theory is then applied to explain experimental observations related to temperature dependence in resistivity and features in optical absorption experiments.

Result: The theory successfully explains several observed phenomena in strange metals, including linear temperature dependence in resistivity and Drude-like peaks in optical absorption. It even suggests a potential solution to the problem of universal dielectric relaxation in insulators, a broader material science challenge.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a promising new theory for strange metals that unifies quantum and classical descriptions of carrier diffusion. Although the framework is comprehensive, it lacks detailed mathematical formulations or experimental data to fully validate its claims.

Abstract: I present a theory of strange metals that is based on the following
asumptions: (i) wavelike coherence is lost at each hop between neighboring
atoms in the solid, i.e. the metal is bad, (ii) the carriers move independently
from one another and (iii) the motion of the charge carriers obeys the
correspondence principle, i.e. the quantum-mechanically averaged carrier
diffusion in time is the same as in the classical case. The theory explains
$T$-linear resistivity with apparently Planckian scattering rates as well as
both the stretched Drude and displaced Drude peaks that are commonly observed
in optical absorption experiments. The present framework might also indicate a
solution to the problem of universal dielectric relaxation in insulators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者为了提高HMC算法的效率，特别是在解决等效性问题方面，进行了算法上的改进。

Method: 研究者结合了WV-HMC与GT-HMC，提出了 Capturing Sampling Method (CSM)。

Result: 在H imaginative Hubbard模型上，使用CSM计算得到的物理量与WV-HMC一致，且运算效率提高。

Conclusion: 结合WV-HMC和GT-HMC可以有效解决HMC算法中的等效性问题。

Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an
efficient and versatile algorithm that simultaneously mitigates both the sign
problem and the ergodicity problem -- the latter being intrinsic to algorithms
based on Lefschetz thimbles. We consider a situation in which the maximum flow
time can be set to a small value, as occurs when WV-HMC is applied to the doped
Hubbard model using a nonphysical redundant parameter. An optimal choice of
this parameter significantly reduces the sign problem on the original
integration surface and allows the maximum flow time to remain small, a feature
that facilitates increasing the system size while keeping the computation time
modest. However, as the worldvolume becomes a thin layer, it becomes
increasingly difficult to explore it efficiently, leading to potential
ergodicity issues. To overcome this limitation, we propose embedding the
Generalized-thimble HMC (GT-HMC) into the WV-HMC framework. GT-HMC performs HMC
updates on a deformed surface at a fixed flow time. Although it suffers from
ergodicity issues due to infinitely high potential barriers at the zeros of the
Boltzmann weight, it enables more efficient exploration within the allowed
region. Furthermore, its molecular dynamics step size can typically be taken to
be larger than in WV-HMC. GT-HMC is thus better suited for sampling regions
where ergodicity issues are not serious. We provide a proof that GT-HMC can be
embedded within the WV-HMC algorithm, and verify that the two methods -- the
pure WV-HMC and the combined version -- yield consistent results within
statistical errors for the two-dimensional doped Hubbard model on a $6 \times
6$ spatial lattice at $T/\kappa = 1/6.4\simeq 0.156$ and $U/\kappa = 8.0$ with
Trotter number $N_t = 20$ ($\kappa$: hopping parameter).

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了 ACSPT 的理论框架，揭示了许多自恰的内生平均对称性保护相，并证明了它们在现实条件下的存在。

Abstract: We investigate a novel class of topological superconducting phases protected
by exact fermion-parity symmetry and average crystalline symmetries. These
phases belong to the broader class of average crystalline symmetry-protected
topological (ACSPT) states and include numerous examples of intrinsic ACSPTs --
topological phases that arise only in the presence of disorder or decoherence.
Unlike conventional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, which require
exact symmetry protection, average SPT (ASPT) phases remain robust as long as
the symmetry is restored on average across disorder realizations or mixed-state
ensembles. To classify these phases, we extend the real-space block state
construction framework to account for average crystalline symmetries. In this
generalized setting, lower-dimensional cells are decorated with ASPT phases,
and the obstruction-free conditions are reformulated to incorporate the
constraints imposed by average symmetry at block intersections. This provides a
physically transparent and systematic method for classifying ASPTs with spatial
symmetries that are only preserved statistically. We further validate our
classification using a generalized spectral sequence analysis, which serves as
an independent consistency check. Our results demonstrate that many crystalline
topological superconductors remain well defined under realistic imperfections,
and they uncover a rich landscape of intrinsically average-symmetry-protected
phases that have no analog in clean systems.

Motivation: 显微荧光成像因其高对比度和穿透深度在医学成像中具有重要应用价值，但受限于时间和空间分辨率以及缺乏 FDA 批准的对比剂，其临床应用受限。该研究试图解决这一问题，通过改进算法和使用 FDA 批准的对比剂，旨在提高成像性能并扩大应用范围。

Method: 该研究采用频率域去噪（FDD）方法和 600 Hz 实时视频技术来提升显微荧光成像的信号对背景比和信噪比；通过使用 Indocyanine Green (ICG) 作为对比剂，并结合 Rose 标准，验证其效果。

Result: 研究结果表明，该方法显著提高了 SBR 和 SNR，并延长了透射深度，减少了所需的对比剂或光照强度，且在动态图像捕捉方面表现出色，尤其适用于 NIR-II 手术导航。

Conclusion: 该研究为 NIR-II 显微荧光成像提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案，为临床应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: The second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 900-1,880 nm) has been pivotal in
advancing in vivo fluorescence imaging due to its superior penetration depth
and contrast. Yet, its clinical utility remains limited by insufficient imaging
temporal-spatial resolution and the absence of U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved NIR-II contrast agents. This work presents a
frequency-domain denoising (FDD)-based in vivo fluorescence imaging technique,
which can improve signal-to-background ratio (SBR) and signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) by more than 2,500-fold and 300-fold, respectively. The great enhancement
yields a doubled penetration depth and a 95% reduction in contrast agent dosage
or excitation light intensity for mouse vascular imaging. Additionally, we
achieved a SBR far exceeded the Rose criterion in the observation of tumor
margins and vessels in mice using Indocyanine Green (ICG), demonstrating the
feasibility of NIR-II surgical navigation with FDA-approved agents.
Furthermore, a 600 Hz real-time video enables visualization of the entire
contrast agent diffusion process within the mouse body and differentiation
between arteries and veins. This innovative technique, characterized by
exceptional sensitivity, efficiency, and robustness, presents a promising
solution for clinical applications, particularly in NIR-II surgical navigation.

Conclusion: 通过约束神经元活动的整体分布，分布均值场模型提供了一种先进而可靠的建模工具，能够有效平衡模型复杂性和描述能力。这也是连接动力学理论与真实神经数据的重要进展。

Abstract: Recent advances in experimental techniques enable the simultaneous recording
of activity from thousands of neurons in the brain, presenting both an
opportunity and a challenge: to build meaningful, scalable models of large
neural populations. Correlations in the brain are typically weak but
widespread, suggesting that a mean-field approach might be effective in
describing real neural populations, and we explore a hierarchy of maximum
entropy models guided by this idea. We begin with models that match only the
mean and variance of the total population activity, and extend to models that
match the experimentally observed mean and variance of activity along multiple
projections of the neural state. Confronted by data from several different
brain regions, these models are driven toward a first-order phase transition,
characterized by the presence of two nearly degenerate minima in the energy
landscape, and this leads to predictions in qualitative disagreement with other
features of the data. To resolve this problem we introduce a novel class of
models that constrain the full probability distribution of activity along
selected projections. We develop the mean-field theory for this class of models
and apply it to recordings from 1000+ neurons in the mouse hippocampus. This
'distributional mean--field' model provides an accurate and consistent
description of the data, offering a scalable and principled approach to
modeling complex neural population dynamics.

TL;DR:  paper introduces a new framework using tensor functors and Anomalous Simple Categories (ASCies) to better understand categorical anomalies in quantum systems, particularly non-invertible symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address a key issue in theoretical physics related to symmetries and their anomalies, especially concerning non-invertible symmetries, which are challenging to analyze. The desire is to create a systematic method to characterize these anomalies to better understand low-energy dynamics and renormalization group flows.

Method: The authors introduce tensor functors between UV and IR symmetry categories, termed Anomalous Simple Categories (ASCies). They use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework where these functors correspond to RG-interfaces, providing a geometrical interpretation of categorical anomalies.

Result: The framework successfully captures anomalies in various non-invertible symmetries across different spacetime dimensions, including 0-form, higher-form, and crucially non-invertible symmetries, offering a comprehensive approach to these anomalies.

Conclusion: This paper provides a unified and precise methodology for understanding and quantifying anomalies in categorical symmetries, which is essential for advancing our knowledge of quantum systems and their RG flows.

Abstract: Matching 't Hooft anomalies is a powerful tool for constraining the
low-energy dynamics of quantum systems and their allowed renormalization group
(RG) flows. For non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries, however, a key
challenge has been the lack of a precise framework to characterize and quantify
anomalies. We address this by identifying tensor functors between UV and IR
symmetry categories as central to capturing these constraints. To this end, we
introduce Anomalous Simple Categories (ASCies) as fundamental building blocks
of categorical anomalies. A given symmetry category may support multiple
ASCies, each encoding distinct anomalous features. These structures naturally
arise in the context of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where
tensor functors correspond to RG-interfaces between UV and IR SymTFTs, and
ASCies are realized as particular such interfaces satisfying simple, universal
criteria. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through examples
involving anomalous 0-form, higher-form, and crucially, non-invertible
symmetries in various spacetime dimensions.

Abstract: We explore consistent truncations from 10d/11d supergravity to supergravity
theories on brane worldvolumes. Supersymmetric black-brane solutions to these
lower-dimensional theories can be uplifted to 10d/11d supergravity and
interpreted as intersecting-brane solutions with a particular smearing pattern.
We survey this novel family of intersecting-brane solutions which also includes
cases that are not related to previously known consistent truncations. Turning
the argument on its head, we argue that the knowledge of such solutions allows
us to generate appropriate embedding ans\"atze for consistent truncations. We
demonstrate this by deriving new consistent embeddings of pure 5d
$\mathcal{N}=4$ supergravity on D4-branes in type IIA theory and of pure 6d
$\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ supergravity on NS5-branes in type IIB theory.

Conclusion: Schwinger 对称破缺更容易实现稳定的粒子对称性破缺，而 Hawking 辐射的实现受到量子效应的限制。

Abstract: We compare Hawking radiation in a collapse background with Schwinger pair
creation in an electric field. The comparison is driven by the presence of an
analogue horizon in the Schwinger case, which causally divides spacetime for
classical particles, but through which quantum fields can tunnel. Amplitudes
for tunnelling processes are encoded in the asymptotic behaviour of solutions
to the appropriate background-coupled wave equation. We construct these
solutions, in both gravity and QED, using the worldline approach, where
tunnelling and particle creation manifest as complex saddle points of a
real-time path integral. For the Schwinger effect, these saddles correspond to
complex worldlines, while for Hawking radiation, the corresponding worldlines
are real, but appear complex when extended beyond a certain coordinate patch.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We explore asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter spacetimes exhibiting
radiative behavior, employing null gauges that allow for a well-defined flat
limit. The radiative content in the bulk is captured by the super-Poynting
vector, which we reinterpret holographically in terms of fluid variables in the
dual boundary theory. For algebraically special solutions, we uncover a close
connection between bulk radiation and dissipative corrections in the boundary
stress tensor, demonstrating a direct link between radiation and entropy
production in the boundary fluid. This reveals a rich interplay between
radiative dynamics in the bulk and out-of-equilibrium conformal physics at the
boundary. We then investigate the flat limit of this correspondence in the
context of flat-space holography. In this setting, we construct a Carrollian
analogue of the super-Poynting vector and introduce Celestial observables, such
as energy detectors, which emerge naturally from the bulk's radiative
structure. Our analysis shows that bulk radiation sources the Carrollian
viscous stress tensor and heat current, which encodes the Bondi news in this
framework. We illustrate our results with explicit examples, including
Robinson-Trautman spacetimes and accelerating black holes.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper explores the compatibility of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) and the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) in Kerr-Newman-Kiselev-Letelier (KNKL) black holes. By introducing specific parameters, the authors demonstrate regions where both conjectures can coexist, suggesting a possible agreement when certain conditions are met.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the validation of two fundamental conjectures in quantum gravity: the weak gravity conjecture and the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. It aims to explore their compatibility in the context of a specific black hole model, KNKL, which incorporates charge, mass, and other physical parameters. The motivation is to understand if these conjectures, which appear unrelated at first glance, can coexist under certain conditions, potentially bridging the gap between quantum and cosmic phenomena.

Method: The authors examine the KNKL black hole's parameters, specifically focusing on the charge-to-mass ratio, and introduce variables such as the spin parameter (a), quintessence parameter (b), and equation of state parameter (ω). They analyze the conditions under which the black hole has event horizons and whether both WGC and WCCC are satisfied in these regions. They also present graphical evidence to support their findings.

Result: The study reveals that in certain parameter regions, particularly where the spin and other introduced parameters are present, both the WGC and WCCC can be fulfilled simultaneously. Specifically, when Q²/M² exceeds 1 but certain parameters are non-zero, the black hole maintains event horizons, thus satisfying WCCC, and WGC is also supported. This suggests a nuanced interplay where the conjectures align under specific conditions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the compatibility of WGC and WCCC is possible in certain parameter regions of the KNKL black hole. The presence of spin and other parameters allows both conjectures to coexist, indicating their agreement under specific conditions, which opens new avenues for testing these conjectures in quantum gravity models.

Abstract: This paper addresses a potential validation of the weak gravity conjecture
(WGC) with the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC), as a significant
challenge in quantum gravity. We explore the viability of the WGC and WCCC in
the context of the Kerr-Newman-Kiselev-Letelier (KNKL) black hole. Although
these conjectures appear unrelated, but surprising connection between these
conjectures, It establishes a bridge between the quantum and the cosmic. By
imposing specific constraints on the black hole's parameters, we demonstrate
that the WGC and WCCC can be compatible in certain regions. We examine the
properties of the KNKL black hole for $q/m > (Q/M )_{ext}$, where $(Q/M
)_{ext}$ is the charge-to-mass ratio of a large extremal black hole. We present
figures to test the validity of both conjectures simultaneously. Without the
spin parameter \(a\), the cloud of string parameter \(b\), quintessence
parameter \(\gamma\), and equation of state parameter \(\omega\), the black
hole either has two event horizons if \(Q^2/M^2 \leq 1\) or none event horizon
if \(Q^2/M^2 > 1\) which leads to a naked singularity that contradicts the
WCCC. However, when \(a\), \(b\), \(\gamma\), and \(\omega\) are present, the
black hole has event horizons in some regions in the \(Q^2/M^2 > 1\) that
ensure the singularity is covered and both the WGC and WCCC are fulfilled.
Actually, we face this issue in the extremality state of the black hole viz
these conjectures remain viable, with the black hole maintaining an event
horizon. We conclude that certain regions of \(a\), \(b\), \(\gamma\), and
\(\omega\) parameters can make the WGC and WCCC compatible, indicating their
agreement when these parameters are present.

Abstract: Thermodynamical topology has emerged as a powerful framework for classifying
the thermodynamical behavior of black holes. Three distinct yet complementary
topological invariants have been employed to characterize black hole phases,
spinodal curves, and critical points in black hole thermodynamics. In this
work, we develop a unified framework that integrates these three topological
approaches and introduce the concept of extended thermodynamical topology,
providing a clear physical interpretation. As a first step, we apply this
framework to black holes in Einstein gravity, systematically elucidating their
phase structure in terms of topological invariants. We then extend our analysis
to black holes in 7-dimensional Lovelock gravity, where novel thermodynamic
phenomena naturally emerge from the topological perspective. Moreover, we
explore the connection between critical exponents and the extended
thermodynamical topology, uncovering a correspondence between the zeros of the
$k$-th order vector field and the associated critical exponents. Our study
demonstrates that extended thermodynamical topology offers a robust and
fine-grained framework for analyzing and classifying black hole phase
transitions.

*Moongul Byun,Taewon Yuk,Young-Kwon Han,Debabrata Ghorai,Sang-Jin Sin*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper uses holographic mean-field theory to derive topological invariants, like Chern numbers, in strongly interacting systems, showing these invariants are robust under changes and pointing out limitations of perturbative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding topological properties in complex many-body systems using advanced theoretical tools like holographic methods.

Method: Obtaining analytic expressions for Green's functions, constructing Hamiltonians, integrating Berry curvature to find Chern numbers, and comparing with perturbative field theory.

Result: Topological invariants are robust and can be defined in holographic theories, unlike perturbative methods.

Conclusion: H-MFT captures the topology of strongly correlated systems near quantum critical points, highlighting its utility and limitations compared to other approaches.

Abstract: We investigate topological invariants in strongly interacting many-body
systems within holographic mean-field theory (H-MFT) framework. Analytic
expressions for retarded Green's functions are obtained for all possible
fermionic bilinear interactions in the limit of probe background limit
$\mathrm{AdS}_4$, from which we construct topological Hamiltonians. Integrating
Berry curvature over the momentum domain for the gapped spectra yields
well-defined and quantized Chern numbers, enabling a systematic classification
of them across interaction types. These topological invariants remain robust
under deformation parameters like interaction and temperature, indicating that
H-MFT encodes effective single-particle-state topology near a quantum critical
point in strongly correlated systems. We point out why topological number is
defined in the holographic theories while it is not in the perturbative field
theory.

Result: 在MHV过程中，通过扩展对称代数，成功的推导出缺失的两个KZ方程，扩展了对MHV散射过程的对称性理解。

Conclusion: 该研究为MHV散射过程提供了一种新的对称性框架，并通过扩展对称代数补充了现有的KZ方程，进一步丰富了散射理论。

Abstract: We revisit the holographic symmetry algebra in the MHV sector. We find an
infinite dimensional Abelian symmetry algebra whose generators are the
conformally soft negative helicity gravitons and gluons. So the complete
symmetry algebra in the MHV graviton sector is a semideirect product of the
$w_{1+\infty}$ algebra and the infinite dimensional Abelian algebra. Similarly
in the MHV gluon sector the symmetry algebra is a semidirect product of the $S$
algebra and the infinite dimensional Abelian algebra. The extended symmetry
algebra has some use. For example, it is known for sometime that an $n$ point
MHV amplitude satisfies $(n-2)$ Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) type equations. So
two equations are missing. We show that the extended symmetry algebra has
additional null states whose decoupling give rise to the two missing equations.

Abstract: We consider a stationary solution of a charged black hole with scalar hair in
AdS$_4$, where the scalar field is coupled to a $U(1)$ Maxwell gauge field.
Near the singularity, the spacetime transitions into a more general Kasner
geometry. The black hole is then injected with rotating and charged
gravitational shock waves in the Dray-'t Hooft solution. These shock waves
lengthen the wormhole connecting the two asymptotic boundaries, thereby
disrupting the correlations between them. The correlation, quantified by the
quantum mutual information between subregions on the left and right boundaries,
vanishes at a characteristic timescale known as the scrambling time, which
depends logarithmically on the black hole entropy. The mutual information is
computed holographically using the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription for entanglement
entropy. We investigate how the rotation and charge of both the black hole and
the shock waves affect chaotic properties such as the scrambling time and the
Lyapunov exponent. The interaction between the charges of the black hole and
the shock waves introduces a delay in the scrambling process. We find that as
the strength of the boundary deformation increases, both the Lyapunov exponent
and the scrambling time delay decrease monotonically. Furthermore, the angular
momentum of the shock waves enhances both the Lyapunov exponent and the
scrambling time delay.

Abstract: The formulation of gravity theories on noncommutative (NC) spacetimes has
been an active area of research for some time. Various models and methods have
been proposed in the literature. Even within the star-product formalism, there
are several distinct approaches to constructing NC deformations of General
Relativity (GR) and Einstein-Cartan-Palatini (ECP) gravity. Some models are
based on the NC local Lorentz symmetry, while others rely on NC deformations of
the diffeomorphism symmetry of GR. In this paper, we investigate the connection
between two NC gravity models based on twisted and braided NC diffeomorphism
symmetry. Although these two models yield different NC gravity actions, we show
that, in certain cases, they lead to the same phenomenological consequences. In
particular, they share identical three-graviton vertex and exhibit some simple
common vacuum solutions. This work represents a step towards understanding the
diverse landscape of NC gravity models constructed within the star-product
framework.

*Simeng Li,Yaobo Zhang*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method using CNNs for the inverse CHY problem, leveraging combinatorial structures and exact solutions, while conventional ML approaches only provide approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics and mathematics require exact solutions, especially in scattering amplitudes, which drives the search for novel methods that can provide these solutions efficiently and accurately.

Method: The approach involves using Combinatorial Neural Networks to map CHY combinatorics, employing generalized pole degrees and hierarchical recursion relations that are handled by CNN architectures for message passing and automatic differentiation, ensuring exact integer constraints remain intact.

Result: The method successfully constructs integrands with exact solutions by leveraging the CHY formalism's combinatorial structure, using CNNs to handle the problem's recursive nature while preserving mathematical constraints.

Conclusion: This innovative approach suggests a new direction for applying machine learning, particularly CNNs, in solving complex problems in theoretical physics and mathematics, offering a bridge between combinatorics, machine learning, and amplitude theory.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to the inverse CHY problem-constructing
integrands from desired pole structures-by establishing a correspondence
between CHY combinatorics and Combinatorial Neural Networks (CNNs). Our key
innovation is the generalized pole degree $K(s_A)$, which is additive under
integrand multiplication and satisfies hierarchical recursion relations. These
recursions naturally map to CNN message-passing architectures, enabling
discrete automatic differentiation that preserves exact integer constraints
throughout the computation. Unlike conventional machine learning approaches
that yield numerical approximations, our method leverages the intrinsic
combinatorial structure of the CHY formalism to guarantee exact algebraic
solutions. This work demonstrates how specialized neural architectures can
solve fundamental physics problems requiring strict mathematical constraints,
providing a modest step toward bridging combinatorics, machine learning, and
scattering amplitude theory.

### [62] [Flux tube formation and the Weingarten representation of center vortices and chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02341)
*David R. Junior,Luis E. Oxman*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses recent work on modeling center and noncenter vortices in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using mixed ensembles. It employs the Weingarten representation to derive a partition function for Abelian-projected vortex worldsurfaces, which accounts for N-ality and supports the dual superconductor model for confinement. The paper elucidates how Goldstone modes from percolating non-Abelian surfaces contribute to flux tubes in confinement mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is rooted in understanding confinement mechanisms in QCD, specifically how magnetic monopoles, vortices, and Goldstone modes contribute to the formation of flux tubes, which is a key aspect of the dual superconductor model.

Method: The authors use the Weingarten representation to formalize the partition function for Abelian-projected vortex ensembles, which allows them to model N-ality and analyze the role of mixed center-vortex configurations in confinement.

Result: The key finding is that a mixed ensemble of center and noncenter vortices provides an Abelian projection that effectively captures confinement via magnetic monopole condensation, aligning with the dual superconductor mechanism. This approach successfully describes the formation of flux tubes through percolation of these vortex surfaces with non-Abelian degrees of freedom, and the Goldstone modes contribute to the flux tube formation by enabling long-range interactions through non-Abelian percolation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the mixed vortex model, through its integration of Abelian and non-Abelian components, offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the confinement mechanism in QCD, particularly the role of magnetic monopoles, Goldstone modes, and percolation in flux tube formation and confinement.

Abstract: We review some recent results regarding the formulation of mixed ensembles of
oriented and nonoriented center vortices based on the Weingarten representation
for the sum over surfaces. This framework enabled a partition function for the
Abelian-projected ensemble of vortex worldsurfaces, previously formulated as a
wavefunctional peaked at center-vortex loops. In particular, we showed how an
Abelian ensemble can account for $N$-ality while supporting a ``dual
superconductor'' model for confinement. This formulation also clarified the
description of the Goldstone modes for percolating surfaces with non-Abelian
degrees of freedom, used in the original mechanism for the formation of a
confining flux tube due to the percolating mixed ensemble.

### [63] [Algebraic structures of Vassiliev invariants for knot families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02385)
*E. Lanina,A. Sleptsov*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Abstract discusses algebraic relations on Vassiliev knot invariants for multi-parameter knot families. It shows that for k-parametric families, the algebra is finitely generated with at most k independent invariants, but it's unknown if fewer invariants could form a complete set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to be about knot invariants and their algebraic structures. I'm interested in understanding the relationships between knot parameters and the completeness of Vassiliev invariants.

Method: The method involves algebraic analysis of Vassiliev invariants using correlators in Chern-Simons theory. It uses abstract algebra to show relations within knot families.

Result: The study proves that k-parametric knot families have at most k independent Vassiliev invariants. Examples suggest that exactly k are needed, but it's unknown if fewer could suffice.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that for knot families with k parameters, a complete invariant set requires at least k Vassiliev invariants, but it's still an open question in the field.

Abstract: We explore algebraic relations on Vassiliev knot invariants expressed through
correlators in the 3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. Vassiliev invariants form
an infinite-dimensional algebra. We focus on $k$-parametric knot families with
Vassiliev invariants being polynomials in family parameters. It turns out that
such a 1-parametric algebra of Vassiliev invariants is always finitely
generated, while in the case of more parameters, the number of generators can
be infinite. Inside a knot family, there appear extra algebraic relations on
Vassiliev invariants. We show that there are $\leq k$ algebraically independent
Vassiliev invariants for a $k$-parametric knot family. However, in all our
examples, the number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants is
exactly $k$, and it is an open question if there exists a $k$-parametric knot
family with a fewer number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants.
We also demonstrate that a complete knot invariant of some $k$-parametric knot
families consists of $\leq k$ Vassiliev invariants. Again, we have only
examples of a set of $k$ Vassiliev invariants being a complete invariant of a
$k$-parametric knot family. Currently, it is unknown whether a set of a fewer
number of Vassiliev invariants cannot be a complete knot family invariant.

Conclusion: 该模型对Ising融合代数的实现具有普适意义，展示了弱Hopf对称性在扩展会边界框架中的作用，并对理解对称性扩展具有理论意义。

Abstract: In this work, we present a construction of a cluster state lattice
Hamiltonian that exhibits the symmetry of the Ising fusion algebra. This
construction is formulated within the framework of weak Hopf symmetry
topological field theory (SymTFT), where we assign smooth and rough boundaries
to the weak Hopf quantum double model, thereby extending the conventional
cluster state model. Central to our construction is the weak Hopf Ising
boundary tube algebra $\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}$, whose representation
category is equivalent to the Ising fusion category $\mathsf{Ising}$. We take
this algebra as the input data for the weak Hopf quantum double model. The
resulting model exhibits Ising fusion symmetry on both open and closed
$1\text{d}$ manifolds. On open manifolds, the symmetry is governed by
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}} \otimes \mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee}$; on
closed manifolds, it reduces to
$\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}) \otimes
\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$. Since the Ising
fusion algebra embeds into
$\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$, the model
faithfully realizes the symmetry of the Ising fusion category.

Abstract: We consider a toy model of a 3-dimensional topological quantum gravity. In
this model, a contribution of a given 3-manifold is given by the partition
function of an abelian Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT), with a
topological boundary condition at the boundary. Using the fact that the TQFT
partition function depends only on the first homology group of the 3-manifold
with some additional structure, the sum over all 3-manifolds with fixed
boundary can be rewritten as a sum over finitely generated abelian groups (and
the extra structure). We present bounds on the universal weights in the sum,
that is, the measure on the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated
abelian groups (with the extra structure) sufficient for the sum to be
convergent. Moreover, with further assumptions on the measure, we argue the
existence of a distribution of 2d TQFTs, such that the sum is equal to the
ensemble average of their partition functions evaluated on the boundary. For a
certain kind of measure, the sum over the abelian groups can be factorized into
sums over abelian $p$-groups, and the analysis can be performed independently
for each prime $p$.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) are special classes of quantum field theories
that find applications ranging from critical phenomena to theories of quantum
gravity via holography. Understanding thermal effects in CFTs is crucial:
criticality is experimentally probed at finite temperature, and, from the
holographic perspective, the study of thermal CFTs is dual to the study of
black holes in Anti-de Sitter space. In this thesis, we explore the kinematics
and dynamics of finite-temperature CFTs by analyzing broken and unbroken
symmetries and adapting various analytical and numerical bootstrap approaches
to finite-temperature correlation functions. These methods are
non-perturbatively valid and can be tested against exactly solvable models,
such as free theories and two-dimensional systems, as well as compared with
perturbative calculations. The main applications discussed in this thesis
concern one- and two-point functions and the free energy density in the O(N)
models in three dimensions, with particular focus on the 3d Ising, XY, and
Heisenberg models (N = 1,2,3).

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper solves a long-standing problem in variational calculus on noncommutative spaces by developing a quantum Anderson complex and applying it to free lattice fields, deriving key equations and conserved tensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variational calculus on noncommutative spaces is a challenging problem that has hindered progress in understanding quantum geometries and field theories on such spaces. This paper addresses this by introducing a novel quantum Anderson complex, providing a framework to derive Euler-Lagrange equations and conserved quantities, which is crucial for advancing the mathematical foundations of quantum field theories on noncommutative backgrounds.

Method: The authors employ a quantum version of the Anderson variational double complex Ω(J^∞). This involves constructing the complex in the context of noncommutative spaces, defining analogues of jet bundles, and developing Euler-Lagrange equations and a Noether theorem adapted to this setting. They also utilize techniques from discrete geometry, considering Z^m lattices as discrete noncommutative spacetimes.

Result: By applying this framework to a free scalar field on a Z^m lattice, they derive the Klein-Gordon equation, including terms for a general metric and gauge field background. In the flat metric case, they further obtain an exactly on-shell conserved stress-energy tensor and Noether charges, demonstrating the feasibility of their approach in concrete physical models.

Conclusion: This work provides a significant breakthrough by extending variational calculus to noncommutative spaces, offering tools to study quantum fields on such geometries. The results, particularly for lattice models, open new avenues for studying discrete quantum gravity and condensed matter systems with noncommutative structures, paving the way for further theoretical developments and potential applications in physics.

Abstract: We solve the long-standing problem of variational calculus on a
noncommutative space or spacetime for a significant class of models with
trivial jet bundle. Our approach entails a quantum version of the Anderson
variational double complex $\Omega(J^\infty)$ and includes Euler-Lagrange
equations and a partial Noether's theorem. We show in detail how this works for
a free field on a $\Bbb Z^m$ lattice regarded as a discrete noncommutative
geometry, obtaining the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field, including
with a general metric and gauge field background, as the Euler-Lagrange
equations of motion for an action. In the case of a flat metric we also obtain
an exactly on-shell conserved stress-energy tensor and Noether charges for a
scalar field on the lattice.

Motivation:                   

Method: ,      

Result:      

Conclusion:      

Abstract: We study three-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant under
non-standard boundary conditions where chemical potentials are determined
dynamically. Using a boundary Hamiltonian inspired by collective field theory
(ColFT), the boundary dynamics reduce to those of a one-dimensional fluid on a
circle, with configurations corresponding to bulk geometries such as BTZ black
holes. Quantizing the system via bosonization of relativistic fermions, we
obtain a microscopic description of black hole states in terms of Young
diagrams, whose degeneracies match the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We compute
the Euclidean canonical partition function and free energy for both the ColFT
Hamiltonian and a relativistic free-fermion Hamiltonian. In the ColFT case, the
partition function resembles that of chiral U(N) Yang-Mills theory on a torus,
with N~1/(\beta G). This offers a novel way to compute quantum corrections to
the partition function. The leading entropy term receives contributions from
all genera, while the subleading logarithmic correction is one-loop exact,
arising solely from the genus-one sector with coefficient -1/2 . This
coefficient remains unchanged in the relativistic fermion case, suggesting the
universality of the one-loop correction across different boundary Hamiltonians.

Abstract: The study of three dimensional CFT correlators in twistor space has recently
garnered a significant interest. Conformal symmetry acts linearly in the
twistor space, which streamlines the analysis. Moreover, twistors provide a
connection to the position and momentum space through the Penrose and Witten
transforms, respectively. In this work, we develop the supersymmetric versions
of Penrose and Witten transforms for three dimensional superconformal field
theories for $\mathcal{N}=1\;\textrm{to}\;4$. We derive two and three point
functions in the position and momentum superspace for the $\mathcal{N}=1$
scenario using these transforms. Extending this setup to higher supersymmetries
turns out to be a simple extension of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ case, which aligns
with the inherent simplicity of supertwistors.

Abstract: The AdS/CFT equivalence transformation is a field redefinition that relates
the Weyl dilaton and AdS brane realizations of broken conformal symmetry.
Acting on theories with second order equations of motion, it maps the conformal
galileons to the DBI galileons for a flat brane probing an AdS bulk. Here we
extend this map to arbitrary dimensions and resolve an apparent puzzle
regarding the Wess-Zumino terms in odd dimensions.

Method: The paper employs the MCDHF method along with RDW theory to compute atomic properties for Krypton and Xenon. These include electron-impact excitation, rate coefficients, and collision strengths, which are then used in a Collisional-Radiative model.

Result: The results show accurate excitation energy and cross-section calculations, along with predicted emission line intensities. They also analyze how line ratios change with temperature.

Conclusion: This research successfully provides detailed atomic data for Na-like Krypton and Xenon, validated through comparisons with previous studies, which can be applied for future work in plasma modeling and other related scientific studies.

Abstract: As an extension to our previous work [1], a comprehensive theoretical study
for Na-like Krypton and Xenon is carried out. Using MCDHF (Multiconfiguration
Dirac-Hartee-Fock) along with RDW (Relativistic distorted wave) theory we
calculate key atomic properties, electron-impact excitation (EIE), rate
coefficients, and collision strength for these ions. We use these parameters to
build a Collisional-Radiative model for Na-like Krypton and Xenon. For Na-like
Krypton we compare our computed excitation energy, EIE cross-sections, rate
coefficients, emission line intensity with previous work. Additionally we
investigate variation of line ratios with temperature. For Na-like Xenon we
compared excitation energy for various fine-structure with NIST( [2]) database
and then provide our computed results for EIE cross-section,intensity profile,
and the temperature dependence of line ratios for Na-like Xenon. Our findings
offer atomic data for studies related Na-like ions.

Conclusion: 该方法为微波领域的高灵敏检测提供了一种新的可能性。

Abstract: The Rydberg-based microwave detection is an all-optical technology that uses
the strong coherent interaction between Rydberg atoms and microwave field.
Different from the traditional microwave meter, the Rydberg atomic sensing is a
new-type microwave detector that transforms the microwave spectrum into a
coherent optical spectrum, and arouses increasingly the interests due to its
high sensibility. For this kind of sensor, the coherence effect induced by
coupling atoms with microwave plays a key role, and the decoherence may reduce
the sensitivity. A multi-level Rydberg atomic scheme with optimized quantum
coherence, which enhances both the bandwidth and the sensitivity for 4 GHz
microwave sensing, is demonstrated experimentally in this work. The enhanced
quantum coherence of Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and
microwave induced Autler-Townes (AT) splitting in EIT windows are shown using
optical pumping at D1 line. The enhanced sensitivity at 3.4 GHz with 0.3 GHz
bandwidth can be realized, based on the enhanced EIT-AT spectrum. The
experimental results show that in the stepped Rydberg EIT system, the spectral
width of EIT and microwave field EIT-AT can be narrowed by optical pumping
(OP), so the sensitivity of microwave electric field measurement can be
improved. After optimizing the EIT amplitude and adding single-frequency
microwaves, the sensitivity of the microwave electric field measurement
observed by the AT splitting interval is improved by 1.3 times. This work
provides a reference for utilizing atomic microwave detection.

Abstract: We report the production of an intense and controlled beam of electronically
excited sulfur atoms in the $^1D_2$ state using a multistage Zeeman
decelerator. Sulfur atoms, generated via photolysis of CS$_2$, are produced in
both the ground $^3P_J$ and excited $^1D_2$ states. We demonstrate that both
can be manipulated using the decelerator, and that temporal separation between
them can be achieved by operating in deceleration mode. This enables the
generation of sulfur atom beams with a well-defined velocity, narrow velocity
spreads, and an enhanced quantum-state purity. To assess the suitability of the
beam for scattering studies, we performed a proof-of-principle elastic
collision experiment with S($^1D_2$) and argon atoms. The observed
velocity-map-imaging signal confirms that the S($^1D_2$) beam density is
sufficient for detailed scattering studies. These results form the foundation
for future studies of reactive and quenching processes involving S($^1D_2$)
atoms at tunable and well-defined collision energies.

Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a promising protocol for demonstrating
quantum computational advantage. One of the key steps for proving classical
hardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one
can ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of
Haar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove
the hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed
states, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen
et al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states
that a $o(\sqrt{M})\times o(\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\times M$ circular
orthogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex
Gaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\to\infty$. This is the first
rigorous proof of the hiding property for GBS in the experimentally relevant
regime, and puts the argument for hardness of classically simulating GBS with a
maximal number of squeezed states on a comparable level to that of the
conventional boson sampling of [Aaronson and Arkhipov, Theory Comput. 9, 143
(2013)].

Motivation: The work aims to enhance the application of quantum information theory in nonlinear imaging techniques, specifically in CSARS, by identifying optimal measurement strategies and introducing advanced imaging schemes to improve resolution and sensitivity.

Method: The authors used tools from quantum information theory to analyze the fundamental precision limits of CSARS. They identified optimal measurement strategies, particularly applying spatial mode demultiplexing, and introduced an advanced imaging scheme using vortex beams to enhance image information.

Result: They demonstrated that spatial mode demultiplexing can achieve quantum limits and improve the sensitivity of conventional intensity measurements. Additionally, they proposed an improved imaging scheme using vortex beams to achieve higher resolution and sensitivity in the quantum state of light.

Conclusion: The research establishes a clear path for quantum-enhanced nonlinear imaging by fusing quantum science concepts with existing microscopy methods, thus bridging the gap between traditional microscopy and quantum technologies.

Abstract: Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering is a widely used imaging technique that
provides chemical contrast without the need for labels, making it an extremely
valuable tool in physics, chemistry, and biology. In this work, we explore its
fundamental precision limits by applying tools from quantum information theory.
We identify optimal measurement strategies and show that spatial mode
demultiplexing--a technique already accessible in current experimental
setups--can achieve these quantum limits and in many situations improve the
sensitivity of conventional intensity measurements. Building on this, we
introduce an advanced imaging scheme based on vortex beams, which we predict to
enhance the image information in the final quantum state of light and thereby
lead to even higher resolution and sensitivity. These findings establish a
clear path for enhancing nonlinear imaging techniques using concepts from
quantum science, bridging the gap between established microscopy methods and
the emerging capabilities of quantum technologies.

Abstract: In conventional exchange-only (EO) spin qubit demonstrations, quantum gates
have been implemented using sequences of individually pulsed pairwise exchange
interactions with only one exchange coupling active at a time. Alternatively,
multiple non-commuting exchange interactions can be pulsed simultaneously,
reducing circuit depths and providing protection against leakage. We
demonstrate high-fidelity quantum control of an always-on exchange-only (AEON)
qubit, operated using simultaneous exchange pulses in a triangular quantum dot
(QD) array. We use blind randomized benchmarking to characterize the
performance of the full AEON single-qubit Clifford gate set, achieving an
average Clifford gate fidelity $F_{\rm C1}$ = 99.86\%. Extensions of this work
may enable more efficient EO two-qubit entangling gates as well as the
implementation of native $i$-Toffoli gates in Loss-DiVincenzo single-spin

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  paper introduces QSQS, a quantum-inspired system for randomness generation that utilizes sorting process observables, with empirical results showing improved entropy and uniformity. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents an innovative approach to random number generation by drawing inspiration from quantum mechanics and leveraging sorting process observables. The motivation is to provide a reliable and efficient method for generating true randomness which can be useful in various applications, especially in post-quantum cryptography. 

Method: QSQS is designed by measuring two conjugate observables, n_p and t, from a permutation sorting process. The measurement of sorting time t is influenced by CPU pipeline jitter, cache latency, and OS scheduling, which are used to dynamically reseed a PRNG. The system then processes the raw distributions to produce nearly uniform outputs. 

Result: The empirical results demonstrate that the QSQS-based RNG achieves high entropy (approaching 8 bits) and uniformity, with chi-squared statistics stabilizing near ideal values and bell curves confirming distribution flattening. These results validate the effectiveness of QSQS in generating high-quality randomness. 

Conclusion: QSQS offers a scalable and efficient physics-based solution for engineering true random number generators, which are crucial for secure post-quantum cryptographic systems. The method leverages inherent physical fluctuations to ensure high entropy and reliability.

Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate the \emph{Quasi-Superposition
Quantum-inspired System (QSQS)} -- a conceptual quantum system for randomness
generation built on measuring two conjugate observables of a permutation
sorting process: the deterministic permutation count $n_p$ and the
fundamentally non-deterministic sorting time $t$. By analogy with quantum
systems, these observables are linked by an uncertainty-like constraint:
algorithmic determinism ensures structural uniformity, while system-level
fluctuations introduce irreducible unpredictability. We realize this framework
concretely as \emph{QPP-RNG}, a system-embedded, software-based true random
number generator (TRNG). In QPP-RNG, real-time measurements of sorting time $t$
-- shaped by CPU pipeline jitter, cache latency, and OS scheduling --
dynamically reseed the PRNG driving the permutation sequence. Crucially, QSQS
transforms initially right-skewed raw distributions of $n_p$ and $t$ into
nearly uniform outputs after modulo reduction, thanks to internal degeneracies
that collapse many distinct states into the same output symbol. Empirical
results show that as the repetition factor $m$ increases, output entropy
converges toward theoretical maxima: Shannon and min-entropy values approach 8
bits, chi-squared statistics stabilize near ideal uniformity, and bell curves
visually confirm the flattening from skewed to uniform distributions. Beyond
practical implications, QSQS unifies deterministic algorithmic processes with
non-deterministic physical fluctuations, offering a physics-based perspective
for engineering true randomness in post-quantum cryptographic systems.

Motivation: The authors are addressing the challenge of improving the sensitivity of microwave metrology for quantum sensing by developing a more sensitive rf-to-microwave transducer.

Method: The method involves using a metalized Si3N4 membrane as a tunable electrostatic pre-amplifier and integrating it with a superconducting electromechanical cavity. A dc bias is applied across the gap to convert rf signals into resonant electrostatic force, achieving voltage-controlled gain.

Result: The transducer achieves a charge sensitivity of 87 μe/√Hz (0.9 nV/√Hz) in a flip-chip device with a 1.5 μm gap. Extrapolations predict even lower sensitivity for sub-micron gaps and advanced membranes.

Conclusion: This work contributes significantly to quantum-grade rf electrometers and low-noise modular heterodyne links, paving the way for advanced quantum sensing applications in superconducting microwave circuits.

Abstract: We report a two-stage, heterodyne rf-to-microwave transducer that combines a
tunable electrostatic pre-amplifier with a superconducting electromechanical
cavity. A metalized Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane (3 MHz frequency) forms the movable
plate of a vacuum-gap capacitor in a microwave LC resonator. A dc bias across
the gap converts any small rf signal into a resonant electrostatic force
proportional to the bias, providing a voltage-controlled gain that multiplies
the cavity's intrinsic electromechanical gain. In a flip-chip device with a 1.5
$\mathrm{\mu}$m gap operated at 10 mK we observe dc-tunable anti-spring shifts,
and rf-to-microwave transduction at 49 V bias, achieving a charge sensitivity
of 87 $\mathrm{\mu}$e/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ (0.9 nV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$).
Extrapolation to sub-micron gaps and state-of-the-art $Q>10^8$ membrane
resonators predicts sub-200 fV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity, establishing
dc-biased electromechanics as a practical route towards quantum-grade rf
electrometers and low-noise modular heterodyne links for superconducting
microwave circuits and charge or voltage sensing.

Abstract: We establish a device-independent, noise-tolerant certification of maximally
entangled states in every finite dimension $d$. The core ingredient is a
$d$-input, $d$-outcome Bell experiment that generalizes the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt test from qubits to qudits, where each setting is a
non-diagonal Heisenberg-Weyl observable. For every odd prime $d \geq 3$, the
associated Bell operator has an exact sum-of-positive-operators decomposition,
yielding the Cirelson bound in closed form, from which we reconstruct the
Heisenberg-Weyl commutation relations on the support of the state. We then
extend the Mayers-Yao local isometry from qubits to prime-dimensional systems
and show that any $\epsilon$-near-optimal strategy below that bound is, up to
local isometries, within trace distance $\delta = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\epsilon})$
of the ideal maximally entangled state; the implemented measurements are
correspondingly close to the target observables. Via a tensor-factor argument,
the prime-dimension result extends the self-testing protocol to every composite
dimension $d$. The protocol uses standard Heisenberg-Weyl operations and
non-Clifford phase gates that are diagonal in the computational basis, making
it directly applicable to high-dimensional photonic and atomic platforms.

InAsP/InP nanowire QD aligns with the absorption bandwidth of the EDF at 980 nm
at cryogenic temperatures, allowing efficient interaction between the two
systems. To demonstrate this, we present a spectroscopic characterization of
the $^{4}I_{15/2} \leftrightarrow ^{4}I_{11/2}$ optical transition in EDF at
980 nm. Our measurements reveal substantial inhomogeneous broadening of this
optical transition and a long spin population lifetime, underscoring EDFs
potential for broadband QM implementation. We implement an 8 GHz bandwidth
multimode QM based on the Atomic Frequency Comb protocol, enabling the storage
and retrieval of 59 weak coherent pulses. Furthermore, we characterize
single-photon emission from an InAsP/InP nanowire QD at 980 nm and demonstrate
its deterministic storage and recall in the EDF QM. Notably, this is achieved
without spectral tuning of the QD emission, demonstrating its direct
compatibility with a solid-state QM.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems exhibit a rich array of physical
phenomena, including non-Hermitian skin effects and exceptional points, that
remain largely inaccessible to existing numerical techniques. In this work, we
investigate the application of variational Monte Carlo and neural network
wavefunction representations to examine their ground-state (the eigenstate with
the smallest real part energy) properties. Due to the breakdown of the
Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle in non-Hermitian settings, we develop a
self-consistent symmetric optimization framework based on variance minimization
with a dynamically updated energy estimate. Our approach respects the
biorthogonal structure of left and right eigenstates, and is further
strengthened by exploiting system symmetries and pseudo-Hermiticity. Tested on
a two-dimensional non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model endowed with a
complex longitudinal field, our method achieves high accuracy across both
parity-time symmetric and broken phases. Moreover, we propose novel
optimization routines that address the challenges posed by exceptional points
and provide reliable convergence to the ground state in regimes where standard
variational techniques fail. Lastly, we show, through extensive numerical
evidence, that our method offers a scalable and flexible computational tool to
investigate non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems, beyond the reach of
conventional numerical techniques such as the density-matrix renormalization
group algorithm.

### [85] [A causal derivation of the algebraic approach to quantum systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01111)
*Nick Ormrod*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a new perspective on quantum systems by focusing on their causal structure, proving that every quantum system can be uniquely represented by a von Neumann algebra. It contrasts this 'causal view' with the traditional 'epistemic view' which is incompatible with such an algebraic approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reinterpret the foundational understanding of quantum systems by moving away from the traditional operator algebraic framework, which has been a cornerstone of quantum mechanics since von Neumann's work.

Method: The authors use an analysis of recent frameworks in quantum causal modelling and explore the implications of defining quantum systems in terms of their causal structure. They derive the algebraic representation from this causal foundation and compare it with an alternative view.

Result: Mathematically proving that every quantum system corresponds to a unique von Neumann algebra, thereby establishing a direct link between the causal view and the algebraic approach. They also define a classical quantum system within this framework.

Conclusion: The paper successfully integrates causal concepts into the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics, providing a new foundation that avoids the issues associated with the traditional operator-based approach, thus unifying various perspectives.

Abstract: It is commonly assumed that every quantum system is represented by some
algebra of operators. Doubt is cast on this assumption by what appears, at
first glance, to be a reasonable candidate for a quantum system that is not
naturally represented by any algebra. To resolve this puzzle, this work draws
inspiration from recent frameworks for causal modelling in quantum theory to
propose a "causal view" of quantum systems. The causal view defines quantum
systems purely in terms of the causal structure of the unitary dynamics. The
algebraic representation of quantum systems is derived from the causal view: it
is proven that every quantum system corresponds to a unique von Neumann algebra
of operators. The causal view is extended with a definition of a "classical
quantum system" inspired by quantum Darwinism. It is shown that such a system
corresponds to a unique commutative von Neumann operator algebra, completing
the derivation of the traditional algebraic approach to quantum systems from
the causal view. The causal view is contrasted with the "epistemic view" of
quantum systems, which is incompatible with the algebraic approach.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental barriers in
scalability, primarily due to barren plateaus and quantum noise sensitivity. To
address these challenges, we introduce TensoMeta-VQC, a novel tensor-train
(TT)-guided meta-learning framework designed to improve the robustness and
scalability of VQC significantly. Our framework fully delegates the generation
of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling
optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates
gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank
representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Based on
Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical
analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization
stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across
quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum
simulation tasks demonstrate that TensoMeta-VQC consistently achieves superior
performance and robust noise tolerance, establishing it as a principled pathway
toward practical and scalable VQC on near-term quantum devices.

### [87] [Quantum Algorithms for Gowers Norm Estimation, Polynomial Testing, and Arithmetic Progression Counting over Finite Abelian Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01231)
*En-Jui Kuo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes quantum algorithms for estimating Gowers uniformity norms over finite abelian groups, using these norms for testing polynomial structures and counting arithmetic progressions. The methods generalize existing algorithms for U^2 to higher k, employing quantum state preparation and Fourier sampling. Quasipolynomial-time algorithms are developed for distinguishing functions that are degree-d phase polynomials, which are useful for quantum property testing and learning. Additionally, the paper demonstrates these techniques' resilience to quantum noise, making them applicable in NISQ contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of developing efficient quantum algorithms for estimating high-order Gowers uniformity norms, which are crucial for various applications in theoretical computer science such as testing polynomial structures and counting arithmetic progressions. By providing a generalization from the U^2 case to arbitrary k, the authors aim to enhance the applicability of quantum algorithms in these areas, potentially leading to advancements in quantum property testing and pseudorandomness.

Method: The paper employs a combination of quantum state preparation techniques, leveraging recent advancements in Gowers norms, and combines them with amplitude estimation. Fourier analysis is used to sample and estimate the uniformity norms. This involves generalizing constructions from finite fields to abelian groups for higher k, integrating inverse theorems for Gowers norms, and using amplitude estimation for estimation tasks.

Result: The results include quasipolynomial-time quantum algorithms for distinguishing functions close to certain polynomial structures from those that are far, as well as a method for estimating the number of 3-term arithmetic progressions in Boolean functions. This extends previous work on U^2 to higher k, offering new tools for quantum applications in property testing and pseudorandomness. The algorithms also handle quantum noise robustly, making them suitable for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Additionally, the paper suggests that Gowers-norm-based quantum algorithms can be versatile primitives in quantum computing tasks such as learning and pseudorandomness.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable quantum approach for estimating higher-order Gowers norms, offering novel methods for structure testing and correlation detection. It opens new avenues for quantum algorithms in theoretical computer science, particularly in property testing and pseudorandomness, while ensuring resilience to quantum noise, thus advancing practical applications in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) regime.

Abstract: We propose a family of quantum algorithms for estimating Gowers uniformity
norms $ U^k $ over finite abelian groups and demonstrate their applications to
testing polynomial structure and counting arithmetic progressions. Building on
recent work for estimating the $ U^2 $-norm over $ \mathbb{F}_2^n $, we
generalize the construction to arbitrary finite fields and abelian groups for
higher values of $ k $. Our algorithms prepare quantum states encoding finite
differences and apply Fourier sampling to estimate uniformity norms, enabling
efficient detection of structural correlations.
  As a key application, we show that for certain degrees $ d = 4, 5, 6 $ and
under appropriate conditions on the underlying field, there exist
quasipolynomial-time quantum algorithms that distinguish whether a bounded
function $ f(x) $ is a degree-$ d $ phase polynomial or far from any such
structure. These algorithms leverage recent inverse theorems for Gowers norms,
together with amplitude estimation, to reveal higher-order algebraic
correlations.
  We also develop a quantum method for estimating the number of 3-term
arithmetic progressions in Boolean functions $ f : \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \{0,1\}
$, based on estimating the $ U^2 $-norm. Though not as query-efficient as
Grover-based counting, our approach provides a structure-sensitive alternative
aligned with additive combinatorics.
  Finally, we demonstrate that our techniques remain valid under certain
quantum noise models, due to the shift-invariance of Gowers norms. This enables
noise-resilient implementations within the NISQ regime and suggests that
Gowers-norm-based quantum algorithms may serve as robust primitives for quantum
property testing, learning, and pseudorandomness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of quantum processors has led to scalability challenges in superconducting systems due to limitations in dilution refrigerators. Building a quantum network across different refrigerators requires efficient photonic links, which this paper addresses with experimental results.

Method: The study used frequency-matched aluminum nitride electro-optic transducers connected via a 1-km telecom fiber to create a coherent signal transfer system between two superconducting circuits in separate refrigerators. They measured the efficiency and transduction, showing significant improvement over commercial modulators.

Result: The system achieved an 80 dB efficiency improvement, indicating a successful demonstration of a scalable photonic link, which is crucial for quantum computation networks.

Conclusion: The results pave the way for scalable and reliable quantum networks by overcoming the challenge of connecting separate dilution refrigerators, thus enabling future practical quantum computations at scale.

Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are a leading platform for implementing
practical quantum computation algorithms. Although superconducting quantum
processors with hundreds of qubits have been demonstrated, their further
scaling up is constrained by the physical size and cooling power of dilution
refrigerators. This constraint can be overcome by constructing a quantum
network to interconnect qubits hosted in different refrigerators, which
requires microwave-to-optical transducers to enable low-loss signal
transmission over long distances. Despite that various designs and
demonstrations have achieved high-efficiency and low-added-noise transducers, a
coherent photonic link between separate refrigerators has not yet been
realized. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate coherent signal transfer
between two superconducting circuits housed in separate dilution refrigerators,
enabled by a pair of frequency-matched aluminum nitride electro-optic
transducers connected via a 1-km telecom optical fiber. With transducers at
each node achieving >0.1% efficiency, an overall 80 dB improvement in
transduction efficiency over commercial electro-optic modulators is attainable,
paving the way towards a fully quantum-enabled link. This work provides
critical design guidelines towards scalable superconducting quantum networks
interconnected by photonic links.

Abstract: Long-term stability of superconducting microwave resonators is essential for
scalable quantum technologies; however, surface and interface degradation
continue to limit device stability. Here, we demonstrate exceptional stability
in microstrip resonators fabricated from epitaxial tantalum and aluminum films,
protected by in situ deposited Al$_2$O$_3$ under ultra-high vacuum. These
resonators initially exhibit internal quality factors (Qi) exceeding one
million and maintain high performance with minimal degradation after up to
fourteen months of air exposure. In contrast, devices relying on native surface
oxides show substantial declines in Qi over time, indicating increased
microwave losses. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the in situ
Al$_2$O$_3$ effectively suppresses interfacial oxidation and preserves the
chemical integrity of the underlying superconducting films, whereas native
oxides permit progressive oxidation, leading to device degradation. These
findings establish a robust, scalable passivation strategy that addresses a
longstanding materials challenge in the development of superconducting quantum
circuits.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method using Magnus expansion and polynomial optimization to synthesize quantum gates faster than existing methods. This is significant because faster and more accurate quantum gates are essential for advancing quantum computing. The method avoids approximations and reduces computational effort while maintaining high accuracy compared to current techniques like CRAB and GRAPE.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization of quantum gates is crucial for enhancing the performance of quantum computing technologies. This paper aims to address the challenge of synthesizing gates more efficiently and accurately by leveraging mathematical tools such as Magnus expansion and polynomial optimization. The goal is to achieve faster convergence and better scalability, which directly impacts the practical implementation of quantum computing.

Method: The authors formulate a polynomial optimization problem using Magnus expansion and optimize over Hermitian matrices that generate unitaries, thereby simplifying the optimization process. This approach ensures global optima without requiring exponential approximations, improving upon existing methods like QCPOP, CRAB, and GRAPE.

Result: The results show that the new method competes with CRAB and GRAPE in terms of accuracy while demonstrating superior computational efficiency. This highlights the potential for this approach to significantly enhance the synthesis of quantum gates, a key component of quantum technology development.

Conclusion: The paper conclusively demonstrates that the proposed method using Magnus expansion and polynomial optimization offers a more efficient and scalable solution for synthesizing quantum gates. This breakthrough supports the advancement of quantum computing by enabling the design of faster and accurate gates in a more computationally efficient manner, avoiding the approximation issues of existing methods.

Abstract: Quantum optimal control plays a crucial role in the development of quantum
technologies, particularly in the design and implementation of fast and
accurate gates for quantum computing. Here, we present a method to synthesize
gates using the Magnus expansion. In particular, we formulate a polynomial
optimization problem that allows us to find the global solution without
resorting to approximations of the exponential. The global method we use
provides a certificate of globality and lets us do single-shot optimization,
which implies it is generally faster than local methods. By optimizing over
Hermitian matrices generating the unitaries, instead of the unitaries
themselves, we can reduce the size of the polynomial to optimize, leading to
faster convergence and better scalability, compared to the QCPOP method.
Numerical experiments comparing our results with CRAB and GRAPE show that we
maintain high accuracy of QCPOP, while improving computational efficiency.

### [91] [Proof of quantum to classical transition for the center of mass of quantum many body systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01362)
*Marco Bilardello*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper shows that the center of mass of a many-body quantum system behaves classically in the macroscopic limit. The classical limit arises due to three assumptions: large total mass, finite number of particles with non-zero correlations, and finite variance in position.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding when and how quantum systems exhibit classical behavior is crucial for the foundation of physics. This paper addresses this key question in quantum mechanics.

Method: The study uses mathematical analysis considering a many-body system with specific assumptions about mass, particle correlations, and position variance.

Result: The center of mass of the system transitions to classical mechanics with a well-defined position and momentum, described by classical dynamics.

Conclusion: This finding suggests that quantum mechanics naturally leads to classical behavior without external influences or modifications, providing a deeper understanding of the quantum-classical transition.

Abstract: The classical limit of quantum mechanics is investigated, by focusing on the
study of the center of mass of a many-body system where each particle is
described by quantum mechanics. We study how, in the limit when the number of
particles diverges and under quite general assumptions, the center of mass of
the system is not anymore described by quantum mechanics but by classical
mechanics: the center of mass of the system becomes with a well-defined
position and momentum, the state of the center of mass is fully determined by
its position and by its momentum, and its dynamics is given by the classical
law of dynamics. In order to get this result, three assumptions on the
many-body system are necessary: the total mass of the system must be much
larger than the mass of each particle composing the system; at most a finite
number of particles has non-zero correlation in position with an infinite
number of particles; finally, when the number of particles composing the system
diverge, the variance in position of each particle converges to a finite value.
These assumptions are commonly realized for a macroscopic solid and liquid
systems. Finally, we sketch a possible experimental setup aiming at observing
the quantum-to-classical transition of the center of mass of a massive
many-body system. The results obtained in this paper show how the classical
limit of quantum mechanics can be naturally achieved without the need to modify
quantum mechanics, without the need to have an external environment and without
the need of changing the interpretations of quantum mechanics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SqDRIFT, an SQD variant that allows scaling SQD calculations for chemical systems using qDRIFT randomized compilation to reduce the time-evolution circuit depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenge of large time-evolution circuit depths in quantum simulations, particularly for molecules, which limits current quantum computers' utility.

Method: The method combines Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) with qDRIFT randomized circuit compilation. This reduces circuit depth while preserving convergence guarantees.

Result: SqDRIFT enables calculating the ground state energy of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, surpassing the reach of exact diagonalization.

Conclusion: This approach opens new possibilities for quantum simulations on utility-scale quantum computers, especially for complex chemical systems.

Abstract: Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is a recently proposed algorithm
to approximate the ground-state wave function of many-body quantum systems on
near-term and early-fault-tolerant quantum devices. In SQD, the quantum
computer acts as a sampling engine that generates the subspace in which the
Hamiltonian is classically diagonalized. A recently proposed SQD variant,
Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD), uses quantum Krylov states
as circuits from which samples are collected. Convergence guarantees can be
derived for SKQD under similar assumptions to those of quantum phase
estimation, provided that the ground-state wave function is concentrated, i.e.,
has support on a small subset of the full Hilbert space. Implementations of
SKQD on current utility-scale quantum computers are limited by the depth of
time-evolution circuits needed to generate Krylov vectors. For many complex
many-body Hamiltonians of interest, such as the molecular electronic-structure
Hamiltonian, this depth exceeds the capability of state-of-the-art quantum
processors. In this work, we introduce a new SQD variant that combines SKQD
with the qDRIFT randomized compilation of the Hamiltonian propagator. The
resulting algorithm, termed SqDRIFT, enables SQD calculations at the utility
scale on chemical Hamiltonians while preserving the convergence guarantees of
SKQD. We apply SqDRIFT to calculate the electronic ground-state energy of
several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, up to system sizes beyond the reach
of exact diagonalization.

Result: Quantum effects significantly impact scattering processes, particularly coherence and contrast, with implications for nanoparticle analysis.

Conclusion: The study challenges classical scattering models, providing new insights into quantum phenomena in electron scattering.

Abstract: Elastic electron scattering is one of the primary means of investigating
materials on the atomic scale. It is usually described by modeling the sample
as a fixed, static, perturbative potential, thereby completely neglecting the
quantum nature of the atoms inside. In this work, we present a quantum
treatment of elastic electron scattering. We show that the interaction of the
probe beam and the sample results in entanglement between the two systems,
which can have far-reaching consequences, particularly on coherence and image
contrast. As a timely example, we discuss decoherence in Bragg scattering on
nanoparticles. We also investigate under which conditions the conventional
scattering theory is recovered.

Abstract: We investigate the advantage of using squeezed input light for generating
gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) through Fourier-domain analysis. Based on
the findings of [1], which demonstrated the feasibility of detecting GIE in
optomechanical systems under quantum control, we further demonstrate that
squeezed input light can reduce the optical noise in the mechanical conditional
state and enhance GIE. Furthermore, we estimate the systematic and statistical
errors in the measurement of GIE using the Fourier transformation over a finite
measurement time. Based on the error estimations using the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) in GIE detection, we find that a total measurement time of 10^6 s
is required to achieve SNR=1 when using squeezed input light, whereas 10^{6.8}
s is needed without squeezed input light. This result highlights the
effectiveness of optomechanical systems and the critical role of squeezed input
light in enhancing the detectability of GIE.

Abstract: Recent developments in quantum technologies have enabled significant
improvements in the precision of optical sensing systems. This work explores
the integration of distributed quantum sensing (DQS) with optical gyroscopes to
improve the estimation accuracy of angular velocity. Utilizing bright two-mode
squeezed states (bTMSS), which offer high photon numbers and strong bipartite
quantum correlations, we propose a novel configuration that leverages
continuous-variable entanglement across multiple spatially separated optical
gyroscopes. Unlike traditional quantum sensing that enhances a single sensor,
our approach focuses on estimating a global phase shift corresponding to the
average angular rotation across distributed optical gyroscopes with
quantum-enhanced sensitivity. We analyze the phase sensitivities of different
bTMSS configurations, including M mode-entangled bTMSS and separable M-bTMSS,
and evaluate their performance through the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. The
analysis shows that, with 5% photon loss in every channel in the system, the
proposed scheme shows a sensitivity enhancement of ~9.3 dB beyond the
shot-noise limit, with an initial squeezing of ~9.8 dB. The present scheme has
potential applications in quantum-enhanced inertial navigation and precision
metrology within emerging quantum networks.

Motivation: The paper explores innovative use of machine learning, specifically WGAN, in quantum optics, targeting efficient generation and characterization of optical states, which is essential for advancements in quantum information processing and related fields.

Method: The authors employ a deep learning framework with two CNNs integrated with a WGAN to train the model on tomographic patterns of Fock, coherent, and 1-PACS states. The training focuses on minimizing the Wasserstein distance between input and output tomograms, and key quantum properties are derived directly from the generated images to differentiate states.

Result: The study successfully uses the WGAN-based method to generate accurate tomograms of the specified states. Quantum properties like mean photon numbers and variances are effectively extracted, successfully distinguishing Fock states and identifying differences between coherent and 1-PACS states, with results verified through multiple error checks and alternative color mappings.

Conclusion: This work effectively demonstrates the capability of WGAN-assisted deep learning to generate and characterize optical quantum states, offering a promising tool for practical applications in quantum optics and state reconstruction, which could motivate further research and development in this intersection of machine learning and quantum physics.

Abstract: Optical tomograms can be envisaged as patterns. The Wasserstein generative
adversarial network (WGAN) algorithm provides a platform to train the machine
to compare patterns corresponding to input and generated tomograms. Using a
deep-learning framework with two convolutional neural networks and WGAN, we
have trained the machine to generate tomograms of Fock states, coherent states
(CS) and the single photon added CS ($1$-PACS). The training process was
continued until the Wasserstein distance between the input and output
tomographic patterns levelled off at a low value. The mean photon number,
variances and higher moments were extracted directly from the generated
tomograms, to distinguish between different Fock states and also between the CS
and the $1$-PACS, without using an additional classifier neural network. The
robustness of our results has been verified using two error models and also
with different colormaps that define the tomographic patterns. We have examined
if the training program successfully reflected some of the findings in a recent
experiment in which state reconstruction was carried out to establish that the
fidelities between an amplified CS, an optimal CS and a $1$-PACS were close to
unity, over a range of parameter values. By training the machine to reproduce
tomograms corresponding to these specific states, and comparing the mean photon
numbers of these states obtained directly from the tomograms, we have
established that the variations in these observables reflect the experimental
trends. State reconstruction from tomograms could be challenging, in general,
since the Hilbert space associated with quantized light is large. The
tomographic approach provides a viable alternative to detailed state
reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the use of machine learning to generate
optical tomograms from which the states can be directly characterized.

*Felix Huber*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces quasi-Clifford algebras (QCAs) defined by specific commutation relations. It maps QCAs to Pauli algebras, which are important in quantum mechanics and computing.

Applications include symmetry reduction in semidefinite programs and constructing anti-commuting operator sets. The paper bridges algebraic structures with quantum information theory, providing new tools for quantum computing and related optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the mathematical framework underlying quantum information processing, specifically focusing on algebras that model quantum operators. By connecting QCAs to Pauli algebras, the work offers a new perspective for analyzing and simplifying quantum systems, which is crucial for advancing quantum computing and optimization algorithms.

Method: The method used involves defining QCAs with specific quadratic and anticommutation relations, establishing a mapping to Pauli algebras. This transformation enables the decomposition of matrix groups and derives operator transforms, such as the Jordan-Wigner transform. The approach leverages algebraic properties to provide insights into quantum systems.

Result: The key results include the efficient mapping between QCAs and Pauli algebras, a Wedderburn decomposition method, and applications in simplifying semidefinite programs and constructing anti-commuting operators. These results offer improved techniques for quantum information processing and computation.

Conclusion: In summary, the paper presents a novel algebraic approach that bridges QCAs with Pauli algebras, offering practical applications in quantum computing and optimization, such as symmetry reduction and operator construction, thereby advancing both theoretical understanding and practical implementations in the field.

Abstract: Algebras with given (anti-)commutativity structure are widespread in quantum
mechanics. This structure is captured by quasi-Clifford algebras (QCA): a QCA
generated by $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ is is given by the relations
$\alpha_i^2 = k_i$ and $\alpha_j \alpha_i = (-1)^{\chi_{ij}} \alpha_i
\alpha_j$, where $k_i \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\chi_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}$. We present
a mapping from QCA to Pauli algebras and discuss its use in quantum information
and computation. The mapping also provides a Wedderburn decomposition of matrix
groups with quasi-Clifford structure. This provides a block-diagonalization for
e.g. Pauli groups, while for Majorana operators the Jordan-Wigner transform is
recovered. Applications to the symmetry reduction of semidefinite programs and
for constructing maximal anti-commuting subsets are discussed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance quantum sensing technology, which often seeks to surpass quantum limits by utilizing quantum resources like squeezing and entanglement. This paper seems to address that goal by introducing quantum combs and scalable interferometric measurement protocols.

Method: The method involves developing theoretical frameworks for designing quantum combs, considering both squeezed and entangled states with division and heterodyne receivers. They analyze four protocols and evaluate their performance under loss conditions.

Result: The results show that these protocols offer scalability and enhanced robustness to loss, providing new capabilities for spectroscopy beyond traditional methods.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that such scalable, loss-robust quantum comb-based sensing protocols represent a significant advancement in quantum sensing, paving the way for more reliable and versatile sensing applications.

Abstract: Optical frequency combs, named for their comb-like peaks in the spectrum, are
essential for various sensing applications. As the technology develops, its
performance has reached the standard quantum limit dictated by the quantum
fluctuations of coherent light field. Quantum combs, with their quantum
fluctuation engineered via squeezing and entanglement, are the necessary
ingredient for overcoming such limits. We develop the theory for designing and
analyzing quantum combs, focusing on dual-comb interferometric measurement. Our
analyses cover both squeezed and entangled quantum combs with division
receivers and heterodyne receivers, leading to four protocols with quantum
advantages scalable with squeezing/entanglement strength. In the spectroscopy
of a single absorption line, whereas the division receiver with the squeezed
comb suffers from amplified thermal noise, the other three protocols
demonstrate a surprising robustness to loss at a few comb lines. Such a unique
loss-robustness of a scalable quantum advantage has not been found in any
traditional quantum sensing protocols.

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a rapidly growing area that applies
techniques from algebraic topology to extract robust features from large-scale
data. A key task in TDA is the estimation of (normalized) Betti numbers, which
capture essential topological invariants. While recent work has led to quantum
algorithms for this problem, we explore an alternative direction: combining
classical and quantum resources to estimate the Betti numbers of a simplicial
complex more efficiently. Assuming the classical description of a simplicial
complex, that is, its set of vertices and edges, we propose a hybrid
quantum-classical algorithm. The classical component enumerates all simplices,
and this combinatorial structure is subsequently processed by a quantum
algorithm to estimate the Betti numbers. We analyze the performance of our
approach and identify regimes where it potentially achieves polynomial to
exponential speedups over existing quantum methods, at the trade-off of using
more ancilla qubits. We further demonstrate the utility of normalized Betti
numbers in concrete applications, highlighting the broader potential of hybrid
quantum algorithms in topological data analysis.

Abstract: Above-threshold ionization (ATI) is a strong-field-driven process where
electrons absorb more photons than required for ionization. While ATI dynamics
and outputs are well-understood when driven by classical, perfectly coherent
light, the recent development of non-classical light sources for strong-field
phenomena has spurred interest in their effect on the involved electron
dynamics. In this work, we present a microscopic quantum optical theory
describing ATI under the influence of strong squeezed light. We observe that
squeezed light significantly enhances the coupling between light and matter,
making their mutual backaction more important than under classical driving.
This backaction profoundly impacts the electronic ionization times, as well as
the non-classical properties of the joint electron-light state. This results in
pronounced entanglement features, both immediately after ionization, and at
later times. These entanglement features are reflected in the properties of the
quantum optical state of the driving field revealing notable non-Gaussian
features that depend on both, the amount of squeezing, and the number of
ionization events occurring during the interaction.

Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) as both classical and quantum states of light
has proven essential in numerous applications, from high-capacity information
transfer to enhanced precision and accuracy in metrology. Here, we extend OAM
metrology to relativistic scenarios to determine the Lorentz factor of a moving
reference frame, exploiting the fact that OAM is not Lorentz invariant. Using
OAM correlations of entangled states, we show that their joint OAM spectrum is
modified by length contraction, where the rescaling of spatial dimensions
alters the orthogonality of the OAM modes themselves. In an emulated
experiment, we confirm the predicted broadening of the OAM spectrum and use
this to quantitatively infer the Lorentz (contraction) factor, reaching
experimentally simulated velocities of up to 0.99c. Our work provides a pathway
for novel measurement techniques suitable for relativistic conditions that
leverages OAM structured light as a resource.

Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of dynamical quantum phase transitions
(QPTs) in a periodically driven $\Lambda$-type three-level system (3LS)
embedded in a double-mode cavity, described by a three-level Jaynes-Cumming
(3L-JC) Hamiltonian. To begin with, we probe the undriven static Hamiltonian in
the dressed-state basis to identify and define distinct coupling regimes and
critical points associated with both cavity modes. Furthermore, to investigate
the dynamical QPTs in this system, we incorporate a periodic modulation across
two atomic states (denoted by $|3\rangle_{at}$ and $|2\rangle_{at}$) out of the
three available energy levels. By performing necessary transformations and
approximations, we reduce the overall Hamiltonian, which contains static and
dynamic modulation terms, into an effective 3L-JC Hamiltonian whose system
parameters are dependent on the driving parameters. The validity of our
approximations is verified using the Loschmidt echo of time-evolved states
corresponding to Hamiltonians before and after the approximations. Finally, we
demonstrate that by tuning the modulation parameters, it is possible to explore
bimodal superradiant phases in a three-level $\Lambda$-type system while
remaining within the critical coupling limits of the static Hamiltonian. Our
results provide an insight into the manipulation of quantum phases in a
three-level system within an effective extended Jaynes-Cummings regime.

### [105] [Hamiltonian simulation for nonlinear partial differential equation by Schrödingerization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01640)
*Shoya Sasaki,Katsuhiro Endo,Mayu Muramatsu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a Hamiltonian simulation method for solving nonlinear partial differential equations by combining Carleman linearization and Schrödingerization. The approach transforms nonlinear equations into linear ones, enabling efficient simulation. A specific application to the nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation demonstrates the method's effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of applying Hamiltonian simulation, which has shown promise in quantum computing for coupled harmonic oscillators, to broader nonlinear systems. With the increasing role of nonlinear PDEs in various scientific fields, developing methods to leverage quantum computing's potential for these problems is highly relevant.

Method: Carleman linearization is first applied to nonlinear PDEs to linearize them, then these linearized equations are mapped to the Schrödinger equation via a warped phase transformation. The resulting Schrödinger equation can then be efficiently simulated using Hamiltonian simulation techniques. This combined approach, termed Carleman linearization plus Schrödingerization (CLS), allows for solving original nonlinear equations by simulating the transformed Schrödinger equation.

Result: The study successfully demonstrates the applicability of Hamiltonian simulation to nonlinear PDEs. By applying the CLS method to the nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation, they show that accurate and efficient simulations are achievable, highlighting the potential of quantum algorithms in solving complex nonlinear problems.

Conclusion: Hamiltonian simulation represents a promising avenue for advancing quantum algorithms to handle nonlinear problems. The proposed CLS method opens new possibilities for leveraging quantum computing in solving a wide range of nonlinear PDEs, thus expanding the scope of problems that can benefit from quantum speedup in the future.

Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a fundamental algorithm in quantum computing that
has attracted considerable interest owing to its potential to efficiently solve
the governing equations of large-scale classical systems. Exponential speedup
through Hamiltonian simulation has been rigorously demonstrated in the case of
coupled harmonic oscillators. The question arises as to whether Hamiltonian
simulations in other physical systems also accelerate exponentially.
Schr\"odingerization is a technique that transforms the governing equations of
classical systems into the Schr\"odinger equation. However, since the
Schr\"odinger equation is a linear equation, Hamiltonian simulation is often
limited to linear equations. The research on Hamiltonian simulation methods for
nonlinear governing equations remains relatively limited. In this study, we
propose a Hamiltonian simulation method for nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDEs). The proposed method is named Carleman linearization +
Schr\"odingerization (CLS), which combines Carleman linearization (CL) and
warped phase transformation (WPT). CL is first applied to transform a nonlinear
PDE into a linear differential equation. This linearized equation is then
mapped to the Schr\"odinger equation via WPT. The original nonlinear PDE can be
solved efficiently by the Hamiltonian simulation of the resulting Schr\"odinger
equation. By applying this method, we transform the original governing equation
into the Schr\"odinger equation. Solving the transformed Schr\"odinger equation
then enables the analysis of the original nonlinear equation. As a specific
application, we apply this method to the nonlinear reaction--diffusion equation
to demonstrate that Hamiltonian simulations are applicable to nonlinear PDEs.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of quantum computing into offline
reinforcement learning and the deployment of the resulting quantum policy in a
real-time control hardware realization of the cart-pole system. Variational
Quantum Circuits (VQCs) are used to represent the policy. Classical model-based
offline policy search was applied, in which a pure VQC with trainable
input-output weights is used as a policy network instead of a classical
multilayer perceptron. The goal is to evaluate the potential of deploying
quantum architectures in real-world industrial control problems. The
experimental results show that the investigated model-based offline policy
search is able to generate quantum policies that can balance the hardware
cart-pole. A latency analysis reveals that while local simulated execution
meets real-time requirements, cloud-based quantum processing remains too slow
for closed-loop control.

Abstract: This paper aims at devising the shape of the external electromagnetic field
which drives the spin dynamics of radical pairs to quantum coherent state
through maximization of the triplet-singlet yield in biochemical reactions. The
model is a Schr\"{o}dinger system with spin Hamiltonians given by the sum of
Zeeman interaction and hyperfine coupling interaction terms. We introduce a
one-parameter family of optimal control problems by coupling the
Schr\"{o}dinger system to a control field through filtering equations for the
electromagnetic field. Fr\'echet differentiability and the Pontryagin Maximum
Principle in Hilbert space is proved, and the bang-bang structure of the
optimal control is established. A new iterative Pontryagin Maximum Principle
(IPMP) method for the identification of the bang-bang optimal control is
developed. Numerical simulations based on IPMP and the gradient projection
method (GPM) in Hilbert spaces are pursued, and the convergence, stability and
the regularization effect are demonstrated. Comparative analysis of filtering
with regular optimal electromagnetic field versus non-filtering with bang-bang
optimal field ({\it Abdulla et al, Quantum Sci. Technol., {\bf9}, 4, 2024})
demonstrates the change of the maxima of the singlet yield is less than 1\%.
The results open a venue for a potential experimental work for the
magnetoreception as a manifestation of quantum biological phenomena.

Abstract: We propose an architecture for a quantum memory distributed over a $2 \times
L$ array of modules equipped with a cyclic shift implemented via flying qubits.
The logical information is distributed across the first row of $L$ modules and
quantum error correction is executed using ancilla modules on the second row
equipped with a cyclic shift. This work proves that quantum LDPC codes such as
BB codes can maintain their performance in a distributed setting while using
solely one simple connector: a cyclic shift. We propose two strategies to
perform quantum error correction on a $2 \times L$ module array: (i) The cyclic
layout which applies to any stabilizer codes, whereas previous results for
qubit arrays are limited to CSS codes. (ii) The sparse cyclic layout, specific
to bivariate bicycle (BB) codes. For the $[[144,12,12]]$ BB code, using the
sparse cyclic layout we obtain a quantum memory with $12$ logical qubits
distributed over $12$ modules, containing $12$ physical qubits each. We propose
physical implementations of this architecture using flying qubits, that can be
faithfully transported, and include qubits encoded in ions, neutral atoms,
electrons or photons. We performed numerical simulations when modules are long
ion chains and when modules are single-qubit arrays of ions showing that the
distributed BB code achieves a logical error rate below $2 \cdot 10^{-6}$ when
the physical error rate is $10^{-3}$.

*Muhammad Faizan,Muhammad Faryad*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines how the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm holds up against depolarizing noise, using density matrices to find the success probability based on noise level and qubit count. It shows that as systems get larger, performance drops significantly if noise isn't reduced. The study suggests balancing system size with qubit quality for quantum advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to address a significant challenge in quantum computing: noise affecting algorithm performance, particularly in fundamental quantum algorithms like Bernstein-Vazirani. Understanding algorithm resilience is crucial for practical applications.

Method: The authors used the density matrix formalism to model depolarizing noise, deriving exact expressions for success probability as a function of error rate and qubits. They then analyzed how these factors impact performance scalability.

Result: The key finding is that with larger system sizes, success probability plummets unless qubit quality improves. This implies that merely increasing qubits without noise reduction hurts quantum advantage.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need to balance system size and qubit quality to maintain quantum advantage, providing a foundation for optimizing future quantum algorithms under realistic noise conditions.

Abstract: We analytically investigated the robustness of the Bernstein--Vazirani
algorithm in the presence of depolarizing noise using the density matrix
formalism. We derive exact expressions for the algorithm's success probability
as a function of the depolarizing error rate $\boldsymbol{p}$ and number of
qubits $\boldsymbol{n}$. The analysis reveals how performance degrades with
increasing system size under realistic noise conditions. Furthermore, it was
seen that scaling up quantum systems without simultaneously improving qubit
quality leads to a sharp decline in the quantum advantage for this algorithm.

### [110] [BVQC: A Backdoor-style Watermarking Scheme for Variational Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01893)
*Cheng Chu,Lei Jiang,Fan Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces BVQC, a backdoor-based watermarking technique for Variational Quantum Circuits that addresses challenges like task loss and watermark removal during re-compilation. It minimizes interference with the base task and retains the original circuit compilation workflow. The technique shows significant improvements in PPA changes and ground truth distance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are addressing a key issue in quantum computing where Variational Quantum Circuits, though powerful, have limitations in terms of their useability and security. The paper aims to enhance the security aspect by introducing a robust watermarking method that counters vulnerabilities related to re-compilation and task loss.

Method: The method proposed, BVQC, employs a grouping algorithm to minimize the impact of watermarks on the base task while ensuring the robustness of the original compilation workflow. This approach balances the need for security enhancements without compromising the efficiency of quantum computations.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that BVQC effectively reduces the Probabilistic Proof of Authorship (PPA) changes by 9.89e-3 and the ground truth distance (GTD) by 0.089, indicating a modest yet significant improvement over existing watermarking technologies.

Conclusion: The BVQC technique successfully provides a secure mechanism for Variational Quantum Circuits, enhancing their usability and security by preserving the integrity of quantum computations during re-compilation and mitigating task loss issues.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a powerful quantum
computing paradigm, demonstrating a scaling advantage for problems intractable
for classical computation. As VQCs require substantial resources and
specialized expertise for their design, they represent significant intellectual
properties (IPs). However, existing quantum circuit watermarking techniques
suffer from two primary drawbacks: (1) watermarks can be removed during
re-compilation of the circuits, and (2) these methods significantly increase
task loss due to the extensive length of the inserted watermarks across
multiple compilation stages. To address these challenges, we propose BVQC, a
backdoor-based watermarking technique for VQCs that preserves the original loss
in typical execution settings, while deliberately increasing the loss to a
predefined level during watermark extraction. Additionally, BVQC employs a
grouping algorithm to minimize the watermark task's interference with the base
task, ensuring optimal accuracy for the base task. BVQC retains the original
compilation workflow, ensuring robustness against re-compilation. Our
evaluations show that BVQC greatly reduces Probabilistic Proof of Authorship
(PPA) changes by 9.89e-3 and ground truth distance (GTD) by 0.089 compared to
prior watermarking technologies.

Conclusion: 提出了一种降级拉曼边带冷却方法，大大减少了冷却循环次数，特别是在高F态时效率显著提升。未来可用于更高效量子气体冷却。

Abstract: We explore degenerate Raman sideband cooling in which neighboring Zeeman
states of a fixed hyperfine level are coupled via a two-photon Raman
transition. The degenerate coupling between $|F,m_F\rangle\rightarrow
|F,m_F-1\rangle$ facilitates the removal of multiple motional quanta in a
single cycle. This method greatly reduces the number of cooling cycles required
to reach the ground state compared to traditional sideband cooling. We show
that near ground state cooling can be achieved with a pulse number as low as
$\bar{n}$ where $\bar{n}$ is the average phonon number in the initial thermal
state. We demonstrate proof-of-concept in $^{176}\mathrm{Lu}^+$ by coupling
neighboring Zeeman levels on the motional sideband for the $F=7$ hyperfine
level in $^3D_1$. Starting from a thermal distribution with an average phonon
number of 6, we demonstrate near ground-state cooling with $\sim10$ pulses. A
theoretical description is given that applies to any $F$ level and demonstrates
how effective this approach can be.

Abstract: Uncertainty relations are pivotal in delineating the limits of simultaneous

inequality. These relations are shown to provide tighter bounds than several
well-known existing relations. Furthermore, we extend these results to
multi-observable scenarios by employing an inequality from M. Kato et al.,
deriving generalized uncertainty relations that similarly exhibit enhanced
precision. The incorporation of the phase angle of the measurement state
contributes to strengthening the derived inequalities. Comparative analyses
with prior studies confirm the effectiveness of our inequalities in
two-observable systems via three illustrative examples.

Motivation: Semi-supervised learning is crucial for scenarios where labeled data is scarce. Enhancing this with quantum computing offers a promising solution to improve performance, especially in low-label settings.

Method: The study introduces ILQSSL and IPQSSL models using improved label propagation in variational quantum circuits. It employs QR decomposition to embed graph structures and evaluates circuit performance through metrics like entanglement entropy and Randomized Benchmarking.

Result: Both quantum models outperform classical counterparts under limited supervision. However, increased circuit complexity may introduce noise, affecting performance.

Conclusion: Quantum-enhanced semi-supervised learning shows potential, balancing circuit complexity and performance for practical applications in data-efficient classification.

Abstract: This paper develops a hybrid quantum approach for graph-based semi-supervised
learning to enhance performance in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. We
introduce two enhanced quantum models, the Improved Laplacian Quantum
Semi-Supervised Learning (ILQSSL) and the Improved Poisson Quantum
Semi-Supervised Learning (IPQSSL), that incorporate advanced label propagation
strategies within variational quantum circuits. These models utilize QR
decomposition to embed graph structure directly into quantum states, thereby
enabling more effective learning in low-label settings. We validate our methods
across four benchmark datasets like Iris, Wine, Heart Disease, and German
Credit Card -- and show that both ILQSSL and IPQSSL consistently outperform
leading classical semi-supervised learning algorithms, particularly under
limited supervision. Beyond standard performance metrics, we examine the effect
of circuit depth and qubit count on learning quality by analyzing entanglement
entropy and Randomized Benchmarking (RB). Our results suggest that while some
level of entanglement improves the model's ability to generalize, increased
circuit complexity may introduce noise that undermines performance on current
quantum hardware. Overall, the study highlights the potential of
quantum-enhanced models for semi-supervised learning, offering practical
insights into how quantum circuits can be designed to balance expressivity and
stability. These findings support the role of quantum machine learning in
advancing data-efficient classification, especially in applications constrained

Abstract: Distributed quantum sensing, which estimates a global parameter across
distant nodes, has attracted significant interest for applications such as
quantum imaging, sensor networks, and global-scale clock synchronization.
$N00N$ states are regarded as one of the optimal quantum resources for quantum
metrology, enabling the Heisenberg scaling. Recently, the concept of $N00N$
states has been extended to multi-mode $N00N$ states for quantum-enhanced
multiple-parameter estimation. However, the application of multi-mode $N00N$
states in distributed quantum sensing remains unexplored. Here, we propose a
distributed quantum sensing scheme that achieves the Heisenberg scaling using
multi-mode $N00N$ states. We theoretically show that multi-mode $N00N$ states
can reach the Heisenberg scaling by examining both the Cram\'er-Rao bound and
the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. For experimental demonstration, we employ a
four-mode $2002$ state to estimate the average of two spatially distributed
phases, achieving a 2.74 dB sensitivity enhancement over the standard quantum
limit. We believe that utilizing multi-mode $N00N$ states for distributed
quantum sensing offers a promising approach for developing
entanglement-enhanced sensor networks.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 随着量子计算的增长，提出的量子算法数量也在增加。然而，这些算法的实际应用各不相同：有些可以直接使用，而有些则需要黑箱oracle，不一定容易实现。Aaronson首先讨论了HHL量子算法在解决线性方程组时的细节问题。本文扩展了这一研究，为First analog quantum algorithm用于计算马尔可夫链平稳分布提供了类似的细节分析。我们得出结论，应该更多地关注量子算法的实际可应用性，无论是单独的研究，还是在介绍算法时给予更多关注。

Motivation: 研究者注意到目前量子算法中存在诸多算法不能直接应用，需要黑箱oracle，这可能限制了算法的实际应用范围。Aaronson已经对此做了初步探讨，本文进一步分析了First analog quantum algorithm的实用性。

Method: 通过对算法细节和实际应用的分析，探讨其是否具备直接应用性，是否需要复杂或难实现的额外组件。

Result: 发现First analog quantum algorithm在平稳分布计算上的实际应用性较差，需要额外的black box oracle，这表明需要更多的研究或关注以提高算法的实用性。

Conclusion: 量子算法的实际应用性研究应受到更多重视，以便更好地推动量子计算的技术发展。

Abstract: With a growing interest in quantum computing, the number of proposed quantum
algorithms grows as well. The practical applicability of these algorithms
differs: Some can be applied out-of-the-box, while others require black box
oracles, which can not always be easily implemented. One of the first works to
explicitly discuss these practical applicability aspects is by Aaronson
discussing the \textit{fine print} of the HHL quantum algorithm that solves
linear systems of equations. We extend this line of research by providing a
similar fine print for the first analog quantum algorithm that computes the
stationary distribution of Markov chains. We conclude that more focus should be
put on this practical applicability of quantum algorithms, either through a
separate line of research, or through more attention when introducing the
algorithm.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of improving quantum communication detection solutions by leveraging low intensity and photon-number-resolving (PNR) capabilities, particularly at C-band wavelengths.

Method: The researchers developed a receiver using low-cost PNR detectors combined with nonlinear optical interactions. They tested this receiver on a femtosecond source generated from white light continuum followed by single-stage amplification at 1.5 µm.

Result: The results demonstrate the receiver's capability to accurately characterize the Poissonian nature of the femtosecond source, suggesting its potential use in more complex communication schemes.

Conclusion: This work highlights a practical and cost-effective solution for quantum communication detection, paving the way for future integration into advanced communication systems.

Abstract: The use of C-band wavelengths in the field of quantum communication has grown
significantly, driving the need for versatile detection solutions, especially
in the low intensity domain. Among the desirable features for such detectors,
photon-number-resolving (PNR) capability is particularly valuable, since it can
offer new possibilities for enhancing security of communication protocols. In
this paper, we present the implementation of a receiver that combines low-cost
PNR detectors with nonlinear optical interactions to achieve sensitivity at
telecom wavelengths. Specifically, we use this receiver to characterize the
Poissonian nature of a femtosecond source at 1.5 $\mu$m, produced via white
light continuum generation followed by a single-stage amplification process.
The obtained results encourage the exploitation of such a detector in more
complex schemes.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes two DI-QKD protocols using heralding, achieving longer communication distances than existing protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitation of DI-QKD in communication distance by proposing new protocols using heralding and standard quantum optics tools.

Method: The methods involve using two-mode squeezed states, displacement operations, on-off detectors, and classical postprocessing. The protocols are analyzed for key rates.

Result: The proposed protocols outperform existing ones in communication distances based on numerical optimization of key rates.

Conclusion: The research provides feasible experimental implementations for long-distance QKD using current technology, enhancing robustness through postprocessing.

Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) enables
information-theoretically secure key distribution between remote parties
without any assumptions on the internal workings of the devices used for its
implementation. However, its communication distance is strictly limited since
the loophole-free Bell violation is required to guarantee its security.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose two long-distance DI-QKD protocols which
use a heralding scheme based on single-photon interference. Our protocols
consist of only standard quantum optics tools such as two-mode squeezed states,
displacement operations and on-off detectors, making the experimental
implementation feasible with current technology. We employ a classical
postprocessing method to enhance our protocols' robustness against experimental
imperfections. We calculate key rates of the protocols by numerical
optimization and show the supremacy of this implementation over existing
protocols in terms of communication distances.

Motivation: The paper advances our understanding of unitary invariants and their applications, bringing together theoretical concepts and practical quantum computing tools.

Method: The authors use Bargmann invariants and multivariate traces, employing quantum switches and Hadamard tests for measurement and simulation.

Result: They successfully demonstrate the measurement and simulation of higher-order quantum processes using these tools.

Conclusion: The findings establish a connection between unitary invariants and practical quantum computations, opening new avenues in quantum resource theory and quantum mechanics applications.

Abstract: Bargmann invariants, multivariate traces of states, completely characterize
any unitary-invariant property of a set of states. Unitary invariants enable
the description of quantum resources such as basis-independent coherence and
imaginarity, nonstabilizerness, and contextuality. We show that the quantum
switch, a higher-order process featuring indefinite causal order, can be used
to measure Bargmann invariants of arbitrary order. We also show how simple
Hadamard test circuits can deterministically simulate an arbitrary unitary
quantum switch. Our results establish a solid bridge between the theory and
applications of unitary invariants and higher-order maps in quantum mechanics.

Abstract: Heat transfer is a fundamental concept in physics, and how to characterize
the microscopical physical mechanism of heat transfer is a significant topic.
Recently, a new mechanism for heat transfer, phonon heat transfer across a
vacuum through quantum fluctuations, has been experimentally demonstrated in a
two-vibrating-membrane system. However, a microscopic quantum electrodynamics
theory behind this phenomenon remains unexplored. Here, we establish the
nonrelativistic microscopic theory of phonon heat transfer across a vacuum
confined by two movable end mirrors of a one-dimensional optomechanical cavity.
Under the multimode-cavity-field framework, we obtain a second-order effective
Hamiltonian governing the heat transfer effect. This Hamiltonian describes a
phonon-exchange interaction between the two mirrors with a strength
proportional to a multimode factor and $l_{0}^{-3}$, where $l_{0}$ is the rest
cavity length. We also confirm the dependence of the mode temperatures and heat
flux on the rest cavity length, corresponding to the thermal steady state of
the mirrors. This work initiates the microscopic investigation of
thermodynamics based on the optomechanical cavity platform, and will have
profound implications for both thermal management in nanoscale devices and
cavity optomechanics.

Abstract: Quantum heuristics have shown promise in solving various optimization
problems, including lattice protein folding. Equally relevant is the inverse
problem, protein design, where one seeks sequences that fold to a given target
structure. The latter problem is often split into two steps: (i) searching for
sequences that minimize the energy in the target structure, and (ii) testing
whether the generated sequences fold to the desired structure. Here, we
investigate the utility of variational quantum algorithms for the first of
these two steps on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We focus
on the sequence optimization task, which is less resource-demanding than
folding computations. We test the quantum approximate optimization algorithm
and variants of it, with problem-informed quantum circuits, as well as the
hardware-efficient ansatz, with problem-agnostic quantum circuits. While the
former algorithms yield acceptable results in noiseless simulations, their
performance drops under noise. With the problem-agnostic circuits, which are
more compatible with hardware constraints, an improved performance is observed
in both noisy and noiseless simulations. However, the results deteriorate when
running on a real quantum device. We attribute this discrepancy to features not
captured by the simulated noise model, such as the temporal aspect of the
hardware noise.

Abstract: For two non-communicating parties, quantum theory can give rise to
probability distributions of outcomes that cannot be reproduced by any local
classical model without communication. However, in the case of two-dimensional
systems ($d=2$), it is known that allowing a finite amount of classical
communication to shared classical resources makes it possible to simulate these
quantum correlations. Whether such a simulation remains possible in higher
dimensions is still an open question. In this work, we identify the key
features of the exact classical protocol in $d=2$, and use them to construct
robust approximate protocols in higher dimensions. We assess their performance
through a randomized numerical study based on the Total Variation Distance. Our
approach exactly reproduces the quantum probability distributions for $d=2$,
and performs very well compared to existing protocols for higher dimensions,
being the most robust protocol in all cases studied. These results offer new
insights into the analytical structure of classical protocols in higher
dimensions.

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence hinges on the integrity of its
training data, a foundation often compromised by noise and corruption. Here,
through a comparative study of classical and quantum neural networks on both
classical and quantum data, we reveal a fundamental difference in their
response to data corruption. We find that classical models exhibit brittle
memorization, leading to a failure in generalization. In contrast, quantum
models demonstrate remarkable resilience, which is underscored by a phase
transition-like response to increasing label noise, revealing a critical point
beyond which the model's performance changes qualitatively. We further
establish and investigate the field of quantum machine unlearning, the process
of efficiently forcing a trained model to forget corrupting influences. We show
that the brittle nature of the classical model forms rigid, stubborn memories
of erroneous data, making efficient unlearning challenging, while the quantum
model is significantly more amenable to efficient forgetting with approximate
unlearning methods. Our findings establish that quantum machine learning can
possess a dual advantage of intrinsic resilience and efficient adaptability,
providing a promising paradigm for the trustworthy and robust artificial
intelligence of the future.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) leverage quantum entanglement and
superposition to enable large-scale parallel linear computation, offering a
potential solution to the scalability limits of classical deep learning.
However, their practical deployment is hampered by two key challenges: the lack
of intrinsic nonlinear operations and the barren plateau phenomenon. We propose
a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) architecture that simultaneously
addresses both issues. Nonlinear effects are introduced via orthonormal basis
expansions of power series, while barren plateaus are mitigated by directly
parameterizing unitary matrices rather than stacking multiple parameterized
gates. Our design further incorporates quantum analogs of convolutional kernels
and strides for scalable circuit construction. Experiments on MNIST and
Fashion-MNIST datasets achieve 99.0% and 88.0% test accuracy, respectively.
Consistency between PyTorch-based matrix simulation and Qiskit-based quantum
circuit simulation validates the physical fidelity of the model. These results
demonstrate a flexible and effective quantum architecture that faithfully
integrates classical convolutional mechanisms into a quantum framework, paving
the way for practical and expressive QNNs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses understanding the relationship between time-symmetric physical laws and apparent causality directionality, which is a central question in quantum foundations. It explores two prominent frameworks, MTS and P-CTC, and aims to establish their equivalence.

Method: The method involves extending the P-CTC framework to include time-labels and define a more general class of P-CTC-assisted combs. They then prove equivalence between MTS and this new P-CTC class by constructing explicit mappings.

Result: The paper demonstrates that every MTS can be operationally equivalent to a time-labelled P-CTC-assisted comb, and vice versa, providing a framework that bridges these quantum causality concepts.

Conclusion: The study concludes that an operational equivalence exists between the MTS and P-CTC-assisted comb frameworks, suggesting a connection between time symmetry and cyclic causality underpinned by quantum information theory knowledge.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between the time-symmetric nature of physical
laws and the apparent directionality of causality is a central question in
quantum foundations. The standard operational formulation, widely used in
quantum information, imposes a definite, acyclic causal order on agents'
operations, contrasting with time-symmetric dynamics. Two prominent extensions
of this framework are the multi-time state (MTS) formalism, which incorporates
time symmetry via arbitrary pre- and post-selection, and the post-selected
closed timelike curve (P-CTC) framework, which enables cyclic causal influences
through post-selection on maximally entangled states. While prior work has
noted structural connections between MTS and P-CTCs, it remained unclear
whether an operational equivalence exists, or whether constructive mappings can
be established between their most general objects. In this work, we address
this gap by extending the P-CTC framework to define time-labelled P-CTC
assisted combs, a more general class of P-CTC-assisted objects that support
open processing slots and explicit temporal structure. We prove that for every
(possibly mixed) MTS, there exists an operationally equivalent time-labelled
P-CTC-assisted comb, and vice versa. The equivalence is shown via explicit
mappings, while discussing the number and dimensionality of the P-CTCs
involved. We also explore a resource-theoretic view of MTS, defining a partial
order under free transformations that do not use P-CTCs. We conclude by
discussing future directions informed by the operational equivalence between
time symmetry and cyclic causality established here.

Abstract: We theoretically consider the quantum simulation of a spin Hamiltonian whose
twelve sites are arranged in a planar configuration with high spatial symmetry,
$D_{6h}$. We map the system onto an effective fermionic Hamiltonian and
identify its symmetry group. Comparing different initial states evolving under
the Heisenberg or XXZ Hamiltonians, we analyze the impact of symmetry on the
probability distribution for the outcomes of a measurement in a given basis, as
a function of the evolution time. The considered measurement basis resolves
only a part of the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We show that, for suitable
choices of the initial state, unresolved symmetries make some configurations
equiprobable. We identify four different regimes for the time evolution of the
probabilities: these may be constant, vary sinusoidally in time, evolve
aperiodically, or collapse. We propose an experimentally accessible scheme
which exploits quantum parallelism to probe these regimes efficiently.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A stepped-impedance low-pass filter with integrated hollow waveguide
absorbers is presented. The filter combines low insertion loss in the passband
with strong attenuation at high frequencies, making it well suited for
superconducting quantum computing applications, where qubits are sensitive to
both near-band and far out-of-band radiation. The structure is implemented in a
rectangular coaxial geometry, with inductive sections coupled to circular
hollow waveguides oriented orthogonally to the transmission axis. Above their
cutoff frequency, these waveguides efficiently couple to radiation inside the
stepped-impedance filter, absorbing energy that would otherwise cause Cooper
pair breaking in conventional superconductors. Optimal dimensions were obtained
using a differential evolution algorithm applied to interpolated
electromagnetic simulation data. A prototype was fabricated and characterized
using a calibrated vector network analyzer up to 67 GHz. Measurements confirm a
3 dB cutoff frequency at 13.5 GHz, insertion loss below 0.45 dB for frequencies
under 8 GHz, and more than 52.7 dB rejection above 17.3 GHz. The design offers
a compact, low-loss solution for near-band filtering and suppression of
quasiparticle-generating radiation in cryogenic quantum systems.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Forrelation problem is a central problem that demonstrates an exponential
separation between quantum and classical capabilities. In this problem, given
query access to $n$-bit Boolean functions $f$ and $g$, the goal is to estimate
the Forrelation function $\mathrm{forr}(f,g)$, which measures the correlation
between $g$ and the Fourier transform of $f$.
  In this work we provide a new linear algebraic perspective on the Forrelation
problem, as opposed to prior analytic approaches. We establish a connection
between the Forrelation problem and bent Boolean functions and through this
connection, analyze an extremal version of the Forrelation problem where the
goal is to distinguish between extremal instances of Forrelation, namely
$(f,g)$ with $\mathrm{forr}(f,g)=1$ and $\mathrm{forr}(f,g)=-1$.
  We show that this problem can be solved with one quantum query and success
probability one, yet requires $\tilde{\Omega}\left(2^{n/4}\right)$ classical
randomized queries, even for algorithms with a one-third failure probability,
highlighting the remarkable power of one exact quantum query. We also study a
restricted variant of this problem where the inputs $f,g$ are computable by
small classical circuits and show classical hardness under cryptographic
assumptions.

### [128] [Diverging conditional correlation lengths in the approach to high temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02567)
*Jerome Lloyd,Dmitry A. Abanin,Sarang Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Markov length as a diagnostic for quantum mixed-state phase transitions [Sang & Hsieh, 2025], showing that it diverges under classical stochastic dynamics during quenching, unlike standard observables. They develop a numerical method using matrix-product states to compute the Markov length and observe its exponential growth. This suggests a singular behavior in the late-time thermalization process, where the system's non-Gibbsian nature increases with time, necessitating a divergent parent Hamiltonian. The findings have implications for understanding quantum phase transitions and thermalization in classical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper combines concepts from quantum phase transitions, information theory, and classical dynamics to explore a novel diagnostic tool, the Markov length, which shows unique behavior under thermal quenching. It challenges conventional wisdom by demonstrating that even classical systems can exhibit divergent behavior, providing insights into the thermodynamic limits and phase transition mechanisms. The development of a numerical method to compute the Markov length is particularly useful for studying such phenomena in more complex systems.

Method: The authors work with quantum mixed states, employing information-theoretic measures to define a diagnostic tool called the Markov length. They use classical stochastic dynamics models and introduce a numerical technique based on matrix-product states to calculate the Markov length dynamics during thermal quenches. This involves simulating the system under thermal quench conditions and analyzing how the Markov length evolves over time using these matrix-product state methods. They then present their findings, showing that the Markov length diverges exponentially, unlike standard observables. A simple information-theoretic argument is provided to explain the results.

Result: The Markov length for the one-dimensional Ising model under thermal quench exhibits exponential growth over time, diverging from standard observables. This suggests that the state becomes increasingly non-Gibbsian as it heats, with the range of its putative parent Hamiltonian necessitating divergence. The paper provides an information-theoretic perspective on the singular behavior of thermalization in the late-time limit.

Conclusion: The key takeaway is that the Markov length provides a unique diagnostic tool for quantum mixed-state phase transitions. The Markov length diverges under classical stochastic dynamics, unlike conventional observables, indicating that the system's non-Gibbsian nature increases with time. The late-time limit of thermalization exhibits singular behavior, and the required parent Hamiltonian diverges with the system size, suggesting deeper insights into the thermodynamic properties of such systems under quenching dynamics.

Abstract: The Markov length was recently proposed as an information-theoretic
diagnostic for quantum mixed-state phase transitions [Sang & Hsieh, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 134, 070403 (2025)]. Here, we show that the Markov length diverges even
under classical stochastic dynamics, when a low-temperature ordered state is
quenched into the high temperature phase. Conventional observables do not
exhibit growing length scales upon quenching into the high-temperature phase;
however, the Markov length grows exponentially in time. Consequently, the state
of a system as it heats becomes increasingly non-Gibbsian, and the range of its
putative "parent Hamiltonian" must diverge with the Markov length. From this
information-theoretic point of view the late-time limit of thermalization is
singular. We introduce a numerical technique for computing the Markov length
based on matrix-product states, and explore its dynamics under general thermal
quenches in the one-dimensional classical Ising model. For all cases, we
provide simple information-theoretic arguments that explain our results.

Abstract: Quantum computing approaches excel at solving quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) problems, however solving quadratic constrained binary
optimization problems (QCBOs) is more challenging. In this work, we develop a
variational approach that creates an equal superposition of quantum states that
satisfy constraints in a QCBO. The method relies on flag qubits, one per
constraint, to identify when a constraint is violated or not. The resulting
equal superposition can be used as an initial state for quantum algorithms that
solve QUBOs/QCBOs such as Grover's search algorithm or the quantum approximate
optimization algorithm (QAOA). We test the approach on sets of one and two
linear inequality constraints and find that it is able to generate an equal
superposition of feasible states with a .98 AR on average. We then use the
approach to generate initial states for Grover-mixer QAOA (GM-QAOA) and find
that GM-QAOA with the constraint gadgets yields significantly higher
probability of measuring the optimal solution than random guessing.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore the potential of molecular processes in quantum information science, particularly in creating entangled states and their applications in teleportation and thermodynamic enhancements.

Method: The method involves theoretical analysis, focusing on homonuclear dimer dissociation and fluorescence to demonstrate entanglement and teleportation mechanisms, as well as analyzing quantum thermodynamic features.

Result: The result shows that molecular entanglement can enable teleportation and exhibit enhanced thermodynamic effects, opening new avenues in quantum information and thermodynamics.

Conclusion: The study concludes that controlling molecular dissociation and fluorescence can harness quantum effects for information processing and thermodynamic applications, promising future advancements in quantum technologies.

Abstract: In this contribution to Abraham Nitzan's Festschrift, we present a
perspective of theoretical research over the years that has pointed to the
potential of molecular processes to act as quantum information resources. Under
appropriate control, homonuclear dimer (diatom) dissociation (half-collision)
and the inverse process of atom-pair collisions are shown to reveal
translational (EPR-like) entanglement that enables molecular wavepacket
teleportation. When such processes involve electronic-state excitation of the
diatom, the fluorescence following dissociation can serve as an entanglement
witness that unravels the molecular-state characteristics and evolution. Such
entangling processes can also exhibit anomalous quantum thermodynamic features,
particularly temperature enhancement of a cavity field that interacts with
dissociated entangled diatoms.

Abstract: We analyze work extraction protocols using the long-lived quantum coherence
of a three-level quantum system, which is coupled to a thermal bath through
dipole-monopole interactions. We identify situations where persistent quantum
coherence arises, i.e., for systems with degenerate excited states with aligned
transition dipoles or nearly degenerate systems with small energy splittings.
By designing two innovative thermodynamic protocols involving energy-preserving
unitary operations, we show that quantum coherence can be transformed into
population asymmetry, serving as a quantum resource for work extraction. As the
system approaches final thermal equilibrium, the initial quantum coherence
effectively acts as fuel, being progressively consumed. Specifically, we
propose an optimized protocol capable of extracting the maximal extractable
work (MEW), measured by the free energy difference (FED), from quantum
coherence in a single-shot thermodynamic cycle. Our results highlight the
thermodynamic advantages of long-lived coherence in a three-level quantum
system and could influence future designs of coherence-driven quantum thermal

Abstract: Large-scale quantum systems require optical coherence between distant quantum
devices, necessitating spectral indistinguishability. Scalable solid-state
platforms offer promising routes to this goal. However, environmental
disorders, including dephasing, spectral diffusion, and spin-bath interactions,
influence the emitters' spectra and deteriorate the coherence. Using
statistical theory, we identify correlations in spectral diffusion from slowly
varying environmental coupling, revealing predictable dynamics extendable to
other disorders. Importantly, this could enable the development of an
anticipatory framework for forecasting and decoherence engineering in remote
quantum emitters. To validate this framework, we demonstrate that a machine
learning model trained on limited data can accurately forecast unseen spectral
behavior. Realization of such a model on distinct quantum emitters could reduce
the spectral shift by factors $\approx$ 2.1 to 15.8, depending on emitter
stability, compared to no prediction. This work presents, for the first time,
the application of anticipatory systems and replica theory to quantum
technology, along with the first experimental demonstration of internal
prediction that generalizes across multiple quantum emitters. These results
pave the way for real-time decoherence engineering in scalable quantum systems.
Such capability could lead to enhanced optical coherence and multi-emitter
synchronization, with broad implications for quantum communication,
computation, imaging, and sensing.

Abstract: The task of atom rearrangement has emerged in the last decade as a
fundamental building block for the development of neutral atom-based quantum
processors. However, despite many recent efforts to develop algorithms with
favorable asymptotic scaling, no time-optimal algorithm has been developed for
any rearrangement task. Moreover, no open-source code exists to reproduce or
benchmark existing algorithms, and to assist the development of new
rearrangement protocols. To address this deficiency, we develop an open-source
simulation framework for developing, comparing, and benchmarking algorithms
under realistic and customizable noise models. Using this framework, we
\textbf{a)} numerically extract lower bounds for the scaling of a time-optimal
rearrangement algorithm and compare it to existing heuristic algorithms
\textbf{b)} develop a naive dual-species algorithm able to prepare arbitrary
targets with near-unity success rate. With this framework, we hope to develop a
common tool for the community to study rearrangement, lower the barrier to
entry for new experimental groups, and stimulate progress in developing
algorithms which approach time-optimal scaling.

Motivation: Improving the efficiency of gamma-ray detection in Low Level Radioactive Waste analysis through the development of a new computational model that captures the entire detector response for faster and more accurate analysis.

Method: A 1D CNN named HPGe Compton Net was developed to analyze the full response function of HPGe detectors. The model incorporates physical features and uses a specialized database to enhance feature learning. The method leverages Compton scattering data to improve detection speed.

Result: The model demonstrated a significant 5x reduction in measurement time compared to conventional methods while maintaining high accuracy. Generalization tests on LLW samples showed superior performance over traditional methods, especially with low count data.

Conclusion: The HPGe Compton Net successfully addresses the challenge of prolonged measurement duration in HPGe-based gamma spectrometry, offering a more efficient solution applicable to Low Level Radioactive Waste analysis.

Abstract: High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors have been golden standard for gamma
spectrometry in Low level radioactive waste (LLW) analysis; however, their
notable shortcoming is prolonged measurement durations for weak radioactive
waste materials. The present study aimed to develop the HPGe Compton Net, a 1D
Physics Guided CNN to accelerate LLW analysis by taking advantage of the entire
response function of a HPGe detector for each radionuclide of interest, in
contrast to the traditional methods that analyze only peak regions of the
response. This acceleration is supported by two core innovative strategies: (a)
Channel Prompt method, a feature enhancement incorporating additional physical
information to guide the model to locate the designated radionuclide; (b) the
specially designed database to achieve effective targeted feature learning. The
performance evaluation carried out for test data set showed a five times
reduction in measurement time compared to a conventional spectral analysis
method while maintaining comparable precision. Compton perturbation tests
confirmed the model's smart adaptive utilization of the Compton regions. The
generalization testing of four LLW samples as the external validation set
proved its superior performance in low count data with an average accuracy of
90% over 83% of the traditional method. Future work will focus on upgrading the
HPGe Compton Net for practical applications.

Motivation: Dark matter searches require precise energy resolution, and this paper aims to explore alternative calibration methods that might improve sensitivity.

Conclusion: Alternative calibration methods could help improve energy resolution but modeling remains a challenge.

Abstract: Cryogenic calorimeters for low-mass dark matter searches have achieved sub-eV

a successful use of Compton steps for sub-keV calibration of cryogenic silicon

detectors operated with 0 V bias across the crystal. This new calibration at 0
V is compared with the established high-voltage calibration using optical

Abstract: Starting from the Einstein equations in Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS)
spacetime and imposing Friedmann-Robertson-Walker coordinates at large
distances, we find two coordinate systems with time-dependent metrics that are
smooth across both the black hole and cosmological horizons. These coordinates
require a positive cosmological constant for regularity, and thus they are not
de Sitter extensions of the Kruskal-Szekeres or Israel coordinates. One of the
coordinate systems was only found in 1999 (Abbassi coordinates), and it has led
to conflicting interpretations in the literature, while the other was briefly
commented on and promptly dismissed as unphysical or incompatible with SdS. We
derive that the second solution is equivalent to the first one, and that both
are indeed equivalent descriptions of SdS spacetime. We also derive explicit
coordinate transformations linking these coordinate systems to the Kottler
coordinates and the maximally extended Lake-Israel coordinates. Among other
applications, these results, which extend the largely used cosmological and
local coordinates, should be useful for further developments in understanding
the exact interplay between black holes and the cosmological background, which
has been the focus of a number of recent works.

*G. G. L. Nashed,Kazuharu Bamba*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: A spherically symmetric solution in quadratic non-metricity gravity has been found, which acts as a cosmological constant and conflicts with existing literature. The solution is applicable to charged fields without altering the non-charged case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a significant finding in gravitational theories, particularly addressed for spherically symmetric solutions in higher-order gravity models, which have not been conclusively established before.

Method: Mathematical derivation and exact solution of the field equations in quadratic non-metricity gravity are employed to find the solution.

Result: The solution exhibits the quadratic term behaving as a cosmological constant and shows applicability in charged field equations matching the non-charged scenario due to off-diagonal field equation components ignoring charge effects.

Conclusion: It refutes previous claims and opens new avenues for gravitational model studies, highlighting the quadratic term's cosmological role and solution applicability in various scenarios.

Abstract: We explicitly find an exact spherically symmetric solution in quadratic
non-metricity gravity. We show that the quadratic term acts as a cosmological
constant. This solution contradicts all the claims in the literature that there
is no spherically symmetric solution for higher-order non-metricity gravity.
Moreover, we demonstrate that for the charged field equations, the solution can
be identical to the non-charged case. This is because the off-diagonal
components of the field equation do not feel the effect of the charge.

Conclusion: 引入y变量扩展了KN黑洞的相关研究，结果与KN相似。

Abstract: Kerr Sen black holes possess stretchon parameters and hidden conformal
symmetries. The superradiant stability and steady state resonance of such black
holes warrant further investigation and form the primary motivation for this
study. In this work,we introduce an additional variable, referred to as y, to
generalize the findings of the previous study. When the frequency of the
perturbation lies within a specific range namely, above a certain threshold
determined by the spin parameter and below the sum of the azimuthal quantum
number times the angular velocity at the horizon and the product of the charge
with the electric potential at the horizon,the Kerr Sen black hole exhibits
superradiant stability. This behavior is similar to the superradiant
characteristics previously observed in KN black holes.

### [140] [Quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder models in loop quantum cosmology with Lorentz term](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01183)
*Minyan Ou,Xiangdong Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Loop quantum gravity effects modify the near-horizon geometry of black holes, altering thermodynamic properties and introducing phase transitions in their heat capacity, consistent with both anti-de Sitter and de Sitter scenarios but differing from classical behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how loop quantum gravity impacts the thermodynamics and structure of black holes is critical for reconciling quantum mechanics with general relativity and exploring the early universe's quantum regime.

Method: Mathematical analysis within loop quantum cosmology framework using quantum-corrected metrics and perturbation studies, including quasi-normal modes and thermodynamic property evaluations.

Result: Loop quantum gravity introduces significant corrections to black hole thermodynamics, modifying their near-horizon geometry and producing distinct phase transitions, both in anti-de Sitter and de Sitter settings but differing from classical predictions.

Conclusion: These results highlight the necessity of loop quantum gravity in accurately describing black hole thermodynamics, particularly in the early universe and across varied cosmological constants.

Abstract: A novel quantum black hole model is derived by incorporating the Lorentzian
term within the loop quantum cosmology framework of the quantum
Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS) model. This model features a quantum-corrected metric
tensor, representing a deformation of the classical Schwarzschild solution.
Investigations into the quasi-normal modes reveal that these quantum-corrected
black holes exhibit stability against scalar perturbations. Notably, the
exponential decay rate within the Lorentzian qOS model demonstrates a
significant reduction compared to both the earlier qOS model devoid of this
term and the standard Schwarzschild black hole. The higher overtones of the
Lorentzian qOS model also differ significantly from those of the earlier qOS
model and the standard Schwarzschild black hole, indicating that the
near-horizon geometry is substantially modified. The thermodynamic properties
with both positive and negative cosmological constant are considered. For the
anti-de Sitter case, our analysis reveals that for small black hole masses, the
temperature within this loop quantum gravity framework decreases as the mass
diminishes, contrasting with classical black hole behavior. Furthermore, a
logarithmic term emerges as the leading-order correction to the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Additionally, LQG corrections induce an extra phase
transition in the black hole's heat capacity at smaller radius. While for the
de Sitter case, the temperature increases as the mass decreases for small black
holes, again differing from classical expectations. Similarly to the anti-de
Sitter case, LQG corrections in the de Sitter case also lead to an extra phase
transition in the heat capacity at small radius.

### [142] [A General Model for Dark Energy Crossing the Phantom Divide](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01378)
*Zhibang Yao,Gen Ye,Alessandra Silvestri*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper presents a new model for dark energy called Freezing Gravity, which decouples background and perturbations. It allows arbitrary background evolutions without ghost or gradient instabilities and avoids issues during phantom crossing. The sound speed of scalar modes varies, approaching infinity at large scales, possibly avoiding strong coupling issues through freezing. On smaller scales, the sound speed is finite. The model suggests a cut-off in energy when the Planck mass exceeds the standard value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces a novel approach to dark energy by decoupling the background and perturbations, addressing known issues like ghosts and instabilities, and providing a framework for analyzing dark energy scenarios without solving complex background equations. This model could offer a new solution to the cosmic acceleration problem.

Method: The authors propose a model within a spatially covariant theory framework, allowing independent control of background and perturbations. They derive the equation of state from the Lagrangian, ensuring arbitrary background behaviors while maintaining stability in linear perturbations. The model avoids issues during phantom transitions by freezing the scalar mode in the infrared limit, even in the presence of strong coupling. Analysis involves examining the sound speed's scale dependence and identifying energy cutoffs.

Result: The main result is the development of the Freezing Gravity model, which successfully decouples background and perturbations, eliminates ghost and gradient instabilities, and provides a method to analyze dark energy without solving background equations. The model's unique large-scale behavior and finite sound speed on smaller scales are key findings.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with Freezing Gravity as a potential solution to dark energy challenges, noting potential areas for further study, such as its implications for structure formation and quantum gravity effects.

Abstract: Within the framework of spatially covariant theories, we propose a general
model for dark energy (DE) in which the cosmological background and
perturbations are independently controlled by different sets of coefficients,
and the equation of state of DE is directly determined by two free functions of
time from the Lagrangian. These properties allow to realize arbitrary
background evolutions while avoiding ghost and gradient instabilities in linear
perturbations. They also enable a more direct analysis of phantom crossing
without having to first solve the background equations of motion. In this
model, the sound speed of the scalar mode is scale-dependent and approaches
infinity at large scale, so that the field becomes non-dynamical in the
infrared (IR) limit. Even though this usually indicates a strong coupling
issue, we speculate that this is avoided because the scalar degree of freedom
becomes frozen not only at linear order but also at any higher order in IR
limit. Given this characteristic large scales behavior, we dub the model
\emph{Freezing Gravity}. On smaller scales, the scalar mode propagates with a
finite speed of sound. The theory has a cut-off in energy, signaled by the pole
in the speed of sound, when the effective Planck mass exceeds Planck mass.

Conclusion: 成功模拟二黑洞合并并提取相应的引力波信号，但三黑洞碰撞时约束纠正较大，存在未来研究引力回射的可能。

Abstract: In this project, we simulate the collision of two and three black holes using
NRPy+ (`Python-based code generation for numerical relativity and beyond')
module and BSSN (Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura) formulation, and extract
the resulting gravitational waveforms. Using Brill-Lindquist initial data and
sixth-order finite differences, we evolve the system using the BSSN formulation
and compute the gravitational-wave signal via the Weyl scalar $\psi_4$. To
assess numerical error, we plot the Hamiltonian constraint and observe that
constraint violations are significantly higher in the three-black-hole
collision. Unexpected gravitational recoil is also detected, which may
influence waveform extraction and that is left for further investigation.
Despite the limitations in computational resources imposed by the Google Colab,
we successfully model the merger of a binary black hole system, and we were
able to extract the corresponding gravitational waves.

Abstract: This paper investigates a geometric framework for the gravitational
Aharonov-Bohm effect in four-dimensional spacetime, demonstrating how spacetime
curvature induces nonlocal quantum phase shifts within field-free regions. By
constructing vector bundles on spacetime manifolds equipped with Levi-Civita
connections, we derive the holonomy transformations for parallel-transported
quantum states. Under the Newtonian approximation, metric decomposition into
Minkowski background plus scalar potential perturbations reveals through the
linearized Einstein field equations that the gravitationally induced phase
shift is mathematically isomorphic to its electromagnetic counterpart. These
results establish the quantum observability of gravitational gauge structures
and provide theoretical support for experimental verification via atom
interferometry.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the statistical entropy of black holes within the framework of
the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) by employing effective metrics that
incorporate leading-order and all-orders quantum gravitational corrections. We
construct three distinct effective metrics induced by the GUP, which are
derived from GUP-corrected temperature, entropy, and all-orders GUP
corrections, and analyze their impact on black hole entropy using 't Hooft's
brick wall method. Our results show that, despite the differences in the
effective metrics and the corresponding ultraviolet cutoffs, the statistical
entropy consistently satisfies the Bekenstein-Hawking area law when expressed
in terms of an invariant (coordinate-independent) distance near the horizon.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the GUP naturally regularizes the ultraviolet
divergence in the density of states, eliminating the need for artificial
cutoffs and yielding finite entropy even when counting quantum states only in
the vicinity of the event horizon. These findings highlight the universality
and robustness of the area law under GUP modifications and provide new insights
into the interplay between quantum gravity effects and black hole
thermodynamics.

### [146] [Wave Function Collapse Triggering Spacetime Dynamics in Semiclassical Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01573)
*Xiaoqiang Wang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: We propose a novel semiclassical mechanism that unites quantum mechanics and general relativity by suggesting that wave function collapse induces spacetime dynamics. Unlike previous models, we propose a single classical spacetime driven by the expectation of the energy-momentum tensor. The collapse modifies spacetime via Einstein's equations, respecting causality. We explore this mechanism for particles in superpositions, propose experimental setups, address theoretical challenges, and discuss implications for quantum-gravity theories, offering a testable framework with future experiments possible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity, which are currently incompatible frameworks, especially concerning quantum gravity theories. The authors propose a new approach using a semiclassical mechanism, focusing on wave function collapse as a trigger for spacetime dynamics. This could potentially provide a pathway for unifying these two foundational theories in physics.

Method: The authors use a semiclassical approach, which combines quantum mechanics and general relativity by considering wave function collapse as the mechanism for spacetime changes. They propose that a single classical spacetime emerges from the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor. The method involves numerical simulations of gravitational perturbations to test the theoretical framework, and they explore this mechanism for particles in spatial superpositions.

Result: The result is a novel theoretical framework that provides a new way to interpret wave function collapse in quantum mechanics and its effect on spacetime dynamics. The simulations suggest that spacetime can dynamically emerge from quantum superpositions without quantizing spacetime, which is a significant step towards quantum gravity theories.

Conclusion: The paper presents a promising approach to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity by linking wave function collapse to spacetime dynamics. The proposed mechanism avoids the need for quantizing spacetime, offering a testable framework with potential experimental validations in the future. This could lead to advancements in quantum gravity theories.

Abstract: We propose a novel semiclassical mechanism to unify quantum mechanics and
general relativity, where wave function collapse in a superposition state
induces a rapid change in the energy-momentum tensor, triggering spacetime
dynamics that propagate at the speed of light. Unlike models assuming
superposed spacetimes, we posit that the superposition yields a single,
continuous classical spacetime driven by the expectation value of the
energy-momentum tensor. Upon collapse, the abrupt shift modifies the spacetime
metric via Einstein's field equations, respecting causality. We explore this
for a particle in a spatial superposition, propose detailed experimental
designs with numerical simulations of gravitational perturbations, address
potential theoretical challenges, and discuss implications for existing
quantum-gravity theories. This framework offers a pathway to reconcile quantum
and gravitational dynamics without quantizing spacetime, with testable
signatures in future experiments.

### [147] [Geometric multipartite entanglement from gravitational particle production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01658)
*Alessio Belfiglio,Roberto Franzosi,Orlando Luongo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses multipartite entanglement in gravitational particle production during inflation, using a non-minimally coupled inflaton with quartic potential. Entanglement is measured with the Entanglement Distance, a geometric approach. Results suggest multipartite entanglement can be significant during inflationary stages, influenced by inflationary scales and possible observational implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of entanglement in inflationary particle production is a key aspect in understanding quantum origins and implications for cosmology. This paper contributes by introducing a geometric method to quantify multipartite entanglement, expanding on previous bipartite studies.

Method: The researchers use a perturbative approach with a non-minimally coupled scalar inflaton field having a quartic self-coupling potential. They compute probability amplitudes and use the Entanglement Distance, based on the Fubini-Study metric, to measure multipartite entanglement.

Result: The study finds that while in the negligible squeezing limit entanglement is dominated by infrared cutoff, non-negligible multipartite entanglement can emerge during inflation, even in late stages, influenced by inflationary momentum scales. They also explore generalizations with squeezing, non-Gaussianities, spectator fields, and discuss potential observational signs.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of multipartite entanglement as a significant quantum signature during inflation, with implications for understanding quantum gravity and cosmological observations. The geometric approach offers a new tool for quantifying entanglement in gravitational particle production processes.

Abstract: We explore novel generation of genuine multipartite entanglement within
gravitational particle production processes during inflationary stages. To this
end, we focus on perturbative production mechanisms, considering a
non-minimally coupled scalar inflaton field with quartic self-coupling
potential and computing probability amplitudes arising from its gravitational
interaction with background perturbations. The corresponding entanglement
amount is quantified using the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, that
provides a \emph{geometric interpretation of particle entanglement, in terms of
the Fubini-Study metric}. We observe that, in the limit of negligible
squeezing, the total amount of entanglement is dominated by the infrared cutoff
scale, in agreement with previous studies analyzing the von Neumann entropy
within bipartite scenarios. We then show that \emph{non-negligible multipartite
entanglement signatures may emerge across inflation, even during the latest
stages of slow-roll}, highlighting their dependence on inflationary momentum
scales. Generalizations to regimes with non-negligible squeezing, cubic
non-Gaussianities, additional spectator fields and possible observational
signatures are also discussed.

Result: 引入α后，效率η提升到11.64%，且α影响了 ergoregion、视界和静力极限的位置。

Conclusion: 量子修正对黑洞能量提取能力有重要影响，与经典Kerr理论预测不同。

Abstract: We explore the extraction of energy from a rotating black hole spacetime
modified by a quantum correction parameter \( \alpha \). Focusing on particle
splitting within the ergoregion, we analyze the Penrose process and compute the
extraction efficiency \( \eta \) as a function of both the spin parameter \( a
\) and the quantum correction parameter \( \alpha \). Our results show that
increasing \( \alpha \) induces an inward shift of the event horizon and the
static limit, resulting in a modest expansion of the ergoregion. This geometric
change significantly enhances the energy extraction potential. By numerically
solving the horizon equation, we determine a maximum extraction efficiency of
11.64\%. Additionally, we derive the expression for the irreducible mass,
highlighting its fundamental role in constraining the amount of extractable
rotational energy. Overall, our findings demonstrate that quantum corrections
have a substantial impact on black hole energetics, leading to marked
deviations from predictions based on classical Kerr theory.

The disc solution is characterized by a rigid rotation around the axis of

$\epsilon<1$ all realized dust particle orbits are stable and for $\epsilon=1$
all dust particles are in marginally stable states.

matter energy density parameter $\Omega$, change over time to help explain the
properties of the observable universe. We establish a hyperbolic solution and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the possibility of a wormhole solution without an event horizon, questioning the cosmic censorship conjecture by providing a theoretical model where a ring singularity is not hidden.

Method: The authors analyze the wormhole's causal structure using Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton equations, employing Papapetrou coordinates, Carter-Penrose diagrams, and Boyer-Linkelquist coordinates to verify the metric's analyticity and visualize the ring singularity's role.

Result: The study concludes that despite lacking a horizon, the wormhole connects regions via an instantaneous connection, satisfying the cosmic censorship conjecture by showing the singularity is visible but the wormhole maintains causality by linearity through a specific throat structure.

Conclusion: This research contributes to the understanding of wormholes and singularities, offering a new perspective on the cosmic censorship conjecture by demonstrating a causally connected wormhole model with a visible ring singularity but maintaining causality through its structure.

Abstract: According to the Cosmic Censorship conjecture, naked singularities are
thought to be forbidden in nature and must remain hidden by a horizon. In this
work, we present the causal structure of an exact solution to the
Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton equations representing a wormhole (WH), where the ring
singularity, without even horizon, is untouchable, this is, causally
disconnected from the rest of the universe. We analyze its metric functions in
Papapetrou coordinates to verify metric analyticity in spacetime, construct the
Carter-Penrose diagram, and use Boyer-Linquist coordinates to visualize the
lining of the ring singularity by the throat. We conclude that the ring
singularity in this WH is lined by the throat, similar to how the event horizon
lines the ring singularity in the Kerr-Newman black hole, satisfying the
Wormhole Cosmic Censorship Conjecture. In this work we show that the topology
of the WH is such that the two sides of the throat are separated by the
singularity, but are topologically identified, giving rise to an instantaneous
connection between these two regions.

Abstract: The introduction of thermodynamics into gravitational physics began 5 decades
ago with the discovery that black holes behave like thermodynamic systems once
semiclassical quantum effects are taken into account. Notions of temperature,
entropy, work, and phase changes that were introduced into gravitational
physics and originally applied to black holes, were later extended to
cosmological horizons and other settings as well. A major development occurred
15 years ago with the introduction of pressure in the form of a cosmological
constant. By extending the thermodynamic phase space to include this term,
along with its conjugate volume, black holes were found to exhibit a broad
variety of phase transitions that resembled phenomena seen in chemistry labs.
Black hole thermodynamics has become Black Hole Chemistry, which has led to a
wealth of insights into the nature of black holes, introducing concepts such as
Van der Waals fluids, reentrant phase transitions, and triple points into
gravitational physics. I discuss the origins of Black Hole Chemistry and its
basic features covered in an earlier review [1], and then go on to describe
developments in the subject that have taken place since then. Examples include
multicritical behaviour, polymeric transitions, superfluid transitions, scalar
hair, heat engines, NUT-charge, acceleration thermodynamics, the Joule-Thompson
expansion, holography, complexity, central charge criticality, microstructure,
thermodynamic tension, phase dynamics, and thermodynamic topology. This wealth
of new phenomena suggest that we likely still have a lot to learn from Black
Hole Chemistry.

Conclusion: 该模型在高性能计算中使用平均理论辅助分析，结果展示了系统渐进行为的稳定性。

Abstract: We consider an anisotropic cosmological model based on the locally rotational
Bianchi I spacetime, incorporating a scalar field and a non-zero cosmological
interaction term. The framework of averaging theory is employed to study the
associated non-linear differential equations. Through a qualitative analysis of
the gravitational field equations, we obtain valuable insights into the
structure of the solution space for the anisotropic scalar field model with a
generalized harmonic potential. The interaction between the scalar field and
matter is described by a general expression that depends on the Hubble
parameter, the time derivative of the scalar field, and the energy densities of
cold dark matter and dark energy. This formulation involves real parameters
that modulate the interaction, as well as a coupling constant with the
dimensions of the Hubble parameter. We show that the Hubble parameter serves as
a time-dependent perturbation parameter, controlling the discrepancy between
the full system and its time-averaged counterpart. As this parameter decreases,
both systems converge to the same asymptotic behaviour. This enables the
suppression of oscillatory effects, significantly simplifying the dynamical
analysis. Finally, we identify conditions on the interaction parameters that
ensure the regularity of the system's evolution by preventing the emergence of
singularities.

### [157] [Formation of Frozen Stars from collapsing matter by tunneling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02100)
*Ram Brustein,A. J. M. Medved,Tamar Simhon*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretical model of a 'frozen star,' a black hole mimic made of open-string flux tubes with extreme anisotropy, and demonstrates that a collapsing matter shell quantum mechanically tunnels into this structure with probability one.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring black hole mimickers and their formation mechanisms is crucial for understanding quantum gravity effects near black holes, which could provide insights into string theory and high-energy physics phenomena.

Method: The authors use a quantum tunneling approach, adapting the Gibbons-Hawking method, to analyze the transition from a collapsing matter shell to a frozen star.

Result: The study conclusively shows that the transition probability is unity, indicating the inevitability of tunneling into a frozen star from a collapsing shell.

Conclusion: This work provides strong evidence that frozen stars are a viable black hole mimic model, significantly advancing the field of black hole physics and quantum gravity.

Abstract: The frozen star is a type of black hole mimicker: An ultracompact object
whose exterior geometry resembles that of a general-relativistic black hole but
differs in its matter composition and in the regularity of its interior
geometry. It is sourced by a spherically symmetric collection of open-string
flux tubes, which posses an extremely anisotropic energy-momentum-stress tensor
with maximally negative radial pressure. The frozen star represents an
effective classical description of the highly quantum, closed-string polymer
model. A key challenge for any model of a black hole mimicker is to explain how
such objects can form from a collapsing body of matter. We started to address
this important problem in a previous article by adapting the Euclidean-action
method of Gibbons and Hawking to show that the transition into a frozen star is
likely. Here, we improve on our previous results by showing that the transition
probability for a collapsing shell of matter to tunnel quantum mechanically
into a frozen star is unity, up to negligible corrections. Our conclusion is
that such a transition is therefore inevitable.

Motivation: Exploring the implications of non-minimal coupling on spacetime structures and fluid dynamics in gravitational theories.

Method: Discussed multiple solving methods for modified field equations and analyzed stress-energy definitions resulting from NMC.

Result: New class of metric solutions are possible, and the nature of the fluid is altered when NMC is considered.

Conclusion: The paper provides a framework for studying spacetime structures with non-minimal coupling, highlighting complexities and new possibilities in gravitational theories beyond general relativity.

Abstract: In this work we have proposed some spherically symmetric, static spacetimes
in a theory of gravity which permits non-minimal coupling (NMC) between
curvature of spacetime and fluid variables. It is shown that these
non-minimally coupled theories may admit of new class of metric solutions.
Known metric solutions from GR can also be solutions of the non-minimally
coupled theories, for these cases the NMC affects the nature of the fluid which
sources the spacetime. The paper presents multiple ways in which the modified
field equations appearing in non-minimally coupled theories can be solved. The
NMC produces multiple definitions of the stress-energy tensor. The paper
discusses the complexity related to these sources of curvature as, unlike in
minimally coupled general relativity, in the present theory the Ricci curvature
itself can affect the stress-energy tensor of the effective fluid which seeds
spacetime curvature. The various energy conditions related to various forms of
possible stress-energy tensors are presented in the paper.

Abstract: In this work, we examine the influence of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) and
$f(R,T)$ gravity on quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) around a magnetically
charged black hole. By analyzing the effective potential, specific energy, and
angular momentum of circular orbits, we study how the NED parameter $\alpha$
and the gravitational coupling parameter $\beta$ affect orbital dynamics.
Increasing $\alpha$ leads to systematic deviations from the Reissner Nordstrom
behavior, reflected in shifts in the ISCO radius and orbital frequencies. We
further explore QPO-generating radii using the Relativistic Precession (RP),
Warped Disk (WD), and Epicyclic Resonance (ER2-ER4) models. We further extend
our analysis by performing an MCMC-based parameter estimation using QPO data
from black holes spanning a wide range of mass scales. This approach yields
consistent observational constraints on the model parameters.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解时空框架下粒子precession提供了理论工具，并为天文学系统应用具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: This paper investigates the spin precession of test particles moving in the
equatorial plane of general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes using the
Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations. The spin precession angles for two cases,
the small-spin case and the spin-orbital plane parallel case, are derived using
different approximations. For the small-spin case, the precession angle of the
spin components in the equatorial plane along circular orbits is found, and
perpendicular component is shown to be a constant of motion. For the
spin-orbital plane parallel case, it is shown that in general the orbital and
spin motions generally do not affect each other, and the spin precession angle
is calculated using the post-Newtonian method to an arbitrarily high order of
the orbital semi-latus rectum p. The precession angles in both cases are
analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively in the Kerr-Newman spacetime to
elucidate their features. For large orbital radii, it is shown that the leading
order of the precession angle series is generally proportional to the spacetime
mass while the Lense-Thirring effect always appears from the subleading order.
These precession results are then applied to various astronomical systems to
determine their spin precession rates. For systems with observational data, our
results show excellent agreement. For systems without observational data, we
predict their spin precession rates at both the leading and Lense-Thirring
effect orders. These predictions indicate that Jupiter's satellites exhibit
exceptionally large geodetic spin precession and their Lense-Thirring effect
may be detectable with current technology.

Conclusion: 这项工作为解决离散广义相对论中的可观察性问题提供了新方法，指向了量子重力理论的新视角。

Abstract: We study how the problem of observables is fully resolved for background
independent theories defined on finite graphs. We argue the correct analogue of
coordinate independence is the invariance under changes of graph labels, a kind
of permutation invariance. Invariants are formed by a group average that probes
the entire graph -- they are global. Strikingly, sets of complete observables
can be constructed so that each seeks a connected subgraph structure -- local
correlations. Geometrical information is fully encoded in background
independent observables through this subtle interplay of global and local graph
notions, a behavior we term glocal. This provides physically meaningful
complete sets of observables for discrete general relativity, suggests a
reformulation of the spin networks state space of loop quantum gravity, and
reveals deep connections between the problem of observables and the graph
isomorphism problem.

*Xi-Jing Wang,Yuan Meng,Xiao-Mei Kuang,Kai Liao*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Hairy Schwarzschild black holes show specific interferometric signals in their photon sphere configurations, which can encode black hole parameters and test gravitational theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation is to leverage the strong interferometric signatures produced by photon rings to enhance the precision of black hole parameter measurements and to test gravitational theory.

Method: The study uses a combination of analytical and numerical methods to investigate the visibility patterns of photon spheres in single and double photon sphere scenarios.

Result: Single photon spheres exhibit damped oscillations, while double photon spheres show varying behaviors depending on the relative photon sphere potentials. Specifically, when the inner photon sphere has a lower effective potential than the outer, damped oscillations are observed. Conversely, if the inner photon sphere has a higher potential, a beat pattern appears. The complex visibility amplitudes can encode the photon sphere structure of the central black hole.

Conclusion: The findings reveal that the interferometric signatures of hSBHs can effectively encode the characteristics of their photon spheres, providing a promising tool for directly measuring black hole parameters and studying gravitational theories.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the interferometric signatures of hairy
Schwarzschild black holes (hSBHs) that have either single or double photon
spheres. Our interest mainly stems from two considerations: (i) the photon ring
structure in black hole images produces strong and universal interferometric
signatures on long baselines, enabling precision measurements of black hole
parameters and testing gravitational theory; (ii) the hSBH describes the
deformation of standard Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) induced by additional
sources, and they can feature double photon spheres within certain parameter
regimes. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that for a hSBH
with a single photon sphere, the complex visibility amplitude of the image
exhibits damped oscillations. A similar behavior appears in the double photon
sphere case when the inner photon sphere has lower effective potential than the
outer one, as the photons near the inner photon sphere remain trapped by
gravity. However, when the inner potential is higher, a beat pattern rises. Our
findings reveal that the complex visibility amplitude can encode the signature
of the photon sphere structure of the central black hole.

Abstract: We investigate the evolution of a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
(FRW) universe in the framework of scalar non-metricity theory of gravity. In
the model, we consider dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) described by the
scalar field. In the paper, we examine the asymptotic behavior of the evolution
of the observed universe. We probe the universe with and without an interaction
between DM and the effective energy density including scalar field in the
non-metricity theory that describes the DE. The critical points of the
autonomous system and their stability are determined to understand the
behaviour of the universe. The cosmological models accommodate the late
accelerating phase of the universe for a given set of parameters, a
matter-dominated saddle point is also found to exist which is flowed by a
decelerating phase dominated by stiff fluid like DE. We obtain a new class of
cosmological model accommodating early inflation, matter-dominated era, and a
future decelerating phase followed by late acceleration of the universe.

Abstract: This study presents a new class of static, spherically symmetric traversable
wormhole solutions within the framework of non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills
(EYM) gravity, where the Yang-Mills field is purely magnetic and governed by
the SU(2) gauge symmetry. By incorporating a non-zero redshift function and a
direct coupling between the Ricci scalar and the Yang-Mills field strength
tensor, the work examines the influence of the non-minimal coupling constant
$\xi$ and the magnetic charge $Q$ on the wormhole geometry. The analysis
demonstrates that suitable choices of these parameters can satisfy the
flare-out and throat conditions, allowing for physically viable traversable
wormholes without requiring exotic matter. The study further evaluates the
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass, showing that quantum corrections, which are
modeled through Euler-Heisenberg-type contributions, reduce the total
gravitational mass and may stabilize the structure. The energy conditions are
analyzed, revealing localized violations of the null and weak energy conditions
at the wormhole throat, while the strong energy condition remains satisfied.
Additionally, light deflection in the presence of the wormhole is calculated,
indicating positive deflection angles and confirming the overall attractive
nature of the gravitational field. These findings highlight the role of
non-minimal gauge-gravity couplings in constructing observationally
distinguishable wormhole configurations.

Abstract: A class of gravity theories respecting spatial covariance and in the presence
of non-dynamical auxiliary scalar fields with only spatial derivatives is
investigated. Generally, without higher temporal derivatives in the metric
sector, there are 3 degrees of freedom (DOFs) propagating due to the breaking
of general covariance. Through a Hamiltonian constraint analysis, we examine
the conditions to eliminate the scalar DOF such that only 2 DOFs, which
correspond the tensorial gravitational waves in a homogeneous and isotropic
background, are propagating. We find that two conditions are needed, each of
which can eliminate half degree of freedom. The second condition can be further
classified into two cases according to its effect on the Dirac matrix. We also
apply the formal conditions to a polynomial-type Lagrangian as a concrete
example, in which all the monomials are spatially covariant scalars containing
two derivatives. Our results are consistent with the previous analysis based on
the perturbative method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores dark energy models in an alternative gravitation theory, aiming to determine their behavior and compatibility with standard cosmology.

Method: Using Bayesian analysis on BAO and SN Ia datasets in both Conformal Killing Gravity and Lambda-CDM frameworks.

Result: H0 and Omega_M are consistent with Lambda-CDM, Omega_D is negative and significant, contributes to matching data, with w0 in quintessence regime.

Conclusion: Dark energy exhibits dynamic behavior, supporting quintessence, which aligns early and late universe data with standard cosmology.

Abstract: In the frame of conformal Killing gravity cosmology, we performed a Bayesian
analysis on two different datasets of Baryonic Acoustic oscillations (DESI and
SDSS DR16) and on two datasets of SNeIa (Pantheon+ and Union3). The results for
H0 and Omega_M in a spatially flat FRW background are consistent with the
Lambda-CDM scenario. We obtain a non-negligible negative value for the novel
density of dark sector, Omega_D, and its relevance in the evolution of the
cosmological observables thus finding quantitatively what its contribution is
on real data to match the standard scenario. The results confirm the dynamical
character of dark energy. We also calculate the deceleration parameter q0 and
the present time dark energy equation of state parameter w0: the latter belongs
to the quintessence regime. The evaluation of the first acoustic peak of CMB
places it extraordinarily near to the best value provided by the Planck
collaboration. In this scenario, we can conclude that late time and early time
data can be successfully matched under the same standard.

Abstract: We analyze beam-induced depolarizing effects in the hydrogen jet target
(HJET) at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) that has been used for
absolute hadron beam polarimetry and shall be employed at the Electron-Ion
Collider (EIC). The EIC's higher bunch repetition frequencies and shorter bunch
durations shift beam harmonics to frequencies that can resonantly drive
hyperfine transitions in hydrogen, threatening to depolarize the target atoms.
Using frequency-domain analysis of beam harmonics and hyperfine transition
frequencies, we establish a photon emission threshold above which beam-induced
fields are too weak to cause significant depolarization. For EIC injection
(\SI{23.5}{\GeV}) and flattop (\SI{275}{\GeV}), beam-induced depolarization
through the bunch structure renders operation at the current RHIC magnetic
guide field at the target of $B_0 = \SI{120}{\milli\tesla}$ untenable.
Increasing the magnetic guide field at the target to $B_0 \approx
\SI{400}{\milli\tesla}$ moves all hyperfine transition frequencies to at least
three times the cutoff frequency, ensuring reliable absolute beam polarimetry
with the required 1\% precision at the EIC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on a key aspect of modern chemistry and drug discovery—understanding and modeling organic reactions, which is particularly challenging due to their complexity. The introduction of a new framework addresses these challenges and offers a more effective tool for researchers in this field.

Method: The method involves creating a multi-scale molecular tokenizer and pre-training stages focused on molecular structures and reaction mechanisms. Playing pre-training stages separately before joint training and implementing prompt-aware fine-tuning.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets and tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling complex organic reactions.

Conclusion: This paper offers a promising new approach for multi-molecular computational modeling, which could significantly advance both organic reaction research and related fields like drug discovery.

Abstract: Organic reaction, the foundation of modern chemical industry, is crucial for
new material development and drug discovery. However, deciphering reaction
mechanisms and modeling multi-molecular relationships remain formidable
challenges due to the complexity of molecular dynamics. While several
state-of-the-art models like Uni-Mol2 have revolutionized single-molecular
representation learning, their extension to multi-molecular systems, where
chemical reactions inherently occur, has been underexplored. This paper
introduces Uni-Mol3, a novel deep learning framework that employs a
hierarchical pipeline for multi-molecular reaction modeling. At its core,
Uni-Mol3 adopts a multi-scale molecular tokenizer (Mol-Tokenizer) that encodes
3D structures of molecules and other features into discrete tokens, creating a
3D-aware molecular language. The framework innovatively combines two
pre-training stages: molecular pre-training to learn the molecular grammars and
reaction pre-training to capture fundamental reaction principles, forming a
progressive learning paradigm from single- to multi-molecular systems. With
prompt-aware downstream fine-tuning, Uni-Mol3 demonstrates exceptional
performance in diverse organic reaction tasks and supports multi-task
prediction with strong generalizability. Experimental results across 10
datasets spanning 4 downstream tasks show that Uni-Mol3 outperforms existing
methods, validating its effectiveness in modeling complex organic reactions.
This work not only ushers in an alternative paradigm for multi-molecular
computational modeling but also charts a course for intelligent organic
reaction by bridging molecular representation with reaction mechanism
understanding.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了利用机器学习算法进行结构保持动力学模拟的可行性，可应用于多个尺度物理系统的复杂模拟中。

Abstract: The equations of classical mechanics can be used to model the time evolution
of countless physical systems, from the astrophysical to the atomic scale.
Accurate numerical integration requires small time steps, which limits the
computational efficiency -- especially in cases such as molecular dynamics that
span wildly different time scales. Using machine-learning (ML) algorithms to
predict trajectories allows one to greatly extend the integration time step, at
the cost of introducing artifacts such as lack of energy conservation and loss
of equipartition between different degrees of freedom of a system. We propose
learning data-driven structure-preserving (symplectic and time-reversible) maps
to generate long-time-step classical dynamics, showing that this method is
equivalent to learning the mechanical action of the system of interest. We show
that an action-derived ML integrator eliminates the pathological behavior of
non-structure-preserving ML predictors, and that the method can be applied
iteratively, serving as a correction to computationally cheaper direct
predictors.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel molecular dynamics simulation method that automatically discovers new metastable states without prior knowledge, using a biasing loss function that leverages neural networks' generalization limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient discovery of metastable states in complex systems, particularly in scenarios where prior knowledge of reaction paths is unavailable.

Method: Ablind molecular dynamics simulation method that employs a loss function to bias the system towards unexplored regions of configurational space without requiring initial data or prior knowledge of reactive pathways.

Result: The method successfully identifies new metastable states, reducing the computational effort needed to explore reatively inaccessible regions compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The research presents a promising, efficient approach for exploring complex molecular systems, with potential applications in materials science and biophysics.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel type of molecular dynamics simulation that
aims at discovering, in a blind way, new metastable states. Using only data
coming from an initial unbiased simulation, and with the help of an
appropriately defined loss function, we compute a bias that favors sampling yet
unexplored configurational space regions, encouraging the system to leave the
initial basin. In our work, we take advantage of what is normally thought to be
a defect, namely the difficulty of neural networks to generalize. Contrary to
most other enhanced sampling methods, which need previous knowledge of the
reactive process, we are able to discover in a blind way new metastable states,
overcoming otherwise insuperable kinetic bottlenecks. We illustrate the
workings of the method with a number of instructive examples.

Abstract: The formation of green energy carriers such as hydrogen (H2) and methane
(CH4) via photocatalytic processes provides a clean method for addressing
environmental and energy issues. To achieve highly efficient photocatalysts for
H2 and CH4 generation, the present work introduces the P/N heterojunctions in a
high-entropy oxide (HEO) with d0/d10 electronic junctions. The study uses CuO
as a P-type semiconductor and the HEO containing d0 (Ti, Zr, Nb, Ta) and d10
(Zn) cations as an N-type semiconductor. The material exhibits improvements in
optical properties, such as light absorption, charge mobility and reduced
electron-hole recombination. The integration of two concepts, atomic-scale
d0/d10 electronic junctions and micro-scale P/N heterojunctions, leads to
enhanced H2 and CH4 production. Particularly after the partial removal of
vacancies in the heterojunction, H2 production from photocatalytic water
splitting reaches 0.71 mmol/g.h, and CH4 evolution from CO2 conversion reaches
2.40 umol/g.h with 72% selectivity for methanation. The integrated strategy of
this study has a high potential in developing active heterostructured catalysts

TL;DR: SMFS provides detailed dynamics of single molecules, but extracting models from its noisy data is challenging. SBI framework addresses these issues, enabling accurate reconstruction from short experiments. Results showed it's highly effective and efficient, opening new possibilities for biomolecular studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving single-molecule force spectroscopy to better analyze biomolecular folding processes by developing robust frameworks.

Method: Simulation-based inference (SBI) integrated with physics-based modeling and deep learning to handle noise and limited data.

Result: Reconstructed free energy landscapes and dynamics accurately from short data, surpassing methods needing much more data.

Conclusion: SBI enhances the analysis of SMFS data, allowing efficient study of complex biomolecules where data is scarce.

Abstract: The study of biomolecular folding has been greatly advanced by
single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), which enables the observation of the
dynamics of individual molecules. However, extracting quantitative models of
fundamental properties such as folding landscapes from SNFS data is very
challenging due to instrumental noise, linker artifacts, and the inherent
stochasticity of the process, often requiring extensive datasets and complex
calibration experiments. Here, we introduce a framework based on
simulation-based inference (SBI) that overcomes these limitations by
integrating physics-based modeling with deep learning. We apply this framework
to analyze constant-force measurements of a DNA hairpin. From a single, short
experimental trajectory of only two seconds, we successfully reconstruct the
hairpin's free energy landscape and folding dynamics, obtaining results that
are in close agreement with established deconvolution methods that require
approximately 100 times more data. Furthermore, the Bayesian nature of this
approach robustly quantifies uncertainties for inferred parameter values,
including the free-energy profile, diffusion coefficients, and linker
stiffness, without needing independent measurements of instrumental properties.
The inferred model is predictive, generating simulated trajectories that
quantitatively reproduce the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the
experimental data. This work establishes SBI as a highly efficient and powerful
tool for analyzing single-molecule experiments. The ability to derive
statistically robust models from minimal datasets is crucial for investigating
complex biomolecular systems where extensive data collection is impractical or
impossible. Consequently, our SBI framework enables the rigorous quantitative
analysis of previously intractable biomolecular systems, paving the way for
novel applications of SMFS.

TL;DR: Their paper demonstrates that neural scaling laws can achieve near-exact solutions to the Schrödinger equation with LAVA algorithm, achieving chemical-accuracy and beyond, and provides new benchmarks for challenging systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about using neural networks in quantum chemistry, specifically improving the accuracy of calculations using scaling laws and an advanced algorithm. The motivation is to push the boundaries of computational chemistry accuracy through AI.

Method: The researchers developed LAVA, an optimization algorithm that scales model parameters and computational resources to improve energy accuracy systematically. They tested it on various molecules, showing systematic power-law decay in error, achieving high accuracy and better wavefunctions than previous methods.

Result: The results show that LAVA surpasses 1 kcal/mol chemical accuracy, achieving down to 1 kJ/mol subchemical accuracy, with improved physical properties like dipole moments. The method also provides benchmarks for challenging systems like ozone and molecular reactions where experimental data is scarce.

Conclusion: This work opens a promising path for AI-driven quantum chemistry, providing more accurate and reliable calculations, which can lead to better understanding and design of molecular systems, particularly in areas where experiments are difficult or limited.

Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, that neural scaling laws can deliver
near-exact solutions to the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation across a broad
range of realistic molecules. This progress is enabled by the Lookahead
Variational Algorithm (LAVA), an effective optimization scheme that
systematically translates increased model size and computational resources into
greatly improved energy accuracy for neural network wavefunctions. Across all
tested cases, including benzene, the absolute energy error exhibits a
systematic power-law decay with respect to model capacity and computation
resources. The resulting energies not only surpass the 1 kcal/mol
"chemical-accuracy" threshold but also achieve 1 kJ/mol subchemical accuracy.
Beyond energies, the scaled-up neural network also yields better wavefunctions
with improved physical symmetries, alongside accurate electron densities,
dipole moments, and other important properties. Our approach offers a promising
way forward to addressing many long-standing challenges in quantum chemistry.
For instance, we improve energetic properties for systems such as the potential
energy curve of nitrogen dimer as dissociation is approached and the
cyclobutadiene automerization reaction barrier, producing definitive
benchmarks, particularly in regimes where experimental data are sparse or
highly uncertain. We also shed light on the decades-old puzzle of the cyclic
ozone stability with highly accurate calculations for the cyclic-to-open ozone
barrier. These results provide near-exact reference calculations with
unprecedented accuracy, universal reliability and practical applicability,
establishing a foundation for AI-driven quantum chemistry.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FastCSP, a machine learning workflow that efficiently predicts crystal structures using MLIPs, significantly reducing computational costs and time while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crystal structure prediction is crucial for various fields, but traditional methods are computationally heavy. The need for efficient and accessible CSP tools leads to this research.

Method: FastCSP combines Genarris 3.0 for structure generation with UMA-based relaxation and free energy calculations to integrate MLIPs without relying on system-specific force fields.

Result: FastCSP aims to simplify the process by using universal MLIPs across different compounds, improving efficiency and accuracy without costly DFT calculations.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates the viability of machine learning in CSP for a broad range of applications, significantly lowering computational requirements.

Abstract: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) of molecular crystals plays a central role
in applications, such as pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. CSP is
challenging and computationally expensive due to the need to explore a large
search space with sufficient accuracy to capture energy differences of a few
kJ/mol between polymorphs. Dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT)
provides the required accuracy but its computational cost is impractical for a
large number of putative structures. We introduce FastCSP, an open-source,
high-throughput CSP workflow based on machine learning interatomic potentials
(MLIPs). FastCSP combines random structure generation using Genarris 3.0 with
geometry relaxation and free energy calculations powered entirely by the
Universal Model for Atoms (UMA) MLIP. We benchmark FastCSP on a curated set of
28 mostly rigid molecules, demonstrating that our workflow consistently
generates known experimental structures and ranks them within 5 kJ/mol per
molecule of the global minimum. Our results demonstrate that universal MLIPs
can be used across diverse compounds without requiring system-specific tuning.
Moreover, the speed and accuracy afforded by UMA eliminate the need for
classical force fields in the early stages of CSP and for final re-ranking with
DFT. The open-source release of the entire FastCSP workflow significantly
lowers the barrier to accessing CSP. CSP results for a single system can be
obtained within hours on tens of modern GPUs, making high-throughput crystal
structure prediction feasible for a broad range of scientific applications.

Abstract: The development of accurate and efficient machine learning models for

Abstract: Hysteretic gate responses of two-dimensional material heterostructures serve
as sensitive probes of the underlying electronic states and hold significant
promise for the development of novel nanoelectronic devices. Here we identify a
new mechanism of hysteretic behavior in
graphene/$h$BN/$\alpha$-$\mathrm{RuCl_3}$ charge transfer field effect devices.
The hysteresis loop exhibits a sharp onset under low temperatures and evolves
symmetrically relative to the charge transfer equilibrium. Unlike conventional
flash memory devices, the charge transfer heterostructure features a
transparent tunneling barrier and its hysteretic gate response is induced by
the dynamic tuning of interfacial dipoles originating from quantum exchange
interactions. The system acts effectively as a ferroelectric and gives rise to
remarkable tunability of the hysteretic gate response under external electrical
bias. Our work unveils a novel mechanism for engineering hysteretic behaviors
via dynamic interfacial quantum dipoles.

Abstract: Unconventional $p$-wave magnets (UPMs) with odd-parity spin textures have
attracted interest for their zero net magnetization and anisotropic spin-split
Fermi surfaces. Here, we explore a non-Hermitian open quantum system composed
of a ferromagnet and a UPM, subjected to an external magnetic field and
off-resonant circularly polarized light (CPL), serving as tunable control
parameters. We demonstrate the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the
proposed junction, whose locations can be modulated by the intrinsic properties
of the UPM. These EPs exhibit different multiplicities and formation conditions
compared to those in even-parity magnets (dubbed $d$- wave altermagnets), a
distinction attributable to the preserved time-reversal and broken inversion
symmetries characteristic of UPMs. We find that both the unidirectional
magnetic field (with adjustable strength and orientation) and the CPL induce
momentum-direction-dependent modifications to the EPs, such as their shifting,
tilting, merging, or annihilation, supported by analyses of spin projection and
eigenvector overlap. Although both perturbations influence the EP structure,
they operate via distinct mechanisms: CPL induces a global Floquet
re-normalization, enabling dynamic tunability through light, whereas the
unidirectional magnetic field selectively alters orientation-aligned terms,
lacking such tunability. Beyond revealing EP dynamics in UPM-based junctions,
our results highlight UPMs as promising platforms for non-Hermitian phenomena
in future spintronics.

Result:  For series connection, destructive quantum interference leads to exponential decay of conductance with small n. In parallel, aurophilic coupling enhances conductance significantly.

Conclusion:  Aurophilic interactions are fundamental in determining the electronic properties and conductance of AuCN molecular wires in different configurations, suggesting their importance in the design of molecular-scale electronic devices.

Abstract: We reveal the role of aurophilic interactions in the formation and
conductance of gold cyanide molecular wires of variable length-to-width ratios

Specifically, we identify electron transport signatures through 1D single
chains containing variable number of monomeric repeats of gold cyanide AuCN,
linked in series (AuCN)n, and through adjacent molecular wires linked in
parallel. When bound in series, destructive quantum interference causes an
exponential decay of conductance in (AuCN)n 1D wires for n=1-3. But when bound
in parallel, aurophilic coupling through the gold atoms of neighboring chains
reorders electronic states and results in significant enhancement of
conductance. Our work reveals that metallophilicity can play a significant role
in junction assembly and electron transport characteristics.

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a novel magnetic phase characterized by symmetry-protected,
momentum-dependent spin splitting and collinear compensated magnetic moments,
has thus far been explored primarily in periodic crystals. In this Letter, we
extend the concept of altermagnetism to quasicrystals -- aperiodic systems with
long-range order and noncrystallographic rotational symmetries. Using a
hyperspatial projection framework, we construct decorated Ammann-Beenker and
Penrose quasicrystalline lattices with inequivalent sublattices and investigate
a Hubbard model with anisotropic hopping. We demonstrate that
interaction-induced N\'eel order on such lattices gives rise to alternating
spin-polarized spectral functions that reflect the underlying quasicrystalline
symmetry, revealing the emergence of unconventional $g$-wave (octagonal) and
$h$-wave (decagonal) altermagnetism. Our symmetry analysis and low-energy
effective theory further reveal unconventional altermagnetic spin splitting,
which is compatible with quasicrystalline rotational symmetry. Our work shows
that quasicrystals provide a fertile ground for realizing unconventional
altermagnetic phases beyond crystallographic constraints, offering a platform
for novel magnetisms and transport phenomena unique to quasiperiodic systems.

Abstract: Adding spin-polarized carriers to semiconductor lasers strongly changes their
properties and, through the transfer of angular momentum, leads to the emission
of the circularly polarized light. In such spin-lasers the polarization of the
emitted light can be modulated an order of magnitude faster than its intensity
in the best conventional lasers. This ultrafast operation in spin-lasers relies
on the large linear birefringence, usually viewed as detrimental in spin and
conventional lasers, which couples the two linearly-polarized emission modes.
We show that the dynamical properties of birefringent spin-lasers under
intensity and polarization modulation are accurately described as coupled
harmonic oscillators. Our model agrees with the intensity-equation description
which, unlike the common complex field components describing the role of
birefringence in laser dynamics, uses simpler real quantities and allows
analytical solutions. We further predict unexplored operation regimes and
elucidate the difference between the weak and strong coupling in spin-lasers.

Abstract: We report two light-induced orbital magnetization effects in quantum Hall
(QH) fluids, stemming from their transverse response. The first is a purely
transverse contribution to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), where circularly
polarized light induces a DC magnetization by stirring the charged fluid. This
contribution dominates the IFE in the QH regime. The second is the orbital
inverse Cotton-Mouton effect (ICME), in which linearly polarized light
generates a DC magnetization. Since the applied field in the ICME does not
break time-reversal symmetry, the induced magnetization directly probes the
chiral orbital response of the fluid at the driving frequency. We estimate that
the resulting magnetization lies in the range of 0.5-10 Bohr magnetons per
charge carrier in materials such as graphene and transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) in the QH regime. Finally, we show that the induced
magnetization is accompanied by a local correction to the static particle
density, enabling optical quantum printing of density profiles into the QH
fluid.

Abstract: We study the interplay of spontaneous symmetry breaking and topological
properties in interacting one-dimensional models. We solve these models using
bozonization and identify topologically non-trivial phases by counting the
additional degeneracy (affiliated with the edge modes) of a finite-size system
relative to the infinite one. We find even if the mean-field solution is
topological, this may not be true when it arises from spontaneous symmetry
breaking, including in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This implies that
the original SSH model, as presented by Su, Schrieffer, and Heeger, is
topologically trivial, as opposed to its mean-field version. A spinful version,
on the other hand, does exhibit a topologically non-trivial phase. In that
state, both mean-field solutions are topologically non-trivial and correspond
to non-interacting SSH chains in the opposite phases with the winding number
$\nu=1$. We show that this phase is protected by a chiral symmetry, similar to
the non-interacting phases.

Result: 非对称间距溶液在一定范围提升迁移率，超过单层量子阱；当间距超过40A时迁移率更高，并在此处取得最佳效果。

Conclusion: 本研究为设计高效AlGaN/GaN量子阱提供了理论指导，支持在低温下优化性能。

Abstract: We demonstrate that coupled AlGaN/GaN quantum wells with asymmetric widths
($L_1-L_2<30 $ A achieve up to 4.5 times higher mobility than single wells at
optimal separation (d = 100 A). Crucially, mobility surpasses single wells when
d>40 A reversing the trend at smaller distances. This enhancement stems from
double-layer screening that suppresses remote/background impurities and
dislocations, while LO phonon scattering remains unaffected. For identical
wells, coupled systems underperform single wells at d<40 A but exceed them
beyond this threshold. Peak gains occur at cryogenic temperatures (77 K). Our
results provide a robust theoretical framework to optimize mobility in
AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, reducing experimental trial-and-error in quantum
device engineering.

Abstract: Over the years, Berry curvature, which is associated with the imaginary part
of the quantum geometric tensor, has profoundly impacted many branches of
physics. Recently, quantum metric, the real part of the quantum geometric
tensor, has been recognized as indispensable in comprehensively characterizing
the intrinsic properties of condensed matter systems. The intrinsic
second-order nonlinear conductivity induced by the quantum metric has attracted
significant recent interest. However, its expression varies across the
literature. Here, we reconcile this discrepancy by systematically examining the
nonlinear conductivity using the standard perturbation theory, the wave packet
dynamics, and the Luttinger-Kohn approach. Moreover, inspired by the Dirac
model, we propose a toy model that suppresses the Berry-curvature-induced
nonlinear transport, making it suitable for studying the quantum-metric-induced
nonlinear conductivity. Our theory can be further extended to include disorder
effects and higher-order quantum geometric contributions, paving the way for a
more comprehensive and systematic understanding of nonlinear transport.

Abstract: Multifold fermions, quasiparticles with multiple degeneracy protected by
crystalline symmetries, exhibit a variety of intriguing phenomena stemming from
their large topological charges and unique band structures. A comprehensive
understanding of their response to external stimuli remains challenging,
especially for types protected by nonsymmorphic symmetries where various
degrees of freedom are intricately coupled. Here, we systematically construct
effective models for multifold fermions that incorporate external fields based
on crystalline symmetry. Specifically, we develop a $\boldsymbol{k} \cdot
\boldsymbol{p}$ model for the threefold fermion protected by space group
I2$_1$3 (No.~199) in the presence of spin--orbit coupling, and derive the terms
for external fields. By complementing this with a tight-binding model, we
investigate the magnetic field response and reveal the pair annihilation of
magnetic monopoles. Furthermore, we construct a $\boldsymbol{k} \cdot
\boldsymbol{p}$ model for the eightfold fermion in space group P$\bar{4}3n1'$
(No.~218), including its coupling to external fields. This work provides a
robust theoretical foundation for advancing the study of external field
responses and transport phenomena in multifold fermions, opening new avenues to
explore their rich physics.

Abstract: This paper presents the possibility for inertial imaging of spatially
patterned annular mass distributions of a circular graphene nanodrum resonator.
By placing two distinct analytes in concentric annular regions, we harness the
vibrational mode-specific sensitivities of the nanodrum to estimate their
respective mass densities. An analytical formulation based on the Rayleigh-Ritz
principle is developed to relate radial mass loading to modal frequency shifts.
Finite element simulations are performed in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the
shifts in the resonance frequency of vibrational modes under varying
geometrical configurations of annular rings. By processing these frequency
shifts through a transformation matrix, we estimate the concomitant mass
distributions of annular rings. The results indicate that the estimation errors
are lower for analytes placed near the antinodal regions of the dominant
vibration mode, with the lowest error being 1.82 % for analyte A and 2.03 % for
analyte B. Furthermore, thinner annular rings demonstrate enhanced detection
accuracy due to reduced modal overlap. This study demonstrates an analytical
strategy for mass detection using a graphene nanodrum by providing insights
into optimal analyte placement and structural design for high-precision
multi-target mass sensing applications.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of multiscale mechanical and chemical constitutive models for energetic molecular crystals, integrating atomistic simulations with continuum code to study explosive materials like TATB and β-HMX at both microscopic and macroscopic levels, incorporating crystal plasticity, twinning, and chemical kinetics through machine learning methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of explosive materials at multiple scales is crucial for understanding their behavior in various applications, from defense to industrial settings, making this paper interdisciplinary in nature with aims to enhance modeling accuracy for simulations.

Method: The paper employs atomistic simulations using molecular dynamics to incorporate mechanical and chemical constitutive laws into continuum finite element codes. It utilizes unsupervised learning for analyzing reactive molecular dynamics and calibrating chemical decomposition models for explosives like TATB and β-HMX, integrating both crystal plasticity and twinning effects with multi-component equations of state.

Result: The integrated methodology successfully models the shock-to-detonation transition and dimensionality effects in hotspots, providing a comprehensive framework for multiscale modeling of Explosives, validated through outlined experiments.

Conclusion: This comprehensive approach paves the way for advanced simulations of explosive materials, enhancing both understanding and potential applications in various fields.

Abstract: Recent developments dedicated to the building of multiscale mechanical and
chemical constitutive laws for energetic molecular crystals are presented and
discussed. In particular, various tools have been specifically incorporated in
molecular dynamics codes to facilitate the subsequent information transfer to
the continuum, i.e. finite elements simulation codes. Atomistic simulations
have been augmented with the capability to follow specific deformation paths as
well as local Lagrangian mechanical metrics, enabling the computation of
materials flow stress surface. This mechanistic library allowed the
construction of a comprehensive non-linear hyperelastic continuum model
including crystal plasticity and twinning for TATB. Besides, recent advances in
analyzing reactive molecular dynamics simulations with unsupervised learning
algorithms has enabled the identification and calibration of chemical
decomposition kinetics for RDX and TATB single crystal. In the present work,
the procedure is applied to $\beta$-HMX and extended with the calibration of a
multi-components equation of state. These two ingredients are implemented in a
finite-element code in order to model the shock-to-detonation transition at the
mesoscale level and to study dimensionality effects in quasi-static hotspots.
Finally, these dedicated efforts towards a comprehensive multiscale modeling of
explosives has also given rise to the need for new prospective experiments,
discussed throughout the paper.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper uses lattice topology engineering to suppress the Peierls transition in 1D polyacetylene chains connected to nanographene, allowing the restoration of a quasi-1D metallic state with a boundary-free resonance state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a new pathway to overcome the Peierls transition, which is a critical factor in determining the metallic or insulating properties of low-dimensional materials. The suppression of BLA is crucial for realizing unconventional quantum phases of matter.

Method: Lattice topology engineering of trans-polyacetylene chains connected to open-shell nanographene terminals, achieved through appropriate modification or incorporating specific structures to influence the electronic properties and suppress BLA.

Result: The system successfully suppresses BLA and reestablishes the quasi-1D metallic character, alongside the formation of an unconventional boundary-free resonance state with persistent spectral weight.

Conclusion: This breakthrough enables the study of materials that were previously hindered by the Peierls transition and paves the way for the synthesis of synthetic organic quantum materials with novel quantum phases.

Abstract: Peierls theorem postulates that a one-dimensional (1D) metallic chain must
undergo a metal-to-insulator transition via lattice distortion, resulting in
bond length alternation (BLA) within the chain. The validity of this theorem
has been repeatedly proven in practice, as evidenced by the absence of a
metallic phase in low-dimensional atomic lattices and electronic crystals,
including conjugated polymers, artificial 1D quantum nanowires, and anisotropic
inorganic crystals. Overcoming this transition enables realizing long-sought
organic quantum phases of matter, including 1D synthetic organic metals and
even high-temperature organic superconductors. Herein, we demonstrate that the
Peierls transition can be globally suppressed by employing lattice topology
engineering of classic trans-polyacetylene chains connected to open-shell
nanographene terminals. The appropriate topology connection enables an
effective interplay between the zero-energy modes (ZMs) of terminal and the
finite odd-membered polyacetylene (OPA) chains. This creates a critical
topology-defined highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) that compensates for
bond density variations, thereby suppressing BLA and reestablishing their
quasi-1D metallic character. Moreover, it also causes the formation of an
unconventional boundary-free resonance state, being delocalized over the entire
chain with non-decaying spectral weight, distinguishing them from traditional
solitons observed in polyacetylene. Our finding sets the stage for pioneering
the suppression of material instability and the creation of synthetic organic
quantum materials with unconventional quantum phases previously prohibited by
the Peierls transition.

Abstract: Measuring entanglement entropy in interacting, multipartite systems remains a
significant experimental challenge. We address this challenge by developing a
protocol to measure von Neumann entropy (VNE) and mutual information in quantum
transport systems with both many-body interactions and multiple subsystems. Our
analysis indicates that the vital connection between VNE and two-point
correlation functions persists under these realistic conditions. The
measurement is shown to be feasible for systems with boundary interactions and,
critically, for bulk-interacting systems subject to a quantum quench of their
internal couplings. Our work provides a pathway to experimentally quantify
entanglement in complex interacting systems and establishes mutual information
as an experimentally accessible indicator for system-environment entanglement.

Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides present compelling prospects
for next-generation low-power and high-frequency field-effect transistors.
However, scaling 2D TMD FETs into the sub-10 nm regime remains challenging due
to technical complexity. Moreover, short-channel effects in this length scale
are not yet fully understood. In this work, we investigate the transport
properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm,
using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green
function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an
effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a classical-to-quantum crossover
in electron transport during transistor downscaling, governed by two critical
temperatures: Tc, which marks the crossover from thermionic emission to quantum
tunneling, and Tt, beyond which thermionic emission dominates and the
subthreshold swing approaches its classical limit. The shortest 3 nm junction
exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold
swing superior to the Boltzmann tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence
of the transmission coefficient. This quantum-tunneling-enhanced switching
behavior demonstrates the potential of ultra-scaled 2D FETs to surpass
classical efficiency constraints, offering a promising route toward
energy-efficient, quantum-enabled computing technologies. This study presents a
predictive, atomistic methodology for quantifying quantum transport and
identifies the transition in electron transport mechanisms from semiclassical
thermionic current in long-channel to quantum tunneling in short-channel 2D TMD
FETs, offering critical design insights for leveraging quantum-classical hybrid
transistor technology.

Abstract: Three-wave scattering is a fascinating phenomenon with many applications in
various technologies. Reducing the system symmetry greatly affects three-wave
scattering, which, in this case, goes beyond the simple momentum conservation
law. In this study, we examine three-magnon scattering at the edge of a thin
ferromagnetic film, when a bulk spin wave interacts with an edge-localized
propagating spin-wave upon the reflection. This creates new bulk spin waves at
mixed frequencies by means of three-magnon confluence or stimulated splitting
processes. Using our developed analytical theory, which has been confirmed by
full micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that the amplitude of the wave
generated in the stimulated splitting process is several times larger than that
generated in the confluence process, primarily due to the lower group velocity.
Furthermore, intensity of inelastically scattered waves exhibit a pronounced
dependence on the incidence angle and frequency of the edge spin wave that goes
beyond existing qualitative models. We show that the observed behaviors can
only be explained by taking into account, that the scattered waves are created
by several elementary three-magnon processes involving the incident and
reflected waves. The complex nature of the scattered wave creation results in a
strong sensitivity of its amplitude to the phase accumulation of spin waves
upon reflection.

Result: Theoretical framework explaining the bilinear response and dependencies on various parameters, providing insights for experiments and device applications.

Conclusion: The analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of the effects, aiding in the design of future spintronic and magnonic devices.

Abstract: Heterostructures of normal metals (N) and magnetic insulators (F) show
paradigmatic effects, such as spin-Hall magnetoresistance and electric drag
currents. These effects are linear in the applied electric field $E(\omega)$.
Normal-metal $-$ magnetic-insulator heterostructures also exhibit a
characteristic nonlinear response quadratic in $E(\omega)$, referred to as
unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance or spin-torque diode effect. In this
article, we develop a theory of the bilinear response of FN bilayers and NFN
trilayers for finite frequencies $\omega$ of the driving field and for four
contributions that have been previously considered in the literature: Joule
heating, phonon-mediated unidirectional magnetoresistance, the spin-torque
diode effect, and magnonic unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance. We
identify their distinct dependencies on frequency and the magnetization
direction of the magnetic insulator and examine their scaling with magnetic
field and system geometry, providing a framework for experimental
differentiation.

Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs), recently discovered unconventional magnets distinct from
ferro- and antiferromagnets, have rapidly emerged as a prominent frontier in
condensed matter physics. AMs are characterized by alternating collinear
magnetic moments with zero net magnetization in real space, and spin splittings
with even-parity symmetry in momentum space. However, their counterparts
exhibiting odd-parity spin splitting remain largely unexplored. Here, based on
symmetry argument, we show that such unconventional odd-parity magnets can be
induced from collinear antiferromagnets. Remarkably, using effective model
analysis within Floquet-theory framework, we demonstrate that circularly
polarized light irradiation of conventional antiferromagnetic lattices induces
both $p$- and $f$-wave magnets, realizing novel magnetic states dubbed Floquet
odd-parity collinear magnets. Moreover, we also uncover light-induced
antiferromagnetic Chern insulating states in the $f$-wave magnets. The proposed
Floquet odd-parity magnet is confirmed by first-principles calculations of
MnPSe$_{3}$ under circularly polarized light. Our work not only proposes a new
class of unconventional magnets, but also opens an avenue for light-induced
magnetic phenomena in spintronic applications.
