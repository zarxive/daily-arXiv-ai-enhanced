### [1] [Dynamic competition between phason and amplitudon observed by ultrafast multimodal scanning tunneling microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11627)
*Seokjin Bae,Arjun Raghavan,Kejian Qu,Chengxi Zhao,Daniel P. Shoemaker,Fahad Mahmood,Ziqiang Wang,Barry Bradlyn,Vidya Madhavan*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper discusses the dynamic competition between two collective excitations in the unconventional charge density wave insulator (TaSe4)2I, observed through a novel multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique. Two modes are found: a massive 0.22 THz phason and a 0.11 THz daughter phason resulting from the splitting of the massive one via parametric amplification. The daughter phason appears under the same frequency as the massive one but with a suppressed amplitude, highlighting an unexplored aspect of mode competition in non-equilibrium states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to study the competition between two non-equilibrium modes in an unconventional insulator, which is particularly relevant given the interest in exotic electronic phases and ultrafast phenomena. The interplay between these modes could provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of charge density wave ordering and phase transitions.

Method: The researchers developed a multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique that allows simultaneous measurement of time-resolved trSTM, trPC, and OPPR on femtosecond timescales. They applied this method to investigate the collective excitations in (TaSe4)2I, leveraging the ability to capture rapid changes in electron systems.

Result: Two distinct excitations were observed: a massive 0.22 THz phason with temperature-dependent properties, and a 0.11 THz daughter mode. The daughter phason is linked to parametric amplification splitting the parent mode, similar to the decay of a neutral pion into photons. The competition between these modes affects their amplitudes, with the daughter phason suppressing the parent's amplitude, offering new insights into mode dynamics.

Conclusion: The study reveals a novel mechanism for the generation and suppression of collective excitations, emphasizing the potential for understanding ultrafast structural and electronic phenomena in insulators. The findings suggest that the daughter phason plays a crucial role in controlling the parent mode's amplitude, providing a microscopic framework for controlling and manipulating such exotic states of matter in the future.

Abstract: The intertwining between two ordered states that arise from the same
interactions is reflected in the dynamics of their coupled collective
excitations. While the equilibrium phase diagram resulting from such
intertwined orders has been extensively studied, the dynamic competition
between non-equilibrium modes is a largely unexplored territory. Here, we
introduce a novel multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique, which enables the
measurement of time-resolved tunneling (trSTM), time-resolved point-contact
(trPC), and optical pump-probe reflectance (OPPR) on femtosecond timescales-all
within a single instrument. We apply these techniques to investigate the
collective excitations of the unconventional charge density wave insulator
(TaSe4)2I. Our trSTM and trPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22
THz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted
behavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Higgs
mechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz
exhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode
intensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking
suggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the
splitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via
parametric amplification-analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two
photons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason
competes with and suppresses the amplitudon at the same frequency. Our studies
reveal an unexplored mechanism for the generation and extinction of collective
excitations and pave the way for a microscopic understanding of ultrafast
phenomena.

### [2] [Multichannel topological Kondo models and their low-temperature conductances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11682)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多通道拓扑 Kondo 现象在不同情况下的行为，包括强耦合固定点与导率特性。

Method: 运用表示论与共形场论方法分析固定点性质，并通过有限温修正研究结果。

Result: 算出了固定点的有限尺寸能量本征值与主要的不可相关算子，导出了通用导率表达式。 thermal corrections 的行为因 N 的不同而变化。

Conclusion: MCTK 模型有强 Screening 固定点，导率在 N 增大时趋于零；有限温修正 showed 新的特性，且与拓扑 symplectic Kondo 不同。需要未来研究更多的实验与数值对比。

Abstract: In the multichannel Kondo effect, overscreening of a magnetic impurity by
conduction electrons leads to a frustrated exotic ground state. It has been
proposed that multichannel topological Kondo (MCTK) model involving topological
Cooper pair boxes with $M$ Majorana modes [SO($M$) "spin"] and $N$ spinless
electron channels exhibits an exotic intermediate coupling fixed point. This
intermediate fixed point has been analyzed through large-$N$ perturbative
calculations, which gives a zero-temperature conductance decaying as $1/N^2$ in
the large-$N$ limit. However, the conductance at this intermediate fixed point
has not been calculated for generic $N$. Using representation theory, we verify
the existence of this intermediate-coupling fixed point and find the
strong-coupling effective Hamiltonian for the case $M=4$. Using conformal field
theory techniques for SO($M$), we generalize the notion of overscreening and
conclude that the MCTK model is an overscreened Kondo model. We find the
fixed-point finite-size energy spectrum and the leading irrelevant operator
(LIO). We express the fixed-point conductance in terms of the modular S-matrix
of SO($M$) for general $N$, confirming the previous large-$N$ result. We
describe the finite-temperature corrections to the conductance by the LIO and
find that they are qualitatively different for the cases $N=1$ and $N\geq2$ due
to the different fusion outcomes with the current operator. We also compare the
multichannel topological Kondo model to the topological symplectic Kondo model.

firmly establish the presence of sixfold fermions in close proximity to the
Fermi energy of $\beta$-PtBi$_2$.

### [4] [Fractal Path Strategies for Efficient 2D DMRG Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11820)
*Oliver R. Bellwood,Heitor P. Casagrande,William J. Munro*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of simulating quantum magnetism in 2D using tensor network methods, which are limited by entanglement entropy. By optimizing the mapping from 2D lattice to 1D path, specifically using fractal space-filling curves like the Hilbert and Peano curves, they improve the efficiency of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm. Results show this leads to faster convergence, especially as the system size increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum magnetism in 2D is a complex field that benefits from numerical methods, but traditional approaches are constrained by computational limitations. This study aims to enhance the efficiency through better path mapping, which is crucial for advancing accurate simulations.

Method: The researchers evaluated all Hamiltonian paths for small grid graphs (N=8) and compared the performance of different space-filling curves (e.g., Hilbert, Peano) against the commonly used snake path. They analyzed convergence speed and identified patterns in the path construction that improve algorithm efficiency.

Result: Using fractal space-filling curves, the algorithm converges faster and more effectively for larger systems, with the performance gain increasing as the system size grows. This suggests the method is scalable and promising for future applications in quantum magnetism.

Conclusion: The study reveals that optimizing the mapping path in Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithms significantly enhances simulation efficiency, particularly in larger systems, using space-filling curves shows promise and should be explored further for improving quantum magnetism simulations.

Abstract: Numerical simulations of quantum magnetism in two spatial dimensions are
often constrained by the area law of entanglement entropy, which heavily limits
the accessible system sizes in tensor network methods. In this work, we
investigate how the choice of mapping from a two-dimensional lattice to a
one-dimensional path affects the accuracy of the two-dimensional Density Matrix
Renormalization Group algorithm. We systematically evaluate all mappings
corresponding to a subset of the Hamiltonian paths of the $N \cross N$ grid
graphs up to $N=8$ and demonstrate that the fractal space-filling curves
generally lead to faster convergence in ground state searches compared to the
commonly used ``snake" path. To explain this performance gain, we analyze
various locality metrics and propose a scalable method for constructing
high-performing paths on larger lattices by tiling smaller optimal paths. Our
results show that such paths consistently improve simulation convergence, with
the advantage increasing with system size.

### [5] [Coexistence of anomalous spin dynamics and weak magnetic order in a chiral trillium lattice K2FeSn(PO4)3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12076)
*J. Khatua,S. Krishnamoorthi,Changhyun Koo,Gyungbin Ban,Taeyun Kim,Suyoung Kim,Yugo Oshima,Jonas A. Krieger,Thomas J. Hicken,Hubertus Luetkens,Marc Uhlarz,Eundeok Mun,Kyeong Jun Lee,Seo Hyoung Chang,R. Sankar,Kwang-Yong Choi*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper discusses the ground-state properties of the K₂FeSn(PO₄)₃ trillium lattice, showing weak magnetic ordering and supporting a classical spin-liquid state through thermodynamic, ESR, and μSR experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores the exotic magnetic properties of trillium lattices, which are promising for quantum state research.

Method: The researchers used thermodynamic measurements, ESR, and μSR techniques to study the magnetic correlations and ordering at various temperatures and fields.

Result: The experiments revealed weak magnetic ordering at low temperatures, suppression by high magnetic fields, and persistent spin dynamics supported by μSR, consistent with a spin-liquid-like state.

Conclusion: The findings suggest potential for realizing a classical spin-liquid ground state with exotic excitations in high-spin trillium systems, opening new avenues in quantum magnetism.

Abstract: Trillium lattices, where magnetic ions form a three-dimensional chiral
network of corner-sharing equilateral triangular motifs, offer a prominent
platform to explore exotic quantum states. In this work, we report ground-state
properties of the $S$ = 5/2 trillium lattice compound
K$_{2}$FeSn(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$ through thermodynamic, electron spin resonance
(ESR), and muon spin relaxation (${\mu}$SR) experiments. Thermodynamic and ESR
measurements reveal the two-step evolution of magnetic correlations across
$T^{*}$ = 11 K, which results from an interplay between dominant
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions and subleading interactions. Below
$T^{*}$, \textit{dc} and \textit{ac} magnetic susceptibilities indicate weak
\textcolor{black}{magnetic ordering} at $T_{\rm N} \approx 2$ K under low
fields, which is suppressed for $\mu_{0}H \geq 2$ T, consistent with a
power-law dependence of magnetic specific heat at low temperatures. $\mu$SR
experiments confirm the dominance of persistent spin dynamics and the absence
of conventional spin freezing, supporting the subtle nature of weak magnetic
ordering coexisting with spin-liquid-like fluctuations. These findings
underscore the potential for realizing a classical spin-liquid ground state
with exotic excitations in high-spin trillium lattice systems.

### [6] [Emergent Symmetry and Phase Transitions on the Domain Wall of $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Topological Orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12193)
*Hong-Hao Song,Chen Peng,Rui-Zhen Huang,Long Zhang*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper studies 1D domain walls in 2D Z₂ topological orders, showing that the Ising model has SU(2)
1 symmetry due to hidden octahedral symmetry. A weak magnetic field perturbs the bulk but drives a domain wall transition to a ferromagnetic state, breaking certain symmetries. The gapless state acts as a T-symmetry-protected topological quantum critical point, demonstrating holographic principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper delves into topological orders and their domain wall phenomena, highlighting their connection to quantum phase transitions and symmetry principles, which are key in modern condensed matter theory.

Method: Theoretical study using the Ising model and conformal field theory to analyze domain wall symmetries and phase transitions.

Result: The domain wall exhibits an enhanced SU(2) symmetry and serves as a critical point in topological phase transitions.

Conclusion: Holographic principles are utilized to explain the emergence of symmetries and phase transitions in topological systems.

Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) domain wall of 2D $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological
orders is studied theoretically. The Ising domain wall model is shown to have
an emergent SU(2)$_{1}$ conformal symmetry because of a hidden nonsymmorphic
octahedral symmetry. While a weak magnetic field is an irrelevant perturbation
to the bulk topological orders, it induces a domain wall transition from the
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid to a ferromagnetic order, which spontaneously breaks
the anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry and the time-reversal symmetry on the
domain wall. Moreover, the gapless domain wall state also realizes a 1D
topological quantum critical point between a
$\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{T}$-symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase,
thus demonstrating the holographic construction of topological transitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to address the complexity of combinatorial summation in Feynman diagrams, a useful approach for physicists or researchers in quantum field theory looking to optimize computational methods for larger models.

Method: The method involves generalizing the combinatorial summation technique, applying it to various models, and showing the reduction in complexity mathematically.

Result: The result is a twofold improvement, reducing the exponential base from 3m to m+2 and demonstrating these results across multiple physical models.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the applicability of the method to important physical systems, suggesting promising outcomes for future research and potential algorithmic improvements.

Abstract: We present several generalizations of the recently proposed combinatorial
summation of Feynman diagrams with more interaction vertices and
symmetry-broken cases. For $m$ interaction vertices, we reduce the exponential
base in complexity from $3m$ to $m+2$. The generalizations encompass many
models of significant physical interest, including the SU(4) Hubbard model on a
honeycomb lattice, spinless fermions with frustrated interactions, SU(2)
Hubbard model on Kagome lattices, \textit{etc}.

### [8] [Phonon spectrum in the spin-Peierls phase of CuGeO$_3$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12409)
*L. Spitz,A. Razpopov,S. Biswas,H. Lane,S. E. Nikitin,K. Iida,R. Kajimoto,M. Fujita,M. Arai,M. Mourigal,Ch. Rüegg,R. Valentí,B. Normand*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper reviews CuGeO3's role in the spin-Peierls transition and uses DFT for electronic and phonon structure analysis, supported by neutron spectroscopy. The study reveals a detailed understanding of phonon modes, their dispersion, and interactions, with implications for spin-phonon hybridization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding complex quantum phenomena in materials like CuGeO3 helps elucidate fundamental aspects of condensed matter physics, such as spin-Peierls transitions and spin-phonon interactions.

Method: DFT calculations and neutron spectroscopy were employed to compute and experimentally observe the electronic and phonon structures, respectively.

Result: Numerical and experimental results align well, showing features like dispersive phonon modes and anticrossings which are explained through eigenvectors. Phonon effects on magnetic interactions were explored.

Conclusion: This work bridges theoretical DFT and experimental results, offering insights into CuGeO3's role in spin-Peierls and possible hybridization effects under various conditions.

Abstract: CuGeO$_3$ has long been studied as a prototypical example of the spin-Peierls
transition in a $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg chain. Despite intensive investigation of
this quasi-one-dimensional material, systematic measurements and calculations
of the phonon excitations in the dimerized phase have not to date been
possible, leaving certain aspects of the spin-Peierls phenomenon unresolved. We
perform state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
compute the electronic structure and phonon dynamics in the low-temperature
dimerized phase. We also perform high-resolution neutron spectroscopy to
measure the full phonon spectrum over multiple Brillouin zones. We find
excellent agreement between our numerical and experimental results that extend
to all measurement temperatures. Notable features of our phonon spectra include
a number of steeply dispersive modes, nonmonotonic dispersion features, and
specific phonon anticrossings, which we relate to the mode eigenvectors. By
calculating the magnetic interactions within DFT and studying the effects of
different phonon modes on the superexchange paths, we discuss the possibility
of observing spin-phonon hybridization effects in experiments performed both in
and out of equilibrium.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper observes CDW fluctuations in T-TiSe₂ above the transition temperature using advanced microscopy and analysis, showing that CDW activity persists even as the material recovers from excitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T-TiSe₂ is a promising material showing a CDW transition, and this research extends our understanding beyond the transition temperature by observing CDW fluctuations above it.

Method: Time-resolved EUV microscopy, nonresonant ultrafast photoexcitation, and density functional perturbation theory were used to observe and analyze CDW fluctuations at 295 K.

Result: Coherent amplitude CDW fluctuations are observed above the transition temperature, persistent with electron-phonon interaction dominating.

Conclusion: CDW mechanisms and quantum phase transitions in T-TiSe₂ involve complex electron-phonon interactions even at elevated temperatures, offering insights into the material's quantum behavior.

Abstract: 1T-TiSe$_2$ exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition below 200 K,
which is believed to be driven by a hybrid exciton-phonon mechanism, making it
a versatile platform for investigating the interplay between electronic and
lattice degrees of freedom. Although the corresponding band structure
modifications below the CDW transition temperature are well established, only a
few reports discuss the occurrence of the CDW fluctuating phase and its
spectral features well above the transition temperature. Here, we report the
direct observation of spectral features associated with CDW fluctuations at 295
K, using time-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy. We investigated
the transient melting and recovery of CDW fluctuations upon nonresonant
ultrafast photoexcitation. Surprisingly, our results reveal that the coherent
amplitude mode modulating the ultrafast CDW recovery persists at these elevated
temperatures. The time-, energy- and momentum-resolved photoemission data
supported by density functional perturbation theory further confirm that CDW
fluctuations at these elevated temperatures are dominated by electron-phonon
interaction. The analysis of these very localized microscopic fluctuations
consequently provides new insights into the complex interplay between the
electronic and lattice degrees of freedom at elevated temperatures and,
therefore, on the nature of this quantum phase transition.

Method: 研究者开发了多渠道Dyson方程，用于多体系统的势能面和谱函数分析，特别是H₂的基态和激发态。应用了精确解的Hubbard二维模型作为测试，评估了其方法在HOMO-LUMO间隙和离解极限中的表现。

Result: 多渠道Dyson方程在计算势能面、谱函数和HOMO-LUMO间隙等方面表现优异，特别是基态能量和HOMO-LUMO间隙在离解极限下与精确解一致。该方法超出了GW和第二生的性能。

Conclusion: 多渠道Dyson方程是一种有效且准确的方法，能够更全面地描述分子的基态和激发态性质，特别是在H₂这样的系统中。这表明该方法可能在其他复杂分子和系统中同样表现出色。

Abstract: We have recently presented the multichannel Dyson equation as an alternative
to the standard single-channel Dyson equation. While the latter involves a
single many-body Green's function, the former uses a multichannel Green's
function in which two or more many-body Green's functions are coupled.
Quasiparticles and satellites are thus naturally treated on equal footing in
the multichannel Dyson equation. To assess the accuracy of our approach we
apply it here to the ground- and excited-state properties of the extended
Hubbard dimer, an exactly solvable model for $H_2$. In particular, we focus on
the potential energy surface as well as the corresponding spectral functions
and HOMO-LUMO gaps, which are well-known challenges for many-body
approximations such as second Born and $GW$. We show that the multichannel
Dyson equation gives overall very good results for all properties considered
and outperforms both $GW$ and second Born. In particular, the multichannel
Dyson equation yields the correct ground-state energy and HOMO-LUMO gap in the
dissociation limit contrary to $GW$.

### [11] [Simple biological controllers drive the evolution of soft modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11973)
*Christopher Joel Russo,Kabir Husain,Rama Ranganathan,David Pincus,Arvind Murugan*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a model of integral feedback in complex biological systems that explains how low-dimensional controllers maintain homeostasis despite high-dimensional environmental fluctuations. The study uses yeast data to validate predictions about the relationship between controller structure and environmental perturbation buffering, suggesting an evolutionary basis for soft modes aimed at reducing system complexity rather than serving a direct function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the paradox of biological systems with many components yet efficient control mechanisms, proposing a potential evolutionary explanation for the presence of low-dimensional controls in high-dimensional systems.

Method: The authors develop an analytical model of integral feedback and test its predictions using a large dataset of yeast gene knockout strains.

Result: The model predicts that knocking out a simple controller decreases the system's response dimensionality to environmental changes, and this is supported experimentally.

Conclusion: The findings imply an evolutionary origin of soft modes that primarily reduce system complexity through buffering perturbations, with implications for gene regulation and other biological processes.

Abstract: Biological systems, with many interacting components, face high-dimensional
environmental fluctuations, ranging from diverse nutrient deprivations to
toxins, drugs, and physical stresses. Yet, many biological control mechanisms
are `simple' -- they restore homeostasis through low-dimensional
representations of the system's high-dimensional state. How do low-dimensional
controllers maintain homeostasis in high-dimensional systems? We develop an
analytically tractable model of integral feedback for complex systems in
fluctuating environments. We find that selection for homeostasis leads to the
emergence of a soft mode that provides the dimensionality reduction required
for the functioning of simple controllers. Our theory predicts that simple
controllers that buffer environmental perturbations (e.g., stress response
pathways) will also buffer mutational perturbation, an equivalence we test
using experimental data across ~5000 strains in the yeast knockout collection.
We also predict, counterintuitively, that knocking out a simple controller will
\emph{decrease} the dimensionality of the response to environmental change; we
outline transcriptomics tests to validate this. Our work suggests an
evolutionary origin of soft modes whose function is for dimensionality
reduction in and of itself rather than direct function like allostery, with
implications ranging from cryptic genetic variation to global epistasis.

Conclusion: 作者提出了一种新的路径积分框架，扩展了对量子场论的分析能力，可能在场基底与算符基底的转化中发现了新的贡献因素，对理论物理的发展有重要作用。

Abstract: We construct the path integral formulation of the partition function for a
free scalar thermal field theory using coherent states, first in the ladder
operator basis and then in the field operator basis. In so doing, we provide
for the first time a mapping in quantum field theory between the field-basis
coherent states and ladder-basis coherent states. Using either basis, one finds
terms missed in the usual path integral derivation, which we identify as the
vacuum energy contribution to the partition function. We then extend the
field-basis coherent state method to the interacting $\phi^4$ theory. In
addition to the vacuum energy contribution, one finds a coupling of a vacuum
expectation value to the mass term that is absent in the existing literature.

### [14] [Non-supersymmetric branes and discrete topological terms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11610)
*Ivano Basile,Vittorio Larotonda*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores a ten-dimensional heterotic string theory with NS5-branes, focusing on the discrete topological term and the spectrum obtained through anomaly inflow. It also examines lower-dimensional gravitational theories using similar methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the theoretical framework and its implications for string theory and gravity. The work aims to validate the spectrum and explore connections in lower dimensions.

Method: Investigates anomaly inflow and the worldvolume theory of NS5-branes. Employs both worldvolume analysis and examine lower-dimensional theories.

Result: Consistency of the spectrum verified; anomaly inflow relates to topological term in spacetime. Lower-dimensional models validated using similar techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed spectrum is consistent; suggests broader applications in string theory and gravity research.

Abstract: In a recent work, Tachikawa and Zhang proved the existence of a discrete
topological term in the unique non-supersymmetric heterotic string with no
tachyons in ten dimensions. This theory features NS5-branes, whose chiral
degrees of freedom are not well-understood due to the absence of dualities or
supersymmetry. In this paper, we test the consistency of a tentative spectrum
obtained by anomaly inflow, studying the relation between the worldvolume
theory and the discrete topological term in spacetime. Furthermore, we conduct
a bottom-up investigation of lower-dimensional gravitational theories with the
same methods.

Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized
screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a
rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this
competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the
superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a
tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the
resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by
either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially,
we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through
a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy
model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between
dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD
environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion
collisions and compact stars.

Abstract: The nucleation of bubbles during a first-order phase transition has recently
been explored using holographic duality, which can provide an important
complement to standard perturbative methods. These computations typically
require finding static and spatially inhomogeneous saddle points, known as
critical bubbles, which correspond in the gravitational dual to solutions of
nonlinear partial differential equations. A computationally simpler alternative
is to use the gravitational dual to derive the effective action of the boundary
theory in a derivative expansion, and then solve the resulting
lower-dimensional equations of motion. Once the effective action, typically
truncated at two derivatives, is obtained, the holographic theory can be set
aside, and bubble solutions can be found from ordinary differential equations.
In this paper, we test this approach in a simple holographic setup: a probe
scalar field in a black brane background with nonlinear multi-trace boundary
conditions. We compute critical bubble solutions both from the effective action
and by solving the full gravitational equations, and find good agreement
between the two methods.

Abstract: In a sense of deformation quantization, noncommutative (NC) geometry
introduces a quantum structure of spacetime. Using the twist-deformation
formalism, we show that the dynamical effects of spacetime noncommutativity can
amount to a transition to a rotating frame of reference. In particular, we
study the dynamics of charged matter (scalars and spinors) on the background of
Melvin's electric universe in the framework of NC gauge field theory. Melvin's
electric/magnetic universe is a static, axially symmetric solution of the
Einstein-Maxwell equations, representing a parallel bundle of self-gravitating
electric/magnetic flux. Due to its axial symmetry, it allows for a very special
kind of Killing twist that does not deform the metric itself but only the gauge
field and the matter fields. Focusing on the perturbative NC equations of
motion for charged scalars and Dirac spinors coupled to Melvin's electric
background, we show that they have the same form as the corresponding classical
(commutative) equations of motion coupled to the same geometric background but
in a uniformly rotating frame whose angular velocity is determined by the NC
scale and the electric charge of the matter field. In principle, this NC
rotation effect can be experimentally tested by setting up the Sagnac
interferometry apparatus to measure the Sagnac phase shift for charged versus
electrically neutral particles, thus placing a bound on the scale of spacetime
noncommutativity.

Abstract: We define and study Conformal Turaev-Viro (CTV) theory, a dual formulation of
Virasoro TQFT based on triangulating 3-manifolds with tetrahedra. Edges of the
triangulation are labeled by continuous conformal weights, and tetrahedra are
glued together weighted by the Cardy density of states. We demonstrate that the
CTV partition function is equal to the modular S-transform of the Virasoro TQFT
amplitude-squared, $|Z_{Vir}|^2$. This is analogous to a known result for
discrete spin networks. The derivation uses a variant of the chain-mail
formalism, adapted to the Virasoro context. As a CFT application, we derive
formulae for the S-transforms of the squared Virasoro crossing kernels. These
results lay the topological foundation to study the exact path integral of pure
AdS$_3$ quantum gravity by triangulations.

### [19] [WZW Partition Functions from Supersymmetric Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11673)
*Boan Zhao*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper successfully proves a conjecture by Murthy and Witten regarding WZW partition functions expressed as lattice sums, validating it for SU(N) root lattices where N > 2 and even with diagonal invariants. It shows the conjecture fails beyond these cases with a counterexample. The paper also applies these lattice sums to nondiagonal SU(2) invariants, demonstrating their efficacy through D and E-series cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper likely explores advanced algebraic structures in theoretical physics, focusing on partition functions and their mathematical properties through modular invariance and lattice sums. The motivation is tied to theoretical physics and mathematical conjectures in the context of SU(N) groups.

Method: The authors employ lattice sums to prove certain modular invariant properties of WZW partition functions for SU(N) groups. They analyze different cases based on N and modular parameters to determine where the conjecture holds true and where it doesn't.

Result: The paper confirms the conjecture for specific SU(N) cases, introduces counterexamples beyond these cases, and extends the method to analyze nondiagonal SU(2) invariants成功地证明了Murthy和Witten的猜想，用格求和的方式表达了WZW partition函数，并验证了其正确性，同时发现了一些反例，方法也应用到了SU(2)非对角不变量，展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: The research establishes a method to determine modular invariant properties of WZW models through lattice sums, highlighting its applicability within certain constraints and providing insights into cases where the conjecture fails. This approach is validated and extended, contributing to the understanding of partition functions in SU(N) groups.

Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Murthy and Witten which expresses modular invariant
WZW partition functions as lattice sums. We show that when the sum is over the
root lattice of SU(N), the result correctly reproduces the diagonal modular
invariants of SU(N)_k whenever N > 2 and N + k is even. Beyond these cases, the
proposition is not always true and we provide a counterexample when k >> N > 2
and k + N is odd. This proof generalizes the proof by Murthy and Witten for the
SU(2) case. We then move onto nondiagonal modular invariants and show that all
SU(2)_k nondiagonal invariants (the D and the E-series) can be obtained using
these lattice sums.

*Sergey Frolov,Davide Polvara,Alessandro Sfondrini*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper completes the derivation of dressing factors for the AdS3×S3×T4 S-matrix with mixed flux, proposing mirror TBA equations for the model's spectrum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of integrable systems in string theory, particularly in AdS/CFT correspondence, has been advanced by precise determination of S-matrix elements, known as dressing factors. This paper builds on previous work by considering mixed Ramond-Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz fluxes in AdS3×S3×T4, aiming to provide a comprehensive description of the spectrum at arbitrary string tension.

Method: The paper starts with the string kinematics, probably deriving the dressing factors for that regime. It then transitions to mirror kinematics, deriving the corresponding mirror Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) equations, which are crucial for solving the spectrum of the integrable system in the mirror regime.

Result: The key results include the successful derivation of the dressing factors in string kinematics and the formulation of the mirror TBA equations. These findings contribute to a more complete understanding of the integrable structure within the AdS3×S3×T4 model with mixed flux, facilitating further analysis of the spectrum and potential applications to the AdS/CFT correspondence.

Conclusion: By completing the dressing factors and establishing the mirror TBA framework, the paper provides a robust foundation for studying the spectrum of the AdS3×S3×T4 model with mixed flux across different parameter regimes, enhances the understanding of integrable systems in string theory and AdS/CFT, and paves the way for future research in this area.

Abstract: We complete the derivation of the dressing factors for the $AdS_3\times
S^3\times T^4$ S matrix with mixed Ramond--Ramond and
Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz flux, in the "string" and "mirror" kinematics.
Using these, we propose the mirror Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations which
describe the spectrum of the model at any string tension.

Result: 研究得出，在纯费米子情况下，最多只能有2个 Dynkin标签非零，且每个标签不超过4。他们还创建了表格，列出了所有可能的渐近自由表示。

Conclusion: 结论表示，在四维时空中，处理纯费米子的规范理论时，基于维度和 Dynkin指数的特性，得出只有有限的外部表示是渐近自由的，且这个结果可以系统化地列举出来。此外，结果可以直接扩展到包含纯bosonic或超对称的情况。

Abstract: We show how to classify the asymptotically-free gauge theories in four
spacetime dimensions, focussing here on the case of purely fermionic matter.
The classification depends on the fact (which we prove) that both the dimension
and Dynkin index of irreducible representations of a simple Lie algebra are
strictly increasing functions of each Dynkin label. This implies not only that
the number of asymptotically-free representations of any one semisimple Lie
algebra is finite, but also that they can be written down in a systematic
fashion using tables for the asymptotically-free irreducible representations of
simple Lie algebras, which we supply. These tables show that at most two out of
a possible ten Dynkin labels can be non-zero and that no Dynkin label can
exceed four. The extension to bosonic matter or supersymmetric theories is
straightforward.

*Jaume Gomis*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper explores the symmetries of N=4 SYM and their connection to string theory on AdS5×S5, focusing on C, P, T symmetries and their bulk realizations. The dual bulk transformations combine worldsheet symmetries with geometric ones. P and T map to CP and CT under S-duality, while C and CPT are invariant. A surface defect related to charge conjugation is defined, and its bulk dual is discussed. The study also touches on symmetries in string theory and quantum gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the connection between the symmetries of a conformal field theory (N=4 SYM) and the bulk string theory, which is a fundamental aspect of the AdS/CFT correspondence. This connection is crucial for exploring dualities in theoretical physics, particularly between gauge theories and gravity.

Method: The paper employs a method that combines theoretical analysis of the conformal field theory with its bulk dual in string theory. It involves studying the symmetries of the field theory, their transformations under S-duality, and their geometric interpretations in the bulk. There's also a discussion of surface defects and their gravitational descriptions.

Result: The main results are that C and CPT are preserved, while P and T transform into CP and CT under S-duality, and that they find a bulk gravitational description for the surface defect. This provides a deeper understanding of the symmetries in the AdS/CFT correspondence and their implications for quantum gravity.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to the understanding of the symmetries involved in the AdS/CFT correspondence, particularly relating C, P, T in N=4 SYM to bulk string symmetries. It also highlights the role of surface defects in connecting the field theory to bulk gravity. This work supports further exploration into the interplay between gauge theories and string theory.

Abstract: We study the realization of $\mathsf{C}$, $\mathsf{P}$, $\mathsf{T}$ in
${\cal N}=4$ SYM - corresponding to charge conjugation, parity, and
time-reversal - and identify the $\mathsf{C}$, $\mathsf{P}$, $\mathsf{T}$
global symmetries of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM with bulk (gauge) symmetries of string
theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$. The dual bulk transformations are symmetries of
Type IIB string theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$ that combine string worldsheet
symmetries, with geometric transformations acting on $AdS_5\times S^5$. We show
that $\mathsf P$ and $\mathsf T$ map to $\mathsf{CP}$ and $\mathsf{CT}$ under
$S$-duality (combined with an $SU(4)$ R-symmetry outer automorphism), while
$\mathsf C$ and $ \mathsf{CPT}$ are invariant. We also define a chiral,
codimension-two surface defect in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM associated with charge
conjugation, and provide its bulk $AdS_5\times S^5$ dual gravitational
description. We discuss the relation between symmetries on the string
worldsheet and symmetries of target space string field theory, global vs gauge
symmetries in quantum gravity, among related topics. Defects in ${\cal N}=4$
SYM and in quantum gravity play a central role in this work.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the hypergraph product and its visualization, introducing a 3D approach for generalized products and exploring code properties through such visualization methods. The author successfully provides visual insights into why k and d are hard to bound, issues with canonical bases, and relations between lifted and balanced products. Overall, the paper offers a deeper understanding through a unified visual approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on providing a comprehensive visualization approach for complex coding techniques, which can aid understanding for both researchers and students. It builds upon the existing canonical perspective to extend it, offering new methods and intuition for code properties.

Method: The author uses a 3D graphical approach, adding a third dimension to the existing visualizations, to generalize the lifted and balanced products. This method provides a unified framework for analyzing various properties of these codes, complementing the rigorous mathematical explanations.

Result: The paper successfully extends the visual understanding of HGPs and their generalizations, offering clear insights into code properties such as bounds on k and d, challenges in finding a canonical basis, and relationships between different products. This graphical approach makes complex concepts more accessible and elucidates the connections between different coding schemes.

Conclusion: By introducing a 3D visual framework, the paper provides a novel way to comprehend the hypergraph product and its generalizations. This approach not only enhances visual intuition but also supports the analysis of code properties, contributing to a more unified understanding of HGPs and their extensions. This work could serve as a valuable educational tool and reference for those studying advanced coding techniques.

Abstract: The hypergraph product (HGP) is a famous code construction technique with an
equally famous canonical visualisation. This visual perspective provides much
more than simply a way to build intuition: HGP codes can be defined
graphically, properties can be demonstrated graphically, and approaches to
fault-tolerant logic have been developed graphically. In recent years two
powerful generalisations of this product -- the lifted and balanced products --
have been proposed and employed to great success, but a unified graphical
approach to describing these codes has been absent. In these notes I review the
canonical approach to visualising HGP codes and then show how, via the addition
of a third dimension, it can be generalised to apply to both the lifted and the
balanced product. In the process we obtain clear intuition into various
properties of these codes such as i) why it is hard to bound $k$ and $d$ ii)
the issues with finding a canonical logical basis in the general case and iii)
how the two products are related, and how they differ. I have attempted to
structure these notes plainly and directly, so that the visual intuition can be
easily obtained by those who want it while the rigorous justification is still
available to those who demand it.

Abstract: Classical machine learning models struggle with learning and prediction tasks
on data sets exhibiting long-range correlations. Previously, the existence of a
long-range correlational structure known as contextuality was shown to inhibit
efficient classical machine learning representations of certain
quantum-inspired sequential distributions. Here, we define a new quantifier of
contextuality we call strong k-contextuality, and prove that any translation
task exhibiting strong k-contextuality is unable to be represented to finite
relative entropy by a classical streaming model with fewer than k latent
states. Importantly, this correlation measure does not induce a similar
resource lower bound for quantum generative models. Using this theory as
motivation, we develop efficient algorithms which estimate our new measure of
contextuality in sequential data, and empirically show that this estimate is a
good predictor for the difference in performance of resource-constrained
classical and quantum Bayesian networks in modeling the data. Strong
k-contextuality thus emerges as a measure to help identify problems that are
difficult for classical computers, but may not be for quantum computers.

Conclusion: 对正则不可补植性的动力学特性有深化的理解，为量子计算资源的安全性保护和优化测量策略提供了理论依据。这将有助于设计更有效的量子门路和更可靠的量子计算架构。

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness - also known as `magic' - in
monitored quantum circuits composed of random Clifford unitaries and local
projective measurements. For measurements in the computational basis, we derive
an analytical model for dynamics of the stabilizer nullity, showing that it
decays in quantized steps and requires exponentially many measurements to
vanish, which reveals the strong protection through Clifford scrambling. On the
other hand, for measurements performed in rotated non-Clifford bases,
measurements can both create and destroy nonstabilizerness. Here, the dynamics
leads to a steady-state with non-trivial nonstabilizerness, independent of the
initial state. We find that Haar-random states equilibrate in constant time,
whereas stabilizer states exhibit linear-in-size relaxation time. While the
stabilizer nullity is insensitive to the rotation angle, Stabilizer R\'enyi
Entropies expose a richer structure in their dynamics. Our results uncover
sharp distinctions between coarse and fine-grained nonstabilizerness
diagnostics and demonstrate how measurements can both suppress and sustain
quantum computational resources.

particular challenge due to intrinsic openness and non-unitary evolution. Here,
we introduce a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm based on Quantum Monte Carlo

advantages of both classical and quantum computation and exhibits good
applicability and adaptability, making it promising for simulating arbitrary
non-Hermitian systems such as PT-symmetric systems, non-physical processes, and
open quantum systems. To validate the algorithm, we applied it to the dynamic
simulation of open quantum systems and achieved the desired results.

Method: The authors use analytical derivations combined with numerical simulations to study the localization, topological properties, and energy spectra of the system.

Result: Mobility rings emerge in the non-Abelian case, unlike the Abelian counterpart, with non-Hermitian topological phase transitions. These mobility rings separate localized and extended states in the complex energy plane. Analytical and numerical results are consistent.

Conclusion: The study reveals that non-Hermitian effects induce mobility rings, offering new insights into the interplay between non-reciprocity and topological phases, suggesting potential applications in quantum technologies such as topological insulators and quantum control.

Abstract: We study localization and topological properties in spin-1/2 non-reciprocal
Aubry-Andr\'{e} chain with SU(2) non-Abelian artificial gauge fields. The
results reveal that, different from the Abelian case, mobility rings, will
emerge in the non-Abelian case accompanied by the non-Hermitian topological
phase transition. As the non-Hermitian extension of mobility edges, such
mobility rings separate Anderson localized eigenstates from extended
eigenstates in the complex energy plane under the periodic boundary condition.
Based on the topological properties, we obtain the exact expression of the
mobility rings. Furthermore, the corresponding indicators such as inverse
participation rate, normalized participation ratio, winding number,
non-Hermitian spectral structures and wave functions are numerically studied.
The numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical expression,
which confirms the emergence of mobility rings.

TL;DR: 研究了一个离散、量子化的阿佩尔哈密顿量，类似于摆的哈密顿量，但在相空间中被限制在一个环面上。该系统的能量级 spacing 变化很大，存在近退化态的对，在变化的参数下，可以发生大量阶跃的 adiabatic 和 diabatic 转移，除非漂移率非常低。研究表明，在非局部势相关且经典系统具有分离相空间的量子系统中，这种广泛能级 spacing 是普遍现象。

Result: 发现系统在参数缓慢变化时，能量级 spacing变化大且容易发生大幅跃迁，只有极低的漂移率才能阻止态的叠加。

Conclusion: 这类量子系统具有广泛能量级 spacing 的特性，且在经典相空间被分割时表现出显著的量子行为。这种情况在涉及非局部势的量子系统中常见。

Abstract: We study a quantized, discrete and drifting version of the Harper
Hamiltonian, also called the finite almost Mathieu operator, which resembles
the pendulum Hamiltonian but in phase space is confined to a torus. Spacing
between pairs of eigenvalues of the operator spans many orders of magnitude,
with nearly degenerate pairs of states at energies that are associated with
circulating orbits in the associated classical system. When parameters of the
system slowly vary, both adiabatic and diabatic transitions can take place at
drift rates that span many orders of magnitude. Only under an extremely
negligible drift rate would all transitions into superposition states be
suppressed. The wide range of energy level spacings could be a common property
of quantum systems with non-local potentials that are related to resonant
classical dynamical systems. Notions for adiabatic drift are discussed for
quantum systems that are associated with classical ones with divided phase
space.

*Mingyu Kang,Yikang Zhang,Kenneth R. Brown,Thomas Barthel*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the open quantum Rabi model, focusing on the nonequilibrium steady states and phase transitions under specific conditions. Key findings include a non-Gaussian phase transition due to oscillator dephasing and a complex instability cascade involving higher-order bosonic operators. Methods such as mean-field analysis, exact diagonalization, perturbation theory, and Keldysh field theory are applied to understand the system's behavior in the soft-mode limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of quantum systems in open environments is crucial. This paper delves into the dynamics of a specific model, the open quantum Rabi model, exploring phase transitions which are fundamental to quantum optics and statistical mechanics.

Method: The researchers employ a variety of methods including mean-field analysis, exact diagonalization, perturbation theory, and Keldysh field theory. They also establish a connection to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians to analyze the system.

Result: The study uncovers a non-Gaussian phase transition and an instability cascade when the bosonic mode is soft and subject to damping. These results provide insights into the complex dynamics of the system under these conditions.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of phase transitions in open quantum systems, which is vital for developing technologies such as quantum computing and ultra-cold atom physics. The connection to non-Hermitian systems opens new avenues for theoretical exploration.

Abstract: The open quantum Rabi model describes a two-level system coupled to a
harmonic oscillator. A Gaussian phase transition for the nonequilibrium steady
states has been predicted when the bosonic mode is soft and subject to damping.
We show that oscillator dephasing is a relevant perturbation, which leads to a
non-Gaussian phase transition and an intriguing cascade of instabilities for
$k$-th order bosonic operators. For the soft-mode limit, the equations of
motion form a closed hierarchy and spectral properties can be efficiently
studied. To this purpose, we establish a fruitful connection to non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians. The results for the phase diagram, stability boundaries, and
relevant observables are based on mean-field analysis, exact diagonalization,
perturbation theory, and Keldysh field theory.

*Leo Sünkel,Jonas Stein,Maximilian Zorn,Thomas Gabor,Claudia Linnhoff-Popien*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents evolutionary algorithms for minimizing communication costs in distributed quantum computing by assigning qubits and optimizing quantum circuits, outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in scaling quantum computing through distributed systems by improving quantum circuit compilation and communication efficiency.

Method: The authors implemented time-aware algorithms considering connectivity and network topology, using simulated annealing, evolutionary algorithms, and graph partitioning. They also developed an evolutionary-based optimization algorithm that modifies the quantum circuit structure.

Result: The evolutionary algorithms reduced communication costs more effectively than the baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed methods show promise for enhancing the scalability of distributed quantum computing, suggesting future integration into compilation frameworks.

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of distributed quantum computing promises a potential
solution to scaling quantum computing to currently unfeasible dimensions. While
this approach itself is still in its infancy, and many obstacles must still be
overcome before its physical implementation, challenges from the software and
algorithmic side must also be identified and addressed. For instance, this
paradigm shift requires a new form of compiler that considers the network
constraints in general as well as phenomena arising due to the nature of
quantum communication. In distributed quantum computing, large circuits are
divided into smaller subcircuits such that they can be executed individually
and simultaneously on multiple QPUs that are connected through quantum
channels. As quantum communication, for example, in the form of teleportation,
is expensive, it must be used sparingly. We address the problem of assigning
qubits to QPUs to minimize communication costs in two different ways. First by
applying time-aware algorithms that take into account the changing connectivity
of a given circuit as well as the underlying network topology. We define the
optimization problem, use simulated annealing and an evolutionary algorithm and
compare the results to graph partitioning and sequential qubit assignment
baselines. In another approach, we propose an evolutionary-based quantum
circuit optimization algorithm that adjusts the circuit itself rather than the
schedule to reduce the overall communication cost. We evaluate the techniques
against random circuits and different network topologies. Both evolutionary
algorithms outperform the baseline in terms of communication cost reduction. We
give an outlook on how the approaches can be integrated into a compilation
framework for distributed quantum computing.

Result: 发现强耦合环境下量子相干可以被自主维持，且通过理论分析和数值模拟支持。

Conclusion: 强耦合环境能使量子态长久保持，可能为量子计算等应用提供新策略。

Abstract: We analytically demonstrate that strong system-bath coupling separates the
relaxation dynamics of a dissipative quantum system into two distinct regimes:
a short-time dynamics that, as expected, accelerates with increasing coupling
to the environment, and a slow dynamics that, counterintuitively, becomes
increasingly prolonged at sufficiently strong coupling. Using the
reaction-coordinate polaron-transform mapping, we uncover the general mechanism
behind this effect and derive accurate expressions for both relaxation
timescales. Numerical simulations confirm our analytical predictions. From a
practical perspective, our results suggest that strong coupling to a
dissipative bath can autonomously generate and sustain long-lived quantum
coherences, offering a promising strategy for bath-engineered quantum state
preparation.

Abstract: We present a method for coupling a Koopmanian classical system to two quantum
bits to mediate an interaction between them. We then prove that the resulting
dynamics can never lead to entanglement between the two qubits. Even though the
total system of two qubits and the Koopmanian classical system are described
with the full quantum formalism, we show that their composite system violates
exact conservation laws as expected for a hybrid quantum-classical system. We
finally discuss the implications for semi-classical treatments of quantum
gravity.

### [35] [Non-additive measures for quantum probability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11735)
*Gabriele Carcassi,Christine A. Aidala*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a non-additive quantum measure as an alternative to classical probability in quantum mechanics. It shows how this measure can maintain some physical intuition while requiring a generalized probability calculus, addressing open questions in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is driven by the need to reconcile quantum mechanics with a generalized probability framework, exploring the implications of non-additive measures in quantum mechanics, particularly in the context of entropy and orthogonality.

Method: The authors propose using non-additive measures, explore their properties, and attempt to generalize the Radon-Nikodym derivative for a quantum probability calculus.

Result: The paper identifies a quantum measure that is non-additive and discusses its implications, along with the need for a generalized probability framework.

Conclusion: The authors suggest that non-additive measures provide a promising avenue for extending probability theory in quantum mechanics, though more research is needed to fully understand their mathematical properties and physical relevance.

Abstract: It is well-established that quantum probability does not follow classical
Kolmogorov probability calculus. Various approaches have been developed to
loosen the axioms, of which the use of signed measures is the most successful
(e.g. the Wigner quasiprobability distribution). As part of our larger effort
Assumptions of Physics, we have been considering the various roles of measures,
which are used in physics not only for probability, but also to quantify the
count of possible states and configurations. These measures play a crucial role
in classical mechanics, as they effectively define its geometric structure. If
one tries to construct a parallel in quantum mechanics, the measure to quantify
the count of states turns out to be non-additive. The proper extension of
probability calculus may require the use of non-additive measures, which is
something that, to our knowledge, has not yet been explored. The purpose of
this paper is to present the general idea and the open problems to an audience
that is knowledgeable of the subject of non-additive set functions, though not
necessarily in quantum physics, in the hope that it will spark helpful
discussions. We go through the motivation in simple terms, which stems from the
link between the entropy of a uniform distribution and the logarithm of the
measure associated to its support. If one extends this notion to quantum
mechanics, the associated measure is non-additive. We will explore some
properties of this "quantum measure", its reasonableness in terms of the
physics, but its peculiarity on the math side. We will explore the need for a
set of properties that can properly characterize the measure and a
generalization of the Radon-Nikodym derivative to define a properly extended
probability calculus that reduces to the standard additive one on sets of
physically distinguishable cases (i.e. orthogonal measurement outcomes).

Abstract: The Lindblad equation embodies a fundamental paradigm of the quantum theory
of open systems, and the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL)
generation theorem says precisely which superoperators can appear on its
right-hand side. These are the generators of completely positive
trace-preserving (or nonincreasing) semigroups. A complete exposition of this
theorem is given. The finite-dimensional case is handled using a form of
Jamio\l{}kowski transform. The treatment requires no previous knowledge of
complete positivity and obtains the Choi-Kraus presentation along the way. The
(separable) infinite-dimensional case is handled by means of a sequence of
finite-dimensional approximations, using the finite-dimensional case as a
crucial tool. An extension to time-dependent generator is also given.

### [37] [Analyzing the free states of one quantum resource theory as resource states of another](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11793)
*Andrew E. Deneris,Paolo Braccia,Pablo Bermejo,N. L. Diaz,Antonio A. Mele,M. Cerezo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the interaction between free states across multiple quantum resource theories, discovering that a state's resourcefulness can vary significantly when analyzed through different QRTs. Rigorous theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the need to understand how free states in one resource theory fare when probed by another, prompting a deeper insight into quantum resource interdependencies.

Method: The authors analyze seven specific QRTs—multipartite entanglement, fermionic non-Gaussianity, imaginarity, realness, spin coherence, Clifford non-stabilizerness, and $S_n$-equivariance, and $non-uniform$ entanglement—using theoretical derivations and numerical simulations to evaluate their resourcefulness across these theories.

Result: The results reveal that a state's perceived resourcefulness varies depending on the QRT used to evaluate it, highlighting the nuanced behavior of quantum resources.

Conclusion: This work underscores the importance of considering multiple QRTs when assessing and comparing quantum resources, offering a richer understanding of quantum states' behavior across different resource theories.

Abstract: In the context of quantum resource theories (QRTs), free states are defined
as those which can be obtained at no cost under a certain restricted set of
conditions. However, when taking a free state from one QRT and evaluating it
through the optics of another QRT, it might well turn out that the state is now
extremely resourceful. Such realization has recently prompted numerous works
characterizing states across several QRTs. In this work we contribute to this
body of knowledge by analyzing the resourcefulness in free states for--and
across witnesses of--the QRTs of multipartite entanglement, fermionic
non-Gaussianity, imaginarity, realness, spin coherence, Clifford
non-stabilizerness, $S_n$-equivariance and non-uniform entanglement. We provide
rigorous theoretical results as well as present numerical studies that showcase
the rich and complex behavior that arises in this type of cross-examination.

TL;DR: Their method reduces the number of shares needed for a system with up to ten qubits by using pairwise calibrations, achieving high control fidelities in large-scale operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the scalability of quantum computing using silicon spin qubits.

Method: They achieved this by using a single shared microwave line for all qubits, employing tailored control pulses, and a calibration scheme using pairwise calibrations.

Result: High-fidelity control of up to five qubits was achieved with fidelities above 99.99%, even during parallel operations.

Conclusion: The approach enables practical fault-tolerant thresholds and is scalable for further qubit additions.

Abstract: Silicon spin qubits are a promising platform for scalable quantum computing
due to their compatibility with industrial semiconductor fabrication and the
recent scaling to multi-qubit devices. Control fidelities above the 99%
fault-tolerant threshold are routinely achieved, but extending high-fidelity
control to simultaneous multi-qubit operation remains a major challenge. We
demonstrate high-fidelity, fully parallel control of five silicon spin qubits
using a single shared microwave line. Using tailored control pulses, all qubits
achieve primitive $\pi/2$ gate fidelities well above 99.99%, with some
approaching 99.999%, exceeding previously reported fidelities in silicon spin
qubits. These fidelities are mostly preserved during simultaneous operation of
up to three qubits, and remain at the practical fault-tolerant threshold of
99.9% even during fully parallel five-qubit operation. This performance is
enabled by a calibration scheme that compensates drive-induced phase shifts
using only pairwise calibrations, scaling quadratically with qubit number and
avoiding exponential overhead. By reducing the number of impedance-controlled
microwave lines, our approach addresses a key architectural bottleneck and
offers a scalable control strategy for high-fidelity operation in large spin
qubit arrays.

Abstract: We numerically investigate the generation and dynamics of tripartite
entanglement among qubits (quantum emitters or atoms) in multimode cavity
quantum electrodynamics (cQED). Our cQED architecture features three initially
unentangled excited two-level quantum emitters confined within a
triangle-shaped multimode optical cavity, which later become entangled due to a
Jaynes-Cummings-like interaction. Using the tripartite negativity measure of
entanglement and fidelity with respect to the genuine tripartite entangled
state (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (or GHZ) state, to be precise), we analyze
the impact of the number of cavity modes, qubit locations, and losses
(spontaneous emission from qubits and photon leakage from the cavity mirrors)
on the generated entanglement. Our key results include the presence of two
kinds of retardation effects: one resulting from the time it takes for photons
to propagate from one qubit to another, and the other to complete one round
trip in the cavity. We observed these retardation effects only in multimode
cavities, with the exciting possibility of controlling the collapse and revival
patterns of tripartite entanglement by altering the qubit locations in the
cavity. Furthermore, the impact of losses on the generated entanglement and the
dependence of maximum entanglement on the total number of modes yield results
that surpass those reported for single and two excitations. With recent
advances in circuit quantum electrodynamics, these findings hold promise for
the development of entanglement-based quantum networking protocols and quantum
memories.

Abstract: Any amplifier requires coupling to its internal degrees of freedom for energy
gain. This coupling introduces extra quantum noise to the output. On the other
hand, if the internal degree of the amplifier can be accessed and manipulated,
we can manage and even reduce the quantum noise of the amplifier's output. In
this paper, we present an experiment to reduce the quantum noise of a Raman
amplifier by preparing the atomic medium in a correlated state with the Stokes
light field. We report an observation of quantum noise reduction of more than
3.5 dB in the atomic Raman amplification process. From another perspective, the
Raman amplifier at high gain in turn serves as a measurement tool for the
quantum correlation between the atom and light. Furthermore, such a scheme,
when viewed as a whole, also forms a quantum-entangled atom-light hybrid
interferometer that can lead to quantum-enhanced sensors.

Abstract: The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems
makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic
coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as
the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be
accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an
optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables
the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the
currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian
distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the
fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to
realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a
series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat
states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for
the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks
and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the
photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.

Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QMPE), an intriguing anomalous relaxation
phenomenon, has recently attracted significant attention. However, how various
types of noise, which are ubiquitous in real systems, may affect the QMPE
remains unknown. Here, we address this gap by constructing a general dynamical
framework for d level open quantum systems under random telegraph noise. By
investigating the dynamics of an extended system and then projecting back, we
find that noise can induce additional modes and strongly influence the
relaxation dynamics of the original system. Specially, in the limit of long
correlation time of noise, these modes cause anomalous slowdown for certain
initial states, thereby inducing or eliminating QMPE, illustrated by a
three-level example system. Interestingly, this mechanism leads to a counter
intuitive effect:the decoherence rate may be slowed down by noise.

Abstract: A simple parametrized family of quantum systems consisting of two entangled
subsystems, dubbed left and right ones, both of them featuring N qubits is
considered in the thermofield double formalism. We assume that the system
evolves in a purely geometric manner based on the parallel transport condition
due to Uhlmann. We explore the different interpretations of this evolution
relative to observers either coupled to the left or to the right subsystems.
The Uhlmann condition breaks the symmetry between left and right by regarding
one of the two possible sets of local unitary operations as gauge degrees of
freedom. Then gauging the right side we show that the geometric evolution on
the left manifests itself via certain local operations reminiscent of
non-unitary filtering measurements. On the other hand on the right the basic
evolutionary steps are organized into a sequence of unitary operations of a
holonomic quantum computation. We calculate the Uhlmann connection governing
the transport for our model which turns out to be related to higher dimensional
instantons. Then we evaluate the anholonomy of the connection for geodesic
triangles with geodesic segments defined with respect to the Bures metric. By
analysing the explicit form of the local filtering measurements showing up on
the left side we realize that they are also optimal measurements for
distinguishing two given mixed states in the statistical sense. We also point
out that by conducting an interference experiment on the right side one can
observe the physical effects of the anholonomic quantum computation. We
demonstrate this by calculating explicit examples for phase shifts and
visibility patterns arising in such interference experiments. Finally a
sequence of geodesic triangles producing the iSWAP gate via anholonomy needed
for computational universality is presented.

Abstract: High-quality quantum states lie at the heart of advanced quantum information
processing. The degree of photon indistinguishability is critical for
applications from photonic quantum computation to precision metrology. The
two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference effect provides a rigorous
quantification method, with its visibility serving as the ultimate benchmark
for source quality. Generally, the coherent pumping is widely regarded as
indispensable for the preparation of quantum sources. As a result, incoherent
light sources have seen limited applications in the current quantum
technologies. In this work, we generate an indistinguishable two-photon state
by incoherent light generated by frequency doubling of Amplified Spontaneous
Emission light. The theoretical analysis indicates that phase randomization of
the pumping does not affect the coincidence visibility in two-photon intensity
interference. Moreover, temporal incoherence further enhances the symmetry of
the generated spectrum in second-harmonic generation. In the experiment, the
incoherently pumped photon sources exhibit a heralding efficiency of
approximately 60\% and a coincidence-to-accidental ratio exceeding 15000. The
observed HOM interference fringes show the visibility of 99.1\% without any
spectrum filtering, confirming the near-ideal indistinguishability of the
photons. Our study reveals the role of temporal coherence in second-order
nonlinear interactions, it provide a potential approach to use an easily
accessible incoherent light for engineering high-quality quantum sources.

*Siddharth Tiwary,Joel E. Moore*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines disordered XX spin chains with stochastic local measurements, showing how non-Hermitian dephasing leads to new phases and critical behavior. A new RSRG method, RSRG-X, is developed for this open system setting, revealing novel strongly disordered fixed points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding phase transitions and critical phenomena in quantum systems with measurements is a significant challenge. This paper contributes to that understanding by exploring disordered spin chains with non-Hermitian dynamics, opening new avenues for studying such systems.

Method: The authors employ a mapping of the monitored spin chain to a non-Hermitian spin ladder. They develop the RSRG-X method specifically suited for open quantum systems to analyze the phase diagram and critical behavior.

Result: The analysis uncovers new classes of strongly disordered fixed points due to non-unitarity, broadening the scope of critical phenomena accessible through RSRG techniques.

Conclusion: This work extends the applicability of real-space renormalization group techniques to include non-Hermitian dynamics, providing a framework to study phase transitions and critical phenomena in monitored quantum systems.

Abstract: Spin chains with quenched disorder exhibit rich critical behavior, often
captured by real-space renormalization group (RSRG) techniques. However, the
physics of such systems in the presence of random measurements (i.e.,
non-Hermitian dephasing) remains largely unexplored. The interplay between
measurements and unitary dynamics gives rise to novel phases and phase
transitions in monitored quantum systems. In this work, we investigate the
disordered XX spin chain subject to stochastic local measurements in the $X$
and $Y$ bases. By mapping the monitored chain to a non-Hermitian spin ladder
with complex couplings, we propose an RSRG-for-excited-states (RSRG-X) approach
for this open-system setting. Our analysis reveals a new class of strongly
disordered fixed points that emerge due to non-unitarity, broadening the
landscape of critical phenomena accessible via RSRG.

Abstract: Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional quantum
systems is pivotal for advancing quantum technologies, including communication
networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum
lattice model comprising coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) units.
Each unit integrates a single-mode cavity that interacts with a two-level
system (TLS), featuring direct coupling between adjacent TLLs. This
configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and
photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and spin-spin
interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we
simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their
transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the
importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters
for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of
excitations along the hybrid lattice. These findings offer insight into
designing controllable quantum links and single-excitation swaps in
low-dimensional quantum systems.

Conclusion: 该方案填补了量子态模糊化在支持量子输入与输出方面的空白，展示了在经典oracle模型下的有效性。

Abstract: Program obfuscation aims to hide the inner workings of a program while
preserving its functionality. In the quantum setting, recent works have
obtained obfuscation schemes for specialized classes of quantum circuits. For
instance, Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024) constructed a
quantum state obfuscation scheme, which supports the obfuscation of quantum
programs represented as quantum states for pseudo-deterministic quantum
programs with classical inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model.
  In this work, we improve upon existing results by constructing the first
quantum state obfuscation scheme for unitary (or approximately unitary) quantum
programs supporting quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model.
At the core of our obfuscation scheme are two novel ingredients: a functional
quantum authentication scheme that allows key holders to learn specific
functions of the authenticated quantum state with simulation-based security,
and a compiler that represents an arbitrary quantum circuit as a projective
linear-plus-measurement quantum program described by a sequence of non-adaptive
Clifford gates interleaved with adaptive and compatible measurements.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了梯度优化算法在提升EO量子比特多比特门性能方面的有效性，为量子计算的实际实现提供了新途径。

Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) qubits, implemented in triple-quantum-dot systems, offer a
compelling platform for scalable semiconductor-based quantum computing by
enabling universal control through purely exchange interactions. While
high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, the synthesis
of efficient multi-qubit operations -- such as the Toffoli gate -- remains a
key bottleneck. Conventional gate decompositions into elementary operations
lead to prohibitively long and error-prone pulse sequences, limiting practical
deployment. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm,
Jenga-Krotov (JK), tailored to discover compact, high-fidelity EO gate
sequences. Applying JK to the Toffoli gate, we reduce the number of required
exchange unitaries from 216 (in standard decomposition) to 92, and compress the
time steps required from 162 to 50, all while maintaining target fidelity.
Under realistic noise, the accumulated gate error from our optimized sequence
is an order of magnitude lower than that of conventional approaches. These
results demonstrate that the JK algorithm is a general and scalable strategy
for multi-qubit gate synthesis in EO architectures, potentially facilitating
realization of multi-qubit algorithms on semiconductor platforms.

Abstract: Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) is an emerging field aimed at automating
the design of quantum circuits for optimal performance. This paper introduces a
novel QAS framework employing hybrid quantum reinforcement learning with
quantum curriculum learning strategies, enabling learning agents to tackle
increasingly complex quantum circuit design tasks. We benchmark four
state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDQN,
TD3) against their quantum-enhanced counterparts (QA2C, QPPO, QDDQN, QTD3) for
optimizing variational quantum circuits (VQCs). Our approach progressively
increases circuit depth and gate complexity during training, leveraging
parameterized quantum circuits as function approximations. To improve learning
efficiency and stability, all algorithms, both classical and quantum, are
augmented with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). Experimental results show
that quantum-enhanced RL significantly outperforms classical methods. In a
2-qubit environment, PERQDDQN achieves a success probability of 0.46 with
~3,000 optimal successes, surpassing classical PERDDQN (0.42, ~2,400). In the
more complex 3-qubit setting, PERQDDQN and PERQTD3 reach success probabilities
of ~0.47, with optimal success counts of ~3,800 and ~3,600, respectively,
outperforming their classical counterparts. Additionally, we apply our QAS-QTN
approach to a classification problem, where the optimized quantum circuit
achieves an accuracy of 90.33\%, outperforming quantum models consisting of
random ansatz. This hybrid classical-quantum approach leads to faster
convergence and more efficient quantum circuit designs, demonstrating its
potential for advancing automated quantum architecture search.

Abstract: Quantum thermal machines offer promising platforms for exploring the
fundamental limits of thermodynamics at the microscopic scale. Here, we study a
two-stroke quantum refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold reservoir via
discrete strokes powered by external work. The working medium consists of two
two-level systems (TLSs) and two heat reservoirs at different temperatures and
is assisted by an auxiliary system acting as a catalyst. Remarkably, the
catalyst remains unchanged after each cycle, ensuring that heat extraction is
driven entirely by the work input. We show that the presence of the catalyst
leads to two significant enhancements: it enables the coefficient of
performance (COP) to exceed the Otto bound and allows the refrigerator to
operate in frequency and temperature regimes that are inaccessible without a
catalyst. These results highlight the potential of catalytic mechanisms to
broaden the operational capabilities of quantum thermal devices and to surpass
conventional thermodynamic performance limits.

Motivation: the paper addresses the need for effective evaluation metrics to optimize quantum hardware and improve algorithm execution efficiency.

Method: the methodology involves proposing QLOPS as a new metric, combining elements such as code rates, decoder accuracy, throughput, and latency to evaluate the performance of quantum error-correcting codes and fault-tolerant computing schemes.

Result: the newly introduced QLOPS framework provides a systematic way to measure and compare the efficiency and practicality of different FTQC approaches, aiding in the development of better quantum hardware.

Conclusion: this framework offers a significant advancement in quantifying the performance and scalability of FTQC schemes, facilitating better alignment and optimization of quantum hardware for practical use cases.

Abstract: It is widely recognized that quantum computing has profound impacts on
multiple fields, including but not limited to cryptography, machine learning,
materials science, etc. To run quantum algorithms, it is essential to develop
scalable quantum hardware with low noise levels and to design efficient
fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) schemes. Currently, various FTQC
schemes have been developed for different hardware platforms. However, a
comprehensive framework for the analysis and evaluation of these schemes is
still lacking. In this work, we propose Quantum Logical Operations Per Second
(QLOPS) as a metric for assessing the performance of FTQC schemes on quantum
hardware platforms. This benchmarking framework will integrate essential
relevant factors, e.g., the code rates of quantum error-correcting codes, the
accuracy, throughput, and latency of the decoder, and reflect the practical
requirements of quantum algorithm execution. This framework will enable the
identification of bottlenecks in quantum hardware, providing potential
directions for their development. Moreover, our results will help establish a
comparative framework for evaluating FTQC designs. As this benchmarking
approach considers practical applications, it may assist in estimating the
hardware resources needed to implement quantum algorithms and offers
preliminary insights into potential timelines.

Abstract: Quantum networks exhibit fundamental differences from their classical
counterparts. These differences necessitate novel principles when organizing,
managing, and operating them. Here we propose an unconventional approach to
organize and manage the operations of quantum network devices. Instead of a
hierarchical scheme using layers, like in classical networks and present
quantum network stack models, we propose a resource-centric task-based scheme.
In this scheme, quantum applications pose objectives, initiated by a node, to a
quantum network, such as sharing an entangled state or sending a qubit along a
path. The quantum network node initiating the objective consequently derives a
distributed workflow, referred to as saga, comprising numerous tasks operating
on resources, which completes the objective. We identify three different kinds
of resources with their own and independent topology, namely classical
messaging, quantum channels and entanglement. Sagas can either be centrally
orchestrated or performed in choreography by the network nodes. The tasks of a
saga originate from and operate on resources of the network, such as quantum
channels or entanglement, and they not only comprise operations and
measurements, but potentially also include other tasks or even entire
protocols, such as sending a qubit, distributing entanglement or performing
entanglement purification steps.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of
quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum
entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential
growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical
simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the
other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states
as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and
the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable
dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This
formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function
dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in
terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of
qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over
phase-space.

Abstract: Constraint handling remains a key bottleneck in quantum combinatorial
optimization. While slack-variable-based encodings are straightforward, they
significantly increase qubit counts and circuit depth, challenging the
scalability of quantum solvers. In this work, we investigate a suite of
Lagrangian-based optimization techniques including dual ascent, bundle methods,
cutting plane approaches, and augmented Lagrangian formulations for solving
constrained combinatorial problems on quantum simulators and hardware. Our
framework is applied to three representative NP-hard problems: the Travelling
Salesman Problem (TSP), the Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP), and the
Maximum Independent Set (MIS).
  We demonstrate that MDKP and TSP, with their inequality-based or
degree-constrained structures, allow for slack-free reformulations, leading to
significant qubit savings without compromising performance. In contrast, MIS
does not inherently benefit from slack elimination but still gains in
feasibility and objective quality from principled Lagrangian updates. We
benchmark these methods across classically hard instances, analyzing trade-offs
in qubit usage, feasibility, and optimality gaps. Our results highlight the
flexibility of Lagrangian formulations as a scalable alternative to naive QUBO
penalization, even when qubit savings are not always achievable. This work
provides practical insights for deploying constraint-aware quantum optimization
pipelines, with applications in logistics, network design, and resource
allocation.

Abstract: We introduce BenchRL-QAS, a unified benchmarking framework for systematically
evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in quantum architecture
search (QAS) across diverse variational quantum algorithm tasks and system
sizes ranging from 2- to 8-qubit. Our study benchmarks nine RL agents including
both value-based and policy-gradient methods on representative quantum problems
such as variational quantum eigensolver, variational quantum state
diagonalization, quantum classification, and state preparation, spanning both
noiseless and realistic noisy regimes. We propose a weighted ranking metric
that balances accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and computational
efficiency, enabling fair and comprehensive comparison. Our results first
reveal that RL-based quantum classifier outperforms baseline variational
classifiers. Then we conclude that no single RL algorithm is universally
optimal when considering a set of QAS tasks; algorithmic performance is highly
context-dependent, varying with task structure, qubit count, and noise. This
empirical finding provides strong evidence for the "no free lunch" principle in
RL-based quantum circuit design and highlights the necessity of tailored
algorithm selection and systematic benchmarking for advancing quantum circuit
synthesis. This work represents the most comprehensive RL-QAS benchmarking
effort to date, and BenchRL-QAS along with all experimental data are made

Abstract: The exploitation of multimodality in different degrees of freedom is one of
the most promising ways to increase the rate of heralded entanglement between
distant quantum nodes. In this paper, we realize a spatially-multiplexed
solid-state quantum memory array with ten individually controllable spin-wave
memory cells featuring on-demand read-out and temporal multiplexing. By
combining spatial and temporal multiplexing, we store weak coherent pulses at
the single-photon level in up to 250 spatio-temporal modes, with an average
signal-to-noise ratio of 10(2). We perform a thorough characterization of the
whole system, including its multiplexing and demultiplexing stage. We verify
that the memory array exhibits low cross-talk even at the single-photon level.
The measured performance indicates readiness for storing non-classical states
and promises a speed-up in entanglement distribution rates.

*Olimpia Lombardi,Sebastian Fortin,Juan Camilo Martinez Gonzalez,Hernan Lucas Accorinti*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The abstract discusses a paper by Huggett, Ladyman, and Thebault challenging the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation's foundation, arguing it aligns with physics rather than requiring a classical assumption. However, the authors find their argument unconvincing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation is likely to reconcile quantum mechanics and classical physics, questioning the necessity of classical underpinnings in chemical reductions.

Method: The paper employs theoretical analysis and critical evaluation to argue against the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation's classical assumptions.

Result: The study concludes that HLT's arguments are weak, possibly due to unclear distinctions or misunderstandings in quantum-classical theory.

Conclusion: The paper disputes HLT's claims, maintaining that the BOA's validity doesn't require classical assumptions, thus supporting chemical-reduction physics.

Abstract: Nick Huggett, James Ladyman, and Karim Thebault (HLT) have presented a
comprehensive article examining the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA). Their
central objective is to challenge our position on the matter-namely, that the
BOA incorporates a classical assumption incompatible with the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle. In contrast, HLT contend that the BOA involves no such
classical assumption and, as a result, supports the view that chemistry can be
reduced to physics. The purpose of this paper is to offer a critical analysis
of the HLT article and to clarify why we consider their arguments unpersuasive.

### [61] [Comment on "Properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12250)
*Rubén Gordillo,Ricardo Puebla*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses a research article where generalized squeezed states show unexpected oscillatory dynamics as their squeezing parameter increases. The authors in this analysis demonstrate that these oscillations are actually numerical artifacts and not genuine physical effects, pointing to issues with the truncation of the Fock basis, lack of convergence, and providing analytical proofs against the idea of intrinsic oscillations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about resolving a mystery in quantum mechanics regarding oscillatory dynamics in squeezed states, which is a significant topic as squeezed states have applications in quantum optics and metrology.

Method: Numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, including Taylor series expansion and Fock basis truncation effects.

Result: The oscillatory behavior is identified as numerical artifacts due to truncation errors and lacks convergence, leading to the conclusion that such behavior isn't physical and can't occur in finite squeezing parameters.

Conclusion: The oscillations observed in the generalized squeezed states are numerical artifacts and not genuine physical phenomena, and the average photon number of these states remains non-decreasing with squeezing parameter. The authors provide proofs to support their conclusion, emphasizing the need for careful analysis in handling high-order squeezing states.

Abstract: A recent article [S. Ashhab and M. Ayyash, New J. Phys. 27, 054104 (2025)]
has reported unexpected oscillatory dynamics in generalized squeezed states of
order higher than two as their squeezing parameter increases. This behaviour,
observed through numerical simulations using truncated bosonic annihilation and
creation operators, appeared in several properties of these states, including
their average photon number. The authors argued that these oscillations reflect
a genuine physical effect. Here, however, we demonstrate that the observed
oscillatory behaviour is a consequence of numerical artefacts. A numerical
analysis reveals that the oscillations are highly sensitive to the truncation
of the Fock basis, indicating a lack of convergence. This is further supported
by a theoretical analysis of the Taylor series of the average photon number,
suggesting that these generalized squeezed states contain infinite energy after
a finite value of the squeezing parameter. Finally, we provide an analytical
proof that the average photon number of any generalized squeezed state is a
non-decreasing function, thereby ruling out the possibility of intrinsic
oscillatory dynamics. We hope these results help clarify the origin of the
reported oscillations and highlight the special care required when dealing with
high-order squeezing states.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of scaling quantum devices while maintaining reliability through QEC protocols is a critical concern, making design automation essential for efficient implementation.

Method: The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of QEC design, divided into four main sections covering theory, design flow, recent advancements, and practical implementations via case studies.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of integrating automated QEC design into scalable quantum architectures to support practical fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) underpins practical fault-tolerant quantum
computing (FTQC) by addressing the fragility of quantum states and mitigating
decoherence-induced errors. As quantum devices scale, integrating robust QEC
protocols is imperative to suppress logical error rates below threshold and
ensure reliable operation, though current frameworks suffer from substantial
qubit overheads and hardware inefficiencies. Design automation in the QEC flow
is thus critical, enabling automated synthesis, transpilation, layout, and
verification of error-corrected circuits to reduce qubit footprints and push
fault-tolerance margins. This chapter presents a comprehensive treatment of
design automation in QEC, structured into four main sections. The first section
delves into the theoretical aspects of QEC, covering logical versus physical
qubit representations, stabilizer code construction, and error syndrome
extraction mechanisms. In the second section, we outline the QEC design flow,
detailing the areas highlighting the need for design automation. The third
section surveys recent advancements in design automation techniques, including
algorithmic $T$-gate optimization, modified surface code architecture to
incorporate lesser qubit overhead, and machine-learning-based decoder
automation. The final section examines near-term FTQC architectures,
integrating automated QEC pipelines into scalable hardware platforms and
discussing end-to-end verification methodologies. Each section is complemented
by case studies of recent research works, illustrating practical
implementations and performance trade-offs. Collectively, this chapter aims to
equip readers with a holistic understanding of design automation in QEC system
design in the fault-tolerant landscape of quantum computing.

Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers
remains a major challenge for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
tools running on classical computer hardware. This has motivated growing
interest in quantum algorithms for CFD to enable flow simulations on quantum
computers. The reason being that these computers are expected to deliver
potential speed-ups for certain problems. One promising quantum CFD approach is
a fully quantum implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method called QLBM.
Although efficient quantum routines are now available for the streaming step,
implementing the nonlinear, irreversible collision step with a low depth
circuit that avoids additional ancilla qubits, probabilistic post-selection and
repeated executions remains a significant challenge. In this study, we address
this challenge by introducing a framework for learning a surrogate quantum
circuit (SQC) that approximates the full Bhatnagar Gross Krook (BGK) collision
operator for the D2Q9 lattice. The four qubit circuit is trained to respect the
physical properties of the BGK collision operator, including mass and momentum
conservation, D8 equivariance and scale equivariance. When compiled to the gate
set used by IBM Heron processor under the assumption of full qubit
connectivity, the 15 block SQC requires only 2,430 native gates and uses
neither ancilla qubits nor post-selection or repeated executions. Moreover, its
depth is independent of the grid resolution, as collision is a local operation
that can exploit quantum parallelism to its full extent. We validate the SQC on
two benchmark flows, the Taylor Green vortex decay and the lid driven cavity,
demonstrating that it accurately captures vortex dissipation and flow
recirculation.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子信息中的类似约束问题提供了一种高效解决策略，具有理论和潜在应用价值。

Abstract: We show that $\varepsilon$-additive approximations of the optimal value of
fixed-size two-player free games with fixed-dimensional entanglement assistance
can be computed in time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$. This stands in contrast
to previous analytic approaches, which focused on scaling with the number of
questions and answers, but yielded only strict $\mathrm{exp}(1/\varepsilon)$
guarantees. Our main result is based on novel Bose-symmetric quantum de Finetti
theorems tailored for constrained quantum separability problems. These results
give rise to semidefinite programming (SDP) outer hierarchies for approximating
the entangled value of such games. By employing representation-theoretic
symmetry reduction techniques, we demonstrate that these SDPs can be formulated
and solved with computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$,
thereby enabling efficient $\varepsilon$-additive approximations. In addition,
we introduce a measurement-based rounding scheme that translates the resulting
outer bounds into certifiably good inner sequences of entangled strategies.
These strategies can, for instance, serve as warm starts for see-saw
optimization methods. We believe that our techniques are of independent
interest for broader classes of constrained separability problems in quantum
information theory.

Abstract: In this thesis, I studied a mathematical development to define and quantify
the uncertainty inherent in classical channels. This thesis starts with the
introduction and background on how to formally think about uncertainty in the
domain of classical states. The concept of probability vector majorization and
its variants, relative majorization and conditional majorization, are reviewed.
This thesis introduces three conceptually distinct approaches to formalize the
notion of uncertainty inherent in classical channels. These three approaches
define the same preordering on the domain of classical channels, leading to
characterizations from many perspectives. With the solid foundation of
uncertainty comparison, classical channel entropy is then defined to be an
additive monotone with respect to the majorization relation. The well-known
entropies in the domain of classical states are uniquely extended to the domain
of channels via the optimal extensions, providing not only a solid foundation
but also the quantifiers of uncertainty inherent in classical channels.

Abstract: Quantum devices require precisely calibrated analog signals, a process that
is complex and time-consuming. Many calibration strategies exist, and all
require careful analysis and tuning to optimize system availability. To enable
rigorous statistical evaluation of quantum calibration procedures, we leverage
statistical model checking (SMC), a technique used in fields that require
statistical guarantees. SMC allows for probabilistic evaluation of properties
of interest, such as a certain parameter's time to failure. We extend the SMC
for Processor Analysis (SPA) framework, which uses SMC for evaluation of
classical systems, to create SPA for Quantum calibration (SPAQ) enabling
simplified tuning and analysis of quantum system calibration. We focus on a
directed acyclic graph-based calibration optimization scheme and demonstrate
how to craft properties of interest for its analysis. We show how to use SPAQ
to find lower bounds of time to failure information, hidden node dependencies,
and parameter threshold values and use that information to improve simulated
quantum system availability through calibration scheme adjustments.

TL;DR: The paper investigates a method using symmetry-based dimension reduction to improve the practicality of the extendability-based semi-definite programming hierarchy for approximate quantum error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements in quantum error correction and their practical implementation by addressing computational complexity through symmetry reduction.

Method: Uses symmetry-based dimension reduction, combining noise symmetries and permutational symmetries, to reduce computational load while maintaining accuracy.

Result: Numerical examples demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method in analyzing small-scale quantum codes.

Conclusion: The study contributes to making theoretical quantum error correction more applicable in real-world scenarios by optimizing computational methods.

Abstract: We revisit the extendability-based semi-definite programming hierarchy
introduced by Berta et al. [Mathematical Programming, 1 - 49 (2021)], which
provides converging outer bounds on the optimal fidelity of approximate quantum
error correction (AQEC). As our first contribution, we introduce a
measurement-based rounding scheme that extracts inner sequences of certifiably
good encoder-decoder pairs from this outer hierarchy. To address the
computational complexity of evaluating fixed levels of the hierarchy, we
investigate the use of symmetry-based dimension reduction. In particular, we
combine noise symmetries - such as those present in multiple copies of the
qubit depolarizing channel - with the permutational symmetry arising from the
extendability of the optimization variable. This framework is illustrated
through basic, but already challenging numerical examples that showcase its
practical effectiveness. Our results contribute to narrowing the gap between
theoretical developments in quantum information theory and their practical
applications in the analysis of small-scale quantum error-correcting codes.

*A. A. Melkozerov,M. Yu. Saygin,S. S. Straupe*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores probability-based linear-optical methods for generating and manipulating more versatile entangled states than the typical GHZ states, which have fixed entanglement. The authors propose two new schemes for creating what they call 'GHZ-like' states with variable entanglement, which could be useful for scaling up quantum technologies. They demonstrate that these states can be used for resource-efficient quantum computing and communication by fusing them in different ways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of quantum technologies, particularly in quantum computing and communication, relies heavily on the generation and manipulation of entangled states. While some specific entangled states like GHZ states are well-studied, there is a need for more versatile states with adjustable entanglement properties to better suit various applications. The authors aim to address this gap by exploring methods to create such states using probabilistic entangling operations in linear optics, which is a promising area due to the scalability and fault-tolerance inherent in these systems.

Method: The authors introduce two methods or schemes based on modified 'fusion gates' within linear-optical setups. These gates allow for adjustable parameters, enabling precise control over the degree of entanglement in the generated states. The first method likely involves a step where the fusion gate is optimized for generation efficiency, while the second method might allow for variable entanglement by adjusting additional parameters such as photon inputs or gate operations. The specifics include modifying existing fusion gate structures to provide flexibility in both the generation efficiency and the entanglement characteristics of the GHZ-like states.

Result: The results indicate that these GHZ-like states with variable entanglement can be effectively generated and fused using the modified gate schemes. The analysis shows that the degree of entanglement can be controlled, and the generation efficiency is improved compared to traditional GHZ states. The fusion operations demonstrate the ability to combine multiple states with controlled entanglement, which opens up possibilities for scalable quantum computing architectures and distributed quantum communication networks.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that their proposed linear-optical methods for generating variable entangled GHZ-like states represent a significant advancement in the field. By providing more flexibility in entanglement control, these methods offer a promising resource for constructing scalable and efficient quantum computing and communication systems. The proposed schemes can be further optimized and integrated with current quantum technologies to enhance their performance and applicability in future quantum networks.

Abstract: Probabilistic entangling measurements are key operations in linear-optical
quantum technologies, enabling the generation and manipulation of
high-dimensional quantum states. While prior research has focused predominantly
on specific entangled states, notably graph states and
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, broader classes of states with
variable entanglement remain underexplored. In this work, we present a
linear-optical approach for generating and fusing GHZ-like states, which
generalize standard GHZ states to include variable entanglement degrees. We
introduce two schemes based on modified fusion gates that allow flexible
control over generation efficiency and the entanglement of the output states.
These results offer a promising pathway toward resource-efficient
entangled-state generation for scalable quantum computing and communication.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an excited local quantum annealing (ExcLQA) algorithm that extends local quantum annealing to find excited states by adding a penalty term. It outperforms the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in solving the shortest vector problem (SVP) up to rank 46.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of finding excited states of a Hamiltonian, which is critical for advancing postquantum cryptography.

Method: ExcLQA adds a penalty term to the cost function to target excited states and uses a hyperparameter for tuning. It maps the problem to finding excited states of a Hamiltonian.

Result: ExcLQA solves SVP instances up to rank 46 and outperforms Metropolis-Hastings in solved ratio, shots, and approximation.

Conclusion: ExcLQA is effective for finding excited states and offers practical advantages over existing algorithms.

Abstract: We introduce excited local quantum annealing (ExcLQA), a classical,
physics-inspired algorithm that extends local quantum annealing (LQA) to
identify excited states of classical Ising Hamiltonians. LQA simulates quantum
annealing while constraining the quantum state to remain in a product state and
uses a gradient-based approach to find approximate solutions to large-scale
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. ExcLQA extends this
framework by adding a penalty term in the cost function to target excited
states, with a single hyperparameter that can be tuned via binary search to set
the desired penalization level. We benchmark ExcLQA on the shortest vector
problem (SVP), a fundamental lattice problem underlying the security of many
postquantum cryptographic schemes. Solving an SVP instance can be mapped to
identifying the first excited state of a Hamiltonian, with approximate
solutions located among nearby excited states. Our results show that ExcLQA
manages to solve SVP instances up to rank 46, and outperforms the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in solved ratio, number of shots, and
approximation factor in the tested instances.

*Matilde Baroni,Dominik Leichtle,Siniša Janković,Ivan Šupić*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proves quantum soundness for Kalai et al.'s compiler for all multipartite non-local games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors propose a compiler for non-local games that eliminates the assumption of physical separation, converting them into interactive protocols with a single prover. While the quantum completeness and classical soundness are established, the quantum soundness was only known for bipartite games. The paper addresses this gap by proving quantum soundness for all multipartite games.

Method: The paper uses techniques from operator algebras, specifically showing that the correlations in asymptotic cases correspond to quantum commuting strategies. It generalizes previous results by characterizing sequential operationally no-signalling strategies as quantum commuting operator strategies in the multipartite case. They also introduce universal C*-algebras of sequential projective-valued-m Measurement (PVM) and establish a new chain rule for Radon-Nikodym derivatives of completely positive maps on C*-algebras, which is of independent interest.

Result: The authors successfully prove that the Kalai et al.'s compiler achieves quantum soundness for all multipartite non-local games by linking asymptotic correlations to quantum commuting strategies through operator algebra techniques.

Conclusion: This work extends the understanding of quantum soundness in the context of the compiler and provides a more general framework using operator algebra techniques, which could have implications for quantum information theory and game-theoretic models in quantum computing.

Abstract: Non-local games are a powerful tool to distinguish between correlations
possible in classical and quantum worlds. Kalai et al. (STOC'23) proposed a
compiler that converts multipartite non-local games into interactive protocols
with a single prover, relying on cryptographic tools to remove the assumption
of physical separation of the players. While quantum completeness and classical
soundness of the construction have been established for all multipartite games,
quantum soundness is known only in the special case of bipartite games.
  In this paper, we prove that the Kalai et al.'s compiler indeed achieves
quantum soundness for all multipartite compiled non-local games, by showing
that any correlations that can be generated in the asymptotic case correspond
to quantum commuting strategies.
  Our proof uses techniques from the theory of operator algebras, and relies on
a characterisation of sequential operationally no-signalling strategies as
quantum commuting operator strategies in the multipartite case, thereby
generalising several previous results. On the way, we construct universal
C*-algebras of sequential PVMs and prove a new chain rule for Radon-Nikodym
derivatives of completely positive maps on C*-algebras which may be of
independent interest.

Abstract: Two-dimensional planar ion crystals in a Penning trap are a platform for
quantum information science experiments. However, the low-frequency planar
modes of these crystals are not efficiently cooled by laser cooling, which can
limit the utility of the drumhead modes for quantum information processing.
Recently, it has been shown that nonlinear mode coupling can enhance the
cooling of the low-frequency planar modes. Here, we demonstrate in numerical
simulations that this coupling can be dynamically tuned by adiabatically
changing the rotation frequency of the ion crystal during experiments.
Furthermore, we show that this technique can, in addition, produce lower
temperatures for the low-frequency planar modes via an adiabatic cooling
process. This result allows cooling of the planar modes to sub-millikelvin
temperatures, resulting in improved spectral resolution of the drumhead modes
at experimentally relevant rotation frequencies, which is crucial for quantum
information processing applications.

*Davide Castaldo,Stefano Corni*

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的量子相位估计方法，通过压缩感知和信号分类方法，在极少采样率下同时估计多个特征值，且在Heisenberg极限下工作。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子相位估计是量子模拟的重要算法，提升其效率对实际应用至关重要。

Method: 论文指出使用断点压缩感知与信号分类方法，结合 Hadamard 测试，在少部分自相关函数采样下同时估计多个特征值，同时在强和弱相关性下都能达到Heisenberg极限，需要短时间实现高精度估计。还开发了一个改进的断点压缩感知协议，利用信号先验知识以更快更稳定地恢复。最后分析了算法在输入状态质量下的抗性。

Result: 数值证据显示该方法在强和弱相关下都能达到Heisenberg极限，可以在短时间内高精度地估计多个特征值。此外，改进的断点压缩感知协议在利用先验知识时表现更好。

Conclusion: 该算法提供了一种潜在的量子优势，尤其是在输入状态质量下降时仍能有效工作。

Abstract: Quantum phase estimation is the flagship algorithm for quantum simulation on
fault-tolerant quantum computers. We demonstrate that an \emph{off-grid}
compressed sensing protocol, combined with a state-of-the-art signal
classification method, enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple
eigenvalues of a unitary matrix using the Hadamard test while sampling only a
few percent of the full autocorrelation function. Our numerical evidence
indicates that the proposed algorithm achieves the Heisenberg limit in both
strongly and weakly correlated regimes and requires very short evolution times
to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate of multiple eigenvalues at once.
  Additionally -- and of independent interest -- we develop a modified off-grid
protocol that leverages prior knowledge of the underlying signal for faster and
more accurate recovery. Finally, we argue that this algorithm may offer a
potential quantum advantage by analyzing its resilience with respect to the
quality of the initial input state.

Abstract: We consider effects of artificial magnetic fields on the ground state of the
two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. Using an asymmetric Bose-Hubbard model, we
demonstrate that the frustrating hopping energy localizes bosons and enlarges
insulators and supersolid borders. We show these increments in the presence of
artificial gauge fields up to a symmetric point of the field. Moreover, our
calculations exhibit the real space modulations of the superfluid and
supersolid phases. The bosonic current exhibits vortices in these phases, which
their configurations depend on the commensuration between the magnetic field
and the lattice. Although the magnetic field breaks the translational symmetry
of the square lattice explicitly, this symmetry is restored in the Mott
insulator phase. The filling factor exhibits a checkerboard pattern in the
density-wave and supersolid phases, regardless of the magnetic field strength.
We explore thermal fluctuations and demonstrate the robustness of insulators
and SS phases up to temperatures comparable to the interaction energy, which
support the feasibility of observing such phases in experiments.

stage, future integration of other cooling stages, such as grey molasses
cooling, could further extend RL to the full preparation pipeline. Our result
highlights the promise of RL as a general tool for closed-loop quantum control

Abstract: Recent experiments have realized ultra-cold gases in twisted-bilayer optical
lattices. We show that interacting bosons in these lattices present a highly
non-trivial ground-state physics resulting from the interplay between inter-
and intra-layer hopping and interactions. This physics is crucially determined
by site clusterization, which we properly take into account by developing a
specifically-tailored cluster Gutzwiller approach. Clusterization results in a
large variety of different Mott-like phases characterized by typically
different occupations of the clusters, and in the appearance of pockets of
sites in between which particles can freely move, but which remain disconnected
from each other. This peculiar phase, which resembles the well-known Bose glass
phase, may occur even for commensurate twist angles and is further enhanced
when the twisting is incommensurate. Moreover, in the incommensurate case, the
formation of mobility islands may occur even without inter-layer hopping solely
due to inter-layer interactions.

Abstract: Field emission under ultra-fast intense terahertz fields provides a promising
approach for generating electron bunches with ultrashort pulse duration and
high charge densities. It is generally believed that the field emission current
described by traditional field emission theory increases dramatically with the
applied electric field. However, we conducted extensive field emission
experiments using quasi-single-cycle strong-field terahertz radiation at
various energy levels and different temperatures and observed an intriguing
phenomenon where the emitted charge reached saturation. A novel model is
proposed to interpret this phenomenon, which considers the contribution of
surface valence electrons and the dynamic replenishment of free electrons from
the bulk to the surface. The experimentally observed convex relationship
between the emitted charge and terahertz energy is consistent with the model
prediction, unlike the concave relationship derived from the traditional field
emission formula. In addition, another observed counter-intuitive phenomenon,
the inverse correlation between the cathode temperature and saturated emission
charge, is also well interpreted by the model. This work offers comprehensive
insights into field emission dynamics under ultra-fast intense fields, paving
the way for generating electron bunches with unprecedented temporal resolution.

focusing provided by an active-plasma lens, the witness is captured and
transported along the array without affecting its quality at the exit of the
plasma module. At the same time the driver, being over-focused in the same
array, can be removed by means of a collimator.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method using spatially dispersive metasurfaces to suppress reflection in dielectric slabs across a wide range of angles, even for thick slabs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from the limitations of traditional reflection coatings when dealing with thick or large-angle incidences, necessitating a new approach with broader applicability.

Method: The method involves creating nonlocal admittance sheets implemented as metasurfaces with grid impedance dependent on direction, utilizing spatial dispersion to achieve wide-angle reflection suppression.

Result: The result is that by using nonlocal metasurface coatings, reflection is significantly reduced across a broad angular range, even for thick dielectric slabs, validated through both simulations and experiments.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that this novel approach opens new possibilities for optically thin, easy-to-manufacture, and highly efficient anti-reflective coatings that work over a wide angular range.

Abstract: Any discontinuity of constitutive parameters along a wave propagation path
causes scattering. For a plane wave incident onto a flat dielectric slab,
reflection becomes strongly dependent on the incident angle as the electrical
thickness becomes large. This behavior limits the applicability of conventional
single- and multilayer anti-reflective coatings. Recently, inspired by the
generalized Huygens' condition, synthesized admittance sheets implemented as
metasurfaces with local response have been shown to remove reflection from a
dielectric slab in a wide range of incident angles, applicable, however, only
in the case of small optical slab thickness. In this work, we study plane wave
transmission through dielectric slabs with arbitrary thickness coated from both
sides by identical metasurfaces with nonlocal response, whose grid impedance is
angularly dependent (spatially dispersive). Nonlocality is shown to play a key
role in obtaining wide-angle reflection suppression in the case of optically
thick slabs. To validate our approach, we study a metasurface realization
composed of Interconnected Split-Ring Resonators that approximates the
predicted spatial dispersion law. As demonstrated numerically and
experimentally, such properly devised nonlocal metasurface coatings indeed
provide transmittance enhancement (and reflectance suppression) of thick
dielectric slabs across a broad range of angles, paving the path to optically
thin and easy-to-fabricate anti-reflective coatings efficiently operating in a
wide angular range even for optically thick dielectric slabs.

Result: They successfully model and analyze the coherent interactions, find stable conditions for SP pulse propagation, derive the modified area theorem, and discuss applications in quantum memory devices.

Conclusion: The study introduces a promising 2D platform for quantum memory and multimode integration, leveraging graphene's properties for coherent interactions of surface plasmons with atomic ensembles.

Abstract: We propose a 2D graphene structure containing atomic ensemble as a platform
for implementing nanoscale enhanced coherent interactions of plasmonic fields
with resonant atomic systems. We determine the graphene surface plasmon modes,
and the properties of its electromagnetic fields, and emphasize the role of
graphene sheet separation on the interaction with atomic systems for various
dipole orientations and positions between the graphene sheets. We analyze the
conditions for implementation of coherent interaction of SP mode with resonant
atomic ensembles. By solving the Maxwell-Bloch equations that govern the
resonant interaction of surface plasmons with atoms, we derive the modified
area theorem, which makes it possible to identify the most common nonlinear
patterns in the behavior of plasmons under the studied conditions. We obtain
analytical and numerical solutions of the area theorem, and find the
possibility of stable propagation of isolated SP pulses of graphene surface
plasmon modes at "fractional" pulse area values relative to $\pi$. We show that
the coherent dynamics of SP fields can be realized in nanoscale design and we
highlight the possibilities of using this scheme of coherent dynamics for
implementing compact multimode nanoscale quantum memory and its integration

TL;DR: The paper suggests using symmetry-broken Mie-resonators in photonic moire structures to achieve a giant Purcell enhancement. Localization of light can surpass conventional limits through this method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exploration is driven by overcoming the traditional challenges of light localization, possibly opening new avenues in quantum optics and sensing where high Q factors are essential.

Method: The approach involves breaking symmetry in finite arrays of resonators using Mie-tronics and employing twist to couple degenerate modes, resulting in increased Purcell factors.

Result:  successfully demonstrate a significant boost in the Purcell factor, indicating enhanced light confinement.

Conclusion: The method supports the successful enhancement of light confinement, expanding wave-based localization control in subwavelength systems.

Abstract: Localization of light requires high-Q cavities or spatial disorder, yet the
wave nature of light may open novel opportunities. Here we suggest to employ
Mie-tronics as a powerful approach to achieve the hybridization of different
resonances for the enhanced confinement of light via interference effects.
Contrary to a conventional approach, we employ the symmetry breaking in finite
arrays of resonators to boost the Q factors by in-plane multiple scattering.
Being applied to photonic moire structures, our approach yields a giant
enhancement of the Purcell factor via twist-induced coupling between degenerate
collective modes. Our findings reveal how finely tuned cooperative scattering
can surpass conventional limits, advancing the control of wave localization in
many subwavelength systems.

TL;DR: This paper explores how different adsorbates affect plasmonic energy transfer on gold surfaces. There are two main mechanisms: direct electronic transitions and inelastic scattering. The study shows that resistivity changes correlate with the efficiency of energy transfer, which is useful for understanding plasmon damping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the importance of understanding plasmonic energy transfer for applications in light-driven energy conversion. The role of adsorbates in this process is crucial yet not fully understood, prompting the investigation to uncover the mechanisms behind it.

Method: The study likely uses a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. They might have conducted UV-Vis spectroscopy, DC electrical resistivity measurements, and molecular modeling using DFT or similar approaches to simulate the interactions between plasmons and adsorbates. Tailor-made simulations would help in understanding the different damping mechanisms.

Result: The findings reveal two mechanisms: direct electronic transitions (BPT) and inelastic scattering (ATP, adenine, DDT). Both mechanisms contribute to plasmon damping and the DC resistivity changes, showing a strong correlation between the two.

Conclusion: The study concludes that adsorbates can mediate plasmon damping through distinct mechanisms, either resonant transitions or inelastic scattering. The correlation between energy transfer and resistivity changes suggests that resistivity measurements can be used to probe plasmon damping in various systems, offering a useful tool for developing efficient light-driven energy conversion devices.

Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures enable efficient light-to-energy conversion by
concentrating optical energy into nanoscale volumes. A key mechanism in this
process is chemical interface damping (CID), where surface plasmons are damped
by adsorbed molecules, enabling the transfer of charge to adsorbed molecules.
In this study, we investigate the relationship between CID and
adsorbate-induced changes in DC electrical resistivity for four molecular
adsorbates-adenine, 4-aminothiophenol (ATP), biphenyl thiol (BPT), and
1-dodecanethiol (DDT)-on gold surfaces. Our results reveal two distinct CID
regimes. BPT causes CID via direct electronic transitions to the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is centered at approx. 2 eV above
the Fermi level and can be resonantly excited by the plasmon. This mechanism is
dependent on plasmon energy. In contrast, ATP, adenine and DDT lead to plasmon
damping through inelastic electron scattering at the metal-molecule interface.
This regime shows a weaker dependency on plasmon energy since it does not
involve resonant electron excitation between hybridized metal-molecule states.
This same mechanism contributes to adsorbate-induced changes in DC resistivity,
suggesting that resistivity measurements can serve as a probe of plasmonic
energy transfer, as highlighted by the good correlation between the two
effects. These findings provide new insights into the microscopic origins of
plasmon damping and offer a unified framework for understanding metal-adsorbate
energy transfer.

Abstract: The existence of boundary states and their protection against
symmetry-preserving perturbations are a hallmark feature of topological
systems. While this concept originally emerged in the context of
sin-gle-particle phenomena in condensed-matter physics, particle interactions
have recently been identi-fied as alternative means to establish topological
phases. As a consequence, nonlinear topological insu-lators gained much
interest as a model system for many interacting particles. However, as their
mean-field model inevitably breaks down for small numbers of particles, to
date, topological states composed of only few interacting particles remain
experimentally largely unexplored. In our work, we explore the physics of
extended interaction-induced two-particle topological states, so-called
Dou-blons. We experimentally implement non-local-interactions via non-adiabatic
periodic driving and dimensional mapping in an artificial photonic solid. The
resonant formation of extended Doublon qua-si-particles at specific local
interaction strengths is observed, allowing us to probe the topologically
protected motion of these entities through the bulk of the system. Our approach
is compatible to a number of established experimental platforms and paves the
way for studying topological few-particle phenomena with finite interaction
strength.

Result: The chip achieves an end-to-end latency of under 100 ps, a low bit-error rate of less than 10-12, a 32-channel 1.024 Tb/s aggregate data rate, and a bandwidth density over 3.55 Tb/s/mm² while using under 0.38 pJ/bit energy efficiency.

Conclusion: The developed chip represents a significant advancement in energy-efficient optical interconnects, surpassing current state-of-the-art solutions and offering substantial benefits for AI systems requiring high data rates and low energy consumption.

Abstract: Energy-efficient high-bandwidth interconnects play a key role in computing
systems. Advances in silicon photonic electro-optic modulators and wavelength
selective components have enabled the utilization of
wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) in integrated optical transceivers,
offering a high data-rate operation while achieving enhanced energy efficiency,
bandwidth density, scalability, and the reach required for data-centers. Here,
we report the demonstration of a single chip optical WDM PAM4 receiver, where
by co-integration of a 32-channel optical demultiplexer (O-DeMux) with
autonomous wavelength tuning and locking at a near-zero power consumption and a
32-channel ultra-low power concurrent electrical detection system, a record
chip energy efficiency of under 0.38 pJ/bit is measured. The implemented 32
channel monolithic WDM optical receiver chip achieves an end-to-end latency of
under 100 ps and a bit-error-rate of less than 10-12 with no equalization,
pre-distortion, or digital-signal-processing, while operating at 1.024 Tb/s
aggregate data-rate on a single input fiber, the largest reported data-rate for
a WDM PAM4 receiver chip to date. The receiver bandwidth density of more than
3.55 Tb/s/mm2 corresponds to more than an order-of-magnitude larger bandwidth
density-energy efficiency product compared to the state-of-the-art optical PAM4
receivers for beyond 100Gb/s links. The chip, integrated using GlobalFoundries

Abstract: A key challenge in the development of materials for the next generation of
solar cells, sensors and transistors is linking macroscopic device performance
to underlying microscopic properties. For years, fabrication of devices has
been faster than our ability to characterize them. This has led to a random
walk of material development, with new materials being proposed faster than our
understanding. We present two neural network-based methods for extracting key
material parameters, including charge carrier mobility and trap state density,
in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells. Our methods require solely
measured light current--voltage curve and modest computational resources,
making our approach applicable in even minimally equipped laboratories. Unlike
traditional machine learning models, our methods place the final material
values in a non-Gaussian likelihood distribution, allowing confidence
assessment of each predicted parameter. We demonstrate these techniques using
fresh PM6:Y12 and degraded PM6:BTP-eC9 organic solar cells.

Abstract: Photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensors exhibit significant potential for
biomolecule detection due to their high sensitivity and low background noise.
However, their performance is severely constrained by the rapid recombination
of photogenerated charge carriers. This study innovatively introduces a
non-contact magnetic modulation strategy to suppress electron-hole
recombination by manipulating carrier spin states, thereby significantly
enhancing photoelectric conversion efficiency. Building on this mechanism, we
developed a novel magnetically modulated PEC biosensing platform based on the
MXenes/cobalt-doped titanium dioxide (Co-TiO2) heterostructure. This platform
achieved ultrasensitive detection of protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Compared
to an identical probe-modified biosensor without magnetic field application,
the developed platform demonstrated a 68.75% enhancement in detection
sensitivity and achieved an ultralow detection limit for PKA of 0.00016 U/mL.
It also exhibited a wide linear range from 0.005 to 80 U/mL. This research not
only provides a novel methodology for kinase activity analysis but also
pioneers the innovative strategy of magnetic modulation for enhanced PEC
sensing. It opens new avenues for developing high-performance biosensing
platforms, holding significant promise for early disease diagnosis and drug
screening applications.

images of the massive boson stars can be tuned via the initial parameter
$\phi_0$ and the coupling constant $\Lambda$. The absence of the event horizon
in the massive boson stars results in distinct optical image characteristics

Abstract: We present a short review of the analytical aspects of recent progress in the
study of black hole spectral instability and its potential observational
consequences. This topic, inspired by earlier foundational works, has attracted
considerable attention in the recent literature. It has been demonstrated that
both the low-lying modes and high overtones of black hole quasinormal spectra
can be substantially influenced by ultraviolet metric perturbations. The
temporal evolution of gravitational wave signals is primarily governed by the
first few low-lying quasinormal modes. In contrast, the asymptotic behavior of
high overtones is closely associated with the phenomenon of black hole echoes.
We review relevant studies on spectral instability in both regimes,
highlighting their potential to produce substantial observational signatures in
gravitational wave data. Additionally, recent proposals of Regge poles and
reflectionless modes as alternative stable observables for probing black hole
spacetimes are summarized.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores cosmic inflation under Myrzakulov Gravity in three different frameworks (metric, teleparallel, and symmetric teleparallel), deriving field equations and calculating observables like scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio. It also extends to F(R,T) gravity, showing how it interpolates between f(R) and f(T) models, providing a flexible framework to fit cosmological data with analytic estimates in the ns-r plane.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of inflationary models within different gravitational theories, aiming to generalize and unify various approaches to understand the early universe's inflationary dynamics and its cosmological implications.

Method: For each formalism (metric, teleparallel, symmetric teleparallel), the authors derive the corresponding field equations in a flat FLRW background driven by a scalar field. They compute observable quantities such as scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio. Additionally, they consider an F(R,T) gravity model, derive its inflationary dynamics, and explore how it transitions between f(R) and f(T) scenarios. Analytical estimates and schematic predictions in the ns-r plane are provided to demonstrate how parameters in F(R,T) can yield viable cosmological signatures.

Result: The results demonstrate the potential of Myrzakulov Gravity and its extensions to provide a consistent and geometrically motivated description of early universe inflation. Analytic estimates show that F(R,T) models can produce viable and distinguishable inflationary signatures, aligning with observational constraints from missions like Planck and BICEP/Keck.

Conclusion: By employing different geometric formulations, Myrzakulov Gravity offers a promising framework for studying inflation, with F(R,T) models providing additional flexibility in matching cosmological observations. This approach significantly enhances predictive power in understanding the universe's early evolution.

Abstract: We present a unified treatment of cosmic inflation within the framework of
Myrzakulov Gravity, exploring its realization in three different formalisms:
metric (curvature-based), teleparallel (torsion-based), and symmetric
teleparallel (non-metricity-based). For each case, we derive the corresponding
field equations in a flat FLRW background, study inflationary solutions driven
by a scalar field, and compute observable quantities such as the scalar
spectral index \( n_s \) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio \( r \). In addition to
these geometric sectors, we extend our analysis to the more general and
dynamically richer Myrzakulov \( F(R,T) \) gravity, which incorporates both
curvature \( R \) and torsion \( T \) in a unified action. We derive the
inflationary dynamics in this hybrid model and investigate how it interpolates
between pure \( f(R) \) and \( f(T) \) behaviors. The resulting framework
allows for enhanced flexibility in matching Planck and BICEP/Keck observational
constraints. We present analytic estimates and schematic predictions in the \(
n_s \)--\( r \) plane, demonstrating that appropriately chosen parameters in \(
F(R,T) \) models can produce viable and distinguishable inflationary
signatures. This comparative and extended study highlights the potential of
Myrzakulov Gravity and its generalizations to provide a consistent and
geometrically motivated description of the early universe, with predictive
power across different formulations of spacetime geometry.

Method: 使用爱因斯坦-史瓦茨-齐塔框架，在开空间k=-1的宇宙中，对数差分模型进行分析，应用理论到特定透镜物体SDSS J1004+4112中

Result: 在空间曲率负曲率且密度足够低的条件下，透镜效应与平直宇宙相似；当周期密度增加时，光弯曲和时延分别增加约1%和10%。

Conclusion: 结论认为，在空间曲率较大的情况下，尽管周期密度会影响透镜效应，但宇宙常数减弱了光弯曲，支持了Rindler和Ishak的主张。

Abstract: We analyze strong gravitational lensing by a spherically symmetric mass
distribution within the Einstein-Straus-de Sitter framework in a spatially open
Universe with negative curvature ($k = -1$). Applying the theory to the lensed
quasar SDSS J1004+4112, we identify a critical threshold for the current scale
factor $a_0$ of approximately $2.6 \times 10^{27}$ m, below which the effects
of negative spatial curvature on lensing observables become significant,
corresponding to a current curvature density of $|\Omega_{k0}| \gtrsim 0.0025$.
In particular, for $\Omega_{k0} = -0.15$, the light bending increases slightly
by about 1%, while the time delay exhibits a more substantial increase of about
10%. Beyond this threshold, however, the lensing observables are found to be
insensitive to the current scale factor and converge to those characteristic of
a spatially flat Universe. Importantly, our results indicate that, even where
spatial curvature would otherwise enhance lensing observables, the effect of
the cosmological constant remains present and acts to reduce light bending,
corroborating the claim of Rindler and Ishak.

Abstract: Addressing the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe, known as the
``dark energy problem'', remains a central challenge in cosmology. While the
cosmological constant is the standard explanation, alternative models such as
quintessence, phantom fluids, and Chaplygin gas have been proposed. This work
investigates the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model, which is characterized
by a polytropic equation of state. We explore this model within the framework
of an anisotropic fluid, by means of a metric that reduces to the standard form
of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime at cosmological
scales. To assess the model's viability, we derive analytical expressions for
the scale factor, the Hubble parameter, and the deceleration parameter.
Finally, the model is tested against observational data to constrain its
parameters and evaluate its consistency.

*Antonio De Felice,Shinji Tsujikawa*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Regular planar black holes with specific scalar fields are found to be unstable and not physically viable due to strong coupling and ghost/Laplacian instabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the stability of black holes under various conditions is crucial for testing their viability as physical objects.

Method: The study involved analyzing four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories using dimensional regularization and conformal rescaling of the metric to examine BH stability.

Result: The BHs with the specified scalar field profile exhibit instabilities, making them non-physical.

Conclusion: Such regular planar BHs cannot exist as stable, physically viable objects.

Abstract: In four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories derived via dimensional
regularization with a conformal rescaling of the metric, we study the stability
of planar black holes (BHs) whose horizons are described by two-dimensional
compact Einstein spaces with vanishing curvature. By taking an infinite sum of
Lovelock curvature invariants, it is possible to construct BH solutions whose
metric components remain nonsingular at $r=0$, with a scalar-field derivative
given by $\phi'(r)=1/r$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate. We show that such
BH solutions suffer from a strong coupling problem, where the kinetic term of
the even-parity scalar-field perturbation associated with the timelike
coordinate vanishes everywhere. Moreover, we find that these BHs are subject to
both ghost and Laplacian instabilities for odd-parity perturbations near $r=0$.
Consequently, the presence of these pathological features rules out regular
planar BHs with the scalar-field profile $\phi'(r)=1/r$ as physically viable
and stable configurations.

Conclusion: 论文得出引力磁电荷影响了能量提取，引入磁重连接机制可以同时解释喷射功率和辐射效率。

Abstract: We have studied the energy extraction from a Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole via
magnetic reconnections occurring in the plunging region. Our results show that
the gravitomagnetic charge suppresses the energy extraction process through
magnetic reconnection and reduces the corresponding extraction efficiency,
which is opposite to those of the black hole spin and the magnetization
parameter. Finally, we treat the energy extraction process through magnetic
reconnection as a mechanism to revisit the problem on the observed jet power
and radiative efficiency of GRS 1915+105. Our results show that the allowed
black hole parameter region originating from the jet power has an intersection
with the region from the radiative efficiency. This means that with this
mechanism related to magnetic reconnection the Kerr-Taub-NUT metric can
simultaneously explain the observed jet power and radiative efficiency for GRS
1915+105, which is not explained by other mechanisms in previous studies.

Abstract: We tested the thermodynamic properties of charged BTZ-type black holes (BHs)
in the framework of Bopp Podolsky electrodynamics, a higher derivative
extension of Maxwells theory that preserves gauge invariance while introducing
a massive photon mode. Using a perturbative approach, we derive first and
second order corrections to the metric and electric field, revealing how the
Bopp Podolsky parameter b modifies the geometry and horizon structure. Unlike
in four dimensional illustrations, where such corrections can lead to wormhole
solutions, the (2+1)dimensional case retains a black hole interpretation,
albeit with curvature dependent deformations that vanish asymptotically. We
compute the Hawking temperature via the Hamilton Jacobi tunneling method,
demonstrating its dependence on both the cosmological constant and the Bopp
Podolsky coupling. Our results indicate that while energy conditions are
marginally violated for certain parameter regimes, the BHs thermodynamic
behavior remains well-defined, with temperature corrections emerging from the
interplay between higher derivative electrodynamics and the lower dimensional
gravitational background.

*Navid Safarzadeh Ilkhchi,Amin Rezaei Akbarieh,Yaghoub Heydarzade*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: In this paper, the authors explore the thermodynamic properties of quadratic gravity in a D-dimensional FLRW universe by deriving field equations, effective energy-momentum tensor, and generalized Misner-Sharp energy. They analyze the thermodynamics of the apparent horizon, deriving equations of state for pressure, temperature, and radius. They determine critical points, critical temperature, and critical radius in terms of quadratic coupling and cosmological constant. They also evaluate thermodynamic quantities like Wald entropy, specific heat, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy to examine stability, revealing that quadratic terms alter stability conditions and lead to new thermodynamic behaviors compared to GR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the interest in exploring extended theories of gravity beyond general relativity, particularly quadratic gravity, in understanding the thermodynamic aspects of the universe, especially in higher dimensions. The study of thermodynamic phase transitions and stability in such models could provide insights into the nature of dark energy and the early universe.

Method: The authors used a structured approach, starting with deriving the field equations and effective energy-momentum tensor for quadratic gravity. They then applied these to calculate the generalized Misner-Sharp energy within an FLRW framework. By analyzing the apparent horizon's thermodynamic properties, they derived equations of state and identified critical points. They evaluated thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and specific heat to assess stability.

Result: The key findings include the successful derivation of thermodynamic quantities for quadratic gravity models, which differ from those of general relativity. The inclusion of quadratic terms significantly alters the thermodynamic stability conditions and leads to distinct thermodynamic behaviors, including new phase transition scenarios. Additionally, expressions for critical temperature and radius were obtained in terms of model parameters, providing concrete insights into the phase structure of quadratic gravity.

Conclusion: This paper contributes to the understanding of thermodynamic properties in quadratic gravity models, highlighting the role of higher-order terms in altering gravitational thermodynamics and phase transitions. These findings could have implications for explaining dark energy and the evolution of the universe, suggesting that quadratic gravity offers a promising framework for exploring beyond standard cosmological models.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic aspects of quadratic gravity
in a $D$-dimensional Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe.
First, we derive the field equations and the effective energy-momentum tensor
for quadratic gravity. Then, using these equations, we obtain the generalized
Misner-Sharp energy within the framework of this model. We consider the
thermodynamic behavior of the apparent horizon and derive the equations of
state related to the pressure, temperature, and radius of the apparent horizon.
Using the thermodynamic pressure, we obtain the critical points corresponding
to phase transitions. We determine the critical temperature and critical radius
in terms of model parameters, including the quadratic coupling and the
cosmological constant. We also examine key thermodynamic quantities, such as
Wald entropy, specific heat at constant pressure, enthalpy, Gibbs free energy.
By examining the behavior of these quantities, we can gain insight into the
thermodynamic stability of the quadratic gravity model. In particular, we find
that quadratic terms change the stability conditions and can lead to new
thermodynamic behaviors compared to general relativity.

Abstract: The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, based on the highly symmetric FLRW geometry,
has successfully explained a wide range of cosmological observations. However,
it faces unresolved issues, including CMB anomalies, the nature of dark matter,
and the matter-antimatter asymmetry. These challenges highlight the limitations
of the standard framework and raise questions about the validity of the assumed
isotropic background geometry. A natural direction is to explore more general
cosmological models that relax this assumption, potentially offering new
insights into these problems. In this work, we examine a geometric approach to
investigating the matter-antimatter asymmetry, grounded not in physics beyond
the Standard Model, but in the structure of spacetime itself. While related
questions have been raised previously in specific contexts, here we focus on
the Bianchi IX cosmological model, motivated by its relevance to early-universe
dynamics through the BKL conjecture and its potential role in generating
angular momentum via global rotation. We study the Dirac spinor field in this
background and derive the corresponding Dirac equation. Our goal is to
investigate how spatial anisotropies and rotation can induce spectral
asymmetries between particles and antiparticles. This paper lays the groundwork
for a follow-up study analyzing specific solutions and their physical
implications on matter-antimatter asymmetry.

### [105] [Hidden diffeos in the Hamiltonian formulation of a background independent field theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12184)
*J. Fernando Barbero G.,Bogar Díaz,Juan Margalef-Bentabol,Eduardo J. S. Villaseñor*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses a modification of the Husain-Kuchař model, examining a Hamiltonian formulation from a geometric standpoint. The modification involves constraining one field to be the exterior covariant derivative of a Lie algebra-valued function while keeping the connection as the primary dynamical variable. The key finding is that the model's gauge symmetries allow both internal and diffeomorphism transformations, which are important for understanding the model's invariance under such transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original Husain-Kuchař model is a significant 3-dimensional continuum model with gauge symmetries, originally describing the gravitational field. Exploring variations or modifications of such models could lead to a deeper understanding of their mathematical structure and physical implications, which is of interest in theoretical physics, particularly in areas like quantum gravity.

Method: The analysis is purely mathematical, performed in the context of differential geometry. The paper examines the structure of the model by considering the covariant derivative and its properties, likely delving into the Poisson brackets of the canonical variables to identify the Hamiltonian constraints associated with the gauge symmetries.

Result: The paper identifies that, despite the modification, the gauge symmetries still include diffeomorphism invariance as well as the internal Lie algebra-valued gauge symmetry. This result shows that the modified model retains key symmetries that are important for its consistency and physical interpretation.

Conclusion: The inclusion of diffeomorphism transformations among the local gauge symmetries suggests that the model can be interpreted as a type of gauge theory with both internal and spacetime diffeomorphism symmetries, potentially offering insights into quantization approaches and the connection between gravity and gauge theories.

Abstract: We analyze from a geometric perspective the Hamiltonian formulation of a
recent modification of the Husain-Kucha\v{r} model where, while preserving the
connection as a dynamical variable, the other field is restricted to be the
exterior covariant derivative of a Lie algebra-valued function. We prove that
3-dimensional diffeomorphisms can be accommodated among the local gauge
transformations of the model in addition to the internal gauge symmetries.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the hypothetical possibility that non-stationary glitch features
in the noise of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors could be produced by
small dark matter clumps that pass through the earth in the vicinity of
gravitational-wave detectors. We first derive the gravitational-wave strain
that would be generated by the passage of such a dark matter clump. We find
that the strain is primarily sourced by the Newtonian gravitational
acceleration of the mirrors toward the clump and by the Shapiro time delay of
the photons in the laser beams as they pass through the gravitational potential
created by the dark matter clump. We also find that the Newtonian acceleration
effect dominates the gravitational-wave strain for both ground and space-based
interferometers. We then compare our dark matter clump, gravitational-wave
strain model to 84 Koi-Fish glitches detected during the second observing run
of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
Bayesian analysis. We find that all glitches but 9 can be confidently rejected
as having originated from dark matter clumps. For the remaining glitches, the
dark matter hypothesis cannot be excluded, and the maximum \textit{a
posteriori} parameters yield minimum densities of about $10^{-7}
{\rm{g}}/{\rm{cm}}^3$, within the model. These results allow us to place the
first direct upper limits with gravitational-wave detectors on the local
over-density of dark matter in the form of clumps in the local neighborhood of
Earth, namely $\rho_{{\rm DM} \, {\rm clumps}} \lesssim 10^{-15}
{\rm{g}}/{\rm{cm}}^{-3}$.

Abstract: We present an all-sky search for long-duration gravitational waves (GWs) from
the first part of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA fourth observing run (O4), called O4a
and comprising data taken between 24 May 2023 and 16 January 2024. The GW
signals targeted by this search are the so-called "long-duration" (> 1 s)
transients expected from a variety of astrophysical processes, including
non-axisymmetric deformations in magnetars or eccentric binary coalescences. We
make minimal assumptions on the emitted GW waveforms in terms of morphologies
and durations. Overall, our search targets signals with durations ~1-1000 s and
frequency content in the range 16-2048 Hz. In the absence of significant
detections, we report the sensitivity limits of our search in terms of
root-sum-square signal amplitude (hrss) of reference waveforms. These limits
improve upon the results from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3) by
about 30% on average. Moreover, this analysis demonstrates substantial progress
in our ability to search for long-duration GW signals owing to enhancements in
pipeline detection efficiencies. As detector sensitivities continue to advance
and observational runs grow longer, unmodeled long-duration searches will
increasingly be able to explore a range of compelling astrophysical scenarios
involving neutron stars and black holes.

Method: 论文的方法是采用贝叶斯统计框架，并结合格拉姆-施密特算法来处理 hmm (拟合模的振荡频率和衰减时间)。具体的，他们使用格拉姆-施密特正交化处理基向量以降低模之间高度相关的问题，并且可以解析地积分掉振荡幅度参数，从而简化数据拟合过程。同时，与传统damped sinusoids方法相比，他们的方法减少了计算成本，使得多模态分析更为高效和可行。

Result: 他们在大规模的数值模拟中，验证了这种方法的有效性。通过对sxs波形库中的波形进行模识别，并与damped sinusoids结果进行对比，发现这种方法在准确性上有提升，尤其是在计算效率上更为显著。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过改进的贝叶斯分析框架和Gram-Schmidt正交化方法，为多振荡器模式在引力波信号中的应用提供了一种高效和可靠的解决方案，极大地推动了黑洞物理和引力波数据处理的技术发展。这种技术可以在更广泛的天体物理学研究中得到应用，如研究多质量比黑洞合并后的行为和后续的演化进程。此外，这种方法也为未来的精确参数估计和理论模型测试提供了实用的工具。论文为后续的高精度引力波数据分析提供了理论基础和方法学支持。未来，可以拓展该方法到其他天体物理问题，如中微子星的合并或更复杂的量子引力理论测试。

Abstract: The ringdown signal following a BH merger can be modeled as a superposition
of BH QNMs, offering a clean setup for testing gravitational theories. In
particular, detecting multiple QNMs enables consistency checks of their
frequencies and damping times, serving as a test of General Relativity -- a
technique known as black hole spectroscopy. However, incorporating additional
QNMs introduces challenges such as increased parameter correlations and higher
computational costs in data analysis. To address this, we propose an efficient
Bayesian analysis method that applies the Gram-Schmidt algorithm to the QNMs.
This reduces the correlation between the modes and enables analytic
marginalization over the mode amplitudes. We validate our approach using damped
sinusoids and numerical waveforms from the SXS catalog.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Hawking temperature of a charged Ads black
hole (spherically symmetric) on the basis of a completely topological method
introduced by Robson, Villari, and Biancalana (RVB). This topological method
can give the exact Hawking temperature of the charged Ads black hole. We have
also derived the Hawking temperature of a charged Ads black hole considering
massive gravity. Due to the presence of mass term in the metric function of the
charged Ads black hole in massive gravity, the effect of mass term can't be
neglected when calculating the Hawking temperature. In massive gravity, the
accurate Hawking temperature can be obtained by including an integral constant
term, which can be derived from the standard definition.

*Johanne Bratland Tjernshaugen,Martin Tang Bruland,Jacob Linder*

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that supercurrents can control spin lattice interactions and magnon gaps, enabling electric control over spins with minimal energy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors explore the use of supercurrents in controlling spin interactions, which is crucial for quantum applications like qubits and sensors.

Method: They use spin-polarized supercurrents and observe effects on the spin lattice, showing control over magnon gaps in different magnetic structures.

Result: The results show electric control over spin lattices and magnon gaps, which can lead to non-collinear ground states and alternative ways to study spin Hamiltonians.

Conclusion: This breakthrough allows for practical applications without energy dissipation, opening up new avenues in spin-based quantum technologies.

Abstract: Controlling magnetic interactions at the level of individual spins is
relevant for a variety of quantum applications, such as qubits, memory and
sensor functionality. Finding ways to exert electrical control over spin
interactions, with minimal energy dissipation, is a key objective in this
endeavour. We show here that spin lattices and magnon gaps can be controlled
with a supercurrent. Remarkably, a spin-polarized supercurrent makes the
interaction between magnetic adatoms placed on the surface of a superconductor
depend not only on their relative distance, but also on their absolute position
in space. This property permits electric control over the interaction not only
between two individual spins, but in fact over an entire spin lattice, allowing
for non-collinear ground states and a practical arena to study the properties
of different spin Hamiltonians. Moreover, we show that a supercurrent controls
the magnon gap in antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic insulators. These results
provide an accessible way to realize electrically controlled spin switching and
magnon gaps without dissipative currents.

TL;DR: This paper investigates a theoretical model with nested Fermi surfaces, interacting fermions, and Coulomb repulsion. The model without doping leads to an insulating, density-wave ordered state. Upon doping, a ferromagnetic phase is induced. The ferromagnetism isn't of the Stoner type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying strongly correlated systems to understand their phases and transitions, particularly influenced by nesting and Coulomb interactions.

Method: Mean field approximation and phase diagram construction.

Result: Insulating state with density waves and ferromagnetic phase upon doping.

Conclusion: The model provides an alternative mechanism for ferromagnetism, not relying on Stoner physics.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate a model with electrons and holes whose Fermi
surfaces are perfectly nested. The fermions are assumed to be interacting, both
with each other and with the lattice. To suppress inhomogeneous states, a
sufficiently strong long-range Coulomb repulsion is included into the model.
Using the mean field approximation, one can demonstrate that in the absence of
doping, the ground state of such a model is insulating and possesses a
density-wave order, either SDW, or CDW. Upon doping, a finite ferromagnetic
polarization emerges. It is argued that the mechanism driving the
ferromagnetism is not of the Stoner type. A phase diagram of the model is
constructed, and various properties of the ordered phases are studied.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding charge carrier behavior in semiconductors is essential for advancing quantum and nanoscale electronics. Current methods provide limited nanoscale insight, so this paper aims to overcome that limitation.

Method: Combined widefield optical microscopy with precision spectroscopy to observe charge carrier capture by NV centers in diamond. Simultaneous single-shot readout allows for detailed analysis over many individual centers.

Result: Measured high capture radii exceeding theoretical Onsager limits, achieved by neutralizing other charge traps. These results validate the new methodology for studying charge dynamics at a microscale.

Conclusion: This study establishes a new platform to observe and understand charge carrier dynamics beyond ensemble measurements, crucial for the development of advanced quantum and nanoscale electronic devices.

Abstract: Understanding the generation, transport and capture of charge carriers in
semiconductors is of fundamental technological importance. However, the
ensemble measurement techniques ubiquitous in electronics offer limited insight
into the nanoscale environment that is crucial to the operation of modern
quantum-electronic devices. Here, we combine widefield optical microscopy with
precision spectroscopy to examine the capture of photogenerated holes by
negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond. Simultaneous
single-shot charge readout over hundreds of individual NVs allows us to resolve
the roles of ionized impurities, reveal the formation of space charges fields,
and monitor the thermalization of hot photo-carriers during diffusion. We
measure effective NV- hole capture radii in excess of 0.2 um, a value
approaching the Onsager limit and made possible here thanks to the
near-complete neutralization of coexisting charge traps. These results
establish a new platform for resolving charge dynamics beyond ensemble
averages, with direct relevance to nanoscale electronics and quantum devices.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper uncovers an exotic localization phenomenon (anisotropic-scaling localization) in higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, which can arise from two primary mechanisms and co-exists with other states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge in condensed matter physics and quantum simulations, where understanding complex localization in higher dimensions is elusive. The study introduces a new phenomenon and provides mechanisms for its emergence, contributing to a better understanding of non-Hermitian systems.

Method: The research combines analytical solutions and numerical simulations to identify the localization mechanisms and competition between different states in non-Hermitian systems.

Result: The findings reveal a new type of localization (ASL) with distinct scaling rules in anisotropic systems, identified through two mechanisms: effective bulk couplings or 1D edge junctions. The competition with edge states is determined by the nature of their eigenenergies.

Conclusion: The work provides a framework for understanding and classifying higher-order non-Hermitian localization, resolving ambiguities in spectral and localization studies.

Abstract: Spatial localization of quantum states is one of the focal points in
condensed matter physics and quantum simulations, as it signatures profound
physics such as nontrivial band topology and non-reciprocal non-Hermiticity.
Yet, in higher dimensions, characterizing state localization becomes elusive
due to the sophisticated interplay between different localization mechanisms
and spacial geometries. In this work, we unveil an exotic type of localization
phenomenon in higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, termed
anisotropic-scaling localization (ASL), where localization lengths follow
distinct size-dependent scaling rules in an anisotropic manner. Assisted with
both analytical solution and numerical simulation, we find that ASL can emerge
from two different mechanisms of effective bulk couplings or one-dimensional
junction between different 1D edges, depending on how non-reciprocity is
introduced to the system. The competition between ASL states and edge
non-Hermitian skin states are further identified by their complex and real
eigenenergies, respectively. Our results resolve the subtle co-existence of
loop-like spectrum and skin-like localization of boundary states in
contemporary literature, and provide a framework to classify the intricate
higher-order non- Hermitian localization regarding their localization profiles.

Abstract: We theoretically study spin and valley transport in a TMDC/ferromagnet
heterostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field. We find that
microwave-driven spin pumping induces a valley-selective spin excitation, a
direct consequence of the valley-asymmetric Landau levels in the TMDC
conduction band. This process generates a pure valley current which, as our
central finding, exhibits pronounced quantum oscillations as a function of
chemical potential. These oscillations provide a definitive experimental
signature of the quantized valley states and establish a new pathway to
interface spintronics and valleytronics.

TL;DR: The paper models the propagation of impact energy in arrays of carbon nanotubes, showing they act as effective shock absorbers. The optimal performance is for nanotubes with 2.7-3.9 nm diameter, where energy is absorbed through structural deformation. Smaller and larger diameter nanotubes exhibit different behaviors related to energy accumulation and release.

Motivation: Understanding the behavior of carbon nanotube arrays under impact could have applications in materials science for creating more effective shock absorbers or in designing advanced composite materials.

Method: Simulation of nanotube arrays under impact loading to analyze energy absorption and force transmission.

Result: Nanotube arrays with specific diameters (2.7-3.9 nm) show enhanced energy absorption as effective shock absorbers. Smaller and larger nanotubes have distinct mechanical responses related to energy storage and release.

Conclusion: Carbon nanotube arrays are promising for shock absorption applications, with optimal results achieved in specific size ranges.

Abstract: The propagation of transverse impact energy in a multilayer packing (in an
array) of parallel single-walled carbon nanotubes has been simulated. It has
been shown that such nanotube arrays are effective shock absorbers. The
depreciation effect is most pronounced for packings of nanotubes with a
diameter of 2.7-3.9 nm. Here, part of the impact energy is absorbed due to the
transfer of the packing to a higher energy stationary state, in which part of
the nanotubes is in a collapsed state. The impact impulse reaches the other
edge of the packing most weakened and distributed over time. For nanotubes with
a smaller diameter, the compression of the array occurs elastically without
energy accumulation, and for nanotubes with a larger diameter - with energy
release.

Abstract: In this work we present a systematic in-depth study of how we can alter the
magneto-transport properties of magnetic topological insulator thin films by
tuning the parameters of the molecular beam epitaxy. First, we show how a
varying substrate temperature changes the surface morphology and when chosen
properly leads to a high crystal quality. Next, the effect of the chromium
concentration on the film roughness and crystal quality is investigated.
Finally, both the substrate temperature and the chromium concentration are
investigated with respect to their effect on the magneto-transport properties
of the magnetic topological insulator thin films. It becomes apparent that the
substrate temperature and the chromium concentration can be used to tune the
Fermi level of the film which allows to make the material intrinsically charge
neutral. A very low chromium concentration furthermore allows to tune the
magnetic topological insulator into a regime where strong superconducting
correlations can be expected when combining the material with a superconductor.

spectroscopy, we probe this interplay by measuring the charging energy ($E_C$)
and the pairing energy ($\Delta$) of individual nano-islands. Below a critical
island size, where $E_C > \Delta$, we observe a crossover between even and odd
parity ground states. By applying controlled voltage pulses, we continuously
tune the island's electrostatic potential and map the full charge-parity
landscape. These results demonstrate tunable superconducting ground states,
offering a potential platform for qubit design and control.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate hole spins confined in a gate-defined quantum
dot (QD) embedded in GeSn/Ge/GeSn quantum well (QW) structure. Owing to the
tensile strain in the Ge layer, the system effectively realizes a light-hole
qubit. We systematically study how various morphological parameters influence
the energy spectrum, g-factors, and the hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spin
bath. The simulations are carried out using a realistic, fully atomic
sp$^3$d$^5$s$^*$ tight-binding model. We also perform complementary DFT
calculations of wave functions near the atomic cores and use them to
parameterize the hyperfine-interaction Hamiltonian. We evaluate the Overhauser
field fluctuations and demonstrate that the strength of the hyperfine coupling
for the lowest hole doublet crucially depends on the Sn content in the barrier.
We highlight the conduction-valence band mixing, which leads to considerable
$s$-type admixtures to the hole states, providing the dominant channel of
hyperfine coupling due to the Fermi contact interaction.

Abstract: The interplay between localized magnetic moments and itinerant electrons
gives rise to exotic quantum states in condensed matter systems.
Two-dimensional moire superlattices offer a powerful platform for engineering
heavy fermion states beyond conventional rare-earth intermetallic compounds.
While localized and itinerant carriers have been observed in twisted graphene
moire systems, direct evidence of their strong coupling--leading to artificial
heavy fermion states--has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate electrically
tunable heavy fermion in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, achieved by
controlling the Kondo hybridization between localized flatband electrons and
itinerant Dirac electrons via a displacement field. Our results reveal a
continuous quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic semimetal to a
paramagnetic heavy fermion metal, evidenced by a crossover from logarithmic to
quadratic temperature-dependent resistivity, a dramatic enhancement of
quasiparticle effective mass, and Fermi surface reconstruction near quantum
critical point. This highly tunable platform offers unprecedented control over
heavy fermion physics, establishing moire heterostructures as a versatile arena
for exploring correlated quantum phases--including potential unconventional
superconductivity--in two-dimensional materials.

By automating background estimation, AMBER minimizes reliance on expert input, making neutron spectrometers more efficient and accessible. The method's potential for broader applications and its ability to handle various data types suggest its versatility in advancing research related to neutron scattering and material property analysis.

Abstract: State-of-the art neutron spectrometers enable simultaneous measurements of
high-dimensional datasets, allowing for a large collection rate of dynamic
material properties. In this paper, we present the Algorithm for Multiplexing
spectrometer Background Estimation with Rotation-independence (AMBER), which is
a segmentation algorithm designed to decompose measured neutron scattering data

advantage of the fact that background and foreground signals are measured
simultaneously during the data collection process, relying on rotational
independence of background contributions. The algorithm, initially developed
for multiplexing neutron spectrometers, aims to strongly reduce time consuming
expert input, therefore promoting full data set usage while minimizing the

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of thin ThF4 films for detecting 229mTh and using them as a nuclear clock medium. It suggests that adding 229Th enrichment can reduce background noise while maintaining signal level. The developed apparatus is now ready for direct measurements.

Motivation: The search for 229mTh and the development of nuclear clocks are important in nuclear physics and metrology, potentially contributing to more accurate timekeeping systems and understanding of radioactive materials.

Method: The experiment involved measuring photo- and radio-luminescence of thin ThF4 films in UV and visible ranges, comparing luminescence levels with PMT noise, optimizing film thickness and Th enrichment to reduce background noise, and developing an apparatus for direct measurements.

Result: The results indicate that thin ThF4 can be a viable target for 229mTh detection and a nuclear clock medium, with the ability to reduce background noise through enhanced 229Th enrichment. The apparatus is now ready for further testing.

Conclusion: The study supports the use of thin ThF4 films in 229mTh research and as a nuclear clock medium, with potential for practical applications in metrology and nuclear physics research.

Abstract: We conducted measurements on the photo- and radio-luminescence of thin
ThF$_4$ films in both the UV and visible ranges. In the UV range, we found that
both luminescences are at a similar level as the internal dark counting noise
of the photo-multiplier-tube (PMT). Our results suggest that thin ThF$_4$
crystals could be used as a target for the search for $^{229m}$Th and as a
medium for the future nuclear clock. The measurements indicate that using a
small and thin ThF$_4$ film can reduce background noise while maintaining the
signal at the same level, achieved by increasing the $^{229}$Th enrichment. Our
developed apparatus is now ready for direct measurements of $^{229m}$Th
excitation and decay in ThF$_4$.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel setup for detecting particles with higher precision than conventional detectors, using a SiC sensor and MMIC. They tested this system at a medical synchrotron and found it effective in monitoring high-flux beams with shorter time intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for precise monitoring of particle beams in medical physics, especially in high-energy environments like synchrotrons, driven by applications like ion therapy.

Method: Used a combination of a SiC sensor and MMIC to create a detector system capable of single-particle detection with high temporal resolution. Tested this setup at the MedAustron center.

Result: The setup showed significant improvements in detection speed and accuracy, enabling detailed analysis of beam intensity over very short periods.

Conclusion: This detection method is a reliable solution for high-flux beam monitoring, enhancing the effectiveness of ion therapy and other medical applications.

Abstract: Medical synchrotrons are often used for testing instrumentation in
high-energy physics or non-clinical research in medical physics. In many
applications of medical synchrotrons, such as microdosimetry and ion imaging,
precise knowledge of the spill structure and instantaneous particle rate is
crucial. Conventional ionization chambers, while omnipresent in clinical
settings, suffer from limitations in charge resolution and integration time,
making single-particle detection at high dose rates unfeasible. To address
these limitations, we present a beam detection setup based on a silicon carbide
(SiC) sensor and a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), capable of
detecting single particles with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) pulse
duration of 500 ps. At the MedAustron ion therapy center, we characterized the
spill structure of proton and carbon-ion beams delivered to the irradiation
room beyond the timescale of the maximum ion revolution frequency in the
synchrotron. The resulting data offer valuable insights into the beam intensity
at small time scales and demonstrate the capabilities of SiC-based systems for
high-flux beam monitoring.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着半导体制造对先进封装的需求增加，NDT技术面临挑战。传统的MFI方法依赖于FFT，忽略了涡旋电流和对齐问题，本文提出改进方案。

Method: 论文提出了一种名为Spatial-Physics Informed Model (SPIM)的方法，该模型结合物理建模和图像处理，包括磁场增强、图像对齐和磁场到电流的逆变方法。

Result: SPIM在提升I通道清晰度和减少Q通道模糊方面成效显著，还成功校正了图像旋转和对齐误差。

Conclusion: 通过SPIM，结合物理建模和图像处理，可以在实际应用中显著提升MFI在NDT中的效果。

Abstract: The development of advanced packaging is essential in the semiconductor
manufacturing industry. However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced
packaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of
the layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables
the imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective
in NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This
conversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for
magnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy
current effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we
present a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample
scanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy.
The SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by
aligning all the "sharp" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect
using both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii)
magnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment
of the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an
inversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by
integrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM
improves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%.
Also, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a
real image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial
analysis with physics-driven models in practical applications.

Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) is a promising material for radiation monitoring in
harsh environments, due to its low dark current, high breakdown voltage, high
thermal conductivity, and radiation hardness.~This work investigates a
SiC-based Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (LGAD), named SICAR, with a gain factor
of~2 to 3, under 80 MeV proton irradiation up to $1\times
10^{14}$~$n_{eq}/cm^{2}$. Electrical characterization via I-V, C-V, and
$\alpha$ particle injection reveals an increase in threshold voltage and a 2 to
4 order of magnitude reduction in leakage current, while charge collection
efficiency decreases by about 50\%. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and capacitance
deep-level transient spectroscopy (C-DLTS) were employed to characterize the
lattice structure and deep-level defects before and after irradiation.
Deep-level defect characteristics were integrated into TCAD simulations to
develop an electrical degradation model for SiC LGADs. A linear defect-flux
relationship is established in the model, showing agreement with experimental
results.

TL;DR: They discovered a new interaction between open-shell polar molecules that can suppress collisional loss by tuning collision rates with spin flips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores novel interaction mechanisms that can affect fundamental molecular collisions, which is relevant in fields like quantum physics and cold atom studies.

Method: The researchers performed laboratory experiments using calcium fluoride and other open-shell molecules, applying spin-flip techniques to observe collisional dynamics.

Result: The new interaction causes collision rates to decrease by a factor of ten million, as demonstrated in experiments.

Conclusion: This effect could lead to precise control over molecular collisions, useful for advancing quantum technologies and material studies.

Abstract: We describe a novel type of interaction between open-shell polar molecules at
sub-millikelvin temperatures. This hyperfine van der Waals interaction occurs
between two molecules in two rotational states that differ by one quantum.
Normally, this induces resonant dipolar interactions that lead to rapid
collisional loss. For specific hyperfine states, however, selection rules
prevent this. One can effectively turn off the dipolar interaction by merely
flipping a nuclear spin. The resulting van der Waals interaction can be
repulsive and can suppress collisional loss. We focus on laser-coolable CaF,
but show this effect occurs universally for open-shell molecules, including
MgF, SrF, BaF and YO. We propose that this effect could be measured by merging
molecules in optical tweezers, where flipping a spin in one of the tweezers
enables tuning of collision rates by five orders of magnitude.

Abstract: The single-centre convergent close-coupling approach to ion-atom collisions
has been extended to model collisions involving arbitrary multi-electron atoms
and partially stripped ions. This is accomplished by generating a set of target
pseudostates using the configuration interaction method. The resulting
pseudostates are expanded in terms of configuration state functions,
constructed using a hybrid of Hartree-Fock and Coulomb-Sturmian spin-orbitals.
This new approach is applied to study antiproton collisions with atomic carbon.
We present excitation energies, oscillator strengths, and the dipole
polarisability obtained using the target structure model to validate its
accuracy. Furthermore, we present results for elastic-scattering, total
excitation, and ionisation cross sections in the incident energy range between
10 to 1000 keV. State-resolved excitation cross sections for the first few
dominant transitions are also presented. Throughout the manuscript, we compare
results obtained using the multi-core target structure model with those from a
frozen-core one. In all cases, we find that a multi-core description of the
carbon atom target is essential for accurately modelling these collisions.

Abstract: We have directly loaded a cryogenic beam of molybdenum atoms into a
