The emerging technology enables the\nrecording of population activity in neurons, and the theory of neural networks\nis expected to explain and extract functional computations from the data.\nThermodynamically, a large proportion of the whole-body energy is consumed by\nthe brain, and functional computation of the human brain seems to involve high\nenergy consumption. The human brain, however, does not increase its energy\nconsumption with its function, and most of its energy consumption is not\ninvolved in specific brain function: how can the human brain perform its wide\nrepertoire of functional computations without drastically changing its energy\nconsumption? Here, we present a mechanism to perform functional computation by\nsubtle modification of the interaction network among the brain regions. We\nfirst show that, by analyzing the data of spontaneous and task-induced\nwhole-cerebral-cortex activity, the probability fluxes, which are the\nmicroscopic irreversible measure of state transitions, exhibit unique patterns\ndepending on the task being performed, indicating that the human brain function\nis a distinct sequence of the brain state transitions. We then fit the\nparameters of Ising spin systems with asymmetric interactions, where we reveal\nthat the symmetric interactions among the brain regions are strong and\ntask-independent, but the antisymmetric interactions are subtle and\ntask-dependent, and the inferred model reproduces most of the observed\nprobability flux patterns.

Unlike their odd\ncounterpart, the even isotopes of alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms possess\nsimpler structures and longer-lived transitions, which would relax the field\ncontrol requirements and enhance the frequency stability of the output light.\nHowever, due to the absence of hyper-fine interaction in even isotopes, the\ntransition from the state $^{3}\\mathrm{P}_{0}$ to $^{1}$S$_{0}$ is strictly\nforbidden, leading to a vanishing coupling strength between the cavity mode and\nthe atoms (the state $^{3}\\mathrm{P}_{0}$ as a dark state).

While few-femtosecond bunches have\nbeen demonstrated, achieving the control, stability and femtosecond-level laser\nsynchronisation remains critically out of reach. Here we demonstrate a concept\nfor laser-driven compression of high-energy (35.5 MeV) electron bunches with\ntemporal synchronisation to a high-power (few-TW) laser system.

In this work, we generalize this mapping to two and\nhigher dimensions by constructing a unitary equivalence between the\nparity-gauged fermionic system and a spin system defined on arbitrary\npolyhedral decompositions of space. Imposing the flatness condition on the\ngauge field yields a bosonization duality between the original (ungauged)\nfermionic system and a gauged spin system obeying a Gauss law. The dependence\nof the Gauss law in the spin system on the Kasteleyn orientation (and the\ndiscrete spin structure) of the fermionic system is made explicit. Applying\nthis bosonization to one or two copies of Majorana fermions on translationally\ninvariant lattices, we derive higher-dimensional analogs of KW (self-)dualities\nin spin systems arising from fermionic minimal translations.

As expected, water does not enter the polyethylene\nmatrix; it accumulates at its surface instead, without any preferencial\norientation. The additives studied exhibit remarkably different structures when\nthey are mixed with the polymer: two of them enter the polymer matrix to\nvarious degrees, either by intercalating their chains with the polyethylene\nones or by forming miscellar-like structures, while the third one stays at the\nsurface.

PhD thesis", "summary": "In 1994, Miguel Alcubierre proposed that the well-known special relativistic\nlimitation that particles cannot travel with velocities higher than light speed\ncan be bypassed when such trips are considered globally within specific general\nrelativistic frameworks, using a warped region of spacetime in the shape of a\nbubble that transports particles with mass traveling through spacetime with\nsuperluminal speed. Although initial results indicated this scenario as\nnonphysical, since it would seem to require negative mass-energy density,\nrecent theoretical analyses suggest that such a nonphysical situation may not\nalways be true. This thesis presents newfound solutions for the Einstein field\nequations, considering the Alcubierre warp drive spacetime metrics. The central\npremise is to study the fluid matter as the gravity source, rather than the\nmore common vacuum or negative energy sources, to explore the potential for\ngenerating superluminal velocities, or \\textit{warp speeds}, through a warped\nregion in the spacetime. Such solutions have various matter-energy sources:\ndust particles, perfect fluid, quasi-perfect fluid with anisotropic pressures,\ncharged dust, and a perfect fluid within a cosmological constant spacetime.\n  A connection between some of these solutions featuring shock waves described\nby a Burgers-type equation with a term on the right-hand side of the equation\npurely dependent on time is also shown. This could mean warp drives are closely\nrelated to vacuum energy and possibly have topological effects such as shock\nwaves."}

Quantum nonlinear\nspectroscopy (QNS) can access exponentially more types of correlations than its\nclassical counterpart, since the responses to ``classical forces'' correspond\nto contour-time-ordered correlations (CTOCs) that involve only commutators,\nwhile in QNS ``quantum forces'' from a quantum sensor induce responses\ncorresponding to CTOCs that involve both commutators and anti-commutators.\nSymmetries are important for constraining and analyzing nonlinear spectroscopy.\nQuantum and classical nonlinear spectroscopy have similar spatial symmetry\nproperties. QNS, however, is expected to have its characteristic non-spatial\nsymmetry properties since commutators and anti-commutators of physical\nquantities can behave differently under non-spatial transformations (such as\nexchange of operators). Here, we investigate how higher-order correlations\nextracted by QNS are constrained by non-spatial symmetries, including\nparticle-hole (C), time-reversal (T), and their combination, i.e., chiral (S)\nsymmetry.

A recent magnetotransport\nobservation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$.\n  We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a pair of\nancilla qubits on each site. Its mean field theory yields hole pockets of area\n$p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region\nof the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of\na background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of\nthe thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs.

A subclass of the GB code called bivariate bicycle\ncodes (BB codes) has garnered significant interest due to their compatibility\nwith two-layer connectivity architectures on superconducting quantum\nprocessors. However, one key limitation of BB codes is their high qubit\nconnectivity degree requirements (degree 6), which exacerbates the noise\nsusceptibility of the system. Building on the recent progress in implementing\nmultiple two-qubit gates on a single chip, this work introduces Louvre -- a\nrouting-based framework designed to reduce qubit connectivity requirements in\nGB codes. Specifically, Louvre-7 achieves degree reduction while preserving the\ndepth of the syndrome extraction circuit, whereas Louvre-8 further minimizes\nthe connectivity by slightly increasing the circuit depth. When applied to BB\ncodes, these two schemes could reduce the average degree to 4.5 and 4,\nrespectively. Crucially, Louvre eliminates some of the long-range, error-prone\nconnections, which is a distinct advantage over prior approaches. Numerical\nsimulations demonstrate that Louvre-7 has an indistinguishable logical error\nrate as the standard syndrome extraction circuits of GB codes, while Louvre-8\nonly incurs a slight error rate penalty. Furthermore, by reordering some of the\ngates in the circuit, we can reduce the coupler length without degrading the\nperformance.

This background is the accumulated\nsignal from unresolved sources throughout cosmic history and encodes\ninformation about the merger history of compact binaries throughout the\nUniverse, as well as exotic physics and potentially primordial processes from\nthe early cosmos. Our cross-correlation analysis reveals no statistically\nsignificant background signal, enabling us to constrain several theoretical\nscenarios. For compact binary coalescences which approximately follow a 2/3\npower-law spectrum, we constrain the fractional energy density to $\\Omega_{\\rm\nGW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.0\\times 10^{-9}$ (95% cred.), a factor of 1.7 improvement\nover previous results.

While most studies assume idealized vacuum\nbackgrounds, realistic extreme-mass-ratio binaries are embedded in\nastrophysical environments, such as accretion disks, stellar clusters, or dark\nmatter spikes, disks and halos, that can significantly alter the orbital\ndynamics. We explore bound geodesics around general-relativistic solutions\ndescribing rotating black holes surrounded by matter halos, for the first time,\nand map how environmental effects meddle with the spacetime symmetries of\nvacuum spinning (Kerr) black holes. In particular, we find that the loss of a\nCarter-like constant leads to geodesic non-integrability and the onset of\nchaos. This manifests through resonant island and chaotic layer formations\naround transient orbital resonances in phase space; features that are otherwise\ncompletely absent in integrable Kerr geodesics. Resonant islands, which are\nextended, non-zero volume regions in phase space, encapsulate periodic orbit\npoints. Non-integrability ensures that the periodicity of the central resonant\npoint is shared throughout the island's geodesics, thus effectively enhancing\nthe lifespan of resonances, beyond Kerr-based predictions.

We\nfind that for sufficiently small $\\alpha_1$, the metric function $f(r)$ becomes\nnon-monotonic outside the event horizon in spacetimes with one or two horizons,\nwhile in all other cases, $f(r)$ remains strictly monotonic. In the\nnon-monotonic regime, the radial effective potential develops a double-barrier\nstructure, allowing the emergence of multiple marginally bound orbits and\nmultiple branches of periodic orbits associated with the same rational number\n$l$. Although differing in radial structure, these orbit branches are\ntopologically equivalent. Remarkably, when the outer potential barrier exceeds\nunity, bound orbits with energy $E>1$ become possible, in addition to the\nstandard $E<1$ branches. When the peak reaches $E=1$, up to three distinct\nbound orbit branches may coexist. We also identify a novel eccentricity\nbehavior, the innermost branch becomes increasingly circular with increasing\nenergy or angular momentum, while outer branches exhibit greater eccentricity\nand a larger apastron-periastron separation.

In this paper, we\npresent numerical solutions to the BDNK equations for a $4$D conformal fluid in\nMinkowski spacetime constrained to the surface of a geometric sphere. We\nnumerically solve the underlying equations of motion by use of finite\ndifference methods applied in cubed-sphere coordinates -- a multi-block grid\nstructure which regularly and continuously covers the surface of a sphere. We\npresent three test cases of our code: linearized fluid perturbations of\nequilibrium states, a smooth, stationary initial Gaussian pulse of energy\ndensity, and Kelvin-Helmholtz-unstable initial data. In the Gaussian test case\nwith sufficiently large entropy-normalized shear viscosity, the flow, though\ninitialized in equilibrium, dynamically diverges away from equilibrium and the\nregime of validity of first-order hydrodynamics as very steep gradients form in\nthe solution, causing convergence to be lost in the numerical simulation. This\nbehavior persists at all grid resolutions we have considered, and also occurs\nat much higher resolutions in simulations of planar-symmetric ($1+1$)D\nconformal flows. These solutions provide numerical evidence that singularities\nin solutions to the BDNK equations can form in finite time from smooth initial\ndata.

This work opens new avenues for investigating quantum\nmatter with strong dipolar interactions and for quantum simulation of\nlong-range many-body systems."}

While\nentanglement is routinely observed for few-body systems, it is significantly\nmore challenging to witness in quantum many-body systems. Here, we\ntheoretically study entanglement between two parallel and spatially separated\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) partitioned along the longitudinal axis. In\nparticular, we focus on 1D Bose gases as a realization of TLLs and investigate\ntwo experimentally relevant situations: tunnel-coupled gases at finite\ntemperatures and after coherent splitting. In both scenarios, we analytically\ncalculate the logarithmic negativity and identify a threshold temperature below\nwhich the system is entangled. Notably, this threshold temperature is\naccessible in near-term coherent splitting experiments. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the crossover between quantum and classical correlations in the\nvicinity of the threshold temperature by comparing logarithmic negativity with\nmutual information. We argue that the initial mutual information established by\nthe coherent splitting is conserved in TLL dynamics, thus preventing certain\ngeneralized Gibbs ensembles from being reached during prethermalization.\nMoreover, both logarithmic negativity and mutual information are found to scale\nextensively with the subsystem's length. Although the ground-state entanglement\nbetween coupled TLLs has been predicted to be extensive, this setting is\nlargely overlooked compared to other partitions. Our work extends the study of\nentanglement between coupled TLLs to finite temperatures and out-of-equilibrium\nregimes, and provides a strategy towards experimental detection of extensive\nentanglement in quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures."}

Electrostatic biasing enables Stark tuning over a $\\sim$3\nmeV range, reduced photon bunching, and significantly shortened radiative\nlifetimes, yielding narrow emission with ratios of experimental to\ntransform-limited linewidths as low as $R\\sim55$. Most notably, two-photon\ninterference measurements reveal a Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility of\n$V_\\text{HOM}\\sim $10$\\%$, and up to $V_\\text{HOM}\\sim$ 40$\\%$ with\npost-selection by temporal filtering, representing the highest reported\nindistinguishability for any TMD quantum emitters and the first such\ndemonstration in the near-infrared regime.
