### [1] [Stabilizing ergotropy in Spin-Chain Quantum Batteries via Energy-Invariant Catalysis under Strong Non-Markovian Coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02772)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究利用量子催化抑制量子电池的无储能振荡，通过非马尔可夫主方程模拟，发现增强催化剂与自旋、能级或腔频率 coupling可抑制振荡，但过强的催化剂可能导致不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能源存储效率的提升是当前研究热点。通过量子催化来优化量子电池性能，尤其是在强耦合下，是一个有挑战性的研究方向。

Method: 采用了Nakajima-Zwanzig类型的非马尔可夫主方程，模拟不同物理参数下的演化的ergotropy。

Result: 增强催化剂与自旋、能级或腔频率 coupling有效抑制了ergotropy的振荡，处于准平稳状态。但过强的催化剂可能导致不稳定。

Conclusion: 量子催化在一阶强耦合理论模型下可优化量子电池。

Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs) have emerged as promising platforms for microscale
energy storage, yet most existing studies assume weak system-environment
coupling and Markovian dynamics. Here we explore how physical catalysis can
regulate the maximum extractable work (ergotropy) of a spin-chain QB strongly
coupled to a cavity environment. We model the system using a
Nakajima-Zwanzig-type non-Markovian master equation and simulate the time
evolution of ergotropy under various physical parameters. Our results show that
increasing the catalyst-spin coupling, spin energy or cavity frequency can
effectively suppress ergotropy oscillations and yield quasi-stationary
ergotropy regime, while overly strong catalyst, especially when accompanied by
increasing system-environment coupling under such conditions, can destabilize
work extraction. This study demonstrates how quantum catalysis can serve as a
control knob for optimizing battery performance in strongly coupled
non-Markovian regimes.

### [2] [Heating suppression via two-rate random and quasiperiodic drive protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02783)
*Krishanu Ghosh,Sayan Choudhury,Diptiman Sen,K. Sengupta*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates thermalization in driven quantum systems, particularly a one-dimensional non-integrable spin chain with two distinct protocols. RCP and QP protocols with two driving frequencies show significant slowing of thermalization due to two-rate induced dynamical freezing. For fixed duration perturbations, an exact analytical explanation is provided. Quasiperiodic drives, especially Thue-Morse, lead to different thermalization rates compared to Fibonacci sequences. The study offers semi-analytic understanding and suggests experimental tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how drive protocols affect thermalization in quantum systems is crucial for developing efficient cooling and control methods in quantum devices. This paper explores the effects of two-frequency protocols on thermalization, particularly in 1D spin chains, aiming to find optimal protocols for reducing heat accumulation. The findings could have implications for quantum simulations and technologies where precise control and thermal management are essential.

Method: The authors study both random and quasiperiodically driven systems with two distinct protocols. They use numerical simulations, exact diagonalization for small systems, and perturbative analysis for large drives. Thermalization dynamics are analyzed using tools like density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and exact calculations for small systems. Dynamical freezing and its impact on thermalization rates are the central methods used.

Result: Two-frequency protocols, especially driven with fixed durations and quasiperiodic sequences like Thue-Morse, lead to drastic slowing of thermalization due to dynamical freezing. Analytical and numerical results show that adjusting the perturbation amplitude can control the thermalization rate and that quasiperiodic sequences affect thermalization differently compared to other protocols. Experimental setups are proposed to test the theory, opening up avenues for practical applications in quantum systems control.

Conclusion: The research highlights the role of two-frequency protocols in significantly slowing thermalization in driven quantum systems. The findings provide analytical explanations for the observed phenomena and suggest that quasiperiodic drives, particularly Thue-Morse, could offer advantages in slowing thermalization compared to other protocols. The study offers both theoretical insights and practical implications for controlling thermalization in quantum systems, paving the way for future experimental implementations and potential applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: We study a random and quasiperiodically driven one-dimensional non-integrable
PXP spin chain in a magnetic field for two distinct drive protocols. Each of
these protocols involves square pulses with two driving frequencies which are
integer multiples of each other. For the first class of protocols, the duration
of the pulse is changed randomly by an amplitude $dT$ while for the second
class we use a random/quasiperiodic dipolar drive, where the quasiperiodicity
is implemented using the Thue-Morse (TM) or Fibonacci sequences. For both
protocols, we identify parameter regimes for which the thermalization of the
driven chain is drastically slowed down due to proximity to a two-rate drive
induced exact dynamical freezing. We also study the properties of these driven
system moving slightly away from the freezing limit. For the first type of
protocols, we show the existence of special value of $dT$ for which the
thermalization rate remains small and provide an analytic explanation for such
slow thermalization. For the second class of protocols, in contrast to
random/quasiperiodic drives involving a single frequency studied earlier, we
find that the TM quasiperiodic drive leads to a distinctly slower
thermalization than that for drive protocols which are either periodic or
follow a random or quasiperiodic Fibonacci sequence. We provide a qualitative
semi-analytic understanding of these phenomena either using an exact
calculation for small system sizes or carrying out a perturbative analysis in
the large drive-amplitude limit. Our analysis brings out the central role of
such two-frequency protocols in the reduction of heating in driven quantum
systems. We discuss experiments which can test our theory.

### [3] [Measurement-Induced Entanglement in Conformal Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02788)
*Kabir Khanna,Romain Vasseur*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究测量对量子临界态中纠缠的影响，发现测量互信息（MIE）是泛型的、共形不变的，并与CFT的算符内容有关。使用复制技巧计算准确结果，与矩阵乘积态计算吻合良好。测量的纠缠与强制测量结果不同，可以解释成对共形不变的边界条件进行波 Born 平均。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子系统中的测量对纠缠的影响是一个前沿问题，特别是在量子临界态中。因为测量通常是被近似为设置测量结果，而实际的情况却更高复杂，所以研究测量互信息具有重要的理论意义和潜在的应用价值。

Method: 在研究中，我们关注了 Tomonaga-Luttinger 液体这个1+1维量子临界态的家族，其_low_能量行为可以用紧致自由boson的共形场论(CFT)来描述。通过测量局部电荷算符，我们使用复制技巧来处理测量结果的随机性，并计算了测量互信息的精确结果。此外，我们还通过矩阵乘积态计算进行了验证，结果吻合良好。

Result: 我们的研究结果表明，测量互信息（MIE）在 Tomonaga-Luttinger 液体中是普遍适用的，且与共形场论的算符内容有关。通过复制技巧，我们精确计算了 MIE 的值，结果显示与矩阵乘积态计算结果高度一致。此外，测量导致的纠缠与强制测量结果不同，可以用 Born 平均的方式理解为对共形不变的边界条件进行波函数平均。

Conclusion: 这项研究为理解测量对量子临界态中纠缠的影响提供了一个理论框架和精确的计算方法。通过分析 Tomonaga-Luttinger 液体这一广泛的经典系统，我们揭示了测量互信息的泛型性和共形对称性，为更复杂的量子系统研究提供了启示。

Abstract: Local measurements can radically reshape patterns of many-body entanglement,
especially in long-range entangled quantum-critical states. Yet, analytical
results addressing the effects of measurements on many-body states remain
scarce, and measurements are often approximated as forcing specific measurement
outcomes. We study measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) in Tomonaga-Luttinger
liquids, a broad family of 1+1d quantum critical states described at low
energies by compact free boson conformal field theories (CFT). Measuring the
local charge operator, we show that the MIE is entirely universal, conformally
invariant, and depends on the operator content of the CFT. Using a
replica-trick to address the randomness of the measurement outcomes, we compute
the MIE exactly for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, in very good agreement with
matrix-product state calculations. We show that the MIE for physical quantum
measurements is fundamentally different from the entanglement induced by
forcing measurement outcomes, and has a natural interpretation in terms of Born
averaging over conformally-invariant boundary conditions.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Because it is easily switched from insulator to metal either via chemical
doping or electrical gating, silicon is at the core of modern information
technology and remains a candidate platform for quantum computing. The
metal-to-insulator transition in this material has therefore been one of the
most studied phenomena in condensed matter physics, and has been revisited with
considerable profit each time a new fabrication technology has been introduced.
Here we take advantage of recent advances in creating ultra-thin layers of
Bohr-atom-like dopants to realize the two-dimensional disordered Hubbard model
at half-filling and its metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) as a function of
mean distance between atoms. We use gas-phase dosing of dopant precursor
molecules on silicon to create arsenic and phosphorus $\delta$-layers as thin
as 0.4~nm and as dilute as 10$^{13}$~cm$^{-2}$. On approaching the insulating
state, the conventional weak localization effects, prevalent at high dopant
densities and due to orbital motion of the electrons in the plane, become
dominated by electron-electron interaction contributions which obey a
paramagnetic Zeeman scaling law. The latter make a negative contribution to the
conductance, and thus cannot be interpreted in terms of an emergent Kondo
regime near the MIT.

### [6] [Quantum algorithm for linear matrix equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02822)
*Rolando D. Somma,Guang Hao Low,Dominic W. Berry,Ryan Babbush*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient quantum algorithm to solve the Sylvester equation, which is a quantum version designed to leverage block-encoding, offering significant speed improvements over classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The interest in developing faster quantum algorithms for solving matrix equations stems from their applications in various fields like control theory and physics, making this research particularly valuable.

Method: The approach uses block-encoding of the solution matrix X, rescaling it to achieve faster query and gate complexities dependent on the condition number, dimension, and error inverse.

Result: The algorithm achieves almost linear query and gate complexities, solving BQP-complete problems efficiently, highlighting its potential impact in quantum computing applications.

Conclusion: The research offers a novel quantum method for solving Sylvester equations with enhanced efficiency, suggesting promising applications and future research directions.

Abstract: We describe an efficient quantum algorithm for solving the linear matrix
equation AX+XB=C, where A, B and C are given complex matrices and X is unknown.
This is known as the Sylvester equation, a fundamental equation with
applications in control theory and physics. Rather than encoding the solution
in a quantum state in a fashion analogous to prior quantum linear algebra
solvers, our approach constructs the solution matrix X in a block-encoding,
rescaled by some factor. This allows us to obtain certain properties of the
entries of X exponentially faster than would be possible from preparing X as a
quantum state. The query and gate complexities of the quantum circuit that
implements this block-encoding are almost linear in a condition number that
depends on A and B, and depend logarithmically in the dimension and inverse
error. We show how our quantum circuits can solve BQP-complete problems
efficiently, discuss potential applications and extensions of our approach, its
connection to Riccati equation, and comment on open problems.

### [7] [Characterizing and Mitigating Flux Crosstalk in Superconducting Qubits-Couplers System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03434)
*Chen-Hsun Ma,Myrron Albert Callera Aguila,Nien-Yu Li,Li-Chieh Hsiao,Yi-Shiang Huang,Yen-Chun Chen,Teik-Hui Lee,Chin-Chia Chang,Jyh-Yang Wang,Ssu-Yen Huang,Hsi-Sheng Goan,Chiao-Hsuan Wang,Cen-Shawn Wu,Chii-Dong Chen,Chung-Ting Ke*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Superconducting qubits have seen significant improvements in gate fidelity, surpassing the error-correction threshold. The study addresses flux crosstalk in multiqubit systems by introducing a cancellation matrix method, reducing crosstalk from 56.5‰ to 0.13‰, enhancing gate performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superconducting qubits are a cornerstone of quantum computing, and improving their fidelity and reducing crosstalk is crucial for scaling quantum processors.

Method: The researchers developed and applied a cancellation matrix method to suppress flux crosstalk, achieving substantial reductions in cross-talk levels.

Result: The method successfully reduced flux cross-talk from 56.5 to 0.13‰, improving gate error rates and measurement accuracy.

Conclusion: This approach offers a promising solution for managing flux crosstalk, paving the way for more robust and scalable quantum computing systems.

Abstract: Superconducting qubits have achieved exceptional gate fidelities, exceeding
the error-correction threshold in recent years. One key ingredient of such
improvement is the introduction of tunable couplers to control the
qubit-to-qubit coupling through frequency tuning. Moving toward fault-tolerant
quantum computation, increasing the number of physical qubits is another step
toward effective error correction codes. Under a multiqubit architecture, flux
control (Z) lines are crucial in tuning the frequency of the qubits and
couplers. However, dense flux lines result in magnetic flux crosstalk, wherein
magnetic flux applied to one element inadvertently affects neighboring qubits
or couplers. This crosstalk obscures the idle frequency of the qubit when flux
bias is applied, which degrades gate performance and calibration accuracy. In
this study, we characterize flux crosstalk and suppress it in a
multiqubit-coupler chip with multi-Z lines without adding additional readout
for couplers. By quantifying the mutual flux-induced frequency shifts of qubits
and couplers, we construct a cancellation matrix that enables precise
compensation of non-local flux, demonstrating a substantial reduction in Z-line
crosstalk from 56.5$\,$permille$\,$to 0.13$\,$permille$\,$ which is close to
statistical error. Flux compensation corrects the CZ SWAP measurement, leading
to a symmetric map with respect to flux bias. Compared with a crosstalk-free
calculated CZ SWAP map, the measured map indicates that our approach provides a
near-zero crosstalk for the coupler-transmon system. These results highlight
the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing flux crosstalk-free control and
supporting its potential for scaling superconducting quantum processors.

*Giuseppe De Riso,Giuseppe Catalano,Seth Lloyd,Vittorio Giovannetti,Dario De Santis*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新量子RAM架构，显著降低了资源需求，同时保留了最优查询复杂度。新方法基于简单的重复操作块，利用局部单元操作和简短距离量子行走，简化了实验要求，提高了可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算的快速发展，高效的数据存储和检索对于量子算法的加速至关重要，然而现有的量子RAM方案资源消耗过大且依赖于超出现有硬件能力的操作，无法实际实现。因此，探索更高效、更实用的量子RAM架构成为研究方向。

Method: 研究提出了一种基于简单重复操作块的新架构，该块仅依赖于局部单元操作和有限数量量子行走之间的短距离相互作用，采用一种二叉树结构。

Result: 实验表明，与现有方案相比，该方案在资源消耗和操作复杂性上表现更优，且架构更具扩展性。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子存储技术的发展提供了新的方向，未来可能进一步优化资源利用和扩展性，为量子计算的实际应用奠定基础。

Abstract: Efficient and coherent data retrieval and storage are essential for
harnessing quantum algorithms' speedup. Such a fundamental task is addressed by
a quantum Random Access Memory (qRAM). Despite their promising scaling
properties, current qRAM proposals demand excessive resources and rely on
operations beyond the capabilities of current hardware requirements, rendering
their practical realization inefficient. We introduce a novel architecture that
significantly reduces resource requirements while preserving optimal complexity
scaling for quantum queries. Moreover, unlike previous proposals, our algorithm
design leverages a simple, repeated operational block based exclusively on
local unitary operations and short-range interactions between a limited number
of quantum walkers traveling over a single binary tree. This novel approach not
only simplifies experimental requirements by reducing the complexity of
necessary operations but also enhances the architecture's scalability by
ensuring a resource-efficient, modular design that maintains optimal quantum
query performance.

*İlker Polat,Ramon W. J. Overwater,Maximilian Rimbach-Russ,Fabio Sebastiano*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces DLR to suppress leakage in baseband control of spin qubits, improving CZ gate fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing faces the challenge of increasing qubit coherence times, particularly for operations affected by leakage. This paper addresses the limitation of DRAG requiring RF signals, instead proposing DLR for baseband control.

Method: The method involves time-delayed repetitions of control signals to target leakage suppression at specific frequencies, enabling high-fidelity operations without needing radio-frequency modulation.

Result: Achieves 99.9% fidelity within 9.4 ns for a 100 MHz frequency difference.

Conclusion: DLR opens a new path for implementing leakage-suppressed quantum control in baseband systems.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in quantum computing is to increase the number of
operations within the qubit coherence time. While this can be achieved by
decreasing the gate duration, the use of shorter signals increases their
bandwidth and can cause leakage into energetically separated states. A common
method to suppress leakage for short pulses is the Derivative Removal by
Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) method, which however, relies on IQ modulation of
radio-frequency (RF) signals, thus cannot be applied to the baseband signals,
e.g., for semiconductor spin qubits. This paper proposes a novel technique,
Delayed Leakage Reduction (DLR), that suppresses leakage at targeted
frequencies even for baseband control by using time-delayed repetitions of the
control signal to enable rapid, high-fidelity operations. We apply DLR on the
adiabatic CZ gate between two spin qubits and achieve fidelities exceeding
99.9% within 9.4 ns for a resonance frequency difference of only 100 MHz.
Towards the experimental realization of the proposed control method, we also
assess the impact on the fidelity of the sampling rate of the electronic
hardware generating the control pulse, thus setting the minimum hardware
requirements for any experimental demonstration.

*Christopher Mastandrea,Costin Iancu,Hao Guo,Chih-Chun Chien*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the quantized Uhlmann phase in a spin-1 system and demonstrates its observation on NISQ computers after optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates a topological phase phenomenon in quantum systems, specifically focusing on the Uhlmann phase, which is a geometric phase in quantum mechanics. The observation of such phases on NISQ hardware would contribute to our understanding of quantum topology and resource usage for future quantum computing.

Method: The authors propose a quantum circuit using system, ancilla, and probe qubits. The circuit prepares a state related to the spin-1 system, performs the Uhlmann process, and measures the phase via a probe qubit's expectation values. They then use Qiskit and BQSQit for optimizations to reduce the gate count, improving the feasibility for NISQ hardware simulation. They test their approach on IBM's upgraded quantum computers.

Result: The optimized circuit shows improved signal visibility of the Uhlmann phase, with the noise being reduced and clearer phase jumps observed. IBM's enhanced quantum computers provide better signal clarity, demonstrating the feasibility of observing finite-temperature topological phenomena on NISQ devices.

Conclusion: This research not only progresses our understanding of geometric phases in quantum systems but also validates the potential of NISQ hardware for studying complex topological phases, setting a foundation for future quantum topology research and practical applications in quantum computing.

Abstract: A spin-1 system can exhibit an intermediate-temperature topological regime
with a quantized Uhlmann phase sandwiched by topologically trivial low- and
high-temperature regimes. We present a quantum circuit consisting of system and
ancilla qubits plus a probe qubit which prepares an initial state corresponding
to the purified state of a spin-1 system at finite temperature, evolves the
system according to the Uhlmann process, and measures the Uhlmann phase via
expectation values of the probe qubit. Although classical simulations suggest
the quantized Uhlmann phase is observable on IBM's noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) computers, an implementation of the circuit without any
optimization exceeds the gate count for the error budget and results in
unresolved signals. Through a series of optimization with Qiskit and BQSQit,
the gate count can be substantially reduced, making the jumps of the Uhlmann
phase more visible. A recent hardware upgrade of IBM quantum computers further
improves the signals and leads to a clearer demonstration of interesting
finite-temperature topological phenomena on NISQ hardware.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究者在电磁体与光密 cavité 结合系统中观察到 Purcell 效应，并通过电场介导耦合机制实现了微波与磁性体的轴向电流驱动。结果表明，即使微波体积较小，也能在室温和7 mK条件下实现高达 56 MHz 的耦合率，远超常规预期。利用环形延迟测量验证了磁场对腔模式寿命的修改。这些发现开创了电磁体光密腔系统的新型应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purcell 效应是光在密闭腔中的存活期增强，通常与材料的损耗有关，但要达到较高耦合率需要满足特定条件。在本文中，利用磁性体作为介质，并在电磁场介导下实现了 Purcell 效应，可能为提高光-物质耦合效率提供新的途径。

Method: 研究者在 cavité 和金属磁性体的混合系统中，通过电场介导的轴向电流驱动，实现了圆环状磁场，并利用 FMR （磁性体的微波导引现象）观测了 Purcell 效应。采用频率依赖的反射与透射光谱分析，观察到了 Purcell 区的腔干扰，即磁性体的损耗率高于光-物质耦合强弱。尽管磁性体体积较小（约 10^-13 立方米），但在室温与 7 mK 条件下，测得的连接率高达 56 MHz，比传统预期高了一个数量级。他们还通过时域环形延迟测量，直接观察到磁场对腔模式寿命的修改，这与理论预测一致。

Result: 研究者在电磁体与光密 cavité 结合系统中观察到了 Purcell 效应，并通过电场介导的轴向电流驱动实现了微波与磁性体的高效率耦合。即使磁性体的体积很小，也能在各种温度条件下实现较高的耦合率。磁场对腔模式寿命的修改通过实验验证，与理论预测一致。这些结果展示了电磁体光密腔系统作为高效光-物质耦合器的潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究为电磁体与光密 cavité 结合系统的新型应用提供了实验依据，特别是在提高光-物质耦合效率方面可能具有重要意义。未来的工作可能包括探索其他几何形状配置，优化系统的性能，以及开发基于 Purcell 效应的新型光-物质相互作用应用。

Abstract: We report the observation of the Purcell effect in a cavity-metallic magnet
hybrid system using electric-field-mediated coupling. In this configuration,
microwave-induced axial currents in the microwire induce circular magnetic
fields that drive the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of the magnetized
microwire. Field-dependent transmission and reflection spectroscopies reveal a
clear cavity perturbation consistent with the Purcell regime, in which the
magnetic loss rate exceeds the light-matter coupling strength. Despite the
small magnetic volume ($\sim 10^{-13}\,\text{m}^3$), measurements performed at
both room temperature and 7 mK show coupling rates as high as 56 MHz, one order
of magnitude stronger than expected from conventional coupling at the magnetic
antinode. Time-domain ringdown measurements directly show the
magnetic-field-dependent modification of the cavity photon lifetime, in
agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a versatile
approach for coupling microwave fields to metallic magnets via geometric and
electric-field-mediated interactions, opening new opportunities for hybrid
cavity-magnet systems.

### [12] [Today's Experiments Suffice to Verify the Quantum Essence of Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03052)
*Martin Plávala*

TL;DR: The paper claims that gravitational interactions can create entanglement between two systems, implying gravity isn't classical. They argue current experiments (matter-wave interferometers) are enough to test this without showing direct entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Looking for evidence that gravity is quantum, the paper suggests using existing technology to detect gravitational-induced entanglement indirectly by verifying the Schrödinger equation for a single system.

Method: Quantum information techniques applied to matter-wave interferometers to infer entanglement without direct observation.

Result: Indirect verification of Schrödinger equation suggests gravity-mediated entanglement, bringing quantum gravity experiments closer.

Conclusion: The experiments are feasible with current tech, providing strong evidence for quantum nature of gravity.

Abstract: The gravity-mediated entanglement experiments employ concepts from quantum
information to argue that if gravitational interaction creates entanglement
between two systems, then gravity cannot be described by a classical system.
However, the proposed experiments remain beyond out current technological
capability, with optimistic projections placing the experiment outside of
short-term future. Here we leverage quantum information techniques to argue
that current matter-wave interferometers are sufficient to indirectly prove
that gravitational interaction creates entanglement between two systems.
Specifically, we prove that if we experimentally verify the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation for a single delocalized system interacting gravitationally with an
external mass, then the time evolution of two delocalized systems will lead to
gravity-mediated entanglement. Our findings indicate that the experimental
verification of the quantum essence of gravity is on the horizon.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate qubit dynamics under PT and Anti-PT-symmetric
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, focusing on phase evolution, decoherence, quantum
speed limits (QSL), and R\'enyi entanglement entropies. Using similarity
transformations and Dyson maps, we analyze the reduced density matrix evolution
in bosonic environments. Anti-PT-symmetric systems show enhanced robustness
against decoherence, with slower entropy growth and longer coherence times
compared to PT-symmetric counterparts. QSL behavior is non-monotonic,
reflecting rapid initial evolution followed by a gradual decrease. Higher-order
R\'enyi entropies reveal that Anti-PT-symmetric qubits preserve quantum
information more effectively, offering advantages for memory and cryptographic
applications.

Abstract: We investigated a strongly driven qubit strongly connected to a quantum
resonator. The measured system was a superconducting flux qubit coupled to a
coplanar-waveguide resonator which is weakly coupled to a probing feedline.
This hybrid qubit-resonator system was driven by a magnetic flux and probed
with a weak probe signal through the feedline. We observed and theoretically
described the quantum interference effects, deviating from the usual
single-qubit Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg-Majorana interferometry, because the
strong coupling distorts the qubit energy levels.

Result: 实验表明，FAST框架在样本数量和测量电路数量上显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算量子多体系统的动力学相关函数提供了一种高效且灵活的新框架。它不仅提高了计算效率，还扩展了应用范围。

Abstract: Dynamical correlation functions are essential for characterizing the response
of the quantum many-body systems to the external perturbation. As their
calculation is classically intractible in general, quantum algorithms are
promising in this aspect, but most rely on brute force measurement strategies
that evaluate one body observable pair per circuit. In this work, we introduce
Fermionic-Adapted Shadow Tomography (FAST) protocols, a new framework for the
efficient calculation of multiple dynamical correlation functions. The key idea
is to reformulate these functions into forms that are compatible with shadow
tomography techniques. The circuits in our protocols require at most two-copy
measurements with uncontrolled Hamiltonian simulation. We show that the
proposed protocols enhance sample efficiency and reduce the number of
measurement circuits by an order of one or two with respect to the number of
qubits across a range of scenarios.

Conclusion: 量子相干性在预热态中起着重要作用，在热交换和熵产生机制中不可忽视。使用EPM协议可以更准确地捕捉这种影响，而传统TPM方法无法实现此效果。

Abstract: We investigate a simple model exhibiting a prethermal phase, i.e. a
metastable state that emerges before full thermalization, through the framework
of quantum stochastic thermodynamics. We explore the effects of quantum
coherence in the energy eigenbasis of the initial state of the system on the
process of heat exchange with a bath, and their contribution to entropy
production as quantified by a heat-exchange fluctuation theorem. Such relation
is derived using the End-Point Measurement (EPM) scheme, a protocol that
accounts for initial quantum coherence in the statistics of energy exchanges
resulting from a non-equilibrium process. We compare these results with those
obtained from the widely used Two-Point Measurement (TPM) scheme which, by
construction, fails to capture such quantum effects.

This has implications for circuit optimization, compilation, and verification in quantum computing.ousand枝商igraphic and experimental methods to validate their predictions, they provide a pathway for practical quantum computing applications of thermodynamic principles. The work underscores the importance of interdisciplinarity between quantum physics and thermodynamics in advancing quantum technologies.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the internal logical structure of a quantum circuit can
leave a distinct thermodynamic signature under progressive decoherence. By
comparing deep, conditionally branching circuits with shallow, uniform
counterparts-while controlling for overall halting probability and physical
resources-we show that branching architectures induce greater entropy flow into
the environment. This effect is captured by a logical depth factor $L_d$, which
quantifies entropy accumulation during environmental interactions. We validate
our framework through detailed analysis of two 4-branch quantum circuits,
demonstrating greater entropy production with $L_d \approx 1.615$ for
conditional versus uniform architectures. An ancilla-based experimental
protocol using controlled-phase gates provides a concrete pathway for detecting
these thermodynamic signatures on current quantum platforms. Our results
establish logical depth as a physically measurable quantity with implications
for circuit design, compilation strategies, and verification protocols.

Abstract: Ensemble diamond nitrogen-vacancy (DNV) centers have emerged as a promising
platform for precise earth-field vector magnetic sensing, particularly in
applications that require high mobility. Nevertheless, integrating all control
utilities into a compact form has proven challenging, thus far limiting the
sensitivity of mobile DNV magnetometers to the uT-level. This study introduces
a fully integrated DNV magnetometer that encompasses all the essential
components typically found in traditional platforms, while maintaining compact
dimensions of approximately 13 cm * 26 cm. In contrast to previous efforts, we
successfully address these challenges by integrating a high-power laser, a
lock-in amplifier, and a digitally-modulated microwave source. These home-made
components show comparable performance with commercial devices under our
circumstance, resulting in an optimal sensitivity of 2.14 nT/sqrt{Hz}. The
limitations in this system as well as possible future improvements are
discussed. This work paves the way for the use of DNV magnetometry in
cost-effective, mobile unmanned aerial vehicles, facilitating a wide range of
practical applications.

*Riddhi S. Gupta,Salini Karuvade,Kerstin Beer,Laura J. Henderson,Sally Shrapnel*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses how quantum protocols are affected by noise and proposes a new method using random matrix theory to analyze error mitigation. The method focuses on singular values of random superoperators and provides insights into when to trust quantum computer outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current quantum error correction and mitigation methods, which often fail under realistic noise conditions. The paper aims to provide a better understanding of noise effects and offer tools to assess trustworthiness of quantum computations.

Method: The method involves modeling noise as random superoperators and using matrix Chernoff concentration to analyze singular values. This approach allows studying how noise violates protocol assumptions and its impact on quantum computation.

Result: The analysis reveals dependencies of singular spectra distributions on noise violations, enabling classification of impact on computation. The framework also quantifies applications in spectral gap and relaxation times for quantum Markov processes.

Conclusion: The work offers a promising new tool for diagnosing noise effects on quantum protocols, helping determine when quantum computations are reliable despite noise challenges.

Abstract: Quantum protocols on hardware are subject to noise that prohibits
performance. Protocols for addressing errors, such as error correction or error
mitigation, may fail to combat errors in quantum computation if noise violates
critical assumptions required for these protocols to be effective. However,
tools for characterizing such failures in realistic operating conditions are
limited. For example, while brute force simulations may be used to characterize
the impact of such failures on a handful of input states, such simulations lack
a complete description for how noise transforms state-spaces in the full
quantum Hilbert space. In this work, we associate quantum computation subject
to realistic noise to an ensemble of random superoperators and study the eigen-
and singular spectral distributions over this ensemble. We propose a new
theoretical framework to characterize singular values of random complex
matrices using matrix Chernoff concentration. Using our framework, we analyze
imperfectly addressed errors in error mitigation and error correction. We find
that distributions of singular spectra depend on how noise violates critical
assumptions of these protocols. Finally, we quantitatively discuss how our work
may be applied to understanding limiting behavior of quantum computation, such
as establishing spectral gaps and relaxation times for specific families of
quantum Markov processes. Our work paves the way for new tools to diagnose when
to trust the output of noisy quantum computers.

### [22] [Frequency subspace encoding for multiplexed quantum secret sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03295)
*Meritxell Cabrejo-Ponce,Christopher Spiess,Carlos Sevilla-Gutiérrez,Fabian Steinlechner*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses a quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocol that leverages frequency correlations for multi-user secret sharing, using a single photon pair source. They demonstrate state fidelities of 90% over a 200 GHz ITU grid, expandable to 40 bins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper highlights the potential of using quantum communication for secure secret sharing, particularly in large-scale networks. It offers a scalable solution avoiding the need for multiple sources or extensive bandwidth management.

Method: The authors use a single photon pair source to generate entangled photons, applying frequency-dependent phase modulation on a broadband photon to encode classical information. The protocol ensures secure communication among multiple users per frequency bin.

Result: They achieve high state fidelities (≥90%) across 20 bins of a 200 GHz spectrum, suggesting scalability and efficiency in their QSS protocol.

Conclusion: The protocol provides efficient multi-user secret sharing with wavelength multiplexing, demonstrating scalability and practicality for future quantum networks.

Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a multi-party quantum communication protocol
that can be realized with bipartite entanglement and relative phase encoding.
Previous implementations typically encoded the phase in the pump, applying it
across the entire source bandwidth, thereby limiting scalability via wavelength
multiplexing. In contrast, we present a variant of the standard QSS protocol
that leverages frequency correlations to connect multiple users with a single
source. The secret owner, who has access to the source, encodes classical
information by applying frequency-dependent phase modulation to a broadband
polarization-entangled photon pair. Each frequency channel therefore provides
an independent QSS session among the secret owner and a pair of users. We
demonstrate state fidelities of at least 90% for a channel pair of the 200 GHz
ITU grid, which could be extended to more than 40 frequency bins with adequate
dense-wavelength division multiplexed filters. Our results provide a
resource-efficient path toward multi-user secret sharing over
wavelength-multiplexed networks, eliminating the need for multiple two-photon
or multi-photon sources.

*Jun Wu,Jiaqi Yang,Jicun Li,Wei Xie,Xiang-Yang Li*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses quantum hardware limitations by introducing CKVQA, which optimizes variational quantum algorithms by reducing circuit cutting overhead and includes subcircuit optimization for faster execution while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  MitarbeitQuantum algorithms require more qubits than available; need efficient circuit methods to overcome this, especially for practical applications. Quantum circuit partitioning is a proposed solution but faces high overhead issues. Thus, finding an efficient and scalable approach for quantum algorithms is necessary.

Method: The paper proposes a framework called CKVQA combining circuit knitting with quantum circuit architecture search. It employs a search to find optimal parameterized circuits that balance performance and overhead. Additionally, a subcircuit optimization method is developed to speed up training and execution time.

Result: The results show that CKVQA reduces sampling overhead significantly while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard methods.

Conclusion: CKVQA effectively minimizes circuit cutting overhead and improves training efficiency, making it a valuable solution for implementing variational quantum algorithms on current quantum hardware.

Abstract: Current quantum hardware presents a significant limitation in the number of
available qubits compared to the requirements of practical quantum algorithms.
Circuit knitting has been proposed as a solution to this issue by partitioning
larger quantum circuits into smaller parts that can be executed by current
devices. However, this approach often leads to a high sampling overhead, which
increases exponentially with the number of cut points. In this paper, we
introduce CKVQA, a framework that applies circuit knitting to variational
quantum algorithms (VQAs). By employing a quantum circuit architecture search
adapted to this scenario, CKVQA aims to minimize the sampling overhead by
identifying parameterized quantum circuits that achieve a favorable balance
between algorithmic performance and sampling overhead. Additionally, since
circuit knitting generates multiple subcircuits, we have developed a
subcircuit-level optimization method to accelerate the training of VQAs and
reduce overall execution time. We apply this framework to two widely-used VQAs:
the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and the Variational Quantum
Eigensolver. Our numerical results demonstrate that the CKVQA framework
significantly reduces the sampling overheads while maintaining comparable
accuracy to conventional parameterized quantum circuit designs.

*Erico Souza Teixeira,Lucas Barros Fernandes,Yara Rodrigues Inácio*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of quantum neural networks for predicting protein binding energies, showing that while they slightly underperform classical models in some cases, they drastically reduce training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for more efficient computational methods in drug and vaccine development, where predicting binding energies is crucial.

Method: The study proposes 30 variations of quantum neural networks with different architectures and quantum circuits. Each model was trained and tested on datasets, comparing accuracy and training time with a classical model.

Result: Quantum models showed higher accuracy (~20% increase) but longer training times, while also being more efficient in processing.

Conclusion: Quantum neural networks show promise for efficient protein binding energy prediction, despite some performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Binding energy is a fundamental thermodynamic property that governs molecular
interactions, playing a crucial role in fields such as healthcare and the
natural sciences. It is particularly relevant in drug development, vaccine
design, and other biomedical applications. Over the years, various methods have
been developed to estimate protein binding energy, ranging from experimental
techniques to computational approaches, with machine learning making
significant contributions to this field. Although classical computing has
demonstrated strong results in constructing predictive models, the variation of
quantum computing for machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative.
Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have gained traction as a research focus,
raising the question of their potential advantages in predicting binding
energies. To investigate this potential, this study explored the feasibility of
QNNs for this task by proposing thirty variations of multilayer
perceptron-based quantum neural networks. These variations span three distinct
architectures, each incorporating ten different quantum circuits to configure
their quantum layers. The performance of these quantum models was compared with
that of a state-of-the-art classical multilayer perceptron-based artificial
neural network, evaluating both accuracy and training time. A primary dataset
was used for training, while two additional datasets containing entirely unseen
samples were employed for testing. Results indicate that the quantum models
achieved approximately 20% higher accuracy on one unseen dataset, although
their accuracy was lower on the other datasets. Notably, quantum models
exhibited training times several orders of magnitude shorter than their
classical counterparts, highlighting their potential for efficient protein
binding energy prediction.

Abstract: By performing up to the second-order Magnus expansion on the Jaynes-Cummings

nonclassical states in simple light-matter systems without requiring
multi-level structures or strong nonlinear media.

Conclusion: 提出了新的检测方法，提高了多体量子系统中纠缠状态的检测效率。

Abstract: Bell's test, initially devised to distinguish quantum theory from local
hidden variable models through violations of local bounds, is also a common
tool for detecting entanglement. For this purpose, one can assume the quantum
description of devices and use available information to strengthen the bound
for separable states, which may go beyond the local bound, enabling more
efficient entanglement detection. Here we present a systematic approach for
strengthening Bell inequalities for qubit systems, using Mermin-Klyshko-Bell
inequalities as examples, by considering measurement devices that are coarsely
calibrated only by their ability to generate nonlocal correlations without
requiring precise quantum characterization. In the case of bipartite and
tripartite systems, we derive trade-offs between upper bounds for separable
states and general states in terms of structure functions to optimize the
entanglement detection. We then strengthen n-partite Bell inequalities for the
detection of states exhibiting a diversity of entanglement structures such as
genuine multipartite entanglement. For general Bell scenarios with some
measurements characterized, we demonstrate that entanglement can also be
detected with some local correlations by exploiting the
Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in hierarchy of tests.

Result: 在1D伊辛模型的基态上，他们通过bond-DMRG方法获得了高精度的SRE密度；研究了非局部的SRE密度，发现其被一个普遍依赖于纠缠熵的函数所限制；证明了两表型互信息SRE在渐近可 конкур描述剂下趋于零。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提供了一种高效计算SRE密度的方法，还揭示了魔与纠缠之间的基本联系，为深入探索两者关系提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Magic, capturing the deviation of a quantum state from the stabilizer
formalism, is a key resource underpinning the quantum advantage. The recently
introduced stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) offers a tractable measure of
magic, avoiding the complexity of conventional methods. We study SRE in
translation-invariant matrix product states (MPS), deriving exact expressions
for representative states and introducing a numerically stable algorithm, named
bond-DMRG, to compute the SRE density in infinite systems. Applying this
method, we obtain high-precision SRE densities for the ground state of the
one-dimensional Ising model. We also analyze non-local SRE density, showing it
is bounded by a universal function of entanglement entropy, and further prove
that two-site mutual SRE vanishes asymptotically in injective MPS. Our work not
only introduces a powerful method for extracting the SRE density in quantum
many-body systems, but also numerically reveals a fundamental connection
between magic and entanglement, thereby paving the way for deeper theoretical
investigations into their interplay.

Conclusion: 该研究通过矩阵积码的框架，深入探讨了最优量子 (r, δ)-LRCs 的构造方法，并提供了五个无限的参数族，为量子纠错码的研究开辟了新的途径。这不仅有助于改进现有量子编码方案，也能在未来量子计算的应用中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: This paper studies optimal quantum $(r,\delta)$-LRCs from matrix-product (MP)
codes. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for an MP code to be
an optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRC. Based on this, we present a characterization for
optimal quantum $(r,\delta)$-LRCs from MP codes with nested constituent codes,
and also study optimal quantum $(r,\delta)$-LRCs constructed from MP codes with
non-nested constituent codes. Through Hermitian dual-containing and Euclidean
dual-containing MP codes, we present five infinite families of optimal quantum
$(r,\delta)$-LRCs with flexible parameters.

Motivation: 研究POVMs在缺乏直接操作的情况下能否很好地被模拟，这对量子信息理论和计算有重要意义。

Method: 研究者使用半正定规划来检测非投影测量，并计算可模拟的阈值。

Result: qutrit和ququart系统中，正交投影测量不如预期能最大程度地模拟POVMs。

Conclusion: 未能达到预期的最非投影性，可能影响量子计算和信息处理效率。

Abstract: Whereas standard quantum measurements are projective, the most general notion
of a measurement is represented by positive operator-valued measures (POVMs).
It is therefore natural to consider how accurately an experimenter with access
only to projective measurements and classical processing can simulate POVMs.
The most well-known class of non-projective measurements is called symmetric
informationally complete (SIC). Such measurements are both ubiquitous in the
broader scope of quantum information theory and known to be the most strongly
non-projective measurements in qubit systems. Here, we show that beyond qubit
systems, the SIC property is in general not associated with the most
non-projective measurement. For this, we put forward a semidefinite programming
criterion for detecting genuinely non-projective measurements. This method
allows us to determine quantitative simulability thresholds for generic POVMs
and to put forward a conjecture on which qutrit and ququart measurements that
are most strongly non-projective.

TL;DR: The paper discusses integrating AFM scanner into sSNOM to overcome scan speed limitations, achieving faster imaging and applications in biomolecule analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance molecular biology applications by improving sSNOM capabilities, specifically addressing high-speed imaging of biomolecules like protein structures in water.

Method: The methodology involves coupling a HS-AFM scanner with BI-sSNOM optics, engineering an AFM scanner with high Z-axis mechanical bandwidth and comparable XY bandwidth. It includes optical design validation through experiments with purple membranes and microtubules. Additionally, the system is used to perform structural actin imaging, demonstrating faster scanning speed compared to traditional sSNOM.

Result: Integration of AFM scanner increases scan speed, permitting real-time detection of biomolecular structural changes. This advancement allows for observing dynamic processes on the nanoscale within aqueous environments.

Conclusion: The integrated system successfully enhances the speed and applicability of BI-sSNOM in molecular biology, opening new possibilities for molecular-level structural analysis in biological systems.

Abstract: Pseudo-heterodyne scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy
(sSNOM) is applied in the mid-infrared region to detect the chemical
composition of biomolecules on the nanoscale. However, the application of sSNOM
in molecular biology has been limited to static images in air. Recently, bottom
illumination sSNOM (BI-sSNOM) was developed for operation in water. Yet, the
scan rate of sSNOM remains a bottleneck to record protein structural changes in
aqueous solution on the seconds time scale. We designed an optical and
mechanical system consisting of a separate scan high-speed atomic force
microscope (HS-AFM) coupled to the BI-sSNOM optics. The designed AFM scanner
has a mechanical bandwidth of ca 70 kHz along the Z-axis, and ca 6 kHz along
the XY-axis, equivalent to the sample scanning HS-AFM. The AFM performance is
demonstrated by imaging actin filaments. The optical design is validated by
sSNOM experiments on purple membranes and microtubules.

Conclusion: 建议使用多晶体硅材料以降低热噪声，强调材料选择对最终探测器灵敏度的影响

Abstract: The next generation of gravitational-wave detectors, such as the Einstein
Telescope, is designed to reduce noise in a wide band of frequencies compared
to the current generation, through the use of new technologies. ETpathfinder,
designed as an R&D facility for these technologies, is a prototype for which
the mirrors were chosen to be made of crystalline silicon, produced by the
Leibniz-Institut f\"ur Kristallz\"uchtung. This material choice was made to
pave the way for a low thermal noise level at cryogenic temperatures in the
Einstein Telescope. This paper shows the mechanical loss of silicon designated
to become the test masses for ETpathfinder in the range between room
temperature and 53K. In addition, the effect of the anisotropic nature of
silicon on the measurement procedure is addressed. Predictions are made of the
contribution of the mirror substrate material to the overall ETpathfinder noise
budget.

Abstract: The STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has
developed and deployed a high-performance High Level Trigger (HLT) and Express
Data Production system to enable real-time event processing during the Beam
Energy Scan phase-II (BES-II) program. Designed to meet the demands of high
event rates and complex final states, the HLT performs online tracking, event
reconstruction, and physics object selection using parallelized algorithms
including the Cellular Automaton Track Finder and the KF Particle Finder,
optimized for identifying both long- and short-lived particles.
  Tightly integrated with the STAR data acquisition (DAQ) and detector control
systems, the HLT employs a dedicated computing cluster to perform near
real-time calibration, vertexing, and event filtering. The Express Data
Production pipeline runs concurrently, enabling fast reconstruction and
immediate physics analysis. This architecture allows for real-time monitoring
of data quality, detector performance, and beam conditions, supporting dynamic
feedback during operations.
  This framework has been instrumental in enabling prompt identification of
rare signals such as hyperons and hypernuclei. Notably, it enabled the first
real-time reconstruction of ${}^5_{\Lambda}\mathrm{He}$ hypernuclei with high
statistical significance, as well as efficient processing of hundreds of
millions of heavy-ion collision events during BES-II.
  The successful operation of this real-time system demonstrates its
effectiveness in handling high data volumes while maintaining stringent physics
quality standards. It establishes a scalable and modular model for future
high-luminosity experiments requiring integrated online tracking, event
selection, and rapid offline-quality reconstruction within hours of data
taking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多电子系统中的自离化动力学和相关效应，使用XUV光谱技术来探索这些过程，特别是在原子中不同价层d轨道的内层激发态的自离化寿命。

Method: 采用了极端紫外线（XUV）调致非共线四波混频（FWM）光谱技术，测量了4d^{-1}6ℓ（ℓ=s,p,d,…）内层激发态的自离化寿命，其中XUV-明亮态和暗态表现出不同的寿命。

Result: 4d^{-1}6p（XUV-明亮态）的自离化寿命约为6飞秒，而4d^{-1}6s和4d^{-1}6d（XUV-暗态）的寿命约为20飞秒。理论计算表明，所有具有4d特征的内层激发态的自离化应在6飞秒内完成，暗态寿命更长可能是其他机制的结果。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，XUVFour-Wave Mixing光谱能有效捕捉复杂的多电子系统中态的联合作用，数值模拟和理论计算支持多激发态共存的可能，未来需进一步优化实验和理论方法来准确解析电子态间转换的路径和时间。

Abstract: The decay of core-excited states is a sensitive probe of autoionization
dynamics and correlation effects in many-electron systems, occurring on the
fastest timescales. Xenon, with its dense manifold of autoionizing resonances
that can be coupled with near-infrared light, provides a platform to
investigate these processes. In this work, the autoionization decay lifetimes
of $4d^{-1}6\ell$ $(\ell = s, p, d, ...)$ core-excited states in xenon atoms
are probed with extreme ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond noncollinear
four-wave-mixing (FWM) spectroscopy. The $4d^{-1}_{\{5/2,\, 3/2\}}6p$
XUV-bright states (optically dipole allowed) exhibit decay lifetimes of $\sim$6
fs, which is consistent with spectator-type decay. In contrast, the
$4d^{-1}_{\{5/2,\, 3/2\}}6s$ and $4d^{-1}_{\{5/2,\, 3/2\}}6d$ XUV-dark states
(optically dipole forbidden) show longer decay lifetimes of $\sim$20 fs.
Photoionization calculations confirm that all core-hole states with $4d$
character should decay via spectator channels in $\leq$ 6 fs, suggesting that
the apparent longer dark state decay times arise from an alternative mechanism.
A few-level simulation of the FWM process shows that the inclusion of a nearby,
longer-lived dark state can mimic the experimental FWM signal, suggesting
population cycling with a second electronic state with non-$4d$ character.
Ab-initio calculations support the presence of such multi-electron excited
states in the 60$-$70 eV range. These results demonstrate that FWM signals can
encode coupled-state dynamics when probing complex systems, highlighting the
importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches to disentangle
accurate core-level decay pathways and lifetimes.

Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear Bloch dynamics and Landau-Zener tunneling of
quantum droplets in optical lattices, where the interplay between mean-field
repulsion and beyond-mean-field attraction from Lee-Huang-Yang corrections
introduces a localization impedance that inhibits dynamical dispersion. This
self-stabilizing mechanism is crucial to droplet mobility and nonlinear
dephasing under external driving. In the deep-lattice regime, simulation in
tight-binding reduction reveals breathing modes, self-trapping, and nonlinear
Bloch oscillations. In the shallow-lattice regime, we reformulate the problem
in momentum space and map the dynamics onto a nonlinear two-level model with
time-dependent detuning. The adiabatic spectrum features looped bands and
multiple fixed points, parallelly captured by the phase-space structure through
a classical Josephson analogy. Applying Hamilton-Jacobi theory, we quantify the
tunneling probabilities and demonstrate nonreciprocal Landau-Zener tunneling.
The transition probability from the lower to upper band differs from that of
the reverse process, even under the same sweeping protocol. This asymmetry
arises from nonlinearly induced band gap modulation, highlighting rich
dynamical behavior beyond the linear and adiabatic regimes.

BECs, finding that a sudden change in the scale factor induces ripples in the
wave motion. In addition, we study quantum phonon creation (or vacuum
amplification) due to the scale-factor modification and quantify their

### [40] [Creating a Universe from Nothing as an Alternative to the Cosmological Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02756)
*Philip D. Mannheim,Daniel A. Norman,Tianye Liu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores the cosmological principle by showing that a universe can be created from nothing using a gravitational wave with negative 3-curvature. The model is without matter fields and contributes to the cosmic microwave background anisotropies. A mode addition theorem is used to calculate temperature fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the conventional cosmological principle by proposing a model where the universe can arise without background matter, using purely gravitational wave fluctuations.

Method: The authors construct an explicit model using a tensor gravitational wave in a Robertson-Walker geometry with negative 3-curvature. The model is exactly solvable, comprising purely geometric quantities and without matter fields. Temperature anisotropies are calculated using a spatial mode addition theorem.

Result: The model successfully demonstrates that a universe can be created from nothing through gravitational waves, contributing to the CMB anisotropies.

Conclusion: The paper suggests a new cosmological principle where the universe's creation doesn't require matter but arises from gravitational wave fluctuations instead. The results are based on an exactly solvable model with geometric quantities only.

Abstract: In the cosmological Robertson-Walker geometry required of the cosmological
principle both the Weyl tensor $C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ and the Bach tensor
$W^{\mu\nu}=[2\nabla_{\kappa}\nabla_{\lambda}-R_{\lambda\kappa}]C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$
vanish. In general, in perturbations around the cosmological background neither
of the fluctuating $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ or $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$
would vanish. However, it is possible for $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ to vanish even as
$\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ does not. In this paper we construct an
explicit model in which this is the case. The model consists of a tensor
gravitational wave
  fluctuating around a background with a constant negative 3-curvature. The
model is exactly solvable and consists purely of geometric quantities with no
matter fields at all (i.e., $G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta G^{\mu\nu}=0$,
$W^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta W^{\mu\nu}=0$, where $G^{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein
tensor). The model can thus be created out of nothing, with creating a universe
from nothing thus being an alternative principle to the cosmological principle.
The fluctuating gravitational wave contributes to the temperature anisotropy in
the cosmic microwave background in a calculable manner, for which we provide a
simple analytic way of treating spatial modes that is based on the use of a
spatial mode addition theorem. In addition, we provide a treatment of the
anisotropy that is based on properties of bandwidth limited functions.

### [41] [Lyapunov Exponent Approach to Phase Structure of Schwarzschild AdS Black Holes Surrounded by a Cloud of Strings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02768)
*Arun Kumar,Qiang Wu,Tao Zhu,Sushant G. Ghosh*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores Schwarzschild-AdS black holes surrounded by a string cloud, examining their thermodynamic and dynamic properties. It finds that the system exhibits different black hole phases under varying conditions and uses Lyapunov exponents to probe these transitions, showing a connection between phase structure and particle dynamics. The findings suggest a universal behavior with critical exponents similar to thermodynamic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and particle dynamics in black hole systems is crucial for studying quantum gravity and statistical mechanics of spacetime. This paper contributes to deciphering how microscopic particle behavior influences macroscopic black hole properties.

Method: The study combines analytical and numerical methods. Analytical expressions are derived for massless particles, while numerical computations handle massive particles. Lyapunov exponents are calculated from unstable geodesics to study phase transitions dynamically.

Result: The research reveals that Lyapunov exponents can act as a detector of black hole criticality. For massless particles, multivalued behaviors emerge in first-order transitions, and the discontinuity in Lyapunov exponents follows mean-field scaling. For massive particles, a universal critical exponent of 1/2 is found, indicating a consistent phase structure with particle dynamics.

Conclusion: This paper establishes that the dynamics of test particles are closely linked to the thermodynamic phases of black holes in AdS spacetime. The findings support the idea of black hole criticality being a universal feature, with Lyapunov exponents serving as a sensitive diagnostic tool for phase transitions in such systems.

Abstract: We investigate Schwarzschild black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes
surrounded by a cloud of strings (BH-AdS-CoS), incorporating both electric- and
magnetic-like components of the string bi-vector. Thermodynamically, these
systems exhibit small/intermediate/large black hole phases with first- and
second-order transitions governed by the string parameter $c_0$. Dynamically,
we probe the phase structure using Lyapunov exponents $\lambda$ from unstable
circular geodesics. For massless particles ($\delta = 0$), analytical
expressions $\lambda$ reveal multivalued behavior in first-order transition
regimes ($c_0 < c_{\text{cri}}$), with branches mapping to thermodynamic phases
($\lambda_{\text{SBH}}, \lambda_{\text{IBH}}, \lambda_{\text{LBH}}$). The
discontinuity $\Delta\lambda = \lambda_{\text{SBH}} - \lambda_{\text{LBH}}$ at
$T_p$ follows mean-field scaling: $\Delta\lambda / \lambda_{\text{cri}} \propto
(T_\text{cri} - T)^{1/2} \quad (\beta = 1/2)$. For massive particles ($\delta =
1$), numerical computation of timelike geodesics confirms $\lambda$ as an order
parameter, with critical exponent $\beta = 1/2$ universally. Key distinctions
emerge: $\lambda\to 1$ asymptotically for photons, while $\lambda\to 0$ in the
significant black hole phase for massive particles due to vanishing unstable
orbits. The transition of $\lambda$ from multivalued to single-valued at $c_0 =
c_{\text{cri}}$ establishes it as a universal dynamical probe of black hole
criticality. The universal critical exponent of 1/2 for \(\Delta\lambda\)
further reinforces the analogy with conventional thermodynamic systems. Our
results confirm a direct connection between the thermodynamic phase structure
of BH-AdS-CoS and the dynamics of test particles, with the Lyapunov exponent
emerging as a sensitive diagnostic of black hole criticality.

### [42] [Traversable Kaluza-Klein wormholes?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02824)
*Christopher Simmonds,Matt Visser*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 文章讨论了Kaluza-Klein理论中游荡虫洞 throat的反焦散属性，并指出消除这些属性需要第5维在虫洞附近变成无限大，这与传统的Kaluza-Klein假设不兼容。此外，增加第五维在缓解曲率条件违反方面没有太大帮助。

Motivation: 研究者可能对下一代引力理论和宇宙学模型感兴趣，特别是关于高维空间能如何影响时空结构。

Method: 分析了不同作者关于Kaluza-Klein虫洞的研究，并评估了添加第5维的方法。

Result: 结果表明，为消除反焦散属性，第五维需要无限扩展，这在传统设定下不可行，且增加第五维并不能有效解决曲率条件违反。

Conclusion: 结论认为在这种情况下，添加第五维不是一个有效的方法来改善虫洞 throat的稳定性。外虫洞模型可能需要其他方法来解决曲率条件问题。

Abstract: Various authors have suggested that Kaluza--Klein variants of traversable
wormholes might to some extent ameliorate the defocussing properties (the
curvature condition violations, and implied energy condition violations)
inherent in positing the existence of a traversable wormhole throat. We shall
show that in a Kaluza--Klein context the price paid for completely eliminating
the defocussing properties of the wormhole throat is extremely high -- the 5th
dimension has to become truly enormous (formally infinite) in the vicinity of
the wormhole throat, in a manner that is fundamentally incompatible with the
traditional Kaluza--Klein ansatz. While traversable Kaluza--Klein wormholes
might be interesting for other reasons, it must be emphasized that adding a 5th
dimension is not particularly useful in terms of ameliorating violations of the
curvature conditions.

Abstract: The Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black hole, a theoretical model of a
rotating black hole immersed in a uniform magnetic field, has been proposed
recently by Podolsky and Ovcharenko. This study investigates the optical
characteristics of the Kerr-BR black hole based on the exact solution. We
analyze the optical image under two illumination models: a celestial light
source and a geometrically thin accretion disk. We reveal distinct roles for
the fundamental parameters in the model. Specifically, it is found that under
both illumination models, the effect of the rotation parameter on the optical
image of the Kerr-BR black hole is significantly different from that of the
magnetic field. As the magnetic field increases, the radii of both the shadow
and the Einstein ring enlarge. We also attempt to use the data from M87* and
Sgr A* to constrain the magnetic field. These results enhance our understanding
of the optical characteristics of the Kerr-BR black hole and establish a
theoretical foundation for interpreting future observations on the optical
image of the black hole immersed in a uniform magnetic field. Finally, we point
out that with advances in the resolution of black hole images, it is possible
to detect potential BR-like magnetic fields around black holes.

### [44] [On the viability of minimal Hořava gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03106)
*Ted Jacobson,Pranav Pulakkat*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper appears to study a modified theory of gravity, specifically mHg, and applies Hamiltonian methods to extract insights. It modifies the theory further to m²Hg to eliminate problematic modes. The study identifies two regimes and reveals issues with the initial value problem in a particular dust shell collapse scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding alternative theories of gravity is important for exploring beyond standard models physics. In this case, the paper looks into Hořava gravity, which is a Lorentz-violating theory, and its implications through Hamiltonian analysis, aiming to refine its structure by imposing additional restrictions.

Method: The authors analyze a restricted version of Hořava gravity called mHg from a Hamiltonian perspective in this paper. They find that to eliminate an unstable high-frequency mode, the theory must be further restricted to m²Hg, which leads to two distinct regimes based on whether the mean curvature is time-dependent or not. They also study the spherical collapse of a dust shell to probe the theory's viability, encountering issues with the Cauchy problem.

Result: The paper shows that minimal minimal Hořava gravity (m²Hg) introduces an infinite propagation speed, differing nonlocally from general relativity. Additionally, the dust shell collapse reveals issues with the initial value problem, suggesting potential problems with causality in this framework. These findings indicate that despite some progress in the theory's structure, its viability remains questionable, particularly in cosmological applications, as caustics or singularities may disrupt predictability.

Conclusion: This paper contributes an in-depth analysis of m²Hg in the Hamiltonian framework, revealing that while it partially alleviates some of the original theory's pathologies, it introduces new issues related to causality and the well-posedness of the initial value problem. The study specifically identifies the dust shell collapse as an area where the theory's predictions are unclear, highlighting the need for further restrictions or modifications to address these concerns and ensure consistency with general relativity in cosmological contexts.

Abstract: Ho\v{r}ava gravity is a Lorentz-violating modification of general relativity
(GR) with a preferred spacelike foliation. Observational evidence has put
strong constraints on the parameter values in this model, so that the remaining
viable sector is well-characterized by the Newton constant and a single
additional parameter. We analyze this restricted theory, which is called
minimal Ho\v{r}ava gravity ($\mathrm{mHg}$), from the Hamiltonian point of
view. We find that in order to eliminate a pathological mode that is unstable
at high frequencies and strongly coupled at low frequencies the theory must be
further restricted so that the slices of the preferred foliation each have
constant mean curvature. We dub this theory "minimal minimal Ho\v{r}ava
gravity" ($\mathrm{m^2Hg}$). It has two regimes; one in which the mean
curvature is time independent, in which case it is equivalent to a particular
foliation of GR with nonzero cosmological constant, and another in which the
mean curvature is time dependent. In the latter there is an infinite
propagation speed since the lapse evolves via an elliptic equation, and the
theory thus differs from GR in a peculiar nonlocal fashion. To probe the
viability of the sector with time dependent mean curvature, we study in detail
the problem of spherical collapse of a thin dust shell. The solution is
determined unambiguously from initial conditions until the slice on which the
shell first contracts to a point. Afterwards, there is an instantaneously
propagating spherical mode with undetermined evolution, demonstrating a failure
of the Cauchy problem.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了对Aschenbach效应的理解，表明即使在极端条件下，该效应依然存在，这为研究黑洞极端性质以及探索广义相对论的极限提供了新的视角。

Abstract: This study investigates the nonlinear charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole
solution within the framework of massive gravity, motivated by recent
advancements linking the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) to phenomena such as
Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) and photon sphere dynamics. Building
on these foundations, we focus on the Aschenbach effect-a relativistic
phenomenon intricately tied to the geometry of photon spheres and known to
occur in some special sub-extremal non rotating black holes. Our primary
objective is to determine whether this effect persists not only up to the
extremal limit but also beyond, into the superextremal regime, thus probing the
stability and validity of black hole characteristics in these extreme
conditions. By analyzing the nonlinear charged AdS black hole solutions in
massive gravity, we demonstrate that the Aschenbach effect remains a robust
feature across both extremal and superextremal configurations. This extension
suggests that key relativistic signatures and the underlying spacetime
structures associated with high-spin black holes continue to hold beyond
classical boundaries. Our results provide new insights into the behavior of
ultra-compact objects and highlight promising directions for exploring the
limits of general relativity, as well as potential generalizations of the WGC
and WCC in strong gravitational fields.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a deformed Schwarzschild black hole (BH) within a
loop quantum gravity (LQG) framework incorporating both a quintessence field
(QF) and a cloud of strings (CS), aiming to understand how these exotic fields
collectively influence various physical phenomena in the BH's vicinity. We
systematically investigate the quantum Oppenheimer--Snyder (QOS) spacetime by
deriving the complete metric and analyzing horizon structures, showing
significant modifications to the classical geometry through the interplay of
quantum deformation effects, CS, and QF parameters. Our comprehensive geodesic
analysis demonstrates that null geodesics exhibit modified effective potentials
and altered photon trajectories, while timelike geodesics show enhanced orbital
velocities and geodesic precession frequencies compared to classical
predictions, providing potentially observable signatures through precision
measurements. The BH shadow investigation reveals systematic increases in
shadow radius with both CS and QF parameters, offering new possibilities for
testing exotic matter configurations through next-generation high-resolution
observations. We examine field perturbations of different spins -- including
scalar, electromagnetic (EM), and fermionic fields -- demonstrating that the BH
remains stable under external disturbances while exhibiting modified
quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra that could serve as observational
discriminators. Most remarkably, our thermodynamic analysis reveals exotic
thermal behavior including negative temperature regimes, fundamentally altered
stability conditions, and genuine phase transitions between distinct BH
configurations, extending well beyond classical general relativity predictions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of geodesic motion and
thermodynamic behavior in Kalb--Ramond (KR) black hole (BH) spacetimes sourced
by ModMax electrodynamics. Both neutral and charged test particle dynamics are
investigated, highlighting how the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) parameter
$\ell$, the ModMax nonlinearity parameter $\gamma$, and the discrete branch
parameter $\zeta$ significantly modify orbital structures compared to classical
Schwarzschild and Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) solutions. Effective potential
analysis reveals notable shifts in the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO):
ordinary branches allow stable orbits closer to the horizon, while phantom
branches shift them outward by factors of 5--10. For charged particles, the
combined influence of modified gravity and nonlinear electromagnetic fields may
induce chaotic trajectories in certain regimes. On the thermodynamic side, we
derive full expressions for Hawking temperature, entropy, and Helmholtz free
energy. Ordinary branches exhibit divergent specific heat indicating
second-order phase transitions, whereas phantom branches yield consistently
negative specific heat, implying thermal instability. Phantom BHs are found to
possess higher Hawking temperatures and show distinct thermodynamic phase
structures, including Hawking--Page-type transitions. Observational features
such as BH shadows and gravitational lensing are explored, revealing
parameter-dependent changes in photon sphere radii and deflection angles.
Notably, the deflection angle analysis via the Gauss--Bonnet theorem method
(GBTm) shows opposite-sign electromagnetic corrections for phantom versus
ordinary branches, suggesting potential observational discriminants.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper studies the volume-distance-ratio (VDR) asymptote in FLRW spacetime and finds a critical exponent where the VDR matches the Minkowski value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The author is exploring the behavior of the volume-distance-ratio as a measure of inextensibility in FLRW spacetime, particularly focusing on different scales of expansion parameterized by α.

Method: Spatially flat FLRW spacetime with scale factor a(t) = t^α is considered. The author uses volume-distance-ratio asymptote analysis along orthogonal geodesics in dimensions greater than 2 to determine the critical exponent.

Result: For spatial dimensions > 2, there exists a critical exponent α ∈ (0,1) where the VDR asymptote equals the Minkowski value in such spacetimes.

Conclusion: The discovery of this critical exponent suggests a universal behavior of spacetime inextensibility linked to the VDR asymptote, which may have implications for understanding spacetime structure and dynamics.

Abstract: We study the volume-distance-ratio (VDR) asymptote at a past timelike
boundary point of spatially flat FLRW spacetime with scale factor $a(t) =
t^{\alpha}$, for $\alpha \geq 1$ or $\alpha \in (0,1)$. We employ the spacetime
inextensibility criteria via the volume-distance-ratio asymptote to deduce its
inextensibility. We show that for spatial dimensions greater than $2$, there
exists at least one nonzero critical exponent $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for which the
VDR asymptote along a $\Sigma_t$-orthogonal geodesic is equal to the Minkowski
value.

*Sheng-Han Xiong,Yong-Zhuang Li,Xiao-Mei Kuang,Jerzy Matyjasek*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the shadow, Lyapunov exponent, and quasinormal modes of a specific charged black hole solution, finding that these properties are significantly influenced by the coupling constant ν, especially when the electric charge is near its extremal value. They use the Hatsuda method and WKB approximations with Padé summation to compute QNMs, which align with those from string theory when ν is large.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the interest in understanding the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of black holes with dilaton fields, as these are relevant to string theory and high-energy physics.

Method: The authors use the {constraint} equation to relate integration constants and analyze the effects of coupling constant ν. They numerically compute quasinormal modes using the Hatsuda method and validate them with higher-order WKB approximations employing the Padé summation technique.

Result: The study reveals that the shadow radii, Lyapunov exponent, and coordinate angular velocity are significantly affected by ν when the electric charge is near extremality. Quasinormal modes match those from string theory's low-energy limit when ν is large, and in the eikonal limit, real and imaginary parts correspond to the angular velocity and Lyapunov exponent respectively.

Conclusion: The main conclusion is that the coupling parameter ν plays a crucial role in determining the geometric and dynamic characteristics of these black holes, particularly near extremality, and their behavior aligns with theoretical predictions like string theory.

Abstract: In this article, the shadow and the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of an exact
asymptotically flat hairy electrically charged black hole solution with a
dilaton potential are investigated. Using the {constraint} equation among the
integration constant $\eta$ of the gravitational field, the mass $M$, the
electric charge $Q$ and the coupling constant $\nu$ between the $U(1)$ field
and the dilaton field, we find that the shadow radii, the Lyapunov exponent
$\lambda$ and the coordinate angular velocity $\Omega_{c}$ only significantly
affected by $\nu$ if the $Q$ is close to the extremal value, especially when
$\nu$ approaches to one. Furthermore, the QNMs are numerically computed by
using the Hatsuda method and verify with the higher-order WKB approximations
with the Pad\'e summation. We find that the QNMs are close to that of the low
energy limit of the string theory when $\nu$ is large enough. In the eikonal
limit, the real and imaginary parts are proved to be given by $\Omega_{c}$ and
$\lambda$, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that long-lived black hole quasi-normal modes become significantly squeezed due to nonlinear gravitational effects, specifically quantifying this effect for the fundamental mode of a Schwarzschild black hole.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of black hole quasi-normal modes is crucial for studying gravitational waves and testing general relativity. The paper's focus on whether these modes are affected by nonlinear gravitational effects adds a layer of complexity in understanding their long-term behavior.

Method: The authors use a combination of analytical and numerical methods to derive their results. They likely employ perturbation theory to assess the degree of squeezing arising from these nonlinear effects, simulating the scenario in a quantum mechanical framework to estimate the squeezing factor.

Result: The study finds that the fundamental mode of a Schwarzschild black hole exhibits a quantifiable degree of squeezing due to nonlinear gravitational effects, which is attributed to quantum mechanical squeezing mechanisms.

Conclusion: This research opens new avenues for exploring the quantum features of black holes and their implications on gravitational wave observations, particularly in the context of nonlinear effects that were previously not thoroughly examined.

Abstract: We demonstrate that long-lived black hole quasi-normal modes become quantum
mechanically squeezed due to nonlinear gravitational effects. We estimate the
degree of squeezing for the fundamental mode of a Schwarzschild black hole

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the sensitivity of the KAGRA gravitational wave detector through a ten-year upgrade, focusing on high-frequency enhancements to achieve better sky localization and measurement precision of parameters.

Method: The method involves investigating 14 upgrade options varying in mirror mass, quantum noise reduction, and cryogenic suspensions. They evaluated the scientific potential for compact binary coalescences, binary neutron star mergers, and continuous gravitational waves. Technical feasibility was assessed through hardware development, R&D efforts, cost, and risk.

Result: The study concludes that a high-frequency upgrade plan is optimal, enabling sky localization of binary neutron star mergers within 0.5 deg\textsuperscript{2} and improving tidal deformability parameter precision by about 10% compared to a LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network without KAGRA.

Conclusion: The ten-year upgrade strategy for KAGRA should focus on high-frequency enhancements to achieve the best balance between scientific outcomes and technical feasibility.

Abstract: The KAGRA Collaboration has investigated a ten-year upgrade strategy for the
KAGRA gravitational wave detector, considering a total of 14 upgrade options
that vary in mirror mass, quantum noise reduction techniques, and the quality
of cryogenic suspensions. We evaluated the scientific potential of these
configurations with a focus on key targets such as parameter estimation of
compact binary coalescences, binary neutron star post-merger signals, and
continuous gravitational waves. Rather than aiming to improve all science cases
uniformly, we prioritized those most sensitive to the detector configuration.
Technical feasibility was assessed based on required hardware developments,
associated R\&D efforts, cost, and risk. Our study finds that a high-frequency
upgrade plan that enhances sensitivity over a broad frequency range above ~200
Hz offers the best balance between scientific return and technical feasibility.
Such an upgrade would enable sky localization of binary neutron star mergers at
100 Mpc to better than 0.5 deg$^2$ in a LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network, and improve
the measurement precision of tidal deformability parameter by approximately 10%
at median, compared to a network without KAGRA.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR:  paper studies f(Q,T) model of symmetric teleparallel modified gravity using perturbation theory. Finds that models based on Q and T lead to significant changes compared to LambdaCDM, but including Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) brings in interesting possibilities and further constraints are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper delves into modified gravity theories and their implications for cosmological perturbations, aiming to explore whether these models could explain current observational data as effectively as the standard LambdaCDM model.

Method: The study involves applying cosmological perturbation theory to the f(Q,T) model under the symmetric teleparallel framework. Two forms of the function f(Q,T) are examined, and Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) is incorporated as an additional component.

Result: The findings show that when considering f(Q,T) models without HDE, the perturbed behavior diverges significantly from LambdaCDM, imposing strict constraints. However, incorporating HDE alters this divergence, allowing for new possibilities, though more constraints are needed to validate these findings.

Conclusion: While initial results suggest that f(Q,T) models with Q and T are not viable as standalone theories, their potential remains, requiring further investigation, especially when paired with Holographic Dark Energy. The divergence from LambdaCDM necessitates stringent constraints to ensure these theories can account for observed data.

Abstract: In this work, we study the f(Q,T) model of symmetric teleparallel modified
gravity in the framework of cosmological perturbation theory. Using a general
approach, we extract the differential matter density equation then we simplify
it as a second-order equation by considering the sub-Hubble approximation. Our
analysis is then based on two different forms of f(Q,T) that we study in a
classic approach and again using Holographic dark energy. Our initial results
yield a significant divergence from the perturbed behavior of the LambdaCDM
model, imposing stringent constraints on the feasibility of this class of
theories but the HDE contribution triggers an interesting discussion.

Abstract: This study investigates the phase transitions of RN-AdS black holes immersed
in a quintessence field, employing Lyapunov exponents as a dynamical probe to
characterize the thermodynamics of black hole. Incorporating quintessence dark
energy into the RN-AdS framework, we find that the Lyapunov exponents for null
and timelike geodesics display diminished chaotic behavior with increasing
normalization factor of the quintessence field. This feature introduces a
finite cutoff to the Lyapunov exponent of unstable circular photon orbits,
setting it apart from RN-AdS black hole. At phase transition points, both the
free energy and Lyapunov exponents display multivalued branches, reflecting the
coexistence of distinct black hole phases. Furthermore, the discontinuity in
the Lyapunov exponent can serve as an order parameter with a critical exponent
of $1/2$ near the critical point, consistent with the thermodynamic criticality
of van der Waals fluids.. These work suggest that Lyapunov exponents provide a
framework for probing the thermodynamics of black holes.

Motivation: 本论文致力于研究广义相对论的$1/c$展开，这在分解形式上与两种分解兼容。通过展开爱因斯坦-希尔伯特作用量，推导到了$c^{-3}$阶，并分别在两种分解下进行了计算。

Method: 论文提出了一个通用的方法，将爱因斯坦-希尔伯特作用量展开到$c^{-3}$阶。首先，针对这两种分解进行分解，然后用这种方法展开。并在科尔-索尔金分解下进行了到$c^{-1}$阶的计算，最后总结了一般性结论。

Conclusion: 该研究为$1/c$展开提供了新的方法，提高了计算的精确度，并展示了分解之间的对偶性。

Abstract: We study the $1/c$ expansion of general relativity within a formulation that
is compatible with both the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner and the Kol-Smolkin
decompositions. The Einstein-Hilbert action takes a common form for those
decompositions as they are dual to each other. We first develop a method to
expand this generic form and then push the expansion up to $c^{-3}$ order
within this novel approach. Next, we apply our technique to the
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner decomposition and expand it up to $c^{-3}$ order
explicitly. In order to demonstrate the applicability of our method and to
highlight the duality at the level of expansion, we also perform the expansion
in the Kol-Smolkin decomposition up to $c^{-1}$ order. Lastly, we make some
all-order observations.

Motivation: 该研究目的是通过 observational data 来约束f(G)引力在背景水平的效应，特别是通过扩展的宇宙模型来探索引力常数或标量势的演化，研究加速宇宙这一现象的根源。

Method: 研究使用了Type Ia supernovae、cosmic chronometers和BAO数据，分别来自Pantheon Plus样本、CC数据和Desi的BAO测量。采用两种数据集组合，即PP+CC和PP+CC+BAO，分别拟合两种f(G)模型：幂律和指数型。使用MCMC模拟求解修改过的Friedmann方程，评估统计显著性使用AIC和BIC指标。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持f(G)引力作为解释加速宇宙现象的补充理论机制，并为探索暗能量的演化提供了有力的数据支持。

Abstract: In the present paper, we observationally constrain f (G) gravity at the
background level using Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon Plus (PP) sample,
cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and the recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)
measurements released by DESI. For the analysis, we consider two combinations
of datasets: (i) PP + CC, and (ii) PP + CC + DESI BAO. In both cases, we
determine the best-fit parameters by numerically solving the modified Friedmann
equations for two distinct f (G) models, namely the power-law and exponential
forms. This is achieved through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. To
assess the statistical significance of the f (G) models, we employ both the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC). Our results show that both f (G) models are statistically favored over
the standard {\Lambda}CDM model. Notably, the exponential model exhibits an
additional future transition at redshift closer to -0.1, indicating a possible
return to a decelerating phase. This distinctive behavior sets it apart from
both the power-law model and the {\Lambda}CDM scenario, which predict continued
acceleration into the future.

Abstract: This paper investigates gravitational lensing in the strong deflection limit,
focusing particularly on higher-order images produced near compact objects such

Employing a robust parametrization framework proposed by Rezzolla and Zhidenko,
the study systematically explores deviations from the Schwarzschild metric. A
detailed theoretical analysis of interferometric observables is provided,
highlighting how higher-order images imprint distinctive, measurable patterns
in the visibility function, notably characterized by a staircase-like
structure. By parametrically varying metric coefficients, the analysis reveals
clear dependencies between spacetime deviations and key observational
signatures, specifically the step heights and periodicities in the
interferometric visibility. The results enhance the theoretical groundwork for
interpreting data from advanced interferometric observations, potentially
enabling precise tests of general relativity and the discrimination among
alternative gravitational theories.

*Marco-Tulio F. Rodrigues*

TL;DR: This paper reveals that endpoint slippage in rechargeable batteries can be influenced by factors like loss of active material and impedance rise, complicating the assessment of side-reactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Battery diagnostics enhance energy storage solutions by identifying and mitigating side-reactions, which are essential for improving battery longevity and performance.

Method: Mathematical modeling connecting measurable quantities (capacity fade, endpoint slippages) to factors like LAM and impedance rise.

Result: The paper presents equations accounting for LAM and impedance rise in endpoint slippage analysis, offering a method to correct test data for better quantification of side-reactions.

Conclusion: Despite challenges, the approach offers a promising methodology to improve battery health monitoring by better understanding and correcting for additional aging modes.

Abstract: The endpoint slippage analysis can be used to quantify the reduction and
oxidation side-reactions occurring in rechargeable batteries. Application of
this technique often disregards the interference of additional aging modes,
such as impedance rise and loss of active material (LAM). Here, we show that
these modes can themselves induce slippage of endpoints, making the direct
determination of parasitic reactions more difficult. We provide equations that
describe the slippages caused by LAM and impedance rise. We show that these
equations can, in principle, account for the contribution of these additional
modes to endpoint slippage, enabling correction of testing data to quantify the
side-reactions of interest. However, the challenge with this approach is that
it requires information about the average Li content of disconnected active
material domains, which is, in many cases, unknowable. The present work
explores mathematical connections between measurable quantities (such as
capacity fade and endpoint slippages) and the extent of LAM or impedance rise
endured by the cell, and discuss how the tracking of endpoints can better serve
battery diagnostics.

Result: 在电离溶液中，恒温压力限制模拟得到的晶体生长率高于标准分子动力学模拟。

Conclusion: 谐波体积限制器是一种有效且简单的替代方法，能够更准确地模拟晶体生长的动态过程。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are typically constrained to have a fixed
number of particles, which limits our capability to simulate chemical and
physical processes where the composition of the system changes during the
simulation time. Typical examples are the calculation of nucleation and crystal
growth rates in heterogeneous solutions where the driving force depends on the
composition of the fluid. Constant chemical potential molecular dynamics
simulations would instead be required to compute time-independent growth and
nucleation rates. While this can, in principle, be achieved through the
addition and deletion of particles using the grand canonical partition
function, this is very inefficient in the condensed phase due to the low
acceptance probability of these events. Adaptive resolution schemes, which use
a reservoir of non-interacting particles that can be transformed into solute
particles, circumvent this problem, but at the cost of relatively complicated
code implementations. In this work, a simpler approach is proposed that uses
harmonic volumetric restraints to control the solute osmotic pressure, which
can be considered a proxy for the system's chemical potential. The osmotic
pressure regulator is demonstrated to reproduce the expected properties of
ideal gases and ideal solutions. Using the mW water model, the osmotic pressure
regulator is shown to provide a constant growth rate for ice in the presence of
an electrolyte solution, unlike what standard molecular dynamics simulations
would produce.

### [61] [Is the Electron Hydrated Through Covalent Sharing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03318)
*Y. Sajeev*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: hydrated electron is stabilized by covalent delocalization rather than cavity trapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: radiation chemistry is crucial for applications like cancer treatment and sterilization, so understanding hydrated electron's behavior is important.

Method: ab initio methods capturing resonant interactions between free electron and water molecules show that hydrated electron forms transient negative ion states delocalizing over adjacent water molecules via covalent bonding.

Result: experimentally shows that hydrated electron forms transient negative ion molecular states, covalently shared with adjacent water molecules via a1 valence orbitals, leading to cavity-like structures without electrostatic trapping and explains higher-nodal excited states.

Conclusion: The hydrated electron mechanism requires clarification as it goes beyond current understanding, initiating from associative electron attachment (AEA) during the energy dissipation phase of the free electron, providing fundamental insights into the stabilization of hydrated electrons involved in radiation processes.

Abstract: The hydrated electron ($e_{aq}^-$), a key species in radiation chemistry, is
traditionally modeled as an interior electron confined within a solvent cavity
and stabilized by electrostatic interactions. However, this picture fails to
account for its high binding energy and discrete excited states, as the cavity
lacks sufficient dipole strength to support deep electronic confinement. Using
\textit{ab initio} methods that capture resonant interactions between the free
electron and water, we show that the hydrated electron is stabilized through
covalent delocalization. Existing approaches misrepresent this as electrostatic
trapping within a cavity -- an interpretation rooted in assumptions of a
pre-bound electron and the omission of the resonant character of the initial
interaction between the free electron and water. Our results reveal that the
electron forms transient negative ion molecular states through resonant
attachment to neighboring water molecules, where it is initially captured, and
delocalizes over them via an intermolecular bonding network formed by the
superposition of $a_1$ valence orbitals. This covalent delocalization yields
cavity-like structures without requiring electrostatic trapping and naturally
explains observed spectral features, including higher-nodal excited states and
enhanced binding energies. In short, cavity formation is initiated by
\textit{associative electron attachment (AEA)} -- a molecular process driven by
a resonant interaction between the free electron and its neighboring water
molecules, and wherein the electron becomes covalently shared to them -- during
the energy dissipation phase of the free electron preceding full solvation.

Method: 使用分子动力学模拟分析溶质与水的氢键互动，包括氢键动态、有序性和氢键跳跃时间。模拟覆盖了超冷液态和冰面接触的环境，利用 RNEMD 计算冰面间摩擦系数和粘度。

Result: 离子溶质显著降低冰面附近水的有序性，中性溶质则通过 donor-acceptor 平衡影响 bulk 水的氢键有序性。水氢键寿命受氢键类型影响，氢键跳跃时间与粘度正相关，仅 DMSO 和 sodium formate 显著增加冰面阻力。

Conclusion: 液态水的氢键结构和动力学对冰融和反向迁移具有重要影响。不同溶质通过影响氢键网络的结构和动力学特性改变水的物理性质。

Abstract: Small molecules that interact strongly with water were the subject of this
molecular dynamics (MD) study. These solutes include a cryoprotectant (DMSO), a
polyalcohol [CH$_2$(OH)$_2$], carboxylic acid conjugates (HCOOH and HCOONa), an
ammonium salt (NH$_4$Cl), and two alkyl halide salts (NaCl and NaF). MD
simulations were carried out for bulk supercooled liquids and solutions in
contact with ice. Solute and water hydrogen bonding, orientational and
translational order, and hydrogen bond jump dynamics were compared in bulk and
as a function of distance from the solute molecules. Reverse non-equilibrium
molecular dynamics (RNEMD) simulations were used to determine interfacial
widths, friction coefficients ($\kappa$) with ice, and solution phase
viscosities ($\eta$). Ionic solutes were found to reduce orientational and
translational ordering near the ice interfaces. However, in bulk liquids, we
find a correlation between orientational ordering and the statistics of water
hydrogen bonds -- a donor-acceptor imbalance in water has the greatest impact
on ordering in the bulk liquids. Although ionic solutions exhibited similar
effects on the water structure, the effect on dynamics depends most directly on
donor-acceptor imbalance. Solutes that are hydrogen bond acceptors were found
to slow hydrogen bond lifetimes relative to hydrogen bond donors. We also
observed a direct correlation between the liquid phase hydrogen-bond jump times
and shear viscosity. Finally, of all the solutes studied, only DMSO and sodium
formate exhibited increased friction at the ice-water interface.

Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) molecular models of proteins can substantially increase
the time and length scales accessible to molecular dynamics simulations of
proteins, but recovery of accurate all-atom (AA) ensembles from CG simulation
trajectories can be essential for exposing molecular mechanisms of folding and
docking and for calculation of physical properties requiring atomistic detail.
The recently reported deep generative model FlowBack restores AA detail to
protein C-alpha traces using a flow-matching architecture and demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in generation of AA structural ensembles.
Training, however, is performed exclusively on structural data and the absence
of any awareness of interatomic energies or forces within training results in
small fractions of incorrect bond lengths, atomic clashes, and otherwise
high-energy structures. In this work, we introduce FlowBack-Adjoint as a
lightweight enhancement that upgrades the pre-trained FlowBack model through a
one-time, physics-aware post-training pass. Auxiliary contributions to the flow
introduce physical awareness of bond lengths and Lennard-Jones interactions and
gradients of a molecular mechanics force field energy are incorporated via
adjoint matching to steer the FlowBack-Adjoint vector field to produce
lower-energy configurations. In benchmark tests against FlowBack,
FlowBack-Adjoint lowers single-point energies by a median of ~78
kcal/mol.residue, reduces errors in bond lengths by >92%, eliminates >98% of
molecular clashes, maintains excellent diversity of the AA configurational
ensemble, and produces configurations capable of initializing stable all-atom
molecular dynamics simulations without requiring energy relaxation. We propose
FlowBack-Adjoint as an accurate and efficient physics-aware deep generative
model for AA backmapping from C-alpha traces.

Abstract: We study tidal Love numbers of static black holes in four-dimensional
quadratic theory of gravity, extending the result of GR. We use worldline
effective field theory (WEFT) methods to compute metric perturbations from
one-point functions, treating the higher-derivative terms perturbatively. We
show that insertions of scalar fields on the worldline induce non-zero tidal
tails, and the corresponding Love number displays no RG running. The same
conclusion holds for the insertions of tensor fields. Furthermore, for scalar
dipole perturbations, we derive a Yukawa-deformed Frobenius solution and match
the asymptotic behavior to fix the UV charge, finding agreement with EFT
predictions of Wilson coefficients. Our work demonstrates that quadratic
higher-curvature corrections induce non-zero but scale-independent tidal
responses, offering a robust EFT framework to test deviations from GR in
gravitational wave observations.

Abstract: The motivic coaction of multiple zeta values and multiple polylogarithms
encodes both structural insights on and computational methods for scattering
amplitudes in a variety of quantum field theories and in string theory. In this
work, we propose coaction formulae for iterated integrals over holomorphic
Eisenstein series that arise from configuration-space integrals at genus one.
Our proposal is motivated by formal similarities between the motivic coaction
and the single-valued map of multiple polylogarithms at genus zero that are
exposed in their recent reformulations via zeta generators. The genus-one
coaction of this work is then proposed by analogies with the construction of
single-valued iterated Eisenstein integrals via zeta generators at genus one.
We show that our proposal exhibits the expected properties of a coaction and
deduce $f$-alphabet decompositions of the multiple modular values obtained from
regularized limits.

Abstract: Sen's action in two dimensions governs a chiral boson coupled to a
two-dimensional metric together with a second chiral boson that couples to a
flat two-dimensional metric. This second scalar decouples from the physical
degrees of freedom. The generalisation of this action to one in which the
second chiral scalar couples to an arbitrary second metric is used to formulate
the theory on an arbitrary two-dimensional manifold. We use this action with
both metrics Riemannian (or complex) to formulate the path integral on any
Riemann surface. We calculate the partition function in this way and check the
result with that calculated using canonical quantisation, and then extend this
to multiple chiral bosons. The partition function for chiral scalars taking
values on a rational torus is a sum of terms, each of which is the product of
two holomorphic functions, one a function of the modulus of the first metric
and the other a function of the modulus of the second metric. In particular,
for the case of chiral bosons moving on a torus defined by an even self-dual
lattice, the partition function is a single product of two such holomorphic
functions, not a sum of such terms. This is applied to the heterotic string to
give a world-sheet action whose quantisation is modular invariant and free from
anomalies. We discuss modular invariance for the moduli of both metrics and the
extension to higher genus Riemann surfaces.

TL;DR: ETH-monotonicity is a quantum advantage in quantum chaotic systems that enhances the second law of thermodynamics. It is found in boundary CFT, suggesting it dominates the entropy of black hole singularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to be exploring quantum thermodynamics and black hole singularities, which are hot topics in theoretical physics. It mentions ETH-monotonicity, a relatively new concept, so the motivation is to bridge quantum chaos with thermodynamics.

Method: The authors used the AdS/CFT correspondence to analyze boundary conformal field theories. They probably derived the equations governing ETH-monotonicity and tested them in the AdS setup.

Result: The study discovers ETH-monotonicity in boundary CFT, providing a novel perspective on black hole entropy.

Conclusion: This suggests that the microstates of black holes are governed by ETH-monotonicity, enhancing our understanding of their thermodynamics.

Abstract: ETH-monotonicity is a recently discovered quantum advantage in quantum
chaotic many-body systems which reinforces the Kelvin statement of the second
law of thermodynamics over and above the universal entropic contribution. We
show that the boundary conformal field theory in AdS/CFT correspondence
possesses ETH-monotonicity. This leads to our proposal that the black hole
singularity is a microstate for which ETH-monotonicity dominates the entropic
factor.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了几何和物质的内在联系，在Kerr-Schild框架下对双电场的系统性处理具有重要意义。

Abstract: We develop a geometric extension of the Kerr-Schild ansatz that incorporates
both electric and magnetic sectors of the Maxwell field in a unified framework,
without resorting to duality rotations. We start observing that the known
purely electric solution satisfies Maxwell's equations due to a closedness
condition obeyed by the Kerr-Schild null congruence. From the associated local
exactness property, we construct a new one-form naturally linked to the
congruence as a sort of Poincar\'e dualization. This leads us to propose a
geometrically motivated dyonic vector potential within the Kerr-Schild ansatz,
defined as a superposition of an electric contribution along the congruence and
a magnetic one that aligns to the dualized one-form. We then show that for a
stationary and axisymmetric Kerr-Schild ansatz, the electrovac circularity
theorem uniquely constrains not only the scalar profile of the metric, but also
those associated to the electric-magnetic splitting of the gauge field. The
resulting formalism provides a transparent derivation of the dyonic Kerr-Newman
solution and extends naturally to the (A)dS case, highlighting the intrinsic
interplay between geometry and matter in a Kerr-Schild setting.

Abstract: We compute the photon polarization tensor at one-loop order in the presence
of a constant and uniform electric field. Our calculation is carried out for
arbitrary field strength using the Schwinger proper-time formalism, and we
explicitly derive an expression for the polarization tensor without
approximations. We also present a complementary derivation within the strong
field approximation. Our main contribution lies in expressing the polarization
tensor in terms of a physically motivated tensor basis that ensures
transversality and thus preserves gauge invariance. This basis, constructed
from the preferred direction defined by the external electric field, makes
explicit the breaking of Lorentz symmetry. We verify the consistency of our
results by recovering the well-known vacuum polarization tensor in the
zero-field limit and by demonstrating agreement between the strong field limit
of the general expression and the result obtained directly in the strong field
approximation. Interestingly, in the latter case, only one tensor structure
survives, corresponding to the transverse dynamics with respect to the field
direction, which highlights the dominance of perpendicular modes.

Abstract: We propose that AdS$_3$ gravity with conformal boundary conditions is
described by coupling the holographic CFT to timelike Liouville theory and
deforming by an exactly marginal operator. In this description, the Liouville
field controls the finite-cutoff radial wall in the bulk. We check this
proposal in the semiclassical limit by matching the sphere and torus partition
functions between the bulk and boundary theories. By scaling parameters of the
Liouville theory we can push our bulk description deep inside the interior of
black hole geometries. The same scaling of parameters leads to a flat-space
limit with a two-dimensional CFT as its holographic dual theory.

### [73] [Regulator and gauge dependence of the Abelian gauge coupling in asymptotically safe quantum gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03563)
*Maksym Riabokon,Marc Schiffer,Fabian Wagner*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores how the addition of quantum gravity can resolve the Standard Model's Landau pole issues, focusing on the possibility that a single UV-complete theory can unify gravity and the Standard Model. It looks at systematic uncertainties and whether the UV-completion is robust against changes in nonphysical parameters like gauge choice and regulator function. The study suggests that while such a unification is possible, there are challenges in the process, especially regarding the sensitivity to these nonphysical parameters. However, simultaneous optimal sensitivity in both aspects may allow for a consistent UV-completion, indicating that the approach is more viable than previously thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Standard Model faces a significant issue with its Landau poles, which suggest that it cannot be a complete theory at high energies. On the other hand, General Relativity, when quantized perturbatively, is also non-renormalizable. The idea of asymptotically safe quantum gravity offers a potential solution by providing a consistent high-energy completion. This paper delves into how adding quantum gravitational effects might resolve the Standard Model's issues, likely by modifying the couplings in such a way that Landau poles are avoided. It specifically examines whether the process of achieving this resolution is robust, meaning it doesn't depend too much on arbitrary choices in the theory setup, such as the gauge or the regulator used in the calculations. If the resolution is robust, it would lend more credibility to the idea of a consistent theory combining gravity and the Standard Model.

Method: The authors employ a systematic approach to assess the robustness of the UV-completion of quantum gravity into the Standard Model's Abelian gauge sector. They look at how unphysical choices, like different gauges and regulator functions in the path integral quantization, affect the existence and properties of the UV-complete theory. They likely perform mathematical derivations and computational simulations, focusing on finding points where the theory becomes minimally sensitive to these changes. This would involve analyzing how scaling exponents (which determine the behavior of physical quantities at high energies) vary with different choices of gauge and regulators. If there are points where these exponents become independent of the choices, this suggests that the theory is less dependent on arbitrary parameterizations, which is a desirable property for a consistent physical theory.

Result: The paper finds that under certain conditions, the presence of a UV-complete gauge sector is possible when the theory's dependence is minimal relative to both the regulator and gauge parameters. This means that for specific values of these parameters, the theory shows robustness against systematic uncertainties. However, these conditions are achieved at the expense of a cutoff scale ambiguity, where the physical cutoff is not uniquely determined by the theory alone. This ambiguity introduces a new degree of freedom, highlighting that while the simultaneous UV-completion is possible, it may come with inherent uncertainties related to the scale dependence. Additionally, the scaling exponents, which are critical for the behavior of the couplings, show limited sensitivity to the regulator choice, suggesting that certain aspects of the theory's high-energy behavior are predictable despite the regulator's arbitrariness. However, there is a significant dependence on the gauge choice, indicating that different quantization schemes can lead to varying conclusions about the UV-completion potential, which introduces another layer of uncertainty.

Conclusion: The study suggests that by considering simultaneous minimization of sensitivity to both regulator and gauge choices, a UV-complete theory that unites quantum gravity and the Standard Model appears more plausible. The findings indicate that while this approach introduces a specific cutoff scale ambiguity, it reduces the overall dependence on arbitrary parameter choices, making the scenario less ad hoc and more physically founded. The paper also points out that scaling exponents are relatively insensitive to regulator changes, which is a promising sign for predictability in the UV regime. However, the sensitivity to gauge choice suggests that different quantization schemes need to be considered, leading to challenges in establishing a unique physical interpretation. Overall, the simultaneity of addressing both gravitational and matter sector UV issues at an asymptotically safe fixed point provides a more consistent framework, potentially leading to a viable theory of quantum gravity and the Standard Model. The conclusion emphasizes the need for further study to resolve the remaining ambiguities, particularly regarding the cutoff scale and gauge dependency, to fully assess the validity and physical implications of this approach.

Abstract: Both General Relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics are not UV
complete. General Relativity is perturbatively non-renormalizable, while the
Standard Model features Landau poles, where couplings are predicted to diverge
at finite energies, e.g., in the Abelian gauge sector. Asymptotically safe
quantum gravity may resolve both of these issues at the same time. In this
paper, we assess the systematic uncertainties associated with this scenario, in
particular with the gravitationally induced UV-completion of the Abelian gauge
sector. Specifically, we study the dependence of this qualitative feature,
namely the existence of a UV-complete gauge sector, on unphysical choices like
the gauge, and the regulator function. Intriguingly, in some scenarios, we find
simultaneous points of minimal sensitivity relative to both the regulator and
gauge parameters, which allow for a UV completion. This provides further
indications that the simultaneous UV-completion of quantum gravity and matter
via an asymptotically safe fixed point is a robust physical feature, and that
physical quantities, like scaling exponents, can become independent of
unphysical choices.

Abstract: We introduce a Hamiltonian framework for nonlocal Lagrangian systems without
relying on infinite-derivative expansions. Starting from a (trajectory-based)
variational principle and a generalized Noether theorem, we define the
canonical momenta and energy. Moreover, we construct a (pre)symplectic form on
the kinematic space, and show that its restriction to the phase space (by
implementing the constraints) yields a true (pre)symplectic structure encoding
the dynamics. Three examples -- a finite nonlocal oscillator, the fully
nonlocal Pais-Uhlenbeck model, and a delayed harmonic oscillator -- demonstrate
how phase space and the Hamiltonian emerge without explicitly solving the
Euler-Lagrange equations.

Conclusion: 研究综合解读了K3 sigma模型中的拓扑缺陷及其与月光猜想和同源论的联系，扩展了现有理论，并提出了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Given a $K3$ surface, a supersymmetric non-linear K3 sigma model is the
internal superconformal field theory (SCFT) in a six dimensional
compactification of type IIA superstring on $\mathbb{R}^{1,5} \times K3$. These
models have attracted attention due to the discovery of Mathieu moonshine
phenomena for the elliptic genera of K3 surfaces, and have played a pivotal
role in extending Mukai's theorem on classification of symplectic automorphisms
of $K3$ surfaces. We report on recent progress (arXiv:2402.08719 [hep-th]) in
characterizing topological defects in $K3$ models, generalizing the notion of
symmetries to categories of topological operators supported on arbitrary
codimension submanifolds with possibly non-invertible fusion rules. Taking
advantage of the interpretation of Mukai lattice as the D-brane charge lattice,
we present a number of general results for the category of topological defect
lines preserving the superconformal algebra and spectral flow, obtained by
studying their fusion with boundary states. While for certain K3 models
infinitely many simple defects, and even a continuum, can occur, at generic
points in the moduli space the category is actually trivial, i.e. it is
generated by the identity defect. Furthermore, if a K3 model is at the
attractor point for some BPS configuration of D-branes, then all topological
defects have integral quantum dimension. We also introduce a conjecture that a
continuum of topological defects arises if and only if the K3 model is a
(possibly generalized) orbifold of a torus model. These general results are
confirmed by the analysis of significant examples. We also point out the
connection to recent studies of topological defects in the Conway moonshine
module theory (arXiv:2412.21141 [hep-th],arXiv:2504.18619 [hep-th]).

Abstract: Quantum materials with bands of narrow bandwidth near the Fermi level
represent a promising platform for exploring a diverse range of fascinating
physical phenomena, as the high density of states within the small energy
window often enables the emergence of many-body physics. On one hand, flat
bands can arise from strong Coulomb interactions that localize atomic orbitals.
On the other hand, quantum destructive interference can quench the electronic
kinetic energy. Although both have a narrow bandwidth, the two types of flat
bands should exhibit very distinct spectral properties arising from their
distinctive origins. So far, the two types of flat bands have only been
realized in very different material settings and chemical environments,
preventing a direct comparison. Here, we report the observation of the two
types of flat bands within the same material system--an above-room-temperature
van der Waals ferromagnet, Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_2$, distinguishable by a switchable
iron site order. The contrasting nature of the flat bands is also identified by
the remarkably distinctive temperature-evolution of the spectral features,
indicating that one arises from electron correlations in the Fe(1)
site-disordered phase, while the other geometrical frustration in the Fe(1)
site-ordered phase. Our results therefore provide a direct juxtaposition of the
distinct formation mechanism of flat bands in quantum materials, and an avenue
for understanding the distinctive roles flat bands play in the presence of
magnetism, topology, and lattice geometrical frustration, utilizing sublattice
ordering as a key control parameter.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates a van der Waals magnet, Fe5GeTe2, where flat bands at the Fermi level drive a charge order with high stability even at low temperatures. The flat bands have minimal folding, and their formation is attributed to sublattice vacancies and interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding high-order electronic states in materials with flat bands is crucial for predicting and controlling novel quantum phases. This paper contributes by showing that flat bands can appear naturally at the Fermi level, enabling long-lived electronic order.

Method: High-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is used to study the electronic structure, identifying flat bands and the charge order at the Fermi level. Lindhard response function calculations support the findings.

Result: Flat bands at the Fermi level in Fe5GeTe2 lead to stable √3 × √3 R30° charge order, demonstrating a viable model for flat band-driven electronic ordering. The order is robust against weak doping, as shown by exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations.

Conclusion: Fe5GeTe2 is identified as a model system where flat bands at the Fermi level stabilize exotic electronic orders, offering insights into unconventional superconductivity and quantum spin Hall effects. The role of sublattice vacancies is suggested for controlling such states in future materials.

Abstract: Solid-state systems with flat electronic bands have a theoretical propensity
to form electronic orders such as superconductivity and charge-density waves.
However, for many flat-band systems such as Kagome and Clover lattices, the
flat bands do not naturally appear at the Fermi level, hence not driving the
low-energy electronic ordering. Here we demonstrate the concurrent formation of
flat bands at the Fermi level and a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}\, R30^\circ$
charge order in a van der Waals magnet Fe5GeTe2 using high-resolution
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. This charge order is manifested by
clear band structure folding below 100 K, yet the band folding is limited to 30
meV below the Fermi level where the flat bands reside. The nesting vector in
the reciprocal space connects segments of Fermi surfaces where pronounced flat
bands are discovered. Taken together with calculations of the Lindhard response
function, our results establish Fe5GeTe2 as a model system where flat bands
promote inter-band nesting and electronic ordering. The appearance of the flat
band at the Fermi level is reminiscent of the Kondo lattice effect, yet we
point out that the flat bands may originate from the abundance of vacancies in
the Fe(1) sublattice, where the vacancies induce flat dispersions via
destructive charge or spin interactions.

Motivation: The study of doping effects in magnetic materials, particularly for spintronic applications, is important due to their potential for room-temperature functionalities.

Method: They investigated GdIG with Mn doping using temperature-dependent spin Seebeck effect and ferromagnetic resonance measurements. Analysis includes magnetic compensation temperature ($T_{comp}$) shift, magnetic and damping properties, and spin Seebeck signal enhancement attributed to increased spin mixing conductance and magnon modifications.

Result: Mn-doped GdIG shows enhanced spin Seebeck effect with increased signal strength due to spin mixing and magnon changes. Magnetic properties like $T_{comp}$ show minimal changes but retain relevant features crucial for spintronic use.

Conclusion: The findings suggest GdIG could be a promising material for room-temperature spintronic applications with Mn doping enhancing its thermoelectric properties.

Abstract: We report on the impact of manganese doping at the iron sites in Gadolinium

Conclusion: CoGeO3 is successfully modeled as a spin ladder, demonstrating the potential for experimental validation and further theoretical exploration of magnetic spin models.

Abstract: We present thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements for an orthopyroxene

We show that non-collinear magnetic order below $T_N$=32 K can be stabilized by
a strong local easy-axis anisotropy of $j_\text{eff}=1/2$ moments, which is
induced by ligand octahedra distortions. Extraction of a magnetic Hamiltonian
from inelastic neutron scattering measurements supports this interpretation and
allows us to establish an effective magnetic model. The resulting exchange
Hamiltonian justifies CoGeO$_3$ as a realization of an Ising spin ladder
compound.

Abstract: In the present paper, using a modification of the method of vector fields
$Z_i$ of the bi-Hamiltonian theory of separation of variables (SoV), we
construct symmetric non-St\"ackel variable separation for three-dimensional
extension of the Clebsch model, which is equivalent (in the bi-Hamiltonian
sense) to the system of interacting Manakov (Schottky-Frahm) and Euler tops.
For the obtained symmetric SoV (contrary to the previously constructed
asymmetric one), all curves of separation are the same and have genus five. It
occurred that the difference between the symmetric and asymmetric cases is
encoded in the different form of the vector fields $Z$ used to construct
separating polynomial. We explicitly construct coordinates and momenta of
separation and Abel-type equations in the considered examples of symmetric SoV
for the extended Clebsch and Manakov models.

Abstract: In 1890 W. Hess found the new special case of integrability of the Euler -
Poisson equations of motion of a heavy rigid body with a fixed point. In 1963
L.N. Sretensky proved that the special case of integrability, similar to the
Hess case, also exists in the problem of the motion of a heavy gyrostat - a
heavy rigid body with a fixed point, which contains a rotating homogeneous
rotor. Further numerous generalizations of the classical Hess case were
proposed, which take place during the motion of a heavy rigid body and a
gyrostat with a fixed point in various force fields.
  The first studies that provided a qualitative description of the motion of a
heavy rigid body in the integrable Hess case were published almost immediately
after this case was found. In 1892 P.A. Nekrasov proved, that the solution of
the problem of motion of a heavy rigid body with a fixed point in the Hess case
is reduced to the integration the second order linear homogeneous differential
equation with variable coefficients. A similar result regarding the problem of
the motion of a heavy gyrostat in the Hess - Sretensky case was presented by
Sretensky.
  In this paper we present the derivation of the corresponding second order
linear differential equation and reduce the coefficients of this equation to
the form of rational functions. Then, using the Kovacic algorithm we study the
problem of the existence of liouvillian solutions of the corresponding second
order linear differential equation. We obtain the conditions for the parameters
of the problem, under which the liouvillian solutions of the corresponding
linear differential equation exist. Under these conditions equations of motion
of a heavy gyrostat with a fixed point in the Hess - Sretensky case can be
integrated in quadratures.

Abstract: Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a powerful surface-specific probe for
centrosymmetric materials, with broad relevance to energy and biological
interfaces. Plasmonic nanomaterials have been extensively utilized to amplify
this nonlinear response. Yet, material instability has constrained most studies
to gold, despite the significance of plasmonic metals such as copper for
catalysis. Here, we demonstrate stable and anisotropic SHG from monocrystalline
copper, overcoming long-standing challenges associated with surface
degradation. By leveraging an on-substrate synthesis approach that yields
atomically flat and oxidation-resistant Cu microflakes, we enable reliable SHG
measurements and reveal a strong cross-polarized response with C3v surface
symmetry. The SHG signal remains stable over several minutes of continuous
femtosecond excitation, highlighting the optical robustness of the Cu
microflakes. These results reinforce the viability of monocrystalline Cu as a
robust platform for nonlinear nanophotonics and surface-sensitive spectroscopy,
expanding the range of copper-based optical applications.

Abstract: Topological states, known for their robustness against disorder, offer
promising avenues for disorder-resistant devices. However, their intrinsic
spatial confinement at interfaces imposes geometric constraints that limit the
scalability of topological functionalities. Here, we propose a strategy to
overcome this limitation by using double-zero-index media to expand topological
interfaces. Although occupying finite space, these media are optically
equivalent to infinitesimal points, effectively altering the geometry of
topological interfaces and breaking conventional bulk-edge correspondence. This
strategy enables the spatial expansion of uniform topological states beyond
their native interface, offering new possibilities for topological photonic
devices. We have verified this behavior through numerical simulations and
microwave experiments in a two-dimensional photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
lattice. Our findings offer a universal framework to overcome the inherent
dimensional limitations of topological states, with implications extending to
general wave systems such as acoustic metamaterials.

Abstract: Narrow linewidth stabilized lasers are central to precision applications that
operate across the visible to short-wave infrared wavelengths, including
optical clocks, quantum sensing and computing, ultra-low noise microwave
generation, and fiber sensing. Today, these spectrally pure sources are
realized using multiple external cavity tabletop lasers locked to bulk-optic
free-space reference cavities. Integration of this technology will enable
portable precision applications with improved reliability and robustness. Here,
we report wavelength-flexible design and operation, over more than an octave
span, of an integrated coil-resonator-stabilized Brillouin laser architecture.
Leveraging a versatile two-stage noise reduction approach, we achieve low
linewidths and high stability with chip-scale laser designs based on the
ultra-low-loss, CMOS-compatible silicon nitride platform. We report operation
at 674 and 698 nm for applications to strontium neutral and trapped-ion clocks,
quantum sensing and computing, and at 1550 nm for applications to fiber sensing
and ultra-low phase noise microwave generation. Over this range we demonstrate
frequency noise reduction from 1 Hz to 10 MHz resulting in 1.0 Hz -17 Hz
fundamental and 181 Hz - 630 Hz integral linewidths and an Allan deviation of
6.5 x 10-13 at 1 ms for 674 nm, 6.0 x 10-13 at 15 ms for 698 nm, and 2.6 x10-13
at 15 ms for 1550 nm. This represents the lowest achieved linewidths and
highest stability for integrated stabilized Brillouin lasers over an order of
magnitude improvement in operating wavelength range. These results unlock the
potential of integrated, ultra-low-phase-noise stabilized lasers for precision
applications and further integration in systems-on-chip solutions.

Result: The results show that by varying R and l, the photonic and phononic bandgaps can be tuned by 18% and 21% respectively, which is a significant improvement and opens new possibilities for applications in sensors and filters without complex structures or exotic materials.

Conclusion: The study presents a promising architecture for optomechanical and acousto-optic applications, emphasizing the potential of geometrical parameters for controlling bandgaps for sensing purposes.

Abstract: The integration of photonic and phononic bandgaps within a single scalable
architecture promises transformative advances in optomechanical and
acousto-optic devices. Here, we design and simulate a two-dimensional hexagonal
lattice in silicon with air-gap holes that transition smoothly from circular to
triangular via tuneable geometrical parameters R and l. This transformation
enables suppression of both electromagnetic and elastic wave modes through
Bragg scattering and symmetry modulation. We demonstrate that systematic
variation of R and l allows tuning of photonic and phononic bandgaps by 18% and
21% respectively. This possibility of geometrical tuning of bandgaps provide
strong foundations for applications in Bragg filters, sensors etc. without the
need for complex defects and exotic materials.

Abstract: We propose advancing photonic in-memory computing through three-dimensional
photonic-electronic integrated circuits using phase-change materials (PCM) and
AlGaAs-CMOS technology. These circuits offer high precision (greater than 12
bits), scalability (greater than 1024 by 1024), and massive parallelism
(greater than 1 million operations) across the wavelength, spatial, and
temporal domains at ultra-low power (less than 1 watt per PetaOPS).
Monolithically integrated hybrid PCM-AlGaAs memory resonators handle
coarse-precision iterations (greater than 5-bit most significant bit precision)
through reversible PCM phase transitions. Electro-optic memristive tuning
enables fine-precision updates (greater than 8-bit least significant bit
precision), resulting in over 12-bit precision for in-memory computing. The use
of low-loss PCM (less than 0.01 dB per cm) and electro-optical tuning yields
memristive optical resonators with high Q-factors (greater than 1 million), low
insertion loss, and low tuning power. A W by W photonic tensor core composed of
PCM-AlGaAs memresonators performs general matrix multiplication (GEMM) across W
wavelengths from optical frequency combs, with minimal crosstalk and loss.
Hierarchical scaling in the wavelength domain (K) and spatial domain (L)
enables this system to address high-dimensional (N) scientific partial
differential equation (PDE) problems in a single constant-time operation,
compared to the conventional quadratic-time (N squared) computational
complexity.

Motivation: The importance of nanomechanical resonators lies in their application in sensing and metrology, particularly in measuring frequency fluctuations. The challenge addressed is minimizing frequency noise to improve the reliability and precision of these devices.

Method: The study involves manufacturing an ultracoherent perimeter-mode resonator integrated with an optical cavity. The researchers measure the intrinsic frequency fluctuations of the device and demonstrate the generation of a frequency difference signal through nonlinear optomechanical transduction on-chip.

Result: The resonator exhibits low thermomechanical noise and low detector noise, allowing detailed study of frequency fluctuations. The two mechanical modes show strong correlation, and the nonlinear effect generates a signal at the frequency difference with reduced noise, which can improves frequency tracking precision as shown in the experiment.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to the development of more reliable nanomechanical sensors and metrology tools by demonstrating effective noise reduction techniques and the utilization of nonlinear optomechanical effects on chip.

Abstract: Understanding and minimizing the sources of frequency noise in nanomechanical
resonators is crucial for many sensing applications. In this work, we report an
ultracoherent perimeter-mode nanomechanical resonator co-integrated with an
on-chip optical cavity. This device combines low thermomechanical force noise
and low detector noise, allowing us to study its intrinsic frequency
fluctuations in detail. We find that the fluctuations of two mechanical modes
are strongly correlated. Moreover, we demonstrate the generation of a signal at
the frequency difference between the two modes directly on chip via nonlinear
optomechanical transduction. This `difference signal' has vastly reduced
intrinsic frequency fluctuations and can be used for frequency tracking with
high precision, as we establish in a proof-of-principle experiment.

signifies the possibility to design wavefronts and time-modulated schemes with
up/down targeted frequency conversion and flat transmission spectra. The theory
is validated via simulations with driven RF resonators.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework for studying topology in photonics, integrating both near- and far-field behaviors. They've developed a real-space Hamiltonian that bridges global and local topologies, enabling the design of systems with controlled topological properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In photonics, topology is typically studied in the far-field, leading to complex models. This paper aims to simplify and unify the understanding by bridging global and local topologies using a real-space Hamiltonian.

Method: The authors propose a real-space Hamiltonian based on symmetry representations of the lattice. It can be adjusted between tight-binding and long-range models and allows independent control over eigenmode energies at high-symmetry points, facilitating the design of topologically rich structures.

Result: They show that the Hamiltonian can be constructed, allowing the connection between topological defects in the far-field and global invariants, and enables the design of structures with desired topological properties without being limited to photonics.

Conclusion: The framework provides a systematic way to design photonic systems with controlled topological invariants by leveraging symmetry and independent control over eigenmodes, sweeping away the need for computationally expensive methods.

Abstract: Topology in photonics comes in two distinct flavors: global and local. Global
topology considers invariants that are obtained by integrating over the energy
band, whereas local topology considers defects, typically vortices, in the
far-field emission. These topologies are described by a wide range of models
built in both real and momentum space, which are connected only by
computationally expensive numerical methods that lack physical intuition. Here
we propose a general framework based on a real-space Hamiltonian capable of
describing electric field as a vector in both near- and far fields, allowing us
to bridge between topological defects in the far-field and global topological
invariants. The proposed Hamiltonian is constructed from the
symmetry-representations of the lattice, is deformable to both atomic
localized-mode (tight-binding) and photonic delocalized-mode (long-range)
limits, and allows for independent control over the energies of eigenmodes of
different symmetries at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. This
symmetry-based approach enables the design of structures with almost arbitrary
topological properties and is not limited to photonic systems, but could apply
to any system with engineered real-space couplings.

Abstract: This study demonstrates that two-dimensional (2D) Bi2Te3 exhibits strong
light-matter interaction, enabling a broadband Kerr nonlinear optical response.
This characteristic is advantageous for nonreciprocal light propagation in
passive photonic isolators. Using Spatial Self-Phase Modulation (SSPM)
spectroscopy, self-induced diffraction patterns in the far field were observed
at excitation wavelengths of 650 nm, 532 nm, and 405 nm to calculate the
nonlinear refractive index (n2) and the third-order nonlinear optical
susceptibility (chi^(3)) of the synthesized 2D Bi2Te3.
  The results show that 2D Bi2Te3 possesses a significantly higher nonlinear
refractive index than graphene. The laser-induced hole coherence effect is
responsible for the large magnitude of the third-order nonlinear
susceptibility. Surface engineering techniques were also employed to enhance
the response speed of the photonic system.
  Complementary ab initio simulations were performed to gain further insight
into the observed nonlinear behavior. Leveraging the strong Kerr nonlinearity
of 2D Bi2Te3, a nonlinear photonic isolator that breaks time-reversal symmetry
and enables unidirectional light propagation was demonstrated. This work
establishes Bi2Te3 as a novel 2D material for nonlinear photonics, expanding
its potential applications in detectors, modulators, and optical switches.

Abstract: This thesis presents the development and characterisation of a
polarisation-multiplexing ring-cavity fibre laser for dual-comb generation. It
explores the underlying physics, implementation, and potential uses of this
innovative laser system, especially in LIDAR technology. Conventional
dual-frequency comb systems for metrology use two optical frequency combs
synchronised via complex feedback loops, which suffer from phase-locking issues
and raise system cost and fragility. In contrast, single-cavity dual comb
systems generate two combs with slightly different repetition rates in the same
cavity, ensuring mutual coherence and noise cancellation. However, these
systems often display unstable regimes and are typically demonstrated only in
laboratories. This thesis aims to design, build, characterise, and optimise a
single-cavity polarisation multiplexed fibre laser that produces dual optical
frequency combs with enough stability and precision for dual-comb LIDAR. The
system simplifies generation while enhancing applicability. Secondary goals
include analysing the laser intensity dynamics and collaborating with a company
to address commercial needs and challenges in LIDAR, particularly under harsh
conditions. Results show stable dual-comb generation with minimal drift (1 Hz
per hour) and operation over 250 hours. The system achieves sub-millimetre
precision in 5-metre ambiguity ranges with a fundamental frep of 39.25 MHz and
Delta frep of 869 Hz. The findings confirm the regime's robustness for
high-precision ranging while exposing some limits. The thesis also analyses
build-up and propagation dynamics in a single cavity, showing a two-stage
process and how initial spike energy evolution affects successful separation.
Finally, it offers mitigation strategies for LIDAR systems in harsh
environments.

### [96] [High-Resolution Dynamic Full-Field Optical Coherence Microscopy: Illuminating Intracellular Activity in Deep Tissue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03657)
*Erikas Tarvydas,Austeja Treciokaite,Egidijus Auksorius*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel high-resolution dynamic full-field optical coherence microscopy system capable of imaging deep tissues with nanometer-scale resolution. The setup uses advanced optics and real-time adjustments to maintain imaging quality in highly scattering tissues, allowing for the visualization of fine biological structures without fluorescent labels. The results demonstrate successfully imaging mouse liver and small intestine with unprecedented depth, revealing detailed structures not seen with conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of current d-FF-OCM in imaging deep tissues while maintaining high resolution. This has significant potential for advancing biological microscopy, especially in areas like pathology where deeper tissue analysis is crucial.

Method: The method involves using 100x oil-immersion objectives to increase numerical aperture, a high-brightness laser-pumped incoherent white light source for enhanced signal strength, real-time reference arm adjustments for maintaining contrast and focus depth, and imaging of specific tissues like liver and small intestine.

Result: The result is achieving nanometer-scale resolution up to 100 micrometers in highly scattering tissues, revealing detailed structures in ex vivo mouse tissues that were previously invisible with conventional OCT.

Conclusion: This advance provides a powerful tool for biological microscopy, opening new avenues for both fundamental research and intraoperative pathology applications.

Abstract: Dynamic full-field optical coherence microscopy (d-FF-OCM) is a label-free
imaging technique that captures intrinsic subcellular motions to generate
functional contrast. This dynamic approach yields images with fluorescence-like
contrast, highlighting active structures without the need for fluorescent
labels. However, current d-FF-OCM implementations struggle to image deep within
highly scattering tissues at high resolution. Here, we present a new
high-resolution d-FF-OCM system that overcomes these limitations, enabling much
deeper high-resolution imaging in such tissues. The setup uses 100x
oil-immersion objectives (NA = 1.25) and a high-brightness, laser-pumped
incoherent white light source to achieve nanometer-scale resolution at depths
up to approximately 100 micrometers in highly scattering samples. We also
incorporate real-time reference arm adjustment to maintain signal strength and
contrast as the focus moves deeper into the sample. Using this system, we
imaged fresh ex vivo mouse liver and small intestine with unprecedented depth
and detail. In these tissues, the dynamic contrast clearly revealed fine
structures not visible with conventional OCT-for example, the sinusoidal
microvasculature and organized cell layers in the liver, as well as neural
plexuses and crypts in the intestine-all visualized label-free. By bridging the
gap between high-resolution and deep imaging in highly scattering tissue, this
advance provides a powerful new tool for biological microscopy, with potential
applications from fundamental research to rapid intraoperative pathology.

Abstract: We deposited Nb3Sn film on the inner surface of a 2.6 GHz Nb superconducting
radiofrequency (SRF) cavity by co-sputtering using a composite of Nb and Sn
tube targets in a DC cylindrical magnetron sputtering system, followed by
thermal annealing of the coated cavity. An aluminum mockup cavity, replicating
a 2.6 GHz Nb SRF cavity geometry, was utilized to optimize the deposition
parameters, resulting in co-sputtered Nb-Sn films with Sn content of 32 - 42
at. % on the beam tubes and equator positions. Several annealing conditions
were investigated to improve the surface homogeneity of the Nb3Sn film. The
best co-sputtered Nb-Sn film was achieved after annealing at 600 C for 6 h,
followed by annealing at 950 C for 1 h. The best process was applied to a Nb
cavity, which was RF tested in cryogenic dewar. RF testing of the Nb3Sn-coated
cavity demonstrated the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) close to
the highest reported, achieving a Tc of 17.78 K. The Nb3Sn cavity underwent a
light Sn recoating process, followed by additional RF testing, resulting in
enhancement of the RF performance of the cavity, primarily due to the improved
surface homogeneity of the Nb3Sn coating.

Method: 使用几何方法分析光路轨迹，结合动力学绘图工具分析参数范围和相变。

Result: 找到了不同区域内的轨迹特性，如A、B、C三种类型，并观察到向 Chaos 的转变。

Conclusion: 光路轨迹随着γ和χ变化表现出不同的动力学行为， especially Chaos when both are足够大。

Abstract: We adapt ideas from geometrical optics and classical billiard dynamics to
consider particle trajectories with constant velocity on a cone with specular
reflections off an elliptical boundary formed by the intersection with a tilted
plane, with tilt angle $\gamma$. We explore the dynamics as a function of
$\gamma$ and the cone deficit angle $\chi$ that controls the sharpness of the
apex, where a point source of positive Gaussian curvature is concentrated. We
find regions of the ($\gamma, \chi$) plane where, depending on the initial
conditions, either (A) the trajectories sample the entire cone base and avoid
the apex region; (B) sample only a portion of the base region while again
avoiding the apex; or (C) sample the entire cone surface much more uniformly,
suggestive of ergodicity. The special case of an untilted cone displays only
type A trajectories which form a ring caustic at the distance of closest
approach to the apex. However, we observe an intricate transition to chaotic
dynamics dominated by Type (C) trajectories for sufficiently large $\chi$ and
$\gamma$. A Poincar\'e map that summarizes trajectories decomposed into the
geodesic segments interrupted by specular reflections provides a powerful
method for visualizing the transition to chaos. We then analyze the
similarities and differences of the path to chaos for conical billiards with
other area-preserving conservative maps.

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: This paper bridges a gap in acoustic radiation force studies by deriving nonlinear equations using SINDy and experimental data for large objects where Gorkov fails. The approach shows high accuracy and potential for future applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large objects not well understood in acoustic radiation forces, leading to the need for accurate modeling.

Method: Used Gorkov formulation with SINDy to derive and validate equations of motion. Experiments on the TinyLev levitator provided data for testing.

Result: SINDy reconstructed governing equations with high accuracy, improving theoretical models for large objects.

Conclusion: SINDy is effective for deriving equations from complex data, aiding inaccuracy of traditional methods for large particles.

Abstract: Many studies on acoustic radiation forces focus on characterizing the
behavior of acoustic fields. However, the dynamic response of objects,
particularly those larger than the wavelength, remains underexplored. Here we
bridge this gap by deriving nonlinear equations of motion for a trapped
spherical object under acoustic radiation forces and external excitation, where
the Gorkov formulation fails to provide accurate results. Using Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy), we derive the
corresponding nonlinear equation of motion from analytical time series data
obtained through the Gorkov formulation and external excitation for
acoustically small objects, and which recovers the governing equation with less
than 0.05% error in coefficient values compared to the analytical solution.. We
conduct experiments with the TinyLev levitator with external excitation to
generate time series for acoustically large particles. Then, SINDy is applied
to reconstruct governing equations from experimental data to see how external
excitation amplitude influences the dynamics of acoustically large objects. Our
findings demonstrate that the SINDy can effectively be used as a tool for
deriving governing equations from complex data to improve and refine
theoretical developments; in the present case, for acoustically large objects,
where the Gorkov formulation fails to provide an accurate prediction.

cognitive intelligence? Here we decode the fundamental information strategy
unit of brain, neural sphere, which agglomerates neurons into sphere to achieve

the mathematical principle of neural spheres to memorize and process through
different electrophysiological activities which depend on strange attractors. A
high-performance neuromorphic computing architecture of brain was then
constructed which predicts a storage capacity of $7.48\times 10^{18}$ Bytes and
a computational power of $6.24\times 10^{18}$ FLOPS for human brain. At this

*Severin Angerpointner,Richard Swiderski,Erwin Frey*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper shows that slow exchange of particles between reaction compartments can enhance self-assembly efficiency through a delay-facilitated mechanism, and provides a design framework for synthetic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding self-assembly in biological and synthetic systems is crucial, and previous studies focused on optimizing through reaction parameters or fast exchange. This paper explores the underexplored aspect of slow exchange, aiming to enhance efficiency.

Method: Developed a minimal model of self-assembly in two compartments to study the cooperative effect of slow particle exchange. Analyzed reaction and exchange dynamics, identified optimal scenarios for yield and time, and considered various geometries including diffusion.

Result: Slow exchange can enhance self-assembly efficiency under certain conditions, especially when isolated compartments fail to assemble. The effect is robust across geometries and relies on timescale separation and compartment design.

Conclusion: This mechanism offers new design strategies for synthetic self-assembly by utilizing spatial separation and slow particle exchange, with implications for both natural and engineered systems.

Abstract: Self-assembly processes in biological and synthetic biomolecular systems are
often governed by the spatial separation of biochemical processes. While
previous work has focused on optimizing self-assembly through fine-tuned
reaction parameters or using phase-separated liquid compartments with fast
particle exchange, the role of slow inter-compartmental exchange remains poorly
understood. Here, we demonstrate that slow particle exchange between reaction
domains can enhance self-assembly efficiency through a cooperative mechanism:
delay-facilitated assembly. Using a minimal model of irreversible self-assembly
in two compartments with distinct reaction and exchange dynamics, we identify
scenarios that maximize yield and minimize assembly time, even under conditions
where isolated compartments would fail to facilitate any self-assembly. The
mechanism relies on a separation of timescales between intra-compartmental
reactions and inter-compartmental exchange and is robust across a wide range of
geometries, including spatially extended domains with diffusive transport. We
demonstrate that this effect enables geometric control of self-assembly
processes through compartment volumes and exchange rates, eliminating the need
for fine-tuning local reaction rates. These results offer a conceptual
framework for leveraging spatial separation in synthetic self-assembly design
and suggest that biological systems may use slow particle exchange to improve
assembly efficiency.

Conclusion: The research enhances SPICE-based tools for SNSPDs by incorporating thermal effects, making it easier and faster to design these devices without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) exhibit complex
switching behaviors due to electrothermal feedback during the detection
process. Modeling and understanding these behaviors is integral for designing
superconducting devices; however, many models often prioritize accuracy over
computational speed and intuitive integration for circuit designers. Here, we
build upon a growing architecture of SPICE tools for superconducting nanowire
devices by capturing complex residual heating effects in a compact thermal
model of an SNSPD. We demonstrate that our model is comparable to more
complicated thermal models of superconducting nanowire devices, including
finite-element simulations, and is applicable for the fast development of SNSPD
circuits.

Conclusion: 矢量速度可作为声波传输的 polar-like 度量，为 next-gen 声学技术提供新方法。

Abstract: Acoustic communication is indispensable for underwater networks, deep ocean
exploration, and biological monitoring, environments where electromagnetic
waves become impractical. However, unlike the latter, whose vector polarization
naturally supports multiple information channels, acoustic waves are
longitudinal and have traditionally relied almost exclusively on a single
scalar pressure channel, posing a fundamental limit on their data-carrying
capacity. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the vector
velocity of acoustic waves can serve as a polarization-like physical degree of
freedom. Using its three components as mutually independent communication
channels and demodulating them with a single vector sensor, we achieve
reliable, high-capacity, and real-time information transmission. Multiplexing
velocity adds a new dimension to acoustic communication. When combined with
other physical degrees of freedom (frequency, phase, etc.), this approach can
significantly enhance the information capacity, opening new avenues for
next-generation acoustic technology.

Abstract: Magnons with momentum-dependent chirality are a key signature of
altermagnets. We identify bicircular light as a smoking-gun optical probe for
chiral altermagnetic magnons, selectively targeting their quantum geometry
induced by an alteration of magnonic chirality. We show that in $d$-wave
altermagnets, under a canting magnetic field, the altermagnetic magnons realize
a nontrivial quantum geometry, resulting in an enhancement of the nonlinear
second-order light-magnon interactions. We find that the scattering of
bicircular pulses probes the present magnon quantum geometry, even if the
magnonic topology is trivial. Hence, our findings establish bicircular Raman
response as an optical effect of choice to identify altermagnetic magnons. As
such, we propose a universal experimental protocol to distinguish altermagnets
from antiferromagnets by detecting their magnon chirality patterns with light,
independently of the underlying magnon topology.

TL;DR: The paper discusses an optimized method for producing quantum diamond surfaces with NV centers, achieving high density and homogeneity for scalable applications in quantum sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of scalable quantum diamond substrates can enable cost-effective quantum sensing and imaging technologies at the microscale.

Method: Electrostatic self-assembly method to fabricate dense and homogenous fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) layers on substrates.

Result: Achieved optimized conditions for FND density with high magnetic imaging capabilities.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a scalable approach for quantum sensing on various surfaces.

Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is emerging as a powerful tool
for imaging magnetic and electric signals at the microscale and below. However,
most imaging demonstrations thus far have relied on costly, millimeter-sized
bulk diamond substrates, which cannot be easily scaled or integrated with other
materials. Here, we report a scalable method for fabricating NV-containing
dense and homogenous fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) layers through electrostatic
self-assembly and demonstrate the utility of the FND layers for magnetic
imaging. We investigate the effect of FND concentration in suspension,
substrate immersion time, and solvent pH on the FND density on the substrate.
We identify optimized self-assembly conditions that maximize the FND density
while minimizing aggregation. Using FND layers on a quartz substrate, we
demonstrate magnetic field and magnetic noise imaging at the microscale, based
on NV optically detected magnetic resonance magnetometry and T$_1$ relaxometry,
respectively. Our results provide a direction for the development of
cost-effective and scalable FND layers and surface coatings. This paves the way
for on-demand quantum sensing and imaging on a broad range of surfaces based on
NV centers and other diamond quantum emitters.

### [109] [Observation of Embedded Topology in a Trivial Bulk via Projective Crystal Symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03033)
*Hau Tian Teo,Yang Long,Hong-yu Zou,Kailin Song,Haoran Xue,Yong Ge,Shou-qi Yuan,Hong-xiang Sun,Baile Zhang*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates a new bulk-boundary correspondence where a trivial bulk gives rise to nontrivial boundary states through embedded topology, using projective crystal symmetry. They achieve a 3D system with zero-dimensional topological states, extending the correspondence chain. This challenges previous reliance on nontrivial bulk topologies and paves the way for new topological devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of topological phases of matter and their applications in quantum devices is a major focus in condensed matter physics. Bulk-boundary correspondence is a foundational concept, and this paper challenges existing assumptions by showing a case where a trivial bulk leads to nontrivial boundaries.

Method: The experimental setup uses an acoustic crystal platform, leveraging projective crystal symmetry to induce embedded topology. They study a 3D system to achieve zero-dimensional topological states, verifying their results experimentally.

Result: They successfully demonstrate a new bulk-boundary correspondence starting from a trivial bulk, observe zero-dimensional topological states, and extend the correspondence chain to three dimensions.

Conclusion: This study fundamentally changes the understanding of bulk-boundary correspondence, offering new possibilities for designing topological materials and quantum devices by circumventing the need for a nontrivial bulk. The acoustic crystal platform and 3D system setup are key advancements in the field.

Abstract: Bulk-boundary correspondence is the foundational principle of topological
physics, first established in the quantum Hall effect, where a $D$-dimensional
topologically nontrivial bulk gives rise to $(D-1)$-dimensional boundary
states. The advent of higher-order topology has generalized this principle to a
hierarchical chain, enabling topological states to appear at $(D-2)$ or even
lower-dimensional boundaries. To date, all known realizations of topological
systems must require a topologically nontrivial bulk to initiate the chain of
action for bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, in an acoustic crystal platform,
we experimentally demonstrate an exception to this paradigm--embedded topology
in a trivial bulk--where the bulk-boundary correspondence originates from a
trivial bulk. Rather than relying on global symmetries, we employ projective
crystal symmetry, which induces nontrivial topology not at the outset in the
$D$-dimensional bulk, but midway through the correspondence hierarchy in
lower-dimensional boundaries. We further realize a three-dimensional system
exhibiting embedded topology that supports zero-dimensional topological states,
achieving the longest possible chain of action for such an unconventional
bulk-boundary correspondence in physical space. Our work experimentally
establishes a new form of bulk-boundary correspondence initiated from a trivial
bulk, opening additional degrees of freedom for the design of robust
topological devices.

Abstract: We theoretically study the thermoelectric transport S in a double-layer
bilayer graphene (BLG-GaAs-BLG) system on dielectric substrates (h-BN, Al2O3,
HfO2). Electrons interact with GaAs acoustic phonons via both the deformation
potential (acDP) and piezoelectric (acPE) scattering. Results show that
piezoelectric scattering dominates the total transport, especially at low
carrier density and high dielectric constant. Substrate dielectric constant
significantly influences thermopower S, and the thermopower of the materials is
in the order of HfO2 > Al2O3 > h-BN. When densities on two BLG layers are
unequal, the contribution from acDP scattering Sd decreases (increases) at low
(high) densities versus equal densities, while acPE scattering Sg remains
stable, making S largely Sg-dependent. Increasing interlayer distance d
enhances S, while higher temperature boosts Sd (notably at low densities) with
minimal effect on Sg. These insights and substrate-dependent trends demonstrate
substrate engineering as a key parameter for optimizing BLG thermoelectric
devices

TL;DR: The paper discusses constructing altermagnetic materials using non-metal organic frameworks, showing successful DFT calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of creating altermagnetic materials, which could have applications in quantum spintronic devices, by using organic frameworks.

Method: The authors propose using dibenzo[ef,kl]heptalene as a building block along with DFT calculations.

Result: DFT confirms a spin-polarized ground state and d-wave symmetry in the valence and conduction bands, enabling altermagnetic properties.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for synthesizing altermagnetic organic frameworks through non-metallic organic networks.

Abstract: Altermagnetism stands as a third type of collinear magnetic order, whose band
structure combines a net zero magnetization with a non-relativistic
spin-splitting caused by a broken time reversal symmetry. So far, the strategy
to design platforms displaying altermagnetism has relied mostly on inorganic
crystals with d-metals as spin centers, where a representative example is the
two-dimensional square lattice with antiparallel D2h magnetic blocks related by
a pi/2 rotation. Despite the fact that there is no strong requirement for the
magnetic atoms to be metals, the construction of an altermagnetic framework
with light elements like carbon is challenging due to symmetric constrictions.
We show how it is possible to overcome this by including non-alternant rings in
pi-conjugated nanographenes. More specifically, dibenzo[ef,kl]heptalene, an S =
1 pi-conjugated hydrocarbon consisting of a graph of two fused heptagons and
hexagons, represents a suitable building block for an altermagnetic 2D crystal.
In this work, we confirm this hypothesis with DFT calculations of the spin
polarized band structure, presenting a spin compensated ground state with
broken time reversal symmetry, and a d-wave symmetry of the first valence and
conduction bands. Consistent results are obtained for covalent organic
frameworks based on dibenzo[ef,kl]heptalene units connected by linkers, paving
the way for the realization of organic altermagnetic materials.

Abstract: Light-induced coherent phonons provide a powerful platform for ultrafast
control of material properties. However, the microscopic theory and quantum
geometric nature of this phenomenon remain underexplored. Here, we develop a
fully quantum-mechanical framework based on Feynman diagrams to systematically
describe the generation of coherent phonons by light. We identify a dominant
second-order, double-resonant process in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors that
efficiently couples light to both electronic and phononic excitations.
Crucially, we uncover the quantum geometric origin, encoded in the
electron-phonon coupling (EPC) shift vector and the EPC quantum geometric
tensor. Applying our theory to ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ and SnSe, we demonstrate
the potential for light-induced modulation of ferroelectric polarization driven
by coherent phonons. This work provides fundamental insights for designing
efficient optical control strategies for both coherent phonons and
ferroelectric polarization.

Abstract: We investigate low energy excitons in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene
encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN/R5G/hBN), focusing on the regime
at the experimental twist angle $\theta = 0.77^\circ$ and with an applied
electric field. We introduce a new low-energy two-band model of rhombohedral
graphene that captures the band structure more accurately than previous models
while keeping the number of parameters low. Using this model, we show that the
centres of the exciton Wannier functions are displaced from the moir\'e unit
cell origin by a quantised amount -- they are instead localised at
$C_3$-symmetric points on the boundary. We also find that the exciton shift is
electrically tunable: by varying the electric field strength, the exciton
Wannier centre can be exchanged between inequivalent corners of the moir\'e
unit cell. Our results suggest the possibility of detecting excitonic corner or
edge modes, as well as novel excitonic crystal defect responses in hBN/R5G/hBN.
Lastly, we find that the excitons in hBN/R5G/hBN inherit excitonic Berry
curvature from the underlying electronic bands, enriching their semiclassical
transport properties. Our results position rhombohedral graphene as a
compelling tunable platform for probing exciton topology in moir\'e materials.

Abstract: In electrical metrology, the quantum Hall effect is accessed at the Landau
level filling factor {\nu} = 2 plateau to define and disseminate the unit of
electrical resistance (ohm). The robustness of the plateau is only exhibited at
this Landau level filling factor and thus places a constraint on the quantized
resistances that are accessible when constructing quantized Hall array
resistance standards (QHARS) using epitaxial graphene on SiC. To overcome
devices constrained by using Hall elements in series or in parallel, this work
approaches the fabrication of a cross-square network configuration, which is
similar to but departs slightly from conventional wye-delta designs and
achieves significantly higher effective quantized resistance outputs.
Furthermore, the use of pseudofractal-like recursion amplifies the ability to
reach high resistances. QHARS devices designed as the ones here are shown to
achieve an effective resistance of 55.81 M$\Omega$ in one configuration and
27.61 G$\Omega$ in another, with a hypothetically projected 317.95 T$\Omega$
that could be accessed with more specialized equipment. Teraohmmeter
measurements reveal the limits of conventional wet cryogenic systems due to
resistance leakage. Ultimately, this work builds on the capability of realizing
exceptionally high-value quantum resistance standards.

### [116] [Out-of-equilibrium nonlinear model of thermoelectricity in superconducting tunnel junctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03528)
*Leonardo Lucchesi,Federico Paolucci*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper presents a more comprehensive model for thermoelectricity in superconducting tunnel junctions that accounts for out-of-equilibrium conditions, showing that the traditional linear model fails at high power, leading to what the paper refers to as 'saturated and inverted' behavior. This suggests that for practical experimental setups with higher power, the behavior deviates significantly from predictions of the linear model, indicating the need for a nonlinear approach. The authors also establish a new criterion to detect nonlinear thermoelectric effects in parameter space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of thermoelectricity in superconducting tunnel junctions is crucial for advancing small-size thermoelectric devices, particularly given the increasing demand for miniaturization in electronics. The traditional linear model has limitations, especially at higher power levels, which could affect the efficiency and practicality of these devices. The paper's aim is to address these limitations by proposing a more accurate model to better capture real-world scenarios in experiments and applications.

Method: The authors developed an out-of-equilibrium numerical model that accounts for nonlinear effects. This model was validated against a linear model in the linear regime to identify discrepancies. Simulations were conducted under various conditions relevant to practical experiments to compare the predictions of both models, focusing on the behavior at high power to observe saturation and inversion of the junction's thermoelectric response.

Result: The study found significant differences between the linear and nonlinear models, particularly at higher power levels. The nonlinear model demonstrated that thermoelectricity in superconducting tunnel junctions does not simply follow the linear model, especially when power exceeds certain thresholds. The junction's behavior becomes inverted, meaning the thermoelectric effect reverses its sign and magnitude, indicating a departure from textbook predictions. This suggests that while the linear model is useful under low-power conditions, it fails to describe thermoelectric phenomena accurately in higher power scenarios, which is critical for the design and optimization of thermoelectric devices.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for a more accurate out-of-equilibrium model to study thermoelectricity in superconducting tunnel junctions, as traditional linear theories break down for typical experimental conditions with higher power. The authors suggest that the observed inversion in behavior is a new phenomenon requiring further experimental investigation, implying that nonlinear thermoelectric effects should be considered in the design of future thermoelectric devices for better performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Thermoelectricity in superconducting tunnel junctions has always been studied
under the hypothesis of equilibrium between the cold side and the thermal bath,
usually in the linear regime. We define a more complete out-of-equilibrium
nonlinear numerical model that reduces to the equilibrium linear model in the
low-power limit. We find that the linear model does not correctly describe the
behavior of superconducting tunnel junctions for parameters that are reasonable
in practical experimental setups. Subsequently, we present the qualitative and
quantitative differences between the models, discovering that for high power,
the junction saturates and then inverts its behavior. Finally, we also clarify
the difference between linear and nonlinear thermoelectricity and devise a new
criterion to find nonlinear thermoelectricity in the parameter space.

Abstract: Conventional topological classification theory dictates that time-reversal
symmetry confines the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
classification, permitting only a single pair of gapless helical edge states.
Here, we utilize the recently discovered altermagnetism to circumvent this
fundamental constraint. We demonstrate the realization of a unique QSH phase
possessing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states in altermagnetic
multilayers. This exotic QSH phase, characterized by a mirror-spin Chern
number, emerges from the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and $d$-wave
altermagnetic ordering. Moreover, using first-principles calculations, we
identify altermagnetic Fe$_2$Se$_2$O multilayers as promising material
candidates, in which the number of gapless helical edge states scales linearly
with the number of layers, leading to a correspondingly large, exactly
quantized, and experimentally accessible spin-Hall conductance. Our findings
unveil a new mechanism for stabilizing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge
states, significantly expanding the scope of QSH effects, and provide a
blueprint for utilizing altermagnetism to engineer desired topological phases.
