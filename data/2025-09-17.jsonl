However, sharing data,\nespecially sensitive information like personal genomic sequences, raises\nsignificant privacy concerns. Quantum federated learning offers a way to\ncollaboratively train QNN models without exposing private data. However, it\nfaces major limitations, including high communication overhead and the need to\nretrain models when the task is modified. To overcome these challenges, we\npropose a privacy-preserving QNN training scheme that utilizes mixed quantum\nstates to encode ensembles of data. This approach allows for the secure sharing\nof statistical information while safeguarding individual data points. QNNs can\nbe trained directly on these mixed states, eliminating the need to access raw\ndata. Building on this foundation, we introduce protocols supporting\nmulti-party collaborative QNN training applicable across diverse domains. Our\napproach enables secure QNN training with only a single round of communication\nper participant, provides high training speed and offers task generality, i.e.,\nnew analyses can be conducted without reacquiring information from\nparticipants. We present the theoretical foundation of our scheme's utility and\nprivacy protections, which prevent the recovery of individual data points and\nresist membership inference attacks as measured by differential privacy. We\nthen validate its effectiveness on three different datasets with a focus on\ngenomic studies with an indication of how it can used in other domains without\nadaptation."}

The field opens a topological gap in\nthe Majorana fermion spectrum and leads to a sequence of topological phase\ntransitions before the field polarised state is reached. At mean field level\nthe gap first closes at the three $M$ points in the Brillouin zone, where the\nMajorana fermions form Dirac cones, resulting in a change of Chern number by\nthree. An odd number of Dirac fermions in the infrared is unusual and requires\nBerry curvature compensation in the UV, which occurs via topological, ring-like\nhybridisation gaps with higher-energy bands. We perform a renormalisation-group\nanalysis of the topological phase transition at the three $M$ points within the\nYukawa theory, allowing for intra- and inter-valley fluctuations of the\nspin-liquid bond operators.

To evaluate the dispersion of density-wave\nstates, we derive the commutation algebra of spinful LLL-projected density\noperators on the sphere, which enables us to extract the gap of the\ndensity-wave excitations from the numerically computed density-density\ncorrelation function, i.e., the static structure factor, of the FQH ground\nstate.

Here, we generalize the study to the scenario\nof a rotating hair black hole within Horndeski gravity and probe the effects of\nthe hairy parameter on the EVPA. For a fixed inclination, the hairy parameter\nenhances the observed EVPA in the slowly rotating case, but decreases it in the\nrapidly rotating case. For a fixed black hole spin, the influence of the hairy\nparameter on the observed EVPA under different observer inclinations is further\nmodulated by the azimuthal angle of the observed polarization vector. The hairy\nparameter's impact is more distinct in the low inclination case as the\nazimuthal angle lies within a specific range, but is almost independent of the\nobserver inclination as the azimuthal angle is beyond this specific range.\nFurthermore, the dependence of the hairy parameter's impact on the EVPA is\nstronger with respect to the black hole spin than to the inclination angle.\nThese results could help to further understand the near-horizon polarized\nimages and Horndeski gravity."}

By employing two complementary measures: the\nQuantum Fisher Information (QFI) flow and the Breuer--Laine--Piilo (BLP)\nmeasure, we demonstrate that QFI flow may fail to witness memory effects in\nweak-coupling and near-resonant regimes, whereas the BLP measure still detects\ninformation backflow. Furthermore, external modulation of the interaction\nkernel produces qualitatively richer behavior, including irregular and\nfrequency-dependent revivals of non-Markovianity. These results clarify the\nphysical origin of memory effects, highlight the limitations of single-witness\napproaches, and suggest that stochasticity and modulation can be harnessed to\nengineer robust, noise-resilient quantum technologies."}

Moreover, we assume that the early Universe can be\ndescribed with fewer initial symmetries, thus we abandon the isotropy\nassumption and instead explore anisotropic universes, beginning with the\nsimplest one, namely Bianchi I (BI). The presence of small initial fluctuations\nin the early universe can be well described by perturbations around a\nhomogeneous background. GR is a constrained system, and we apply the so-called\nDirac procedure for constrained systems to derive a gauge-invariant Hamiltonian\nformulation suitable for quantization. In this work, we present how this\nprocedure can be extended to a generic background and its relation to the\nKuchar decomposition. Subsequently, we apply this formulation to a BI universe,\nobtaining new and interesting results on the gauge-invariant representation of\nmatter and geometry perturbations. Contrary to the FLRW case, in which all the\nmodes decouple, in BI we see that scalar and tensor modes do not decouple. We\nshow that new types of gauge-fixing conditions exit in this case. For instance,\na gravitational wave can be encoded into scalar modes, by introducing a new\ngauge which is not valid in FLRW. Furthermore, we make a first step towards a\nconsistent and unified quantization of the composite system made of a\nbackground mode and perturbation modes. Specifically, we study tensor modes in\na FLRW universe. We focus on the relation between the choice of internal time\nof the universe and the quantum evolution it undergoes. Our results indicate\nthat the time reparametrization invariance in general relativity affects the\nquantum evolution of the background and perturbation modes.

Inspired by techniques from natural language processing (NLP), our\napproach first selects a compact gate dictionary by optimizing the entangling\npower of two-qubit gates. We identify the iSWAP gate as a key element that\nsignificantly enhances sample efficiency, resulting in a minimal gate set of\n{I, SWAP, iSWAP}. Building on this, we implement a recurrent neural network\ntrained via reinforcement learning to generate high-performing quantum\ncircuits. The trained model demonstrates strong generalization ability,\ndiscovering efficient circuit architectures with low sample complexity beyond\nthe training set. Our NLP-inspired framework offers broad potential for quantum\ncomputation, including extracting properties of logical qubits in quantum error\ncorrection."}
