This phase is\ncharacterized by a Bogoliubov spectrum consisting of three modes: one mode is\ngapped, while the other two are gapless. When $a_0$ is modulated and half of\nthe modulation frequency lies below the gapped mode, density and spin Faraday\npatterns emerge. In that case, in quasi-one-dimension, the spin texture is\ncharacterized by periodic domains of opposite $z$-polarizations. When driven\nabove the gap, the spin texture is characterized by random orientations of spin\nvectors along the condensate axis. Qualitatively new features appear in the\ndriven quasi-two-dimensional condensate. For instance, when driven above the\ngap, the spin textures are characterized by anomalous vortices and antivortices\nthat do not exhibit phase winding in individual magnetic components. Below the\ngap, the spin texture exhibits irregular ferromagnetic patches with opposite\npolarizations. The spatial spin-spin correlations in quasi-one-dimension\nexhibit a Gaussian envelope, whereas they possess a Bessel function dependence\nin quasi-two-dimension. Under the $a_2$-modulation, the density patterns\ndominate irrespective of the driving frequency, unless the spin-dependent\ninteraction strength is sufficiently smaller than that of the spin-independent\ninteraction. The intriguing scenario of competing instability can emerge when\nboth scattering lengths are simultaneously modulated. Finally, we show that the\ncompeting instabilities result in a complex relationship between the population\ntransfer and the strength of the quadratic Zeeman field, while keeping all\nother parameters constant."}

On such hardware, it is useful to\nensure that computations use only gates that maintain the Z-bias (or X-bias) in\nthe noise. This is so that quantum error-correcting codes tailored for\nbiased-noise models can be used to provide fault-tolerance on these platforms.\nIn this paper, we follow up on the recent work of Fellous-Asiani et al. (npj\nQuantum Inf., 2025) in studying the structure and properties of bias-preserving\ngates. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) We give a novel\ncharacterization of Z-bias-preserving gates based on their decomposition as a\nlinear combination of Pauli operators. (2) We show that any Z-bias-preserving\ngate can be approximated arbitrarily well using only gates from the set\n{X,R_z(\\theta),CNOT,CCNOT}, where \\theta is any irrational multiple of 2\\pi.\n(3) We prove, by drawing a connection with coherence resource theory, that any\nZ-bias-preserving logical operator acting on the logical qubits of a\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code can be realized by applying Z-bias-preserving\ngates on the physical qubits.

Here we\ndemonstrate, through comprehensive finite element and variational Monte-Carlo\nmodelling, that a reconfigurable three-dimensional array of needle shaped beams\ncan selectively switch the quantum optical response of individual InAs nanorods\nembedded in GaAs. By tuning the local non resonant intensity pattern the\nexciton and biexciton energies were calculated, electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT) windows were examined, and correspondingly near-field\ndiffraction carpets were dynamically reshaped. A single parameter the\nactivation ratio between illuminated and dark nanorods provides continuous\ncontrol over photoluminescence peak position (80 meV) and EIT bandwidth (six\ntimes). We further predict fully programmable Talbot self-imaging in nanorod\narrays with sub-wavelength pitch. Importantly, the observed Talbot carpets\nenable spatially resolved identification of which nanorods were excited,\noffering a powerful diagnostic for verifying structured-light activation\nschemes. The concept offers a low crosstalk, wafer scale route toward\nreconfigurable quantum emitters, tunable diffractive optics and on-chip\nslow-light components."}

In continuum fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, these excitations\nare described by the chiral Luttinger liquid ($\\chi$LL) theory.

From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual\nof JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the level spacing statistics of the\nspectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low\ntemperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by\nthe symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT.\nThrough numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the\nSYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus\nleading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the quenched entropy at low\ntemperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled\nwith matter, which is modeled by the $\\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model.\nNumerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows\nus to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large\nparticle number limit."}

The low energy of microwave photons, the natural signal\npath for superconducting quantum devices, makes their detection much harder\nthan for visible light. Despite impressive progress in recent years and the\nproposal and realization of a number of different detector architectures, the\nreliable detection of a single itinerant microwave photon remains an open\ntopic.\n  Here, we investigate and simulate a detailed protocol for single-photon\nmultiplication and subsequent amplification and detection. At its heart lies a\nJosephson-photonics device which uses inelastic Cooper-pair tunneling driven by\na dc bias in combination with the energy of an incoming photon to create\nmultiple photons, thus compensating for the low-energy problem. Our analysis\nprovides clear design guidelines for utilizing such devices, which have\npreviously been operated in an amplifier mode with a continuous wave input, for\ncounting photons. Combining a formalism recently developed by M{\\o}lmer to\ndescribe the full quantum state of in- and outgoing photon pulses with\nstochastic Schr\\\"odinger equations, we can describe the full multiplication and\ndetection protocol and calculate performance parameters, such as detection\nprobabilities and dark count rates. With optimized parameters, a high\npopulation of a single output mode can be achieved that can then be easily\ndistinguished from vacuum noise in heterodyne measurements of quadratures with\na conventional linear amplifier. Realistic devices with two multiplication\nstages with multiplication of $16$ reach for an impinging Gaussian pulse of\nlength $T$ a detection probability of $84.5\\%$ with a dark count rate of\n$10^{-3}/T$, and promise to outperform competing schemes."}

Jose", "Rejish Nath"], "title": "Faraday patterns, spin textures, spin-spin correlations and competing instabilities in a driven spin-1 antiferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensate", "comment": "11 pages, 12 figures", "summary": "We study the formation of transient Faraday patterns and spin textures in\ndriven quasi-one-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional spin-1 Bose-Einstein\ncondensates under the periodic modulation of $s$-wave scattering lengths $a_0$\nand $a_2$, starting from the anti-ferromagnetic phase. This phase is\ncharacterized by a Bogoliubov spectrum consisting of three modes: one mode is\ngapped, while the other two are gapless. When $a_0$ is modulated and half of\nthe modulation frequency lies below the gapped mode, density and spin Faraday\npatterns emerge. In that case, in quasi-one-dimension, the spin texture is\ncharacterized by periodic domains of opposite $z$-polarizations. When driven\nabove the gap, the spin texture is characterized by random orientations of spin\nvectors along the condensate axis. Qualitatively new features appear in the\ndriven quasi-two-dimensional condensate. For instance, when driven above the\ngap, the spin textures are characterized by anomalous vortices and antivortices\nthat do not exhibit phase winding in individual magnetic components. Below the\ngap, the spin texture exhibits irregular ferromagnetic patches with opposite\npolarizations. The spatial spin-spin correlations in quasi-one-dimension\nexhibit a Gaussian envelope, whereas they possess a Bessel function dependence\nin quasi-two-dimension. Under the $a_2$-modulation, the density patterns\ndominate irrespective of the driving frequency, unless the spin-dependent\ninteraction strength is sufficiently smaller than that of the spin-independent\ninteraction. The intriguing scenario of competing instability can emerge when\nboth scattering lengths are simultaneously modulated. Finally, we show that the\ncompeting instabilities result in a complex relationship between the population\ntransfer and the strength of the quadratic Zeeman field, while keeping all\nother parameters constant."}

We investigate how the information encoded in two paradigmatic states,\nthe Laughlin and Moore-Read states, is affected by density decoherence --\ncoupling of local charge density to non-thermal noise. We identify a critical\nfilling factor $\\nu_c$, above which the quantum information remains fully\nrecoverable for arbitrarily strong decoherence. The $\\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state\nand $\\nu = 1/2$ Moore-Read state both lie within this range. Below $\\nu_c$ both\nclasses of states undergo a decoherence induced\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thousless (BKT) transition into a critical decohered\nphase. For Laughlin states, information encoded in the topological ground state\nmanifold degrades continuously with decoherence strength inside this critical\nphase, vanishing only in the limit of infinite decoherence strength. On the\nother hand, quantum information encoded in the fusion space of non-abelian\nanyons of the Moore-Read states remains fully recoverable for arbitrary strong\ndecoherence even beyond the BKT transition. These results lend further support\nto the promise of non-Abelian FQH states as platforms for topological quantum\ncomputation and raises the question of how errors in such states can be\ncorrected."}
