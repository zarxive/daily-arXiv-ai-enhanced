In this study, we developed two types of\nscintillator-integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (SCI-IMPs),\none incorporating barium fluoride, and the other bismuth germanate, to enable\nsimultaneous high-precision timing and energy measurements. To evaluate their\nperformance over a wide energy range from keV- to GeV-scale, electron-positron\nannihilation gamma rays and cosmic ray muons were used. For energy\nmeasurements, both detectors achieved an energy resolution of approximately 35%\nat 511 keV. For timing measurements using 511 keV, coincidence time resolutions\n(CTRs) of approximately 50 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) were obtained\nfor both detectors. In contrast, for cosmic ray muon experiments where cosmic\nray muon energy is typically on the order of GeV, CTRs were measured to be 25.1\nand 16.8 ps FWHM for barium fluoride- and bismuth germanate-based detectors,\nrespectively. The versatile scintillator-integration technique established in\nthis study can broaden the applicability of the newly developed SCI-IMPs. In\nparticular, these results demonstrate that the developed detectors push the\nboundaries of timing performance while retaining energy measurement and hold\npromise for future applications in fundamental physics experiments and medical\nimaging."}

The model,\nwhich includes spin-orbit physics and has a multi-orbital $t_{2g}$ band\nstructure that is common to transition-metal perovskites, is applied to\nBaTiO$_3$. We find that the 2DEG develops an Ising spin texture, with spins\naligned perpendicular to the domain wall. We contrast this with the Rashba spin\ntexture that should emerge at weakly conducting $90^\\circ$ head-to-tail domain\nwalls. We then show that the head-to-head domain walls should have a measurable\nEdelstein effect (that is, a current-induced magnetization), even in the dilute\nlimit and at room temperature, and describe a simple experiment to measure it."}

Utilizing a continuum model, closely based upon the\nseminal Bistritzer-MacDonald model, that captures the essential physics of\nlow-energy moir\\'e bands, we calculate the spin current response to the\ndeformation in terms of the familiar Berry phase formalism. The resulting\nmoir\\'e superlattice potential modulates the electronic band structure, leading\nto emergent topological phases and novel transport properties such as quantized\npiezo responses both for spin and charge transport. This approach allows us to\ntune the system across different topological regimes and to explore the\npiezo-spintronic responses as a function of the band topology. When inversion\nsymmetry is broken either by a sublattice potential $V$, alignment with an hBN\nsubstrate, uniaxial strain, or structural asymmetry present in the moir\\'e\nsuperlattice, the system acquires a finite Berry curvature that is opposite in\nthe $K$ and $K'$ valleys (protected by valley time reversal symmetry). In\ncontrast, for strain, the valley-contrasting nature of the pseudo-gauge field\nensures that the quantized response is robust and proportional to the sum of\nthe valley Chern numbers. These notable physical properties make these systems\npromising candidates for groundbreaking spintronic and valleytronic devices."}

Rev. Lett., 8+13 pages, 3+7 figures", "summary": "The fractional quantum Hall state (FQHS) observed in the lowest Landau level\nat filling factor $\\nu=1/2$ in wide quantum wells has been enigmatic for\ndecades because the two-dimensional electron system (2DES) has a bilayer charge\ndistribution but with significant interlayer tunneling. Of particular interest\nis whether the 1/2 FQHS in this system has a one-component (1C) or\ntwo-component (2C) origin; these are typically identified as the Pfaffian\n(non-Abelian) or the $\\Psi_{331}$ (Abelian) FQHSs, respectively. We report here\nour experimental study of the evolution of the correlated states of an\nultrahigh-quality 2DES confined to a 72.5-nm-wide GaAs quantum well. At the\nlowest densities, the 2DES displays only odd-denominator FQHSs, and the ground\nstate at $\\nu = 1/2$ is a composite fermion Fermi sea. As the density is\nincreased, a FQHS emerges at $\\nu = 1/2$, and becomes very strong. In a finite\ndensity range where the 1/2 FQHS is strongest, we also observe its daughter\nFQHSs at $\\nu = 8/17$ and 7/13, consistent with the theoretically expected\ndaughter states of a Pfaffian 1/2 FQHS. At the highest densities, the 2DES\nbecomes 2C, signaled by the emergence of a bilayer Wigner crystal state and the\ntransitions of FQHSs flanking $\\nu=1/2$. The 1/2 FQHS remains robust near this\ntransition and, notably, its charge transport energy gap exhibits an\n\\textit{upward} cusp with a maximum value of about 6 K on the 1C side of the\ntransition; this is the largest gap reported for any even-denominator FQHS. Our\nobservation of the transition of the 2DES ground states near $\\nu=1/2$ to 2C\nstates at high densities, and our measurements of the robustness of the 1/2\nFQHS against charge distribution asymmetry, suggest that the 1/2 FQHS also\nmakes a transition from 1C to 2C. Such a transition from a non-Abelian to\nAbelian state can open avenues for topological quantum information and quantum\ncriticality."}

Essentially two families\nof data hiding states were known prior to this work: Werner states and random\nstates. Hiding Werner states can be made either separable or globally perfectly\northogonal, but not both -- separability comes at the price of orthogonality\nbeing only approximate.

A challenging question in such\nmodels is how to keep the shear under control in the contracting phase, as it\nis well-known that the shear grows as fast as $1/a^{6}$ toward the bounce,\nwhere $a$ is the expansion factor of the universe. A common approach is to\nintroduce a scalar field with an ekpyrotic-like potential which becomes\nnegative near the bounce, so the effective equation of state of the scalar\nfield will be greater than one, whereby it dominates the shear and other matter\nfields in the bounce region. As a result, a homogeneous and isotropic universe\ncan be produced. In this paper, we study how the ekpyrotic mechanism affects\nthe inflationary phase in both loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and a modified loop\nquantum cosmological model (mLQC-I), because in these frameworks the inflation\nis generic without such a mechanism. After numerically studying various cases\nin which the potential of the inflaton consists of two parts, an inflationary\npotential and an ekpyrotic-like one, we find that, despite the fact that the\ninfluence is significant, by properly choosing the free parameters involved in\nthe models, the ekpyrotic-like potential dominates in the bounce region, during\nwhich the effective equation of state is larger than one, so the shear problem\nis resolved. As the time continuously increases after the bounce, the\ninflationary potential grows and ultimately becomes dominant, resulting in an\ninflationary phase.

Very\nimportant: all energy conditions are satisfied except the dominant one (DEC),\nwhich is violated inside the radius 8M/3. Notice that 2M is not the event\nhorizon, but a curvature singularity covered by an apparent horizon that, at\nthe actual stage of the Universe, nearly coincides with 2M. Moreover, the\ncurvature singularity is not analytic with respect to the dynamics of the\nUniverse encoded in the Hubble function $H(t)$: for arbitrarily small but not\nzero $H^\\prime(t)$, the curvature invariants are singular, while for\n$H^\\prime(t)$ identically zero, they are regular. Therefore, we can not\nanalytically decouple the black hole from the entire Cosmos, namely, we can not\nassume the Schwarzschild solution locally and the FRW metric at large scale\nwithout violating the analyticity of the metric. Since the spacetime does not\nexist for $r \\leqslant$2M, and since the DEC is violated for r<8M/3, we are\nallowed to doubt the existence of black holes in our Universe as understood up\nto now.

A challenging question in such\nmodels is how to keep the shear under control in the contracting phase, as it\nis well-known that the shear grows as fast as $1/a^{6}$ toward the bounce,\nwhere $a$ is the expansion factor of the universe. A common approach is to\nintroduce a scalar field with an ekpyrotic-like potential which becomes\nnegative near the bounce, so the effective equation of state of the scalar\nfield will be greater than one, whereby it dominates the shear and other matter\nfields in the bounce region. As a result, a homogeneous and isotropic universe\ncan be produced. In this paper, we study how the ekpyrotic mechanism affects\nthe inflationary phase in both loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and a modified loop\nquantum cosmological model (mLQC-I), because in these frameworks the inflation\nis generic without such a mechanism. After numerically studying various cases\nin which the potential of the inflaton consists of two parts, an inflationary\npotential and an ekpyrotic-like one, we find that, despite the fact that the\ninfluence is significant, by properly choosing the free parameters involved in\nthe models, the ekpyrotic-like potential dominates in the bounce region, during\nwhich the effective equation of state is larger than one, so the shear problem\nis resolved. As the time continuously increases after the bounce, the\ninflationary potential grows and ultimately becomes dominant, resulting in an\ninflationary phase.

In this work\nwe articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated\nelectronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the\nelectromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the\nmaterial system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we\nfocus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic\nFermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often\nenergetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may\nform, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the\nelectromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the\nCasimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular\norientations of the nematic order.
