Each of\nthese protocols involves square pulses with two driving frequencies which are\ninteger multiples of each other. For the first class of protocols, the duration\nof the pulse is changed randomly by an amplitude $dT$ while for the second\nclass we use a random/quasiperiodic dipolar drive, where the quasiperiodicity\nis implemented using the Thue-Morse (TM) or Fibonacci sequences. For both\nprotocols, we identify parameter regimes for which the thermalization of the\ndriven chain is drastically slowed down due to proximity to a two-rate drive\ninduced exact dynamical freezing. We also study the properties of these driven\nsystem moving slightly away from the freezing limit. For the first type of\nprotocols, we show the existence of special value of $dT$ for which the\nthermalization rate remains small and provide an analytic explanation for such\nslow thermalization. For the second class of protocols, in contrast to\nrandom/quasiperiodic drives involving a single frequency studied earlier, we\nfind that the TM quasiperiodic drive leads to a distinctly slower\nthermalization than that for drive protocols which are either periodic or\nfollow a random or quasiperiodic Fibonacci sequence.

Hess found the new special case of integrability of the Euler -\nPoisson equations of motion of a heavy rigid body with a fixed point. In 1963\nL.N. Sretensky proved that the special case of integrability, similar to the\nHess case, also exists in the problem of the motion of a heavy gyrostat - a\nheavy rigid body with a fixed point, which contains a rotating homogeneous\nrotor. Further numerous generalizations of the classical Hess case were\nproposed, which take place during the motion of a heavy rigid body and a\ngyrostat with a fixed point in various force fields.\n  The first studies that provided a qualitative description of the motion of a\nheavy rigid body in the integrable Hess case were published almost immediately\nafter this case was found. In 1892 P.A. Nekrasov proved, that the solution of\nthe problem of motion of a heavy rigid body with a fixed point in the Hess case\nis reduced to the integration the second order linear homogeneous differential\nequation with variable coefficients. A similar result regarding the problem of\nthe motion of a heavy gyrostat in the Hess - Sretensky case was presented by\nSretensky.\n  In this paper we present the derivation of the corresponding second order\nlinear differential equation and reduce the coefficients of this equation to\nthe form of rational functions. Then, using the Kovacic algorithm we study the\nproblem of the existence of liouvillian solutions of the corresponding second\norder linear differential equation. We obtain the conditions for the parameters\nof the problem, under which the liouvillian solutions of the corresponding\nlinear differential equation exist.

Typical examples are the calculation of nucleation and crystal\ngrowth rates in heterogeneous solutions where the driving force depends on the\ncomposition of the fluid. Constant chemical potential molecular dynamics\nsimulations would instead be required to compute time-independent growth and\nnucleation rates. While this can, in principle, be achieved through the\naddition and deletion of particles using the grand canonical partition\nfunction, this is very inefficient in the condensed phase due to the low\nacceptance probability of these events. Adaptive resolution schemes, which use\na reservoir of non-interacting particles that can be transformed into solute\nparticles, circumvent this problem, but at the cost of relatively complicated\ncode implementations. In this work, a simpler approach is proposed that uses\nharmonic volumetric restraints to control the solute osmotic pressure, which\ncan be considered a proxy for the system's chemical potential. The osmotic\npressure regulator is demonstrated to reproduce the expected properties of\nideal gases and ideal solutions. Using the mW water model, the osmotic pressure\nregulator is shown to provide a constant growth rate for ice in the presence of\nan electrolyte solution, unlike what standard molecular dynamics simulations\nwould produce.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8c10\u6ce2\u4f53\u79ef\u9650\u5236\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b49\u6e29\u538b\u529b\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6c34\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e2d\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u751f\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u62df\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u5206\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u6676\u4f53\u751f\u957f\u7684\u6838\u72b6\u7269\u76f8\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8c10\u6ce2\u4f53\u79ef\u9650\u5236\u5668\u548cmW\u6c34\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6052\u6e29\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u538b\u529b\u63a7\u5236\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u6676\u4f53\u751f\u957f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7535\u79bb\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e2d\uff0c\u6052\u6e29\u538b\u529b\u9650\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u751f\u957f\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c10\u6ce2\u4f53\u79ef\u9650\u5236\u5668\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u6676\u4f53\u751f\u957f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

So far, the strategy\nto design platforms displaying altermagnetism has relied mostly on inorganic\ncrystals with d-metals as spin centers, where a representative example is the\ntwo-dimensional square lattice with antiparallel D2h magnetic blocks related by\na pi/2 rotation. Despite the fact that there is no strong requirement for the\nmagnetic atoms to be metals, the construction of an altermagnetic framework\nwith light elements like carbon is challenging due to symmetric constrictions.\nWe show how it is possible to overcome this by including non-alternant rings in\npi-conjugated nanographenes. More specifically, dibenzo[ef,kl]heptalene, an S =\n1 pi-conjugated hydrocarbon consisting of a graph of two fused heptagons and\nhexagons, represents a suitable building block for an altermagnetic 2D crystal.\nIn this work, we confirm this hypothesis with DFT calculations of the spin\npolarized band structure, presenting a spin compensated ground state with\nbroken time reversal symmetry, and a d-wave symmetry of the first valence and\nconduction bands.

Building\non these foundations, we focus on the Aschenbach effect-a relativistic\nphenomenon intricately tied to the geometry of photon spheres and known to\noccur in some special sub-extremal non rotating black holes. Our primary\nobjective is to determine whether this effect persists not only up to the\nextremal limit but also beyond, into the superextremal regime, thus probing the\nstability and validity of black hole characteristics in these extreme\nconditions. By analyzing the nonlinear charged AdS black hole solutions in\nmassive gravity, we demonstrate that the Aschenbach effect remains a robust\nfeature across both extremal and superextremal configurations. This extension\nsuggests that key relativistic signatures and the underlying spacetime\nstructures associated with high-spin black holes continue to hold beyond\nclassical boundaries. Our results provide new insights into the behavior of\nultra-compact objects and highlight promising directions for exploring the\nlimits of general relativity, as well as potential generalizations of the WGC\nand WCC in strong gravitational fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u7684\u53cd\u5fb7\u897f\u7279\uff08AdS\uff09\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u5f15\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86Aschenbach\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u5426\u5728\u6781\u6027\u548c\u8d85\u6781\u6027\u533a\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u5149\u7403\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u662f\u90e8\u5206\u6b21\u6781\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Aschenbach\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u548c\u8d85\u6781\u6027\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5747\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u6781\u7aef\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684 Relativistic \u7279\u6027\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u6781\u9650\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f31\u5f15\u529b\u731c\u60f3\u5728\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC)\u3001Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC)\u548c\u5149\u7403\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6781\u7aef\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u7684AdS\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86Aschenbach\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6781\u6027\u7684\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u6559\u5458\u548c\u8d85\u6559\u5458\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cAschenbach\u6548\u5e94\u5747\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9Aschenbach\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6781\u7aef\u6027\u8d28\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a2\u7d22\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u6781\u9650\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

One key ingredient of such\nimprovement is the introduction of tunable couplers to control the\nqubit-to-qubit coupling through frequency tuning. Moving toward fault-tolerant\nquantum computation, increasing the number of physical qubits is another step\ntoward effective error correction codes. Under a multiqubit architecture, flux\ncontrol (Z) lines are crucial in tuning the frequency of the qubits and\ncouplers. However, dense flux lines result in magnetic flux crosstalk, wherein\nmagnetic flux applied to one element inadvertently affects neighboring qubits\nor couplers. This crosstalk obscures the idle frequency of the qubit when flux\nbias is applied, which degrades gate performance and calibration accuracy. In\nthis study, we characterize flux crosstalk and suppress it in a\nmultiqubit-coupler chip with multi-Z lines without adding additional readout\nfor couplers. By quantifying the mutual flux-induced frequency shifts of qubits\nand couplers, we construct a cancellation matrix that enables precise\ncompensation of non-local flux, demonstrating a substantial reduction in Z-line\ncrosstalk from 56.5$\\,$permille$\\,$to 0.13$\\,$permille$\\,$ which is close to\nstatistical error. Flux compensation corrects the CZ SWAP measurement, leading\nto a symmetric map with respect to flux bias. Compared with a crosstalk-free\ncalculated CZ SWAP map, the measured map indicates that our approach provides a\nnear-zero crosstalk for the coupler-transmon system.

Auxiliary contributions to the flow\nintroduce physical awareness of bond lengths and Lennard-Jones interactions and\ngradients of a molecular mechanics force field energy are incorporated via\nadjoint matching to steer the FlowBack-Adjoint vector field to produce\nlower-energy configurations. In benchmark tests against FlowBack,\nFlowBack-Adjoint lowers single-point energies by a median of ~78\nkcal/mol.residue, reduces errors in bond lengths by >92%, eliminates >98% of\nmolecular clashes, maintains excellent diversity of the AA configurational\nensemble, and produces configurations capable of initializing stable all-atom\nmolecular dynamics simulations without requiring energy relaxation. We propose\nFlowBack-Adjoint as an accurate and efficient physics-aware deep generative\nmodel for AA backmapping from C-alpha traces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578bFlowBack-Adjoint\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ececg\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u6062\u590d\u6240\u6709\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u952e\u957f\u3001\u539f\u5b50\u78b0\u649e\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86FlowBack-Adjoint\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5728\u5355\u70b9\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u952e\u957f\u548c\u539f\u5b50\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "cg\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u86cb\u767d\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6062\u590d\u6240\u6709\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6784\u8c61\u548c\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FlowBack-Adjoint\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86AA\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d\u7684FlowBack-Adjoint\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5229\u7528\u4eff\u5c04\u914d\u51c6\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f34\u968f\u5339\u914d\u6cd5 Incorporate bond lengths \u548c Lennard-Jones \u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u529b\u573a\u80fd\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u5bfc\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFlowBack-Adjoint\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5355\u70b9\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u952e\u957f\u548c\u539f\u5b50\u78b0\u649e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86AA\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u80fd\u91cf\u677e\u5f1b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u542f\u52a8\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowBack-Adjoint\u662f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9884\u7559\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4ececg\u8f68\u8ff9\u6062\u590d\u6240\u6709\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6784\u8c61\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5408\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6298\u53e0\u548c\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

We\nsystematically investigate the quantum Oppenheimer--Snyder (QOS) spacetime by\nderiving the complete metric and analyzing horizon structures, showing\nsignificant modifications to the classical geometry through the interplay of\nquantum deformation effects, CS, and QF parameters. Our comprehensive geodesic\nanalysis demonstrates that null geodesics exhibit modified effective potentials\nand altered photon trajectories, while timelike geodesics show enhanced orbital\nvelocities and geodesic precession frequencies compared to classical\npredictions, providing potentially observable signatures through precision\nmeasurements. The BH shadow investigation reveals systematic increases in\nshadow radius with both CS and QF parameters, offering new possibilities for\ntesting exotic matter configurations through next-generation high-resolution\nobservations. We examine field perturbations of different spins -- including\nscalar, electromagnetic (EM), and fermionic fields -- demonstrating that the BH\nremains stable under external disturbances while exhibiting modified\nquasinormal mode (QNM) spectra that could serve as observational\ndiscriminators. Most remarkably, our thermodynamic analysis reveals exotic\nthermal behavior including negative temperature regimes, fundamentally altered\nstability conditions, and genuine phase transitions between distinct BH\nconfigurations, extending well beyond classical general relativity predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u5938\u91cf\u573a\u548c\u4e91\u5f26\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u57df\u9ed1\u4f53\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ed1\u4f53\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u4e91\u5f26\u548c\u5938\u91cf\u573a\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5149\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u8f68\u9053\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6d4b\u5f71\u7b49\u89c2\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u7269\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c2\u6d4b\u754c\u9650\u3002ollect of Thought: \u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5305\u542b\u5938\u91cf\u573a\u3001\u4e91\u5f26\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u57df\u9ed1\u4f53\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u5468\u56f4\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97Oppenheimer-Snyder\u91cf\u5b50\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u89c6\u754c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u4e91\u5f26\u548c\u5938\u91cf\u573a\u53c2\u6570\u5982\u4f55\u4fee\u6539\u7ecf\u5178\u51e0\u4f55\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5149\u5b50\u548c\u6d4b\u65f6\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u5176\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002\u8fd8\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6d4b\u5f71\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8d1f\u6e29\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u5bfb\u627e\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6216\u65b0\u7269\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002usions: \u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u5938\u91cf\u573a\u548c\u4e91\u5f26\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u57df\u9ed1\u4f53\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ed1\u4f53\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u4e91\u5f26\u548c\u5938\u91cf\u573a\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5149\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u8f68\u9053\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6d4b\u5f71\u7b49\u89c2\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u7269\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c2\u6d4b\u754c\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406ramer\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u57df\u9ed1\u4f53\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u7269\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u8fd0\u7528Oppenheimer-Snyder\u91cf\u5b50\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7269\u7406\u3001\u5938\u91cf\u573a\u548c\u4e91\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u8fb9\u754c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u9ed1\u4f53\u5468\u56f4\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u8be6\u7ec6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u6d4b\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u4e91\u5f26\u4e0e\u5938\u91cf\u573a\u53c2\u6570\u663e\u8457\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5149\u5b50\u548c\u6d4b\u65f6\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d4b\u5f71\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u51fa\u73b0\u8d1f\u6e29\u548c\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u3001\u5938\u91cf\u573a\u548c\u4e91\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u57df\u9ed1\u4f53\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u5bfb\u627e\u548c\u68c0\u9a8c\u65b0\u7269\u8d28\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

While this can be achieved by\ndecreasing the gate duration, the use of shorter signals increases their\nbandwidth and can cause leakage into energetically separated states. A common\nmethod to suppress leakage for short pulses is the Derivative Removal by\nAdiabatic Gate (DRAG) method, which however, relies on IQ modulation of\nradio-frequency (RF) signals, thus cannot be applied to the baseband signals,\ne.g., for semiconductor spin qubits. This paper proposes a novel technique,\nDelayed Leakage Reduction (DLR), that suppresses leakage at targeted\nfrequencies even for baseband control by using time-delayed repetitions of the\ncontrol signal to enable rapid, high-fidelity operations. We apply DLR on the\nadiabatic CZ gate between two spin qubits and achieve fidelities exceeding\n99.9% within 9.4 ns for a resonance frequency difference of only 100 MHz.\nTowards the experimental realization of the proposed control method, we also\nassess the impact on the fidelity of the sampling rate of the electronic\nhardware generating the control pulse, thus setting the minimum hardware\nrequirements for any experimental demonstration.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces DLR to suppress leakage in baseband control of spin qubits, improving CZ gate fidelity.", "motivation": "Quantum computing faces the challenge of increasing qubit coherence times, particularly for operations affected by leakage.

General Relativity is perturbatively non-renormalizable, while the\nStandard Model features Landau poles, where couplings are predicted to diverge\nat finite energies, e.g., in the Abelian gauge sector. Asymptotically safe\nquantum gravity may resolve both of these issues at the same time. In this\npaper, we assess the systematic uncertainties associated with this scenario, in\nparticular with the gravitationally induced UV-completion of the Abelian gauge\nsector. Specifically, we study the dependence of this qualitative feature,\nnamely the existence of a UV-complete gauge sector, on unphysical choices like\nthe gauge, and the regulator function. Intriguingly, in some scenarios, we find\nsimultaneous points of minimal sensitivity relative to both the regulator and\ngauge parameters, which allow for a UV completion. This provides further\nindications that the simultaneous UV-completion of quantum gravity and matter\nvia an asymptotically safe fixed point is a robust physical feature, and that\nphysical quantities, like scaling exponents, can become independent of\nunphysical choices.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores how the addition of quantum gravity can resolve the Standard Model's Landau pole issues, focusing on the possibility that a single UV-complete theory can unify gravity and the Standard Model. It looks at systematic uncertainties and whether the UV-completion is robust against changes in nonphysical parameters like gauge choice and regulator function. The study suggests that while such a unification is possible, there are challenges in the process, especially regarding the sensitivity to these nonphysical parameters. However, simultaneous optimal sensitivity in both aspects may allow for a consistent UV-completion, indicating that the approach is more viable than previously thought.", "motivation": "The Standard Model faces a significant issue with its Landau poles, which suggest that it cannot be a complete theory at high energies. On the other hand, General Relativity, when quantized perturbatively, is also non-renormalizable. The idea of asymptotically safe quantum gravity offers a potential solution by providing a consistent high-energy completion. This paper delves into how adding quantum gravitational effects might resolve the Standard Model's issues, likely by modifying the couplings in such a way that Landau poles are avoided. It specifically examines whether the process of achieving this resolution is robust, meaning it doesn't depend too much on arbitrary choices in the theory setup, such as the gauge or the regulator used in the calculations. If the resolution is robust, it would lend more credibility to the idea of a consistent theory combining gravity and the Standard Model.", "method": "The authors employ a systematic approach to assess the robustness of the UV-completion of quantum gravity into the Standard Model's Abelian gauge sector. They look at how unphysical choices, like different gauges and regulator functions in the path integral quantization, affect the existence and properties of the UV-complete theory. They likely perform mathematical derivations and computational simulations, focusing on finding points where the theory becomes minimally sensitive to these changes. This would involve analyzing how scaling exponents (which determine the behavior of physical quantities at high energies) vary with different choices of gauge and regulators. If there are points where these exponents become independent of the choices, this suggests that the theory is less dependent on arbitrary parameterizations, which is a desirable property for a consistent physical theory.", "result": "The paper finds that under certain conditions, the presence of a UV-complete gauge sector is possible when the theory's dependence is minimal relative to both the regulator and gauge parameters. This means that for specific values of these parameters, the theory shows robustness against systematic uncertainties. However, these conditions are achieved at the expense of a cutoff scale ambiguity, where the physical cutoff is not uniquely determined by the theory alone. This ambiguity introduces a new degree of freedom, highlighting that while the simultaneous UV-completion is possible, it may come with inherent uncertainties related to the scale dependence. Additionally, the scaling exponents, which are critical for the behavior of the couplings, show limited sensitivity to the regulator choice, suggesting that certain aspects of the theory's high-energy behavior are predictable despite the regulator's arbitrariness. However, there is a significant dependence on the gauge choice, indicating that different quantization schemes can lead to varying conclusions about the UV-completion potential, which introduces another layer of uncertainty.", "conclusion": "The study suggests that by considering simultaneous minimization of sensitivity to both regulator and gauge choices, a UV-complete theory that unites quantum gravity and the Standard Model appears more plausible. The findings indicate that while this approach introduces a specific cutoff scale ambiguity, it reduces the overall dependence on arbitrary parameter choices, making the scenario less ad hoc and more physically founded. The paper also points out that scaling exponents are relatively insensitive to regulator changes, which is a promising sign for predictability in the UV regime. However, the sensitivity to gauge choice suggests that different quantization schemes need to be considered, leading to challenges in establishing a unique physical interpretation. Overall, the simultaneity of addressing both gravitational and matter sector UV issues at an asymptotically safe fixed point provides a more consistent framework, potentially leading to a viable theory of quantum gravity and the Standard Model. The conclusion emphasizes the need for further study to resolve the remaining ambiguities, particularly regarding the cutoff scale and gauge dependency, to fully assess the validity and physical implications of this approach."}}

We define a more complete out-of-equilibrium\nnonlinear numerical model that reduces to the equilibrium linear model in the\nlow-power limit. We find that the linear model does not correctly describe the\nbehavior of superconducting tunnel junctions for parameters that are reasonable\nin practical experimental setups. Subsequently, we present the qualitative and\nquantitative differences between the models, discovering that for high power,\nthe junction saturates and then inverts its behavior. Finally, we also clarify\nthe difference between linear and nonlinear thermoelectricity and devise a new\ncriterion to find nonlinear thermoelectricity in the parameter space.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a more comprehensive model for thermoelectricity in superconducting tunnel junctions that accounts for out-of-equilibrium conditions, showing that the traditional linear model fails at high power, leading to what the paper refers to as 'saturated and inverted' behavior.

The traditional linear model has limitations, especially at higher power levels, which could affect the efficiency and practicality of these devices. The paper's aim is to address these limitations by proposing a more accurate model to better capture real-world scenarios in experiments and applications.", "method": "The authors developed an out-of-equilibrium numerical model that accounts for nonlinear effects. This model was validated against a linear model in the linear regime to identify discrepancies. Simulations were conducted under various conditions relevant to practical experiments to compare the predictions of both models, focusing on the behavior at high power to observe saturation and inversion of the junction's thermoelectric response.", "result": "The study found significant differences between the linear and nonlinear models, particularly at higher power levels. The nonlinear model demonstrated that thermoelectricity in superconducting tunnel junctions does not simply follow the linear model, especially when power exceeds certain thresholds. The junction's behavior becomes inverted, meaning the thermoelectric effect reverses its sign and magnitude, indicating a departure from textbook predictions. This suggests that while the linear model is useful under low-power conditions, it fails to describe thermoelectric phenomena accurately in higher power scenarios, which is critical for the design and optimization of thermoelectric devices.", "conclusion": "The paper highlights the need for a more accurate out-of-equilibrium model to study thermoelectricity in superconducting tunnel junctions, as traditional linear theories break down for typical experimental conditions with higher power. The authors suggest that the observed inversion in behavior is a new phenomenon requiring further experimental investigation, implying that nonlinear thermoelectric effects should be considered in the design of future thermoelectric devices for better performance and efficiency."}}

It\nexplores the underlying physics, implementation, and potential uses of this\ninnovative laser system, especially in LIDAR technology. Conventional\ndual-frequency comb systems for metrology use two optical frequency combs\nsynchronised via complex feedback loops, which suffer from phase-locking issues\nand raise system cost and fragility. In contrast, single-cavity dual comb\nsystems generate two combs with slightly different repetition rates in the same\ncavity, ensuring mutual coherence and noise cancellation. However, these\nsystems often display unstable regimes and are typically demonstrated only in\nlaboratories. This thesis aims to design, build, characterise, and optimise a\nsingle-cavity polarisation multiplexed fibre laser that produces dual optical\nfrequency combs with enough stability and precision for dual-comb LIDAR. The\nsystem simplifies generation while enhancing applicability. Secondary goals\ninclude analysing the laser intensity dynamics and collaborating with a company\nto address commercial needs and challenges in LIDAR, particularly under harsh\nconditions. Results show stable dual-comb generation with minimal drift (1 Hz\nper hour) and operation over 250 hours. The system achieves sub-millimetre\nprecision in 5-metre ambiguity ranges with a fundamental frep of 39.25 MHz and\nDelta frep of 869 Hz. The findings confirm the regime's robustness for\nhigh-precision ranging while exposing some limits. The thesis also analyses\nbuild-up and propagation dynamics in a single cavity, showing a two-stage\nprocess and how initial spike energy evolution affects successful separation.\nFinally, it offers mitigation strategies for LIDAR systems in harsh\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Prepared for submission to the proceedings of the AMS/UMI\n  joint conference special session on \"New Developments in infinite dimensional\n  Lie algebras, vertex operator algebras and the Monster\" to appear in the\n  Contemporary Mathematics series", "summary": "Given a $K3$ surface, a supersymmetric non-linear K3 sigma model is the\ninternal superconformal field theory (SCFT) in a six dimensional\ncompactification of type IIA superstring on $\\mathbb{R}^{1,5} \\times K3$. These\nmodels have attracted attention due to the discovery of Mathieu moonshine\nphenomena for the elliptic genera of K3 surfaces, and have played a pivotal\nrole in extending Mukai's theorem on classification of symplectic automorphisms\nof $K3$ surfaces. We report on recent progress (arXiv:2402.08719 [hep-th]) in\ncharacterizing topological defects in $K3$ models, generalizing the notion of\nsymmetries to categories of topological operators supported on arbitrary\ncodimension submanifolds with possibly non-invertible fusion rules. Taking\nadvantage of the interpretation of Mukai lattice as the D-brane charge lattice,\nwe present a number of general results for the category of topological defect\nlines preserving the superconformal algebra and spectral flow, obtained by\nstudying their fusion with boundary states. While for certain K3 models\ninfinitely many simple defects, and even a continuum, can occur, at generic\npoints in the moduli space the category is actually trivial, i.e. it is\ngenerated by the identity defect. Furthermore, if a K3 model is at the\nattractor point for some BPS configuration of D-branes, then all topological\ndefects have integral quantum dimension. We also introduce a conjecture that a\ncontinuum of topological defects arises if and only if the K3 model is a\n(possibly generalized) orbifold of a torus model.

Incorporating quintessence dark\nenergy into the RN-AdS framework, we find that the Lyapunov exponents for null\nand timelike geodesics display diminished chaotic behavior with increasing\nnormalization factor of the quintessence field. This feature introduces a\nfinite cutoff to the Lyapunov exponent of unstable circular photon orbits,\nsetting it apart from RN-AdS black hole. At phase transition points, both the\nfree energy and Lyapunov exponents display multivalued branches, reflecting the\ncoexistence of distinct black hole phases. Furthermore, the discontinuity in\nthe Lyapunov exponent can serve as an order parameter with a critical exponent\nof $1/2$ near the critical point, consistent with the thermodynamic criticality\nof van der Waals fluids..

By\ncomparing deep, conditionally branching circuits with shallow, uniform\ncounterparts-while controlling for overall halting probability and physical\nresources-we show that branching architectures induce greater entropy flow into\nthe environment. This effect is captured by a logical depth factor $L_d$, which\nquantifies entropy accumulation during environmental interactions.

In the case of bipartite and\ntripartite systems, we derive trade-offs between upper bounds for separable\nstates and general states in terms of structure functions to optimize the\nentanglement detection. We then strengthen n-partite Bell inequalities for the\ndetection of states exhibiting a diversity of entanglement structures such as\ngenuine multipartite entanglement. For general Bell scenarios with some\nmeasurements characterized, we demonstrate that entanglement can also be\ndetected with some local correlations by exploiting the\nNavascu\\'es-Pironio-Ac\\'in hierarchy of tests.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bbe\u5907\u7c97\u7cd9\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bbe\u5907\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Navascues-Pironio-Ac\u00edn\u5c42\u6b21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u7ea0\u7f20\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7ea0\u7f20\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}
