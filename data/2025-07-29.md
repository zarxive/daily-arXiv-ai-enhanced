### [1] [Quasi-isospectral higher-order Hamiltonians via a reversed Lax pair construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19622)
*Francisco Correa,Andreas Fring*

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种构造更高阶准等谱哈密顿量的方法，通过对Lax对的重新理解，从高阶M算子出发，使用交织技术生成了一系列准等谱的哈密顿量，展示了这种方法在KdV方程和其扩展中的应用，以及生成可积分系统的新机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者们通常通过Lax对的第二阶L算子来构造哈密顿量，但这篇论文的作者提出了一种新的思路，认为高阶M算子可以作为起点，从而构造出更多的准等谱哈密顿量，这对生成新的可积分系统具有重要意义。

Method: 论文采用了反向的方法，不是用通常认为的第二阶L算子作为哈密顿量，而是以高阶M算子为基础，通过交织技术构造一系列准等谱的哈密顿量，尤其针对KdV方程和相关扩展进行了详细分析，还讨论了生成无限序列的方法和可积分系统的形状不变算子。

Result: 通过这种方法，作者成功地生成了一种新的可积分系统的构造方法，展示了在KdV方程下的应用，并提供了无限序列的生成方式。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种系统化的方式生成新的可积分系统，扩展了现有的构造方法，并展示了针对不同Lax对的普适性。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for constructing quasi-isospectral higher-order
Hamiltonians from time-independent Lax pairs by reversing the conventional
interpretation of the Lax pair operators. Instead of treating the typically
second-order $L$-operator as the Hamiltonian, we take the higher-order
$M$-operator as the starting point and construct a sequence of
quasi-isospectral operators via intertwining techniques. This procedure yields
a variety of new higher-order Hamiltonians that are isospectral to each other,
except for at least one state. We illustrate the approach with explicit
examples derived from the KdV equation and its extensions, discussing the
properties of the resulting operators based on rational, hyperbolic, and
elliptic function solutions. In some cases, we present infinite sequences of
quasi-isospectral Hamiltonians, which we generalise to shape-invariant
differential operators capable of generating such sequences. Our framework
provides a systematic mechanism for generating new integrable systems from
known Lax pairs.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Real and regular soliton solutions of the KP hierarchy have been classified
in terms of the totally nonnegative (TNN) Grassmannians. These solitons are
referred to as KP solitons, and they are expressed as singular (tropical)
limits of shifted Riemann theta functions. In this talk, for each element of
the TNN Grassmannian, we construct a Schottky group, which uniformizes the
Riemann surface associated with a real finite-gap solution. Then we show that
the KP solitons are obtained by degenerating these finite-gap solutions.

### [3] [Measurements of enriched 155 Gd and 157Gd converters with the NMX detector on the nTOF EAR2 beam line at CERN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20756)

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: 论文介绍了ESS中的NMX探测器 prototype 使用Gd优化，使用时间差分技术研究Gd的能谱，结果显示157Gd和155Gd在热中子范围内效率显著高于天然Gd，但峰值差异低于预期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望提高 neutron detectors 的效率，Gd是一种常见的 neutron 转换材料，优化其可能提高探测器性能。

Method: 使用时间-差分技术，测量 neutron 的能谱，比较天然Gd和 enriched Gd 在不同能量下的效率。

Result: 157Gd 显著比天然Gd高效，但峰值差异低于预期，可能由 gamma 背景、对焦点模糊和饱和效应引起。

Conclusion: 使用富 Gd 的 NMX 探测器 prototype 可有效提高效率，未来可应用该技术提升ESS的探测器性能。

Abstract: The detectors for the NMX instrument at the European Spallation Source (ESS)
in Lund use natural Gd as the neutron converter. In 2024, beam time was
obtained at the neutron time-of flight experiment (nTOF) at CERN to study the
feasibility of an upgrade to enriched Gd. A 10 x 10 cm^2 prototype of the NMX
detector was equipped with two enriched Gd samples (157Gd and 155Gd) that were
attached with copper tape to the natural Gd cathode of the detector. Three sets
of measurements were taken, with the beam focused on either the natural Gd, the
157Gd, or the 155Gd samples. Using the time-of-flight technique with the
subsequent conversion of time-of-flight into energy, the resonant region
between 1 eV and 200 eV of the 157Gd and 155Gd cross sections was studied. The
peaks in the resonant region were clearly visible, having higher ADC values in
the ADC spectrum. Additionally, the resonant peaks had a larger number of
counts per energy bin. In the thermal neutron energy range, the count rate at
the center of the beam was measured for natural Gd, 157Gd, and 155Gd. Enriched
157Gd showed an efficiency that was between 60 - 180% higher, compared to
natural Gd, for neutron wavelengths between 0.8 A and 1.8 A. The measured 60 %
increase in efficiency at 1.8 A is lower than expected from simulations (100 %)
and previous measurements with solid state detectors (80 %). Gamma background
detection, bad focusing, and saturation effects most likely explain this
deviation. An upgrade of the natural Gd converter to enriched 157Gd would thus
lead to an efficiency increase of at least 60 %. The measurements presented in
this paper are the first successful time-of-flight measurements with the NMX
detector prototype and the ESS VMM readout.

Zhu*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: This paper presents SPLENDOR, a new dark matter detector using advanced materials and quantum sensors to achieve sub-eV sensitivity, with a focus on scalability and future upgrades.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the need for improved sensitivity in dark matter detection, especially in the sub-eV mass range, to better understand dark matter interactions and properties.

Method: The research employs narrow-gap semiconductors and cryogenic HEMT amplifiers, employing directional sensitivity and quantum sensing techniques.

Result: SPLENDOR achieved 20 ±7 electron resolution, indicating success in its detector design and scalability for deployment. They also estimate future sensitivity improvements with quantum sensing upgrades.

Conclusion: SPLENDOR presents a promising new direction in dark matter detection by combining material science and quantum sensing, with potential for significant future sensitivity advancements.

Abstract: We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector
platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge
readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV
scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to
accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies.
SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated
f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not
only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming
dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily
modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic
high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching
single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of
Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype
detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier
chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon
test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a
demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment
in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results.
Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of
athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background
environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing
performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our
ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR
provides a novel approach to dark matter detection, combining quantum sensing
with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass
range of dark matter parameter space.

### [5] [Fundamental limitations of thermoradiative energy conversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19864)
*Maxime Giteau,Michela F. Picardi,Georgia T. Papadakis*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 研究得出辐射式热机是高效能源转换的更优选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解能量转换的极限是优化能源使用的关键。

Method: 分析了几种热交换器的配置，比较了辐射热机和热辐射热机的性能，得出了辐射热机更优的结论。

Result: 辐射热机的效率和功率总是在其他热转换装置下受限。

Conclusion: 必须结合多个热交换方式来实现高效的能源转换。

Abstract: Understanding the fundamental limits of various energy conversion approaches
is essential for assessing their efficiency and power output. In this work, we
derive general performance bounds for thermoradiative heat engines that
exchange heat radiatively with a cold sink, establishing
power-versus-efficiency thermodynamic bounds for several configurations. We
find that the performance of these engines is always bounded by that of
radiative engines, which harness the thermal radiation emitted by a hot source,
making thermoradiative engines inherently less favorable for energy conversion.
By unifying the results of radiative and thermoradiative engines within a
common thermodynamic framework, which also encompasses dual-engine
configurations that combine both features, this work provides a comprehensive
understanding of the thermodynamic limits of radiative energy conversion. Our
framework offers general metrics for evaluating specific devices and raises
critical questions regarding the relevance of thermoradiative cells for energy
production.

### [6] [Visualizing the Link Between Nanomorphology and Energetic Disorder in 3D Organic Solar Cells](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20040)
*Pelin Çiloğlu,Carmen Tretmans,Carsten Deibel,Jan-F. Pietschmann,Martin Stoll,Roderick C. I. MacKenzie*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a 3D hybrid model for organic BHJ solar cells to understand the effects of nanomorphology and energetic disorder. They use a phase-field approach for realistic morphologies and find that even with percolation pathways, energetic disorder limits performance through charge extraction issues and suggests multiscale design strategies. The model bridges the gap computationally and physically while predicting key limitations and potential improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of BHJ solar cells is highly dependent on two factors: nanomorphology and energetic disorder. Many existing models either oversimplify these factors. There's a need for a more comprehensive model that accurately incorporates both factors for better understanding and optimization of BHJ devices.

Method: They use a three-dimensional hybrid model combining a phase-field approach for morphologies and Monte Carlo simulations. They generate realistic morphologies considering solvent evaporation, then study the interplay between energetic and configurational disorder at realistic carrier densities.

Result: The model shows that energetic disorder reduces device performance primarily through suppressed charge extraction in interconnected domains, even when percolation pathways exist. The study emphasizes the importance of optimizing molecular packing at the nanoscale and controlling phase separation at the mesoscale.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the necessity of multiscale design strategies for next-generation BHJ devices, suggesting that advancing molecular packing and phase separation control at different scales could lead to significant performance improvements.

Abstract: The performance of organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is highly
sensitive to both nanomorphology and energetic disorder arising from
microscopic molecular packing and structural defects. However, most models used
to understand these devices are either one-dimensional effective medium
approximations that neglect spatial and energetic disorder or three-dimensional
Monte Carlo simulations that are computationally intensive. In this work, we
present the results from a three-dimensional hybrid model capable of operating
at both high carrier densities and incorporating the effects of energetic
disorder. We first generate realistic morphologies using a phase-field approach
that accounts for solvent evaporation during film formation. Using these
example morphologies, we systematically study the interplay between energetic
disorder and configurational disorder at carrier densities representative of
real device operation. This enables us to separate and visualize the impact of
the nanomorphology and energetic disorder on device performance. Our results
reveal that, even when macroscopic percolation pathways remain intact,
energetic disorder limits performance primarily through suppressed charge
extraction in interconnected domains. This suggest that optimizing molecular
packing at the nanoscale is as critical as controlling phase separation at the
mesoscale, highlighting the need for multiscale design strategies in
next-generation BHJ devices.

### [7] [Device-scale modeling of valley photovoltaics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20054)
*Daixi Xia,Hassan Allami,Jacob J. Krich*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种包含谷穴散射效应的泊松/漂移-扩散模型，模拟谷穴光伏装置。提供了有效的谷载效应率，具有嵌套蒙特卡罗模拟的结果。发现非平衡的谷载群体并不能提高效能，增加内部电场反而降低效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谷载光伏作为一种新型的热载物太阳能电池，通过大规模电场下的谷穴散射效应，潜力巨大，但现有 fabricated 设备表现不佳，需要有有效的理论模型来解释和优化其工作原理。

Method: 主要采用泊松方程和漂移-扩散方程来模型电场和载流子浓度分布，结合嵌套蒙特卡罗模拟得到谷穴散射率随电场变化的参数。

Result: 模型显示，非平衡的谷载载流子群体无法显著提高效率，反而增加内部电场并不提升效率，与之前的结论相悖。

Conclusion: 该模型为研究谷载光伏装置提供了一定的理论支持，但结果表明现有的设计策略可能无法实现高效率，下一步需尝试改变材料或结构，或进行更多的实验验证以找到改进的方向。

Abstract: We present a Poisson/drift-diffusion model that includes valley scattering
effects for simulating valley photovoltaic devices. The valley photovoltaic
concept is a novel implementation of a hot-carrier solar cell and leverages the
valley scattering effect under large electric field to potentially achieve high
voltage and high efficiency. Fabricated devices have shown S-shaped
current-voltage curves, low fill factor, and thus low efficiency. We hence
develop the first device model for valley photovoltaics. Our model includes
electric-field-dependent valley scattering rates extracted from previous
ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the condition of nonequilibrium
carrier populations in the satellite valleys is not enough for valley
photovoltaics to achieve high efficiency. We also show that increasing the
built-in electric field of the valley-scattering region does not improve
efficiency, contrary to previous suggestion.

*Arif Hussain,Anang Dadhich,Enric Pardo*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 研究了高温超导(HTS)环形线圈在不同电压和热边界条件下的电磁和热量分析，揭示了其在航空应用中的热管理及故障响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超导电路在航空中有重要的应用，研究其电磁和热学行为有助于提高设计和可靠性

Method: 结合MEMEP方法和有限差分法（FDM）进行电磁热分析

Result: 高电压导致电流超过临界值，引发材料损伤；低电压表现周期性波动，涉及热扩散和电磁稳定性

Conclusion: 研究结果对设计超导电动机和改善航空设备可靠性有重要意义

Abstract: High-temperature superconducting (HTS) racetrack coils are promising
components for lightweight, high-power electric machines due to their
exceptional current-carrying capacity. However, self-heating due to AC loss or
DC short circuits can cause electro-thermal quench, which poses a significant
challenge for the design and reliability of superconducting motors. Here, we
apply an electro-magneto-thermal computational approach that integrates the
Minimum Electro-Magnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP) method for electromagnetic
modelling with the Finite Difference Method (FDM) for electrothermal analyses.
The investigation focuses on the response of an HTS racetrack coil subjected to
DC voltages ranging from low (1 V) to high values (1000 V) at operating
temperature of 30 K. Computations were conducted under two thermal boundary
conditions: complete adiabatic conditions and cooling applied to one side of
the coil with the top surface at 30 K. We found that at higher voltages, the
current exceeds the critical value, causing rapid thermal runaway that damages
the superconducting material. In contrast, at lower voltages, the coil presents
periodic oscillations in current and temperature, demonstrating a complex
interplay of thermal diffusion and electromagnetic stability. This study
provides critical insights into the thermal management and fault response of
HTS coils for aviation applications, particularly in the design of
superconducting motors for electric aircraft.

### [9] [On the surface Bloch waves in truncated periodic media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20431)
*Bojan B. Guzina,Shixu Meng,Prasanna Salasiya,Long Nguyen*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The study investigates surface Bloch (SB) waves in periodic media, focusing on their dispersion, waveform, and skin depth using a quadratic eigenvalue problem (QEP) approach. They model SB waves by considering evanescent QEP eigenstates and analyze the effects of surface undulations for optimal design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand and model SB waves in periodic media, which are important for applications in phononic crystals and metamaterials. The motivation stems from the need to manipulate wave propagation for device designs.

Method: Scalar wave equation with periodic coefficients is used as the test case. A QEP-based reduced order model is developed to describe SB waves' properties, including dispersion and skin depth. The model involves deriving complex wavenumbers by solving a QEP that considers the Bravais lattice, surface cut orientation, and wave direction.

Result: The QEP approach successfully captures dispersion characteristics and evanescent waveforms of SB waves. The method can be used to optimize surface cuts for desired wave behavior, indicating advancements in controlling wave propagation in periodic media.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing and optimizing surface Bloch waves, offering insights into designing phononic and photonic devices with tailored wave properties.

Abstract: Much like their counterparts in elastic solids, waves in periodic media can
be broadly classified into Floquet-Bloch body waves, and evanescent surface
waves. Our goal is to elucidate the latter boundary layers, termed surface
Bloch (SB) waves, affiliated with rational surface cuts and homogeneous Neumann
data. To this end we adopt the scalar wave equation with periodic coefficients
as a test bed and develop a unit cell-of-periodicity-based, reduced order model
of the SB waves that is capable of describing both their dispersion, waveforms,
and ``skin depth''. The centerpiece of our analysis is a quadratic eigenvalue
problem (QEP) for the effective unit cell of periodicity -- deriving from a
geometric interplay between the mother Bravais lattice, orientation of the
surface cut, and the direction of SB wave -- that seeks the complex wavenumber
normal to the cut plane given (i) the excitation frequency and (ii) wavenumber
in the direction of the SB wave. In this way the sought boundary layer is
derived via superposition of the evanescent QEP eigenstates, whose strengths
are obtained by imposing the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. With the
QEP eigenspectrum at hand, evaluation of an SB wave -- in terms of both
dispersion characteristics and evanescent waveforms -- entails only a
low-dimensional eigenvalue problem. This feature caters for rapid exploration
of the effect of (periodic) surface undulations, and so enables manipulation of
the SB waves via optimal design of the surface cut. For completeness, our
analysis includes an account for the power flow and ``skin depth'' of a surface
Bloch wave, both of which are critical for the energetic relevance of boundary
layers.

### [10] [A Wide-Input 0.25 um BCD LDO with Dual-Stage Amplifier and Active Ripple Cancellation for High PSRR and Fast Transient Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20522)
*Yi Zhang,Zhuolong Chen,Zhenghao Xu,Yujin He*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型的低功耗稳压电路（LDO），在相同电压范围内实现了更高的功载拒绝比（PSRR）和更快的瞬态响应，采用了双级误差放大器和主动降谐技术和自适应快速反馈机制，通过建模和仿真验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着SoC的集成，对LDO的性能要求提高，传统LDO在PSRR和瞬态响应方面存在冲突，如何突破这一限制成为研究重点。

Method: 提出了一种双级误差放大器架构，结合主动降谐和自适应反馈机制，构建了双级PSRR模型和三频段分析框架。

Result: 仿真结果显示PSRR达-75dB，瞬态响应在50uA至4mA负荷变化时输出电压仅0.65V的振荡，16us恢复。

Conclusion: 该设计有效满足了模拟/RF SoC和移动设备的高要求。

Abstract: Demand for on-chip low-dropout regulators (LDOs) with both high power-supply
rejection ratio (PSRR) and fast transient response is growing as system-on-chip
(SoC) integration increases. However, conventional LDO architectures face
difficulty achieving these performance metrics simultaneously over wide input
voltage ranges. This paper presents a wide-input linear regulator implemented
in 0.25 um BCD technology that attains high PSRR and swift load-transient
performance while maintaining low quiescent current. The proposed LDO employs a
dual-stage error amplifier architecture and active ripple cancellation along
both the power path and the error amplifier's supply to significantly enhance
PSRR across frequency. An adaptive fast feedback branch together with an
on-chip frequency compensation network is introduced to accelerate transient
response without compromising stability. A two-stage PSRR analytical model and
a three-frequency-band PSRR interpretation framework are developed to guide the
design. Cadence Spectre simulations of the 14 V-output LDO demonstrate a -75 dB
low-frequency PSRR, and during a 50 uA - 4 mA load step the output voltage
droop is kept under 0.65 V with recovery within 16 us. These results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and analysis, indicating that
the design meets the stringent requirements of analog/RF SoCs and portable
electronics.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: This study optimized pyrolysis conditions for ginkgo biomass into high-quality coal, with significant energy yield improvements. However, heavy metal contamination requires further study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the sustainable use of urban ginkgo pruning materials, aiming to develop a renewable energy source with lower environmental impact.

Method: Conducted pyrolysis experiments under varying temperatures after oven drying pretreatment, tested fuel properties using multiple analysis methods, and evaluated heavy metal content.

Result: Yielding 27.33-32.05% carbon and reducing 41.19-49.97% mass. Energy yield up to 46.75%, improved calorific value to 34.26 MJ/kg. Thermal stability and combustion performance were superior to other biomass types. Heavy metals like Zn were present in higher concentrations.

Conclusion: Viable method to produce high-quality coal from ginkgo pruning, with potential for further optimization to reduce environmental impact.

Abstract: Ginkgo biloba trees are widely planted in urban areas of developed countries
for their resilience, longevity and aesthetic appeal. Annual pruning to control
tree size, shape and interference with traffic and pedestrians generates large
volumes of unutilized Ginkgo biomass. This study aimed to valorize these
pruning residues into charcoal by optimizing pyrolysis conditions and
evaluating its fuel properties. The pyrolysis experiment was conducted at 400
to 600 degrees Celsius, after oven drying pretreatment. The mass yield of
charcoal was found to vary from 27.33 to 32.05 percent and the approximate
volume shrinkage was found to be 41.19 to 49.97 percent. The fuel properties of
the charcoals were evaluated using the moisture absorption test, proximate and
ultimate analysis, thermogravimetry, calorimetry and inductively coupled plasma
optical emission spectrometry. The calorific value improved from 20.76 to 34.26
MJ per kg with energy yield up to 46.75 percent. Charcoal exhibited superior
thermal stability and better combustion performance. The results revealed
satisfactory properties compared with other biomass, coal and biochar
standards. The product complied with first grade standards at 550 and 600
degrees Celsius and second grade wood charcoal standards at other temperatures.
However, higher concentrations of some heavy metals like Zn indicate the need
for pretreatment and further research on copyrolysis for resource optimization.
This study highlights the dual benefits of waste management and renewable
energy, providing insights for urban planning and policymaking.

Abstract: Ultrafast optical control of magnetic textures offers new opportunities for
energy-efficient, high-speed spintronic devices. While uniform magnetization
reversal via all-optical switching is well established, the formation dynamics
of non-uniform domain walls (DWs) under ultrafast excitation remain poorly
understood. Here, we use Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy combined with
transient optical grating excitation to directly image the real-time formation
of DWs in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film. We observe a rapid evolution from
disordered spin contrast to ordered DW arrays within 10 ps, including a
transient, strongly asymmetric DW state. In a narrow fluence window,
short-lived DWs form and spontaneously vanish within picoseconds. Multiscale
simulations combining atomistic spin dynamics and micromagnetics reveal a
nonlinear nucleation pathway involving a hybrid transition state where
localized, unstable spin textures coalesce into metastable DWs. This
nonequilibrium mechanism explains the observed asymmetry and spatial ordering,
and establishes a framework for controlling spin textures in magnetic materials
on femtosecond timescales.

Efficient energy conversion in these systems depends on the accurate modeling of ultrafast electron transfer mechanisms, which this paper aims to provide by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework.

Method: The researchers developed a semiclassical framework that integrates electron dynamics with nuclear motion and environmental relaxation effects. They used multidimensional diabatic free energy surfaces and a stochastic point-transition method to model multistage electron transfer cascades. This approach unifies various existing models, making it versatile for different applications.

Result: The framework explains that secondary acceptor shifts can suppress nonequilibrium recombination, and numerical simulations reveal how factors like reorganization energy and vibrational coupling influence electron transfer efficiency. This understanding helps in the rational design of photovoltaic devices and molecular systems for energy conversion.

Conclusion: The unified approach provides a scalable and systematic method for modeling and designing photofunctional systems, which is a significant advancement in the field of molecular and organic electronics.

Abstract: Ultrafast multistage electron transfer (ET) in molecular systems with
multiple redox centers is fundamental to photochemical energy conversion,
including processes in natural photosynthesis, molecular optoelectronics, and
organic photovoltaics. These systems often operate under nonequilibrium
conditions, where solvent relaxation, intramolecular vibrations, and competing
ET pathways jointly determine reaction kinetics and product yields. In this
chapter, we present a unified semiclassical framework for modeling ultrafast,
competitive ET in multiredox compounds embedded in polar environments with
complex relaxation dynamics. The approach constructs diabatic free energy
surfaces (FESs) in a multidimensional coordinate space that integrates both
polarization and relaxation components of the environment within a unified
representation. Electron dynamics are described using a stochastic
point-transition method that captures the coupling between nonadiabatic quantum
transitions and classical nuclear motion. The formalism generalizes and unifies
several established semiclassical models - including the Najbar-Tachiya,
Zusman-Beratan, and Sumi-Marcus approaches - and supports efficient simulation
of multistage ET cascades. As an application, we investigate ultrafast charge
separation in donor-acceptor-acceptor (D-A1-A2) triads, showing how hot charge
shift to a secondary acceptor can suppress nonequilibrium charge recombination.
Numerical simulations reveal how reorganization energies, vibrational coupling,
molecular geometry, and bending angle collectively influence ET efficiency. The
proposed framework offers a general and scalable tool for the rational design
of photofunctional molecular systems.

Abstract: Light-driven molecular nanomotors hold promise for applications in material
science and biomedicine. Significant efforts have focused on improving their
efficiency, often targeting single candidate molecules. Here, we present a
systematic data-driven approach to design nanomotors with high isomerization
quantum yields for one- and two-photon applications, the latter being critical
for biomedical applications requiring near-infrared light. We analyze the
excited state properties of a dataset of 2016 nanomotors substituted with
electron-donating and electron-withdrawing (push-pull) groups. Among the the
top candidates, we achieved an increase in two-photon absorption strengths of
up to two orders of magnitude compared to existing nanomotors. To ensure that
the pi-pi*-character of the excited state is preserved, which is necessary to
achieve the required photoisomerization, we introduce a photoreactivity score,
that gauges the excited state character based on the transition. Furthermore,
we benchmark three machine learning (ML) models Kernel Ridge Regression,
XGBoost, and a Neural Network using physical and connectivity-based molecular
descriptors. The excellent accuracy of our ML predictions holds promise to
replace computationally costly quantum chemistry calculations in chemical space
explorations.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The study compares different computational methods for electron-phonon coupling calculations, finding that the dH approach is reliable while the dψ approach has pitfalls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the mutual consistency of computational strategies for EPC, which is a critical issue in material science and electronic structure computations. Understanding reliable methods is essential for accurate modeling of material behavior.

Method: The authors benchmarked two ab initio methodologies using CP2K and VASP with wannier90, focusing on EPC parameters using both dH and dψ approaches. They tested this on various organic molecules.

Result: The study found better agreement with the dH method compared to the dψ approach, cautioning against the latter's use.

Conclusion: This benchmark study provides guidance on choosing reliable computational methods for EPC calculations, emphasizing the superiority of the dH method over dψ.

Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is fundamental for understanding the behavior
of molecules and crystals, influencing phenomena such as charge transport,
energy transfer, phase transitions, and polaron formation. Accurate
computational methods to calculate EPCs from first principles are essential,
but their complexity has resulted in a variety of computational strategies,
raising concerns about their mutual consistency.
  In this study, we provide a systematic benchmark of methods for EPC
calculation by comparing two fundamentally different {\it ab initio}
methodologies. We investigate Gaussian-type orbital methods based on the
\textsc{CP2K} code and plane-wave-based projector-augmented-wave (PAW) methods
combined with maximally localized Wannier functions, as implemented in
\textsc{VASP} and \textsc{wannier90}. In addition, we further distinguish
between the derivative--of--Hamiltonian ($dH$) and derivative--of--states
($d\psi$) approaches for obtaining EPC parameters. The comparison is conducted
on a representative set of organic molecules, including pyrazine, pyridine,
bithiophene, and quarterthiophene, varying significantly in size and
flexibility.
  We find excellent agreement across implementations and basis sets when
employing the same computational approach ($dH$ or $d\psi$), demonstrating
robust consistency between the numerical schemes. However, noticeable
deviations occur when comparing the $dH$ and $d\psi$ approaches within each
code and for specific cases discussed in detail. Our findings emphasize the
reliability of EPC computations using the $dH$ method and caution against
potential pitfalls associated with the $d\psi$ approach, providing guidance for
future EPC calculations and model parameterizations.

Result: 结果表明，包含三阶相互作用项能够提高吸附能的精度和优化的有效性，尤其是在不同覆盖度和表面结构下。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决更高复杂度的全局优化问题提供了新思路， mugger 无需依赖专用硬件。

Abstract: Understanding how molecules arrange on surfaces is fundamental to surface
chemistry and essential for the rational design of catalytic and functional
materials. In particular, the energetically most stable configuration provides
valuable insight into adsorption-related processes. However, the search for
this configuration is a global optimization problem with exponentially growing
complexity as the number of adsorbates and possible adsorption sites increases.
To address this, we express the adsorption energy as a sum of multi-adsorbate
interaction terms, evaluated using our in-house trained machine learning
interatomic potential MACE-Osaka24, and formulate the search for the most
stable configuration as a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO)
problem. We employ a tensor-train-based method, Tensor Train Optimizer (TTOpt),
to solve the HUBO problem and identify optimal adsorption configurations of CO
and NO molecules on various alloys up to full surface coverage. Our results
show that including interaction terms up to third order may be sufficient to
approximate adsorption energies within chemical accuracy and to identify
optimal configurations. We also observed that TTOpt performs better with the
HUBO formulation, suggesting that third-order terms help preserve correlations
between adsorption sites, which allow TTOpt to optimize configurations more
effectively. The extensive benchmarks across various alloys, surface
geometries, and adsorbates demonstrate the robustness and applicability of
using TTOpt to solve HUBO-type global optimization problems in surface
chemistry. In contrast to quantum and digital annealers, which have recently
been applied to similar global optimization tasks but are restricted to cost
functions with at most quadratic terms, our approach can incorporate
higher-order terms in a straightforward manner and does not require specialized
hardware.

Abstract: We construct an ultraviolet-complete, local, and unitary quantum field theory
in 2+1 dimensions that exhibits spontaneous breaking of space-time parity,
persisting to arbitrarily high temperatures. The theory is defined by a
renormalization group trajectory, triggered by a relevant deformation of a
conformal field theory, consisting of a critical biconical vector model and a
free massless Dirac fermion. This deformation couples the fermion to the scalar
sector, generating a renormalization group flow that terminates at a nontrivial
infrared fixed point described by a conformal Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model and a
decoupled critical vector model. By construction, the quantum field theory is
parity invariant at zero temperature. However, we show that at sufficiently
high temperatures, parity symmetry is spontaneously broken and remains so even
in the infinite-temperature limit. Our analysis relies on both, perturbative
renormalization group techniques in $4\!-\!\epsilon$ dimensions and functional
renormalization group techniques directly in 2+1 dimensions.

Abstract: Conformal field theory (CFT) can be placed on disparate space-time manifolds
to facilitate investigations of their properties. For (2+1)D theories, one
useful choice is the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^3$ obtained by
identifying antipodal points on the boundary sphere of a three-dimensional
ball. One-point functions of scalar primary fields on this manifold generally
do not vanish and encode the so-called crosscap coefficients. These
coefficients also manifest on the sphere as the overlaps between certain
crosscap states and CFT primary states. Taking the (2+1)D Ising CFT as a
concrete example, we demonstrate that crosscap coefficients can be extracted
from microscopic models. We construct crosscap states in both lattice models
defined on polyhedrons and continuum models in Landau levels, where the degrees
of freedom at antipodal points are entangled in Bell-type states. By computing
their overlaps with the eigenstates of many-body Hamiltonians, we obtain
results consistent with those from conformal bootstrap. Importantly, our
approach directly reveals the absolute values of crosscap overlaps, whereas
bootstrap calculations typically yield only their ratios. Furthermore, we
investigate the finite-size scaling of these overlaps and their evolution under
perturbations away from criticality.

Abstract: We develop the holographic framework for the $\TTbar$ deformation of
two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFT$_2$) with gravitational
anomalies, characterized by unequal left and right central charges and
holographically dual to topological massive gravity (TMG). Utilizing the mixed
boundary condition prescription, we construct the deformed BTZ black hole
geometry and derive the corresponding deformed energy spectrum, confirming that
the universal flow equation remains valid despite the presence of gravitational
anomalies. From the boundary perspective, we compute leading-order corrections
to entanglement entropy and reflected entropy induced by the $\TTbar$
deformation, as well as the balanced partial entanglement entropy
non-perturbatively. On the gravity side, these quantities are evaluated using
spinning worldlines in the deformed bulk geometry, with results matching their
field-theoretic counterparts in the high-temperature limit. We further analyze
the reality condition for holographic entanglement entropy, which constrains
the deformation parameter and reveals a generalized Hagedorn behavior. This
Hagedorn-like transition is also independently reproduced from the asymptotic
density of states in the deformed anomalous CFT$_2$, providing additional
evidence for its universality.

Abstract: We give a review on hyperbolic magnetic monopoles and hyperbolic vortices
obtained in the unified way through the conformal equivalence by the
dimensional reduction from the symmetric instantons with various spatial
symmetries in the four-dimensional Euclidean Yang-Mills theory. They are used
to understand quark confinement in the sense of the area law of the Wilson loop
average in a semi-classical picture from a unified treatment of Atiyah's
hyperbolic magnetic monopole and Witten-Manton's hyperbolic vortex. In this way
quark confinement is shown to be realized by the the non-perturbative vacuum
disordered by these topological defects. For this purpose we start from the
4-dim. Euclidean Yang-Mills theory and require the conformal equivalence
between the 4-dim. Euclidean space and the possible curved spacetimes with some
compact dimensions. This requirement forces us to restrict the gauge
configurations of 4-dim.Yang-Mills instantons to those with some spatial
symmetries (called symmetric instantons) which are identified with magnetic
monopoles and vortices living in the lower-dimensional curved hyperbolic
spacetime with constant negative curvature through the dimensional reduction.
At the same time, this scheme caused by the dimensional reduction give a
holographic description of hyperbolic magnetic monopole dominance on AdS3 in
the rigorous way without any further assumptions, which does not hold in the
flat Euclidean case. This unified treatment of two topological defects is shown
to give the semi-classical picture for quark confinement in the sense of
Wilson. We give the understanding of the result from the viewpoint of the
gauge-covariant Cho-Duan-Ge-Faddeev-Niemi decomposition for the gauge field.

*Lorenzo Benfatto,Omar Zanusso*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The renormalization group flow of a multiscalar φ³ theory in d=6-ε dimensions is shown to have a gradient structure, extending known results from d=6 to non-six dimensions by deriving specific constraints on beta functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the renormalization group flow in various dimensions is crucial for studying the behavior of quantum field theories near critical points and for addressing the triviality and Landau pole issues, especially in lower dimensions and twists.

Method: The authors employ perturbative renormalization group analysis in d=6-ε dimensions, calculate the beta functions up to three loops, and derive constraints to ensure the gradient flow structure by leveraging the trace anomaly and Ward identities.

Result: New linear constraints on the beta functions of the φ³ theory in d=6-ε dimensions are established, confirming the gradient structure of the renormalization group flow in this setup.

Conclusion: The discovery of these constraints provides further evidence for the gradient flow property of the RG flow in the φ³ theory across dimensions, enhancing our understanding of the theory's behavior in continuous dimensions and its implications for triviality concerns.

Abstract: The renormalization group flow of the multiscalar interacting $\varphi^3$
theory in $d=6$ dimensions is known to have a gradient structure, in which
suitable generalizations of the beta functions $B^{I}$ emerge as the gradient
of a scalar function $A$, $\partial_I A = T_{IJ} B^J $, with a nontrivial
tensor $T_{IJ}$ in the space of couplings. This has been shown directly to
three loops in schemes such as $\overline{\rm MS}$ and can be argued in general
by identifying $A$ with the coefficient of the topological term of the
trace-anomaly in $d=6$ up to a normalization. In this paper we show that the
same renormalization group has a gradient structure in $d=6-\varepsilon$. The
requirement of a gradient structure is translated to linear constraints that
the coefficients of the $\overline{\rm MS}$ beta functions must obey, one of
which is new and pertinent only to the extension to $d \neq 6$.

### [25] [Quasi-topological mass generation for 3D linearized gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20845)
*Erica Bertolini,Edoardo Lui,Nicola Maggiore*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: A new mass generation mechanism for three-dimensional linearized gravity is presented using a Chern-Simons-like term, with the resulting theory showing a massive gauge boson and maintaining a massless limit. The model is structurally similar to Topological Massive Gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores possible modifications to three-dimensional gravity theories to introduce mass terms for the gravitational field, which has been largely absent in lower dimensions compared to higher-dimensional theories.

Method: The authors introduce a modified action by adding a lower-dimensional Chern-Simons-like term to the invariant action of linearized gravity in 3D. They employ gauge fixing and analyze the propagators to identify the degrees of freedom.

Result: The theory contains a single massive propagating degree of freedom, which is traced back to the transverse spatial Ricci tensor component. This matches the behavior observed in the Deser-Jackiw-Templeton model.

Conclusion: The modified theory successfully generates a massive graviton mode while retaining the massless limit, suggesting potential applications in areas requiring such behavior, like quantum gravity or condensed matter analogs.

Abstract: We present a new mass generation mechanism for linearized gravity in three
spacetime dimensions, which consists of a lower-dimensional Chern-Simons-like
term added to the invariant action. The propagators of the gauge fixed massive
action show a massive pole and a good massless limit. Moreover, we show that,
as the Topological Massive Gravity model of Deser, Jackiw and Templeton, this
theory displays one propagating massive DoF, which can be traced back to the
transverse part of the spatial Ricci tensor. Finally, the action of this
linearized massive gravity is characterized by an algebraic structure formed by
a set of Ward operators, which uniquely determine the theory.

Conclusion: 研究为$	ext{SU}(N)$Sp粒子的有效常数研究提供了一种新方法和结果，可能扩展到相关场论和弦理论问题。

Abstract: In this work, we present a recurrence relation for the instanton partition
function of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM $SU(N)$ gauge theory with $2N$ fundamental
multiplets. The main difficulty lies in determining the asymptotic behaviour of
the partition function in the regime of large vacuum expectation values of the
Higgs field. We demonstrate that, in this limit, the partition function is
governed by the Quantum Seiberg-Witten curves, as it is in the
Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit, up to a normalisation constant. With the found
asymptotic behaviour, we are able to write the recurrence relation for the
partition function and to find the effective infrared coupling constant. The
resulting effective constant is an inverse to a modular function with respect
to a certain triangle group, and the asymptotic itself is a product of modular
functions and forms with respect to the same group.

Abstract: We formulate a discrete model of holography on biregular trees, which are
discrete symmetric spaces associated with the bulk isometry group SU(3) over
the unramified quadratic extension of a nonarchimedean field. For a scalar
field theory on biregular trees, the bulk-to-bulk and bulk-to-boundary
propagators exhibit distinct features absent on the regular tree or continuum
AdS spaces, arising from the semihomogeneous nature of the bulk space. We
compute the two- and three-point correlators of the putative boundary dual. The
three-point correlator exhibits a nontrivial "tensor structure" via dependence
on the homogeneity degree of a unique bulk point specified in terms of boundary
insertion points. The computed OPE coefficients show dependence on zeta
functions associated with the unramified quadratic extension of a
nonarchimedean field. This work initiates the formulation of holography on a
family of discrete holographic spaces that exhibit features of both flat space
and negatively curved space.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 抽象模型研究由非交换规范群6d超引力理论提出，通过分析局部和全球相容性条件，确定了有限数量的可接受模型，得出一个统一的约束公式。模型符合E8×F4×(G2×SU(2))²的规范群结构，与F理论中的模型类似，这对F理论有限模型研究具有启发作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究物理理论中的规范群相容性是非常重要的，特别是当研究不同的维度和各种可能的模型时。这篇论文通过异常抵消条件分析得到有限模型空间，这对相容的规范群和超引力理论的发展有指导意义。

Method: 论文者通过将异常抵消条件转化为高维线性规划问题，使用对偶方法进行研究，得出了模型数量的上限，并且得到规范群结构的具体形式。

Result: 研究得出，具有非交换规范群的6d超引力理论最多只能有3003个张量多重场，规范群结构非常符合已知的相类似模型，特别是与F理论中的某些结果相吻合。

Conclusion: 这些结果不仅限于6d超引力理论，还为弦论中的类似问题提供了新的视角和方法，进而促进不同理论之间的联系与发展。

Abstract: 6d supergravities with non-abelian gauge group are subject to many
consistency conditions. While the absence of local gauge and gravitational
anomalies allows for infinitely many models, we show that those conditions
stemming from the absence of both local and global anomalies together are
strong enough to leave only finitely many consistent models. To do this we
distill the consequences of anomaly cancellation into a high-dimensional linear
program whose dual can be efficiently studied using standard techniques. We
obtain a universal bound on the number of tensor multiplets $T \leq 11 \cdot
273 = 3003$ and show that this leads to a finite landscape of consistent
non-abelian models. Interestingly, the model which saturates this bound has
gauge group $[E_8 \times F_4 \times (G_2 \times \mathrm{SU}(2))^2]^{273}$,
which bears a striking resemblance to the model which saturates the bound $T
\leq 193$ for F-theory constructions.

Conclusion: 该研究为在highly curved引力环境中的局部和热力学观察框架提供了理论基础，对量子引力和黑洞物理的研究具有重要的理论意义。

Abstract: We propose a construction of fiducial observers in the throat region of
near-extremal black holes within the framework of JT quantum gravity, leading
to a notion of local observers in a highly quantum regime of the gravitational
field. The construction is based on an earlier proposal for light-ray anchoring
to the asymptotic boundary and is uniquely fixed at the semiclassical level by
demanding that the notion of time translations for an observer at the
asymptotic boundary of JT gravity should be extended into the bulk as the flow
of a conformal isometry. Since conformal isometries are a necessary condition
for geometric modular flow, our construction is amenable as a candidate
geometric gravitational dressing that may be interpreted via the modular
crossed product, potentially connecting our choice of dressing with recent
developments on the literature on local observables in quantum gravity. Taking
this definition beyond the semiclassical regime, we compute quantum
gravitational wormhole contributions to the black hole thermal atmosphere,
directly producing a finite thermal entropy and leading to a quantum
description of the stretched horizon in this model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to improve precision in studying complex quantum systems, particularly those from high-energy theories by examining matrix models.

Method: They apply the matrix bootstrap technique, considering constraints up to level 14, and leverage symmetries to analyze observables like ⟨ tr X² ⟩ in confining phases at infinite N.

Result: The method provides results more precise than existing large N and lattice simulations, with estimates accurate up to 8 significant digits.

Conclusion: This approach offers a robust framework for enhancing the precision of studies in conforming phases of matrix quantum mechanics, with potential applications in understanding Yang-Mills theories.

Abstract: We consider matrix quantum mechanics with multiple bosonic matrices,
including those obtained from dimensional reduction of Yang-Mills theories.
Using the matrix bootstrap, we study simple observables like $\langle
\mathop{tr} X^2 \rangle$ in the confining phase of the theory in the infinite
$N$ limit. By leveraging the symmetries of these models and using non-linear
relaxation, we consider constraints up to level 14, e.g., constraints from
traces of words of length $\le 14$. Our results are more precise than large
$N$, continuum extrapolations of lattice Monte Carlo simulations, including an
estimate of certain simple observables up to 8 significant digits.

### [31] [Non-volatile photorefractive tuning and green light generation in a diamond cavity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19583)
*Joe Itoi,Elham Zohari,Nicholas J. Sorensen,Waleed El-Sayed,Joseph E. Losby,Gustavo O. Luiz,Sigurd Flågan,Paul E. Barclay*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the first deterministic and non-volatile resonance tuning of diamond nanocavities using photorefractive effects and third-harmonic generation. They observed a blue shift of 20.9 GHz surpassing the cavity's linewidth, which is caused by a refractive index change of -1e-4, allowing for stable tuning over hours. This overcomes a previous issue with diamond's vanishing second-order nonlinear susceptibility, suggesting new applications for frequency converters and modulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on quantum and nonlinear optical technologies in diamond nanocavities, emphasizing precise control and tunability. This is relevant as diamond's potential in these fields is immense, and overcoming issues like vanishing second-order nonlinearity opens new possibilities for applications.

Method: The researchers observed photorefractive effects in diamond nanocavities, where third-harmonic light was generated and blue-shifted the cavity frequency. They measured the resulting shift, which turned out to be larger than the cavity linewidth, and analyzed the effect on the refractive index, linking it to the generation of non-zero second-order susceptibility.

Result: The main result is successful non-volatile, deterministic tuning of diamond nanocavities via photorefractive and third-harmonic effects, with a significant frequency shift that meets practical applications. This discovery is significant as it overcomes a long-standing limitation of diamond's nonlinearity, enabling new optical devices.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the use of photorefractive effects in diamond nanocavities for precise resonance tuning. By showing how third-harmonic generation contributes to blue-shifting the cavity frequency and creating a non-zero second-order susceptibility, the researchers pave the way for new optoelectronic devices and applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Single-crystal diamond nanocavities have tremendous potential for use in
quantum and nonlinear optical technologies. The ability to precisely control
their resonant frequencies is essential for many applications, and $\textit{in
situ}$ tuning is particularly desirable. In this work, we demonstrate
deterministic and non-volatile resonance tuning of a diamond nanocavity. We
observed a photorefractive effect in concert with the generation of
third-harmonic light within the device. This effect blue-shifted the cavity
resonance frequency by $20.9\,\text{GHz}$, exceeding the cavity linewidth. The
shift corresponded to a fractional change in refractive index of $-10^{-4}$,
and its relaxation occurred over several tens of hours. Although
photorefraction is a second-order nonlinear effect and has previously not been
observed in diamond owing to its vanishing $\chi^{(2)}$, the observed behaviour
is consistent with the generation of non-zero $\chi^{(2)}$ by electric fields
from charged crystal defects. This observation could enable the realisation of
diamond frequency converters and electro-optical modulators that rely on
second-order nonlinearity.

TL;DR: Optical tweezers are improved using hyperbolic materials, achieving nanometer accuracy and higher efficiency without high intensity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitation of optical tweezers' diffraction resolution is addressed to allow for better particle control.

Method: Utilizes hyperbolic materials with cylinder geometry, which exhibits auto-focusing and efficient light focusing.

Result: Nanometer accuracy and magnitudes more efficient forces without high light intensity.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic materials offer a solution for overcoming optical tweezers' limitations.

Abstract: Optical tweezers, formed by tightly focused propagating laser beams, offer
the unique capability to trap and control microscopic particles over a broad
size range. However, the diffraction inherent to propagating optical fields,
limits the resulting resolution and the accuracy of particle manipulation. Here
we show that the phenomenon of ``auto-focusing'' inherent to hyperbolic
materials in cylinder geometry, can be used for spatial control with nanometer
accuracy. Furthermore, due to highly efficient light focusing in hyperbolic
media that is not restricted by diffraction, the resulting electromagnetically
induced forces exceed those of conventional optical tweezers by several orders
of magnitude, which allows more efficient particle manipulation at reduced
illumination intensity.

Abstract: This work present an affine map approximation for solving the inverse
scattering problem related to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger model of signal
propagation in high-speed coherent optical communication. Numerical simulations
indicate that accurate recovery of the transmitted bit sequence can be achieved
using only the continuous part of the Lax spectrum at the fiber output, thereby
allowing the discrete (soliton) spectrum to be disregarded. We observed that
the numerically evaluated rank of the resulting affine map matrix equals the
number of bits per transmitted sequence, and we utilize this to derive a
reduced order affine map.

*Mitchell Harling,Chandler Stevenson,Ayman F. Abouraddy,Kimani C. Toussaint Jr*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates a method to achieve scattering immunity in optical communications by using partially coherent light with maximal entropy based on the coherence rank of the field. The method ensures 100% fidelity communication through highly scattering environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop robust optical communication techniques in environments with extreme scattering, which is a significant challenge for traditional encoding schemes. 

Method: The method uses partially coherent fields, encoding logical bits in the coherence rank. They prepare fields with maximal entropies corresponding to different ranks (0, 1, 1.585, 2 bits) and demonstrate 100% fidelity. 

Result: 100% fidelity achieved through scattering-immune communication using this method.

Conclusion: This approach provides a promising countermeasure against scattering, ensuring reliable communication even in challenging environments.

Abstract: In optical communications, logical bits are encoded in physical
degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) of the electromagnetic field. Consequently, optical
scattering in a communications channel compromises the information transfer. In
the worst-case-scenario, bit-to-bit stochastically varying scattering that
couples the DoFs to each other -including even unused DoFs -can decouple the
transmitter and receiver when relying on conventional physical encoding
schemes, and preclude the utilization of adaptive techniques as a
counter-measure. Here we show that partially coherent optical fields help
circumvent the worst-case-scenario of rapidly varying, strong optical
scattering, even when the channel is rendered informationally opaque for
conventional approaches. Using a channel in which the spatial and polarization
DoFs are relevant, we encode the logical bits in the unitarily invariant
coherence rank (the number of non-zero eigenvalues of the field coherence
matrix) and prepare our partially coherent fields with maximal entropies of 0,
1, 1.585, and 2 bits for rank-1, rank-2, rank-3, and rank-4 coherence matrices,
respectively. This scheme demonstrates scattering-immune optical communications
with 100 % fidelity. These results unveil an unexpected utility for partially
coherent light in optical communications through challenging environments.

Abstract: Hybrid integration of two-dimensional (2D) materials with nanophotonic
platforms has enabled compact optoelectronic devices by leveraging the unique
optical and electronic properties of atomically thin layers. While most efforts
have focused on coupling 2D materials to pre-defined photonic structures, the
broader potential of 2D heterostructures for actively engineering the photonic
environment remains largely unexplored. In our previous work, we employed
single types of 2D material and showed that even monolayer flakes can locally
induce high-$Q$ nanocavities in photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides through
effective refractive index modulation. Here, we extend this concept by
demonstrating that further transferring of 2D material flakes onto the induced
hybrid nanocavity to form heterostructures enable more flexibility for
post-fabrication dielectric environment engineering of the cavity. We show that
the high-$Q$ hybrid nanocavities remain robust under sequential flake stacking.
Coupling optically active MoTe$_{2}$ flake to these cavities yields enhanced
photoluminescence and reduced emission lifetimes, consistent with
Purcell-enhanced light-matter interactions. Additionally, encapsulation with a
top hBN layer leads to a significant increase in the cavity $Q$ factor, in
agreement with numerical simulations. Our results show that these
heterostructure stacks not only preserve the cavity quality but also introduce
an additional degrees of control -- via flake thickness, refractive indices,
size and interface design -- offering a richer dielectric environment
modulation landscape than what is achievable with monolayers alone, providing a
versatile method toward scalable and reconfigurable hybrid nanophotonic
systems.

Abstract: The minority carrier lifetime of semiconductor materials is a crucial
performance parameter for optoelectronic devices. However, the existing
minority carrier lifetime measurement techniques necessitate delicate optical
measurement systems and harmful treatment of the samples, which will definitely
cause great constraints on the further development of the semiconductor
industry. Here, an off-junction graphene/water/silicon photodetector is
realized based on the charming dynamic polarization process of water molecules
at the water/silicon and water/graphene interface, which shows a typical
responsivity and detectivity of 36.55 mA W-1 and 1.62*1012 Jones respectively
under 890 nm illumination with a distance of 0.2 cm away from the junction.
This pulse-like photo-response arises from the diffusion and drift current
toward the water/silicon interface generated by the illumination on an
off-junction spot. Furthermore, by measuring the photo-current at a different
distance from the junction combined with an exponential fitting method, the
minority carrier lifetime calculation of silicon can be performed with the
maximum accuracy rate reaches 98.8%, where water plays the key role of deducing
the carrier lifetime. This study provides a straightforward method that paves
the way for future minority carrier lifetime tests of semiconductor materials,
which hold great potential for developing the nondestructive tests(NDT) in
semiconductor industry.

TL;DR: This paper reports the first direct mapping of the local density of states (LDOS) in a photonic time crystal, showing how it evolves from spontaneous emission enhancement to lasing. They used microwave modulated LC resonators and found that the LDOS shows Lorentzian lines near a momentum gap frequency, with the emission rate maximized at this frequency. When gain exceeds loss, they transitioned to lasing. Their results align with classical Floquet theory and open new avenues in photonics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the physics of photonic time crystals, specifically focusing on the LDOS. Understanding the behavior of LDOS in such systems is important for advancing the field of photonics and lasing applications. The study's findings could lead to new materials and devices with engineered photonics properties.

Method: The researchers implemented a PTC using time-periodically modulated LC resonators. They used microwave frequencies and a broadband white noise probe to measure the LDOS. The data was analyzed using classical non-Hermitian Floquet theory to extract features like Lorentzian lines and emission rates.

Result: They verified the predictions of Floquet theory with their experimental results. The LDOS showed maximum emission at the gap frequency, and the system transitioned to lasing when modulation-induced gain exceeded losses, suggesting their model works.

Conclusion: Their findings provide a direct mapping of LDOS in a PTC and demonstrate control over light propagation in time-periodic systems, opening new possibilities for designing ultrafast and ultrasensitive photonics devices.

Abstract: We report the first direct mapping of the local density of states (LDOS) in a
photonic time crystal (PTC), capturing its evolution from the analogues of
spontaneous emission enhancement to thresholded lasing. The PTC is implemented
with an array of time-periodically modulated LC resonators at microwave
frequencies. Broadband white noise probes the system and reveals an LDOS
lineshape that decomposes into absorptive and dispersive Lorentzian components
near the momentum gap frequency. The finite peak amplitude, which grows with
modulation strength, shows that the spontaneous emission rate is maximized at
the gap frequency. All observed features agree with classical non-Hermitian
Floquet theory. When modulation-induced gain exceeds losses, the PTC
transitions to a narrow-band lasing oscillation state. These findings open a
route to nonequilibrium photonics and bring time-periodic LDOS engineering
closer to practical realization.

Abstract: This work presents a quantum-limited optomechanical sensing platform for
real-time detection and discrimination of chiral molecules, based on a
multilayer hybrid plasmonic-mechanical resonator. Leveraging quantum zero-point
motion and engineered photon-phonon interactions, the system achieves ultrahigh
displacement sensitivity that approaches the fundamental quantum limit. The
multilayer architecture, composed of alternating dielectric and metallic films,
supports mechanical resonances with quality factors reaching approximately ten
thousand in the megahertz frequency range. These resonances coherently modulate
the optical field through radiation pressure and dynamical backaction. Power
spectral density measurements reveal distinct mechanical peaks at 0.68, 2.9,
4.3, 5.5, and 6.8 MHz, with optomechanical coupling strengths exceeding twice
the intrinsic baseline, enabling highly efficient signal transduction.
Lorentzian fitting confirms the presence of sharp mechanical linewidths, while
the total force noise, including thermal, shot, and technical contributions,
remains below the threshold required for detecting sub-piconewton forces.
Time-resolved Raman spectroscopy, which is typically insensitive to chirality,
here reveals enantioselective dynamics arising from asymmetric optomechanical
interactions, enabling clear spectral distinction between d- and l-enantiomers.
Finite-element simulations validate the strong spatial overlap between optical
confinement and mechanical displacement modes. This platform offers a scalable
and tunable approach to quantum-limited, high-sensitivity chiral molecule
detection, with applications in coherent control, precision spectroscopy, and
chemical sensing.

Abstract: Large-area chemically synthesized single-crystal metals with nanometer-scale
thickness have emerged as promising materials for on-chip nanophotonic
applications, owing to their superior plasmonic properties compared to
nanofabricated polycrystalline counterparts. While much recent attention has
focused on their optical properties, the combined optimal electrical and
optical characteristics, which hold great potential for high-performance
optoelectronic functionalities, remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a
single-crystal plasmonic optoelectronic platform based on nanowires fabricated
from synthesized gold flakes and demonstrate its capabilities for highly
enhanced hot carrier collection, electroluminescence, and photovoltage
detection. Notably, single-crystal gold nanogap devices exhibit an order of
magnitude higher open-circuit photovoltage compared to polycrystalline devices,
representing one of the highest reported photovoltage sensing performances in
terms of on-chip device density and responsivity per area. Our analysis
revealed that this enhancement is attributed mostly to the suppression of
electron-phonon scattering and improved hot carrier tunneling efficiency in
single-crystal devices. These results highlight the potential of large-scale
single-crystal nanostructures for both fundamental studies of nanoscale hot

Abstract: In this work, we present a generalized guided mode expansion method to model
complex resonances in photonic crystal slabs within a non-Hermitian framework.
By expanding the electromagnetic fields over the complete mode basis of an
unpatterned slab and systematically integrating out radiative Fabry-Perot
modes, we derive an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that treats guided mode
coupling and radiation losses on equal footing. As a case study highlighting
the power of our effective theory, we apply it to hexagonal lattices with both
preserved and broken $C_6$ symmetry. The method accurately predicts complex
band structures, near-field profiles, and far-field radiation patterns, in
excellent agreement with full-wave finite element simulations. In particular,
it reproduces both symmetry-protected BICs at the $\Gamma$ point, accidental
off-$\Gamma$ BICs in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$ point, and emergence of
chiral exceptional points. It also captures the tunable behavior of eigenmodes
near the $K$ point, including the shift of Dirac points and the emergence of
quasi-BICs or bandgap opening, depending on the nature of $C_6$ symmetry
breaking. Our work paves the way for predictive and efficient modeling of
complex photonic resonances, revealing their topological and symmetry-protected
characteristics in non-Hermitian systems.

*Sky Semone,Matthew J. Brandsema,Christos Argyropoulos*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper discusses a novel chiral plasmonic metasurface that improves SPDC efficiency and generates circularly polarized single-photon pairs for quantum applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of SPDC-based sources, such as low efficiency and lack of polarization control, to enable broader quantum applications.

Method: The method involves designing an ultrathin metasurface with a qBIC resonance to increase efficiency and achieve circular polarization.

Result: The metasurface increases efficiency, supports free space coupling, operates at room temperature, and provides a compact quantum source.

Conclusion: This metasurface addresses the challenges in quantum computing and communication by offering efficient and controllable single-photon sources.

Abstract: Spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) has proven to be a robust and
prominent method for creating non-classical light sources of entangled
single-photon pairs. However, such sources suffer from low efficiency due to
the inherent weakness of the SPDC process. Moreover, there is no control of
polarization in the generated photons. Circular polarized SPDC-based sources
with efficient chiral response are currently missing, which severely precludes
the realization of a wide range of practical applications in quantum computing
and communications. The current work solves these inherent problems by
demonstrating a novel chiral plasmonic metasurface that leverages a strong
quasi-bound state in the continuum (qBIC) resonance which significantly
increases the SPDC photon generation efficiency and realizes circular polarized
(chiral) single-photon pairs. The presented metasurface design is ultrathin,
supports efficient free space outcoupling of chiral classical and quantum
radiation, and operates at room temperature. Hence, it offers the potential to
realize a compact and integrable quantum source of circularly polarized
entangled single-photon pairs.

Abstract: The rapid progress of nanophotonics demands theoretical frameworks capable of
predicting the resonant behavior of complex systems comprising constituents of

classical temporal coupled-mode theory (CMT) is applicable. This work presents
a coupled-quasinormal-mode (cQNM) framework for analyzing dissipative coupling
with photonic and plasmonic resonators. The framework provides rigorous
closed-form expressions for dissipative coupling coefficients and introduces
novel features, such as a new coupling scheme via time derivatives of
excitation coefficients. It delivers transparent and accurate predictions of
exotic phenomena-such as zero-coupling between very close cavities and
level-attraction effects that are only vaguely captured by traditional CMT
models. Efficient and user-friendly, this framework facilitates rapid parameter
space exploration for device design and offers potential for extension to
nonlinear and quantum systems in future applications.

Abstract: The electromagnetic response of metasurfaces can be intentionally engineered
by carefully designing their unit cells. Narrowband metasurfaces, characterized
by high quality factors, can serve as an efficient platform for biosensing in
optical to THz regimes, to explore new structural forms of biomolecules,
further elevating the capabilities of THz sensing technologies. In this study,
an all-metallic metasurface featuring structural asymmetry is proposed to
analyze L-Cysteine with orthorhombic and monoclinic crystallographic
structures. The influence of the concentration of L-Cysteine in the monoclinic
phase on the THz response of the metasurface was performed using a drop-casting
method. Our findings reveal a noticeable frequency shift as analyte
concentration raises, underscoring the potential for high sensitivity in
detecting biomolecules. Thus, this research demonstrates that asymmetric THz
metasurfaces offer rather promising detection capabilities at lower THz
frequencies between two crystallographic structures of L Cysteine, with a
Q-factor of 37, and a sensitivity of 1.430 THz ml/g. We believe that our
results can be of great value to the development of biosensors for improved

Motivation: The need for compact and multi-functional optical sensors that can handle both spectral and polarization information efficiently, particularly in applications like biomedical diagnosis and industrial metrology.

Result: Experiments show accurate reconstruction across broad wavelengths, high imaging capability, and successful integration into a CMOS image sensor, opening possibilities for on-chip multi-dimensional sensing.

Conclusion: This integrated approach provides a compact solution for multi-functional optical sensing, enhancing versatility in various applications.

Abstract: Conventional spectrometer and polarimeter systems rely on bulky optics,
fundamentally limiting compact integration and hindering multi-dimensional
optical sensing capabilities. Here, we propose a spectropolarimeter enabled by
metasurface-based diffractive optical networks that simultaneously performs
spectrometric and polarimetric measurements in a compact device. By leveraging
the wavelength- and polarization-dependent phase modulation of metasurfaces,
our system encodes the spectral and polarization information of incident light
into spatially resolved intensity distributions, which are subsequently decoded
by a trained deep neural network, enabling simultaneous high-accuracy
reconstruction of both spectral compositions and Stokes parameters through a
single-shot measurement. Experiments validate the proposed network's accurate
reconstruction of the spectral and polarization information across a broad
wavelength range, and further confirm its imaging capability. Notably, we
demonstrate a chip-integrated sensor prototype combing both measurement
functionalities into a commercial CMOS image sensor. This integrated platform
provides a compact solution for on-chip multi-dimensional optical sensing,
holding significant potential for versatile sensing, biomedical diagnosis, and
industrial metrology.

Abstract: Optical feedback is a well-known method of controlling laser dynamics, which
has been widely studied in photonic systems to induce complex behaviors such as
chaos or enhanced coherence. However, its application to systems in the strong
light-matter coupling regime remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce a
delayed optical feedback loop into a nonresonantly pumped polariton condensate.
By feeding part of the emission back into the cavity to seed the next
condensate, we observe a strong increase in the output intensity, up to 110%.
We explain this effect using a classical rate equation model for the condensate
coupled to excitonic reservoirs. Our results evidence that polariton
condensates can respond strongly to optical feedback, congruent with well known
polariton amplification techniques using resonant pump-probe setups. Our method
opens new possibilities for using polariton feedback to connect multiple
condensates and can be an essential step toward neuromorphic computing based on
recurrent signaling in photonic systems.

Conclusion: The work presents a practical machine learning photonic device that efficiently integrates scalable processing with FPGA support for real-world applications.

Abstract: Photonic neural networks (PNNs) of sufficiently large physical dimensions and
high operation accuracies are envisaged as an ideal candidate for breaking the
major bottlenecks in the current artificial intelligence architectures in terms
of latency, energy efficiency and computational power. To achieve this vision,
it is of vital importance to scale up the PNNs and in the meantime reduce the
high demand on the dimensions required by the PNNs. The underlying cause of
this strategy is the enormous gap between the scales of photonic and electronic
integrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate monolithically integrated optical
convolutional processors on thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) to enable
large-scale programmable convolution kernels and in turn greatly reduce the
dimensions required by the subsequent fully connected layers. Experimental
validation achieves high classification accuracies of 96%/86% on the
MNIST/Fashion-MNIST datasets and 84.6% on the AG News dataset, while
dramatically reducing the required subsequent fully connected layer dimensions
to 196x10 (from 784x10) and 175x4 (from 800x4), respectively. Furthermore, our
devices can be driven by commercial field-programmable gate array (FPGA)
systems, a unique advantage in addition to their scalable channel number and

Abstract: We report on the frequency conversions of terahertz (THz) waves at ultrafast
time boundaries created via femtosecond laser-induced air-to-plasma phase
transitions. Our combined experimental and theoretical approach reveals that
the abrupt change in refractive index at the ultrafast time boundaries drives
both the red and blue shifts over the broadband THz spectrum due to the
dispersive plasma, with distinctive amplitude variations. The present study
contrasts these effects with those from spatial boundaries, highlighting the
superior efficacy of temporal manipulations for spectral engineering. These
findings not only deepen the understanding of light-matter interactions in
time-varying media but also pave the way for innovative applications in THz

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着光纤通信技术的发展，高符号速率系统中非线性效应和PMD随机效应变得越来越显著，如何补偿这些干扰以提高传输性能是一个关键问题。

Method: 使用分裂步长傅里叶法（SSFM）进行模拟，分别分析了理想情况下IC-NLC在不同符号速率下的性能，以及实际情况下LDBP在C带宽分复用（WDM）系统中的表现。

Result: 随着符号速率从200 GBaud增加到300 GBaud，IC-NLC带来的理论增益有所下降。在EDFA放大链接中，IDBP增益从28.16 dB下降到24.31 dB，而在DRA放大链接中，增益下降了一部分。LDBP在实际应用中增益从0.53 dB升到300 GBaud时的0.87 dB，进一步升到1.30 dB。

Conclusion: 即使在高符号速率和显著PMD影响的情况下，IC-NLC和LDBP仍能有效提高系统的传输性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate and assess the performance of intra-channel
nonlinearity compensation (IC-NLC) in long-haul coherent optical transmission
systems with a symbol rate of 200 GBaud and beyond. We first evaluate the
potential gain of ideal IC-NLC in 4 THz systems by estimating the proportion of
self-channel interference (SCI) using the split-step Fourier method (SSFM)
based simulation with either lumped amplification or distributed amplification.
As the symbol rate increases to 300 GBaud, the SCI proportion exceeds 65%. On
the other hand, the non-deterministic polarization mode dispersion (PMD) will
impact the effectiveness of IC-NLC, especially for ultra-high symbol rate
systems. Therefore, we investigate the power spectral density of the residual
nonlinear noise after ideal IC-NLC in the presence of PMD. The results indicate
that the gain of ideal digital backpropagation (IDBP) decreases by 3.85 dB in
300 GBaud erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA)-amplified links with a PMD
parameter of 0.05 ps/km1/2, and 5.09 dB in distributed Raman amplifier
(DRA)-amplified links. Finally, we evaluate the potential gains of practical
IC-NLC in C-band wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) systems by employing
the low-pass-filter assisted digital backpropagation (LDBP). As the symbol rate
increases from 100 GBaud to 300 GBaud, the gain of 20-step-per-span (20-stps)
LDBP increases from 0.53 dB to 0.87 dB for EDFA-amplified links, and from 0.89
dB to 1.30 dB for DRA-amplified links. Our quantitative results show that for
200 GBaud and beyond systems, there is a sizable gain to achieve by
compensating for intra-channel nonlinearity even with a large non-deterministic
PMD.

adopting curved apertures as a more versatile alternative for beam shaping. We
introduce a novel formulation for wave trajectory engineering compatible with

that curved apertures offer improved control over wave propagation, are more
resilient to phase control constraints, and achieve higher power density across

Abstract: We demonstrate the realization of refractometric measurements relying on the
study of the transmission spectrum of filled capillary fibers. In this method,
the fiber is filled with a material with a lower refractive index than that of
the capillary and, due to antiresonant guidance mechanism, a characteristic
transmission spectrum alternating high and low attenuation regions is obtained.
The refractive index data is hence extracted by analyzing the spectral
positions of the fiber transmission bands. While this method holds broad
applicability for diverse materials, we specifically applied this technique to
characterize agarose gels, due to their interest as a promising optical
material. By analyzing the transmission spectra across the 600-900 nm
wavelength range, we determined the dispersion trend for agar gels prepared
with varying water and glycerol concentrations and estimated their first-order
Sellmeier coefficients. The reported refractometric method provides a simple
and promising means for characterizing the dispersion properties of a wide
range of materials, including gels, solids, and liquids, also opening new
possibilities for the development of new refractive index sensing platforms.

achieving full 2$\pi$ phase control at telecommunication wavelengths, with
simulated transmission efficiencies reaching 90 %. The architecture is guided
by a semi-analytical Fabry-Perot model and validated through full-wave

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photonic applications requiring advanced light management, such as angular and spectral control, are being driven by the need for precise control in complex systems.

Method: Reverse-engineering design approach based on Fourier space analysis and blob detection to create optimized point distributions, which are then decorated with nano-resonators or meta-atoms.

Result: The hydrodynamic-like flow of light around these structures allows for individual control over both the angular and spectral responses, with simulations and experiments confirming the effectiveness of the method.

Conclusion: This approach opens new possibilities for creating versatile and highly controllable metasurfaces, enhancing the capabilities of photonic devices by independent manipulation of light scattering in both angular and spectral domains.

Abstract: Metasurfaces with precise spectral and angular control of light scattering
are of growing interest for photonic applications requiring advanced photon
management. Correlated disorder emerged as a promising route for angular
control of light scattering, but most design approaches are computationally
expensive or do not allow spectral tunability. Here, we introduce a
reverse-engineering design approach for correlated-disordered metasurfaces
based on tailoring the Fourier space and blob detection to create point
distributions that are later "decorated" with individually designed
nano-resonators or meta-atoms to tune the optical response for the desired
functionality. We validate the control of the angular scattering by fabricating
ensembles of Au nanopillars following our design and characterizing their
angular scattering with Fourier microscopy. Using finite-difference time-domain
simulations, we demonstrate how the choice of decorative unit tunes the
spectral response, showcasing individual and independent control over light
scattering in angular and spectral terms. Lastly, we expand the limits of our
versatile approach by combining multiple metasurfaces in one, effectively
adding their individual scattering characteristics. As such, we can address
spectral and angular ranges independently, yielding a high degree of control of
the scattering response.

The setup involves 100-mJ, 300-ps pulses achieving sub-picoaltitude broadening and a 11-mirror cell for proof of concept, requiring 260 MW peak power. The scheme aims to make ultrafast lasers accessible from high-power industrial sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pulse trains with kHz repetition rates from terawatt-class lasers could offer significant benefits, but achieving sub-femtosecond pulses requires new technologies. The paper presents a method using multi-mirror cells to directly compress pulses, which is both cost-effective and scalable. This approach uses high-power lasers to create ultrafast sources for various applications.

Method: The authors propose a system involving multi-mirror multi-pass cells. They simulate the compression of 100-mJ, 300-ps pulses to a sub-ps Fourier limit in a 1-m diameter cell. They also mention a 11-mirror multi-pass cell for proof of concept. The method calculates the required peak power to achieve spectral broadening by a factor of 15 in air, which was 260 MW.

Result: Experimental proof of concept is demonstrated with a 11-mirror setup, showing the feasibility of compressing pulses to sub-femtosecond levels using industrial high-power lasers. This method effectively transforms existing laser systems into efficient ultrafast sources, highlighting a scalable and cost-efficient solution.

Conclusion: The proposed method using compact multi-mirror cells successfully demonstrates scalable, high-intensity pulse generation. It provides a practical solution for achieving ultrafast laser sources, making it suitable for diverse industrial applications. With 260 MW peak power, the system offers a viable pathway to implement this technology for advanced ultrashort pulse generation.

Abstract: Applications of terawatt-class lasers can enormously benefit from pulse
trains with kHz repetition rates. The associated unprecedented combinations of
peak and average powers require the development of new concepts for scalable
ultrashort pulse generation. We propose using multi-mirror multi-pass cells as
a compact and cost-efficient solution for the direct post-compression of
sub-nanosecond pulses into the femtosecond regime. We simulate spectral
broadening of 100-mJ, 300-ps pulses to a sub-ps Fourier transform-limit in a
1-m diameter multi-pass cell. Furthermore, an 11-mirror cell for about 300
passes was set-up for proof-of-concept. To reach a spectral broadening factor
of 15 in air, only 260 MW of peak power were required. The proposed scheme can
efficiently transform industrially mature high-power, high-energy lasers into
unique ultrafast sources.

TL;DR: The study demonstrates spectral tuning of hyperbolic shear polaritons in bGO through isotopic substitution, with near-field and ab initio data confirming a 40 cm⁻¹ redshift without prior dielectric knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The phenomenon of hyperbolic phonon polaritons is of significant interest in optoelectronics due to their unique properties, making the development of methods to tune their frequencies essential.

Method: The study used near-field optical microscopy and ab initio calculations to analyze isotopic substitution effects on HShPs in bGO. They observed a spectral redshift of ~40 cm⁻¹ by substituting with ¹⁸O, without prior knowledge of the dielectric tensor.

Result: A spectral redshift of ~40 cm⁻¹ was observed in ^18O bGO compared to ^16O bGO, allowing direct observation and estimation of frequency shifts without dielectric data.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for using isotopic substitution to tune HShPs, enabling applications in optoelectronics by leveraging phonon properties without requiring detailed dielectric information.

Abstract: Hyperbolic phonon polaritons - hybridized modes arising from the ultrastrong
coupling of infrared light to strongly anisotropic lattice vibrations in
uniaxial or biaxial polar crystals - enable to confine light to the nanoscale
with low losses and high directionality. In even lower symmetry materials, such
as monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ (bGO), hyperbolic shear polaritons (HShPs)
further enhance the directionality. Yet, HShPs are intrinsically supported only
within narrow frequency ranges defined by the phonon frequencies of the host
material. Here, we report spectral tuning of HShPs in bGO by isotopic
substitution. Employing near-field optical microscopy to image HShPs in
$^{18}$O bGO films homo-epitaxially grown on a $^{16}$O bGO substrate, we
demonstrate a spectral redshift of $\sim~40~$cm$^{-1}$ for the $^{18}$O bGO,
compared to $^{16}$O bGO. The technique allows for direct observation and a
model-free estimation of the spectral shift driven by isotopic substitution
without the need for knowledge of the dielectric tensor. Complementary
far-field measurements and ab initio calculations - in good agreement with the
near-field data - confirm the effectiveness of this estimation. This
multifaceted study demonstrates a significant isotopic substitution induced
spectral tuning of HShPs into a previously inaccessible frequency range,
creating new avenues for technological applications of such highly directional
polaritons.

Conclusion: 量子几何工程提供了一种新途径来设计和调控材料的光学特性，如颜色和透明度，超越了传统的能带设计方法。

Abstract: The optical properties of solids are governed not only by their energy band
dispersions but also by the quantum geometry of Bloch states. While the role of
energy bands in determining the perceived optical appearance of materials, such
as color and transparency, is well established, the influence of quantum
geometry remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the color and transparency
of materials can be direct manifestations of their underlying quantum geometry.
To illustrate this principle, we employ quadratic band-touching models that
allow us to tune only the geometric properties of Bloch states, while keeping
the energy dispersion fixed. This decoupling reveals that modifying the
wavefunction texture alone can lead to dramatic changes in the optical
conductivity and, consequently, in the reflectance spectrum of the material.
This results in distinct and controllable changes in perceived color.
Similarly, we show that quantum geometry can govern the transparency of
two-dimensional materials. Our findings demonstrate how quantum geometry shapes
the visual appearance of materials, opening new avenues for tailoring color and
transparency beyond traditional band structure design. This establishes quantum
geometric engineering as a novel approach for manipulating materials with
customized optical functionalities.

TL;DR: The paper discusses contrast mechanisms in 4D-STEM and presents new imaging modes替代 Ptychography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance imaging techniques by understanding contrast transfer mechanisms in 4D-STEM.

Method: Analyzes generalized contrast formalism, applies tilt correction, and experiments with imaging modes.

Result: New imaging modes enable simpler, faster imaging comparable to Ptychography.

Conclusion: The findings expand phase contrast theory into 4D-STEM, offering new imaging options.

Abstract: Contrast transfer mechanisms for electron scattering have been extensively
studied in transmission electron microscopy. Here we revisit H. Rose's
generalized contrast formalism from scattering theory to understand where
information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron
microscopy (4D-STEM) data, and consequently identify new imaging modes that can
also serve as crude but fast approximations to ptychography. We show that tilt
correction and summation of the symmetric and antisymmetric scattering
components within the bright-field disk -- corresponding to tilt-corrected
bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC)
respectively -- enables aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast
imaging (acBF) that makes maximal use of the 4D-STEM information under the weak
phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond the WPOA, we identify the contrast
transfer from the interference between inelastic/plural scattering electrons,
which show up as quadratic terms, and show that under overfocus conditions,
contrast can be further enhanced at selected frequencies, similar to
phase-contrast TEM imaging. There is also usable information encoded in the
dark field region which we demonstrate by constructing a tilt-corrected
dark-field image (tcDF) that sums up the incoherent scattering components and
holds promise for depth sectioning of strong scatterers. This framework
generalizes phase contrast theory in conventional/scanning transmission
electron microscopy to 4D-STEM and provides analytical models and insights into
full-field iterative ptychography, which blindly exploits all above contrast
mechanisms.

Conclusion: 该研究为光扭子的制造和应用提供了理论支持，使其成为控制高能状态的紧凑光源。

Abstract: The theory of radiation of twisted photons in elliptical multifrequency
undulators is developed. It is shown that helical multifrequency undulators can
be employed as a bright and versatile source of photons in the states that are
superpositions of the modes with definite projection of total angular momentum
(TAM), amplitude, and relative phase. All these parameters of the state are
readily controlled by the undulator design. The explicit expression for the
amplitude of radiation of a twisted photon from a charged particle in the
multifrequency undulator is derived. The energy spectrum of radiation and the
selection rules for the TAM projection of radiated photons are described. The
symmetry properties of the spectrum with respect to the TAM projection are
established. The interpretation to the energy spectrum and to the selection
rules is given in terms of virtual photons mediating between the charged
particle and the undulator. The results obtained are also applicable to
radiation of twisted photons produced by ultrarelativistic charged particles
moving in plane multifrequency electromagnetic waves.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called Twinac for creating virtual accelerator controls, enabling real-time digital twins of particle accelerators. It supports predictive maintenance, environmental monitoring, and explores new operational methods without risking damage. Twinac aims to promote collaboration among institutions by standardizing digital twin development and sharing virtual accelerator tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a solution aimed at enhancing the efficiency and safety of particle accelerator operations through digital twins, which is a growing need in scientific research institutions to better predict and control variables that affect accelerator performance. The motivation likely comes from the increasing reliance on digital tools in scientific facilities to improve productivity and mitigate risks during real-time operations.

Method: The authors describe Twinac as a system for virtual accelerator controls, capable of mirroring physical accelerators, integrating features like predictive maintenance, environmental monitoring, and virtual operational modeling. They emphasize a agnostic approach, allowing various simulation methods (analytics, AI-driven, or combinations) to be standardized and shared across different facilities. The method appears to focus on creating a versatile and interoperable framework to enable collaboration among institutions.

Result: The paper's framework, Twinac, provides a digital twin solution that integrates predictive maintenance, environmental monitoring, and innovative operational strategies while supporting the sharing and reuse of simulations across various accelerators. The result shows potential in increasing operational efficiency, reducing risks, and facilitating collaborative research among institutions.

Conclusion: The introduction of Twinac represents a significant advancement in the field of particle accelerator management, offering a standardized and collaborative approach to developing and sharing virtual accelerator tools. This framework is expected to enhance the efficiency, safety, and collaboration in accelerator facilities across various scientific research institutions.

Abstract: We propose a universal framework for a system of virtual accelerator controls
(Twinac), a standard toolkit for research institutions to design, maintain, and
use a real-time, end-to-end "digital twin" of their particle accelerator
facility. This virtual counterpart will mirror any physical accelerator to
provide (1) predictive maintenance; (2) surveillance of hidden environmental
factors, such as seasonal temperature variations, which could impact
performance of power supplies, magnets, and other instruments; and (3) a
capability to model novel ways to operate the accelerator without risking
equipment damage. Twinac is envisioned as accelerator facility agnostic,
allowing institutions to share and reuse myriad simulation approaches
(analytics-based, A.I.-driven, or combinations of the like) across facilities.
The Twinac system lays the groundwork for a collaborative network of
institutions to maintain and update this shared virtual accelerator technology.

Abstract: We present a concept of the rapid-cycling 1.7 T ReBCO magnet for 1 to 10 kT/s
ramping range as required for muon acceleration in a future muon collider
presently under study. This approach is based on the 6 kA CORC-like cable
constructed with 12 superconducting ReBCO tapes of 2 mm width. Based on
theoretical prediction there is a linear scaling of the ReBCO cable hysteresis
loss with the crossing magnetic field possibly generating power loss
independent of the magnetic field ramping speed. This feature makes this ReBCO
cable suitable for the construction of rapid-cycling magnets. In this work we
outline the design of a dipole magnet for 1.7 T gap magnetic field and discuss
the helium coolant parameters for the minimal electric power.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A paper presents PennyCoder, a lightweight framework for quantum code generation that enables on-device deployment by avoiding external APIs, leveraging LLaMA 3.1-8B with LoRA and domain-specific tuning for quantum programming tasks. The framework shows 44.3% accuracy, better than its baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for privacy, reduced latency, and cost-effective quantum programming solutions is rising, prompting the development of frameworks like PennyCoder.

Method: PennyCoder uses a fine-tuned LLaMA model with LoRA and domain-specific instructions optimized for PennyLane, focusing on quantum machine learning and reinforcement learning tasks.

Result: PennyCoder achieved 44.3% accuracy, outperforming both the base model and RAG-augmented baselines.

Conclusion: PennyCoder successfully provides a viable solution for on-device quantum programming without external dependencies, enhancing efficiency and accessibility.

Abstract: The growing demand for robust quantum programming frameworks has unveiled a
critical limitation: current large language model (LLM) based quantum code
assistants heavily rely on remote APIs, introducing challenges related to
privacy, latency, and excessive usage costs. Addressing this gap, we propose
PennyCoder, a novel lightweight framework for quantum code generation,
explicitly designed for local and embedded deployment to enable on-device
quantum programming assistance without external API dependence. PennyCoder
leverages a fine-tuned version of the LLaMA 3.1-8B model, adapted through
parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques combined with
domain-specific instruction tuning optimized for the specialized syntax and
computational logic of quantum programming in PennyLane, including tasks in
quantum machine learning and quantum reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work
focused on cloud-based quantum code generation, our approach emphasizes
device-native operability while maintaining high model efficacy. We rigorously
evaluated PennyCoder over a comprehensive quantum programming dataset,
achieving 44.3% accuracy with our fine-tuned model (compared to 33.7% for the
base LLaMA 3.1-8B and 40.1% for the RAG-augmented baseline), demonstrating a
significant improvement in functional correctness.

TL;DR: The paper refutes a critique by Popescu against their work on counterfactual communication. They argue that the critique misses the specifics of their protocol and over-simplifies, leading to a misunderstanding of their results. They clarify that their communication method is concrete and valid, based on tested criteria, and they address any misinterpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are responding to a critique, aiming to defend their work on counterfactual communication against Popescu's arguments, highlighting the validity and specifics of their protocol.

Method: They refute Popescu's critique by pointing out the reasons for the critique's basis and simplification, clarify the specifics of their protocol, and address misinterpretations by providing concrete examples and theoretical/electirical validations.

Result: They successfully argue that Popescu's critique is based on misunderstanding and over-simplification, thus reaffirming the validity of their counterfactual communication protocol.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that their protocol is valid despite the critique, reinforcing the possibility of counterfactual communication as described in their paper.

Abstract: In his Comment on our recent paper ``The laws of physics do not prohibit
counterfactual communication'', \textit{npj Quantum Information} (2022) 8:60,
Popescu argues that the claims of the paper are invalid. Here, we refute his
argument, showing that it is based on ignoring the specifics of what we set out
to prove (that counterfactual communication is possible \emph{for post-selected
particles}, and more specifically in these cases is not prohibited by the weak
trace or consistent histories criteria for particle path), followed by an
unwarranted simplification of the protocol. Moreover, the Comment's excursion
into interpretation is misplaced. Our communication protocol is a precisely
defined one that allows two remote parties, albeit rarely, to communicate an
arbitrarily long binary message, with arbitrarily high accuracy. This is not a
matter of interpretation -- as the concrete example given in our paper in
question illustrates. As for our overarching claim that no particles are
exchanged in the course of this communication, we have already demonstrated
this both theoretically and experimentally, in the postselected case we
consider, as per the weak trace and consistent histories criteria for path of a
quantum particle.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses recent experiments using single neutral atoms in the ground state to perform Young's double slit experiment, highlighting how the atoms serve as a two-level system to detect which-way information. It generalizes two experiments, comparing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum mechanics' principles through practical experiments, particularly complementarity. The double slit experiment is a key example for studying wave-particle duality and information disturbs the system. Single atoms provide a feasible platform for such experiments due to their controllability. The paper aims to analyze recent advancements in this area by comparing different experimental setups and their implications for quantum mechanics.

Method: The authors analyze two recent experiments, focusing on how each uses single atoms to detect which-way information. They compare the mechanisms by which the atoms record the measurement, possibly examining their interaction with the harmonic oscillator potential and recoil momentum. The analysis involves theoretical models and experimental results to generalize the findings.

Result: The paper identifies similarities and differences in the experimental approaches, showing how the choice of which-way markers impacts the interference patterns. It highlights the feasibility of using single atoms for complementarity experiments and offers insights into how different detection methods affect the observed results.

Conclusion: The experiments demonstrate that objectification of the which-way information through different methods leads to different quantum interference outcomes. This ribbits more insight into the complementarity principle and supports the development of quantum technologies relying on precise control of quantum systems in which-way states.

Abstract: Young's double slit experiment has often been used to illustrate the concept
of complementarity in quantum mechanics. If information can in principle be
obtained about the path of the photon, then the visibility of the interference
fringes is reduced or even destroyed. This Gedanken experiment discussed by
Bohr and Einstein can be realized when the slit is replaced by individual atoms
sensitive to the transferred recoil momentum of a photon which "passes through
the slit". Early pioneering experiments were done with trapped ions and atom
pairs created via photo-dissociation. Recently, it became possible to perform
interference experiments with single neutral atoms cooled to the absolute
ground state of a harmonic oscillator potential. The slits are now single atoms
representing a two-level system, and the excitation in the harmonic oscillator
potential is the which-way marker. In this note, we analyze and generalize two
recent experiments performed with single atoms and emphasize the different ways
they record which-way information.

Abstract: All experimental evidence {indicates} that the vacuum is not void, but filled
with something truly quantum. This is reflected by terms such as {zero-point}
fluctuations, and Dirac's sea of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs, and last
but not least the vacuum is the medium responsible for Maxwell's displacement
current. While quantum electrodynamics (QED) is an exceptionally successful
theory, it remains a perturbative framework rather than a fully self-contained
one. Inherently, it includes singularities and divergences, which prevent the
precise calculation of fundamental quantities such as the fine-structure
constant $\alpha$. Any direct attempt to compute $\alpha$ results in divergent
values. However, and most remarkable, what can be determined is how $\alpha$
``runs", meaning how it varies with energy or exchanged momentum. In this
article, we review the historical development of these ideas, the current state
of knowledge, and ongoing efforts to find ways to move further. This includes a
simple model to describe vacuum polarization in the low-energy regime, when
considering only small (linear) deviations from the equilibrium {state},
relating {Maxwell's displacement} in the vacuum, to the quantum properties of
the vacuum.

Abstract: Cluster states are a useful resource in quantum computation, and can be
generated by applying entangling gates between next-neighbor qubits. Heralded
entangling gates offer the advantage of high post-selected fidelity, and can be
used to create cluster states at the expense of large space-time overheads. We
propose a low-overhead protocol to generate and merge high-fidelity many-atom
entangled states into a 3D cluster state that supports fault-tolerant universal
logical operations. Our simulations indicate that a state-of-the-art
high-finesse optical cavity is sufficient for constructing a scalable
fault-tolerant cluster state with loss and Pauli errors remaining an order of
magnitude below their respective thresholds. This protocol reduces the
space-time resource requirements for cluster state construction, highlighting
the measurement-based method as an alternative approach to achieving
large-scale error-corrected quantum processing with neutral atoms.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel quantum simulation approach using trapped-ion systems for lattice gauge theories, encoding both gauge and matter fields, achieving real-time dynamics and demonstrating practical steps towards higher-dimensional simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying strongly coupled quantum systems using conventional methods is computationally intensive. This paper explores a new quantum simulation technique that can handle such systems more efficiently, leveraging hybrid qubits and oscillators to simulate lattice gauge theories with both matter and gauge fields.

Method: The study uses a hybrid trapped-ion system where qubits represent gauge fields and vibrational modes encode matter fields. They construct higher-dimensional lattices using synthetic dimensions, employ digital-analog techniques for state preparation and measurement, and simulate abelian $b{Z}_2$ gauge theory, achieving real-time dynamics with measurable observables.

Result: The system successfully simulates a genuinely 2D lattice gauge theory, capturing Aharonov-Bohm interference with dynamical flux. This marks a proof-of-principle for scalable quantum simulations of bosonic gauge theories and paves the way for higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories.

Conclusion: By combining qubits and oscillators in a trapped-ion system, the researchers have made a significant step toward achieving quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories, enabling the study of complex systems that are intractable classically.

Abstract: Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) with both dynamical
matter and gauge fields provide a promising approach to studying strongly
coupled problems beyond classical computational reach. Yet, implementing
gauge-invariant encodings and real-time evolution remains experimentally
challenging. Here, we demonstrate a resource-efficient encoding of a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT using a hybrid qubit-oscillator trapped-ion quantum device,
where qubits represent gauge fields and vibrational modes naturally encode
bosonic matter fields. This architecture utilises synthetic dimensions to
construct higher-dimensional lattice geometries and combines digital and
analogue techniques to prepare initial states, realise gauge-invariant
real-time evolution, and measure the relevant observables. We experimentally
probe dynamics obeying Gauss's law in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ link and extend this to
a loop geometry, marking the first steps towards higher-dimensional LGTs. In
this quasi-2D setup, we observe Aharonov-Bohm interference for the first time
with dynamical gauge fields encoding magnetic flux, demonstrating the interplay

quantum simulations of bosonic gauge theories and outline a roadmap for
realising exotic LGTs in higher dimensions.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of VQCs which require local measurements, by developing an adaptive non-local observable approach for quantum reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical frameworks leverage quantum computing for machine
learning; however, variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are limited by the need
for local measurements. We introduce an adaptive non-local observable (ANO)
paradigm within VQCs for quantum reinforcement learning (QRL), jointly
optimizing circuit parameters and multi-qubit measurements. The ANO-VQC
architecture serves as the function approximator in Deep Q-Network (DQN) and
Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms. On multiple benchmark
tasks, ANO-VQC agents outperform baseline VQCs. Ablation studies reveal that
adaptive measurements enhance the function space without increasing circuit
depth. Our results demonstrate that adaptive multi-qubit observables can enable
practical quantum advantages in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent advances in optical imaging and tracking of
wave-packet propagation in optical cavities, we systematically explore the
non-Hermitian polariton dynamics within a decay-tunable multimode cavity model.
The complex eigen-spectrum of the model Hamiltonian allows us to predict the
incoherent-coherent transition induced by photon losses, which defines an
exceptional point at resonance and evolves analytically as the wavevector
shifts off-resonantly. The resulting dispersion relation, group velocity, and
relaxation rate exhibit striking signatures, such as curve crossing, level
repulsion, turnover, bifurcation, and coalescence, as the decay rate crosses
the critical transition or the wavevector crosses the resonance. The spectral
characterization leads to surprising features in the non-Hermitian wave packet
dynamics: (i) maximal population relaxation rate at the critical transition;
(ii) reversed propagation in the center-of-mass motion; (iii)
ballistic-to-diffusion transition; (iv) contraction in the displacement and
width of the polariton wave-packet. These dynamical features have complementary
symmetry between the upper-polariton (UP) branch and lower-polariton (LP)
branch in the two-dimensional phase diagram spanned by the photon decay rate
and wavevector. Thus, the combination of complex spectral characterization and
non-Hermitian wave packet propagation establishes the photon decay rate as a
powerful control parameter for polariton transport, reveals the underlying
symmetry in lossy cavities, and presents a starting point to incorporate other
dissipative mechanisms.

Abstract: We utilize few-level model systems to analyze the polarization and phase
properties of below-threshold harmonics (BTH) in aligned molecules. In a
two-level system (TLS), we find that the phase of emitted harmonics undergoes a
distinct change. For harmonics with photon energies below the transition
between the dominant field-dressed states, the phase alternates by $\pi$
between successive odd harmonic orders but remains constant above. Exploiting
this behavior, we construct a four-level model composed of two uncoupled TLS
subsystems aligned along orthogonal directions. We demonstrate that with
selected transition frequencies lower-order harmonics follow the polarization
of the linearly polarized driving field while higher-order harmonics exhibit a
mirrored polarization. The model predicts that aligned systems with orthogonal
transition dipoles may show analogous phase and polarization features in the
BTH regime.

### [73] [Quantum Internet Architecture: unlocking Quantum-Native Routing via Quantum Addressing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19655)
*Marcello Caleffi,Angela Sara Cacciapuoti*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel hierarchical architecture for the Quantum Internet focusing on entanglement-based operations, addressing scalability issues with a quantum-native control plane, quantum addressing scheme, and routing protocol. It also introduces a function that generalizes classical routing logic to the quantum domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Quantum Internet requires a fundamentally new approach to network design due to its reliance on quantum entanglement, which challenges classical principles, making it necessary to develop innovative architectures and protocols.

Method: The paper proposes a hierarchical architecture with an entanglement-defined controller, a quantum addressing scheme, quantum-native routing protocol, and a function based on Schrödinger's oracles to handle routing logic.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates the advantages of quantum-by-design network operations, providing scalability and efficiency by efficiently operating over entanglement-aware topologies.

Conclusion: The paper successfully presents a comprehensive framework for a scalable, efficient, and quantum-native Quantum Internet, highlighting its potential benefits over classical designs.

Abstract: The Quantum Internet introduces a fundamental shift in the network design,
since its key objective is the distribution and manipulation of quantum
entanglement, rather than the transmission of classical information. This shift
breaks key classical Internet design principles, such as the end-to-end
argument, due to the inherently stateful and non-local nature of entangled
states that require coordinated in-network operations. Consequently, in this
paper we propose a novel hierarchical Quantum Internet architecture centered
around the concept of entanglement-defined controller, enabling scalable and
efficient management of the aforementioned in-network operations. However,
architecture alone is insufficient for network scalability, which requires a
quantum-native control plane that fundamentally rethinks addressing and
routing. Consequently, we propose a quantum addressing scheme that embraces the
principles and quantum phenomena within the node identifiers. Built upon this
addressing scheme, we also design a quantum-native routing protocol that
exhibits scalable and compact routing tables, by efficiently operating over
entanglement-aware topologies. Finally, we design a quantum address splitting
functionality based on Schr\"odinger's oracles that generalizes classical
match-and-forward logic to the quantum domain. Together, these contributions
demonstrate, for the first time, the key advantages of quantum-by-design
network functioning.

Abstract: A diagrammatic multi-reference generalization of many-body perturbation
theory was recently introduced [J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2025, 16, 3047]. This
framework allows us to extend single-reference (SR) Green's function methods
defined at the diagrammatic level naturally into multi-reference case, as
previously exemplified by the formulation of multi-reference direct random
phase approximation (MR-dRPA) and the multi-reference second-order screened
exchange approximation (MR-SOSEX). In this work, we further elaborate this
framework and use it to develop MR generalizations of two other RPA variants,
namely, particle-hole (ph) RPA with exchange (MR-RPAx) and particle-particle
RPA (MR-ppRPA). We define these two MR generalizations by infinite order
resummations of the generalized `ring' and `ladder' diagrams with
antisymmetrized interaction vertices, respectively, which incorporate the
contributions from the active-space connected two-body Green's functions. As
for MR-dRPA, we derive unified sets of equations that hold at both SR and MR
levels for RPAx and ppRPA, respectively. We perform numerical studies of
prototypical systems using the three MR-RPA methods and carry out a
perturbative analysis to gain a deeper understanding of their behaviors. We
find that error cancellation between the second and third orders is a key
factor for both SR-RPA and MR-RPA. In addition, we observe that MR-phRPA
(MR-dRPA and MR-RPAx) and MR-ppRPA tend to overestimate and underestimate
correlation energies, respectively, suggesting that a better accuracy can be
achieved by further combining these two channels in the future.

Abstract: Convolution operations are foundational to classical image processing and
modern deep learning architectures, yet their extension into the quantum domain
has remained algorithmically and physically costly due to inefficient data
encoding and prohibitive circuit complexity. In this work, we present a
resource-efficient quantum algorithm that reformulates the convolution product
as a structured matrix multiplication via a novel sparse reshaping formalism.
Leveraging the observation that localized convolutions can be encoded as doubly
block-Toeplitz matrix multiplications, we construct a quantum framework wherein
sparse input patches are prepared using optimized key-value QRAM state
encoding, while convolutional filters are represented as quantum states in
superposition. The convolution outputs are computed through inner product
estimation using a low-depth SWAP test circuit, which yields probabilistic
amplitude information with reduced sampling overhead. Our architecture supports
batched convolution across multiple filters using a generalized SWAP circuit.
Compared to prior quantum convolutional approaches, our method eliminates
redundant preparation costs, scales logarithmically with input size under
sparsity, and enables direct integration into hybrid quantum-classical machine
learning pipelines. This work provides a scalable and physically realizable
pathway toward quantum-enhanced feature extraction, opening up new
possibilities for quantum convolutional neural networks and data-driven quantum
inference.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a non-uniform grid approach for more efficient quantum chemistry calculations on quantum computers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient resource use in quantum computing, especially in dealing with electron-nuclear cusps in high-density regions.

Method: Deploying non-uniform, molecule-adaptive grids with Voronoi partitions to enhance computational efficiency and eliminate Coulomb singularities.

Result: Improved scaling of qubit count and computational resources, validated on benchmark systems.

Conclusion: A promising framework for accurate ground-state chemistry on quantum hardware.

Abstract: First-quantized, real-space formulations of quantum chemistry on quantum
computers are appealing: qubit count scales logarithmically with spatial
resolution, and Coulomb operators achieve quadratic instead of quartic
computational scaling of two-electron interactions. However, existing schemes
employ uniform discretizations, so the resolution required to capture
electron-nuclear cusps in high-density regions oversamples low-density regions,
wasting computational resources. We address this by deploying non-uniform,
molecule-adaptive grids that concentrate points where electronic density is
high. Using Voronoi partitions of these grids, the molecular Hamiltonian is
expressed in a Hermitian form and in a transcorrelated, isospectral form that
eliminates Coulomb singularities and yields cusp-free eigenfunctions. Both
formulations slot naturally into quantum eigenvalue solvers: Hermitian Quantum
Phase Estimation (QPE) and the recent generalised Quantum Eigenvalue Estimation
(QEVE) protocol for its non-Hermitian, transcorrelated counterpart. Numerical
validation on benchmark systems confirms that this non-heuristic ab initio
framework offers a promising path for accurate ground-state chemistry on
quantum hardware.

Motivation: The paper addresses the need for fault-tolerant quantum gates, which are essential for scalable quantum computing. The introduction of an sqrt(T) gate extends the set of Clifford gates needed to achieve universal quantum computation.

Method: The authors build upon an architecture for a dissipatively stabilized GKP qubit and extend it with a quartic flux potential generated by Ancillary Josephson Junctions to implement the desired sqrt(T) gate. They likely employ topological protection mechanisms and address control and device imperfections through detailed simulations or experiments.

Result: The protocol demonstrates robustness to control errors and device imperfections, with exponentially low infidelity. It also shows fast operation, even on microsecond timescales for GHz resonators, indicating potential scalability.

Conclusion: The work represents a significant step toward implementing non-Clifford gates in a fault-tolerant manner, which is crucial for achieving universal quantum computation with distributed resonator-based qubits.

Abstract: Recent work (Nathan et al, arXiv:2405.05671) proposed an architecture for a
dissipatively stabilized GKP qubit, and protocols for protected Clifford gates.
Here we propose a protocol for a protected non-Clifford $\sqrt{T}$ gate at the
physical qubit level, based on the inclusion of a quartic flux potential
generated by ancillary Josephson junctions. We show that such a gate is
topologically robust with exponentially suppressed infidelity from control or
device imperfections, and operates on microsecond timescales for GHz
resonators. We analyze the resilience of the protocol to noise, imperfect
control, and imperfect targeting of circuit parameters.

Abstract: In this work, we study the electromagnetic energy and energy rate spectra
produced by a point particle in the presence of plane wave fields. Our approach
is based on a semiclassical formulation, in which the current distribution that
generates electromagnetic radiation is treated classically while the radiation
field is quantum. Unlike the classical energy spectrum--which exhibits
divergences linked to the duration of interaction between the particle and the
external field--the semiclassical spectrum is finite because radiation is
produced during the quantum transition from an initial state without photons to
the final state with photons at time $t$. In our formulation, we find that the
maximum energy spectrum emitted by the particle is linearly proportional to
time or phase, depending on the external field. This allowed us not only to
extract the maximum energy rate spectra emitted by the particle but also to
correlate them with energy rates derived in the framework of Classical
Electrodynamics and Quantum Electrodynamics.

TL;DR: The paper presents a quantum-informed machine learning framework for learning chaotic systems, using a Born machine and Koopman model, achieving significant memory efficiency and superior performance compared to classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of modeling chaotic systems with traditional methods is highlighted due to long-term prediction instability and capturing invariant statistical properties, which is crucial in various scientific and engineering fields. The motivation is to leverage quantum computing's potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of such modeling, especially with the constraints of current quantum hardware.

Method: A quantum circuit Born machine is used to learn invariant properties of chaotic systems. The framework incorporates this into a Koopman-based model to address training issues like gradient vanishing or explosion, achieving memory efficiency and better predictive performance.

Result: The framework successfully applies to systems like Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, Kolmogorov flow, and turbulent channel flow, demonstrating significant memory savings and superior accuracy compared to classical methods.

Conclusion: This hybrid quantum-classical approach provides a practical solution for modeling chaotic systems using near-term quantum hardware, opening new possibilities for future quantum advancements in this field.

Abstract: Learning the behaviour of chaotic systems remains challenging due to
instability in long-term predictions and difficulties in accurately capturing
invariant statistical properties. While quantum machine learning offers a
promising route to efficiently capture physical properties from
high-dimensional data, its practical deployment is hindered by current hardware
noise and limited scalability. We introduce a quantum-informed machine learning
framework for learning partial differential equations, with an application
focus on chaotic systems. A quantum circuit Born machine is employed to learn
the invariant properties of chaotic dynamical systems, achieving substantial
memory efficiency by representing these complex physical statistics with a
compact set of trainable circuit parameters. This approach reduces the data
storage requirement by over two orders of magnitude compared to the raw
simulation data. The resulting statistical quantum-informed prior is then
incorporated into a Koopman-based auto-regressive model to address issues such
as gradient vanishing or explosion, while maintaining long-term statistical
fidelity. The framework is evaluated on three representative systems: the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow and turbulent
channel flow. In all cases, the quantum-informed model achieves superior
performance compared to its classical counterparts without quantum priors. This
hybrid architecture offers a practical route for learning dynamical systems
using near-term quantum hardware.

Motivation: The study of topological phases and their transitions is crucial in modern condensed matter physics, and this paper provides a novel framework to understand such phenomena using symmetry group actions.

Method: The authors employ a symmetry-integrated approach, discretizing the parameter space and combining group cochains with differential geometric tools to construct topological invariants.

Result: Key findings include a fixed-point formula for higher Berry curvature and identification of phase defects as monopoles at phase transition boundaries.

Conclusion: This work offers new insights into the geometrical and topological aspects of phase transitions, potentially guiding the search for novel quantum phases and phase transitions.

Abstract: We analyze topological phase transitions and higher Berry curvature in
one-dimensional quantum spin systems, using a framework that explicitly
incorporates the symmetry group action on the parameter space. Based on a
$G$-compatible discretization of the parameter space, we incorporate both group
cochains and parameter-space differentials, enabling the systematic
construction of equivariant topological invariants. We derive a fixed-point
formula for the higher Berry invariant in the case where the symmetry action
has isolated fixed points. This reveals that the phase transition point between
Haldane and trivial phases acts as a monopole-like defect where higher Berry
curvature emanates. We further discuss hierarchical structures of topological
defects in the parameter space, governed by symmetry reductions and
compatibility with subgroup structures.

*Ali Pedram,Özgür E. Müstecaplıoğlu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses the ultimate precision limits of a spin chain coupled to a heat bath for measuring parameters like magnetometry and thermometry. It uses a full polaron transform to derive effective Hamiltonians, calculates quantum Fisher information (QFI) for equilibrium states in both weak and strong coupling regimes, including finite-size effects. Strong coupling (SC) shows advantages for thermometry at low temperatures and improves magnetometric precision by controlling the anisotropy parameter. Neglecting finite-size effects significantly impacts precision bounds. The study also reveals that phenomenological approaches aren't adequate for systems at SC and shows the effect of the bath on phase transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about quantum metrology and thermodynamics, which are important fields in quantum physics and engineering, aiming to find ultimate precision limits of measurements in quantum systems.

Method: Full polaron transform is used to derive effective Hamiltonians for both weak and strong coupling regimes, considering finite-size effects. Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is derived and calculated for equilibrium states. Hill's nanothermodynamics is employed to calculate effective QFI at strong coupling. Other methods include analysis of phase transitions due to the bath effect.

Result: In weak coupling, quantum Fisher information significantly depends on system size under finite-size effects. Strong coupling allows effective QFI expression independent of initial system states but dependent on control parameters like temperature and magnetic fields. Strong coupling regime shows higher precision for thermometry at low temperatures and enhanced magnetometric precision through anisotropy control. Additionally, neglecting finite-size effects leads to errors in precision bounds, and strong coupling can drive crossovers in thermodynamic behavior influenced by the bath.,

Conclusion: The study reveals that strong coupling provides advantages in thermometry at low temperatures and enhances magnetometric precision by controlling anisotropy. Finite-size effects cannot be neglected for precision bounds. Phenomenological approaches are insufficient for strongly coupled spin chains. The effect of the bath on phase transitions is also highlighted.

Abstract: We study the ultimate precision limits of a spin chain, strongly coupled to a
heat bath, for measuring a general parameter and report the results for
specific cases of magnetometry and thermometry. Employing a full polaron
transform, we derive the effective Hamiltonian and obtain analytical
expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of equilibrium states in
both weak coupling (WC) and strong coupling (SC) regimes for a general
parameter, explicitly accounting for finite-size (FS) effects. Furthermore, we
utilize Hill's nanothermodynamics to calculate an effective QFI expression at
SC. Our results reveal a potential advantage of SC for thermometry at low
temperatures and demonstrate enhanced magnetometric precision through control
of the anisotropy parameter. Crucially, we show that neglecting FS effects
leads to considerable errors in ultimate precision bounds for equilibrium
thermometry. This work also highlights the inadequacy of phenomenological
approaches in describing the metrological capability and thermodynamic behavior
of systems at SC. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of bath on system's
phase transition at SC.

Abstract: Bosons with density-dependent hopping on a one dimensional lattice have been
shown to emulate anyonic particles with fractional exchange statistics.
Leveraging this, we construct a Josephson junction setup, where an insulating
barrier in the form of a Mott-insulator is sandwiched between two superfluid
phases. This is obtained by spatially varying either the statistical phase or
the strength of the on-site interaction potential on which the ground state of
the system depends. Utilizing numerical methods such as exact diagonalization
and density renormalization group theory, the ground state properties of this
setup are investigated to understand the Josephson effect in a strongly
correlated regime. The dynamical properties of this model for different
configurations of this model are analyzed to find the configurations that can
produce the Josephson effect. Furthermore, it is observed that continuous
particle flow over time is achievable in this proposed model solely by creating
an initial phase difference without any external biasing.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the quantum behavior of a charm-anticharm system under magnetic field, using symplectic formulation of QM. They found that magnetic fields enhance the system's non-classicality as indicated by Wigner function negativity, and their calculated mass spectra match experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding charm-anticharm systems and their behavior under external fields is crucial for particle physics. Quantum effects like the Wigner function negativity provide insights into non-classical behavior which is essential for accurate theoretical models.

Method: They performed a perturbative analysis using the Cornell potential, applied Bohlin mapping, solved the symplectic Pauli-Schrödinger equation, and computed Wigner functions under varying magnetic field strengths.

Result: Observed that the magnetic field increases the negativity of the Wigner function, leading to a better match between computed and experimental mass spectra of the cc̄ meson.

Conclusion: The study contributes to refining quantum models for charm mesons by incorporating spin effects, which is vital for future precision in particle physics studies.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum behavior of a charm-anticharm bound system under
the influence of a magnetic field within the symplectic formulation of Quantum
Mechanics. Employing a perturbative approach, we obtain the ground and first
excited states of the system described by the Cornell potential, which
incorporates both confining and nonconfining interactions. After perfoming a
Bohlin mapping in phase space, we solve the time-independent symplectic
Pauli-Schr\"odinger-type equation and determine the corresponding Wigner
function. Special attention is given to the observation of the confinement of
the quark-antiquark (meson $c\overline{c}$) that is revealed in the phase space
structure. And the introduction of spin effect (external magnetic field) in
modifying the quantum characteristics of the system. Our results reveal that
the magnetic enhances the negativity of the Wigner function, signaling stronger
quantum interference and a departure from classical behavior. The negativity
thus serve as a quantitative measure of the system's non-classicality. In
addition we have computed the mass spectra of the $c\overline{c}$ meson and
present result are in agreement with experimental data, improving previous
theoretical studies.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper clarifies that comparing energy-velocity in Bohmian mechanics with semi-classical speed doesn't challenge Bohmian mechanics because both interpretations predict same results for photon tunneling in coupled waveguides.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to refute claims challenging Bohmian mechanics by showing that comparing incompatible velocity measures doesn't determine the validity of Bohmian interpretation.

Method: The authors demonstrate they are comparing distinct quantities (v and vs) and that both interpretations predict the same tunneling behavior in their setup.

Result: They show that Bohmian mechanics holds up against the experiment, as both interpretations yield the same predictions.

Conclusion: Bohmian mechanics is not challenged by the experiment, as the quantities compared aren't directly comparable and both interpretations agree on tunneling outcomes.

Abstract: Very recently, Sharoglazova et al. performed an experiment measuring the
energy-velocity relationship and Bohmian velocity in coupled waveguides. Their
data show a discrepancy between the semi-classical `speed'
$v=\sqrt{2|\Delta|/m}$ and Bohmian velocity $v_s$ for $\Delta<-\hbar J_0$,
leading them to claim a challenge to Bohmian mechanics. Here, we definitively
demonstrate this experiment poses no challenge to Bohmian mechanics. First, $v$
and $v_S$ represent fundamentally distinct physical quantities -- comparing
them is physically unjustified and cannot adjudicate between Copenhagen and
Bohmian interpretations. Second, we rigorously show that both interpretations
predict identical photon tunneling dynamics in coupled waveguides.

TL;DR: Introduces a new polarized Houston basis to accurately model nonequilibrium dynamics in driven open quantum systems by suppressing spurious excitations, reducing unphysical currents, and allowing clean extraction of real excitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in modeling excitation dynamics in driven quantum systems, particularly by introducing an improved basis that accounts for field-induced polarizations.

Method: The authors developed a polarized Houston basis, extended from conventional state methods, using a dimer-chain model within the quantum master equation framework.

Result: The new basis significantly reduces spurious excitations and unphysical currents, providing a more accurate description of real excitations and enhancing the simulation of nonequilibrium phenomena in quantum materials.

Conclusion: The polarized Houston basis is a powerful new tool for simulating nonequilibrium dynamics in light-driven open quantum systems.

Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework -- the polarized Houston basis -- to
model nonequilibrium dynamics in driven open quantum systems, formulated for
use within the quantum master equation. This basis extends conventional Houston
states by incorporating field-induced polarization effects, enabling a more
accurate description of excitation dynamics under external driving. Using a
one-dimensional dimer-chain model, we examine band population dynamics through
projections onto polarized Houston states, original Houston states, and naive
Bloch states. We find that the polarized Houston basis significantly suppresses
spurious Bloch-state excitations and virtual transitions present in standard
Houston approaches, allowing for a cleaner extraction of real excitations. When
implemented in the relaxation time approximation of the quantum master
equation, this formalism also yields a substantial reduction of unphysical DC
currents in insulating systems. Our results highlight the polarized Houston
basis as a powerful tool for simulating nonequilibrium phenomena in
light-driven open quantum materials.

### [91] [Atom-Field-Medium Interactions III: Quantum Field-mediated Entanglement between Two Atoms near a Conducting Surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20213)
*Jen-Tsung Hsiang,Bei-Lok Hu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates quantum entanglement between two atoms and their interaction with conductors and fields, building on previous work. It uses a method involving modeling atoms as harmonic oscillators and analyzing how their entanglement changes with varying distances and conductors. The results reveal how entanglement strength relates to these factors and offer a way to control it through parameter adjustments, which is useful for quantum information studies and metrology. However, it didn't delve into decoherence aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how quantum entanglement is affected by external conductors and fields, which is fundamental for quantum information theory and applications in precision measurements.

Method: The paper models each atom's internal degrees of freedom using a harmonic oscillator and observes how their entanglement changes with separation and distance from conductors. It considers both the proximity effect and the coupling strengths between the atoms, fields, and conductors, moving beyond weak coupling assumptions.

Result: The study finds that entanglement decreases as atoms approach a conductor, even though the attractive force increases. This spatial relationship creates a 3D entanglement domain that can be controlled through parameters.

Conclusion: This research provides a framework for controlling quantum entanglement using atom distances and conductor surfaces, useful for future studies and applications in metrology, quantum computing, and sensing.

Abstract: This third paper in this series continues the investigation of atom-field
interactions in the presence of a conductor or a dielectric medium, focusing on
quantum information related basic issues such as decoherence and entanglement.
Here we consider the entanglement between two atoms with internal degrees of
freedom modeled by a harmonic oscillator, with varying separations between them
and varying distances between them and a conducting surface. These are
configurations familiar in the Casimir-Polder effect, but the behavior of
atom-surface entanglement is quite different from the well-studied behavior of
field-induced forces. For one, while the attractive force between an atom and a
conducting surface increases as they come closer, the entanglement between the
atom and the quantum field actually decreases as the atom gets closer to the
conductor, as shown in \cite{Rong,AFD2}. We show how different factors play
out, ranging from the coupling between the atoms and the field to the coupling
between the atoms, going beyond the weak coupling restrictions often found
necessary in the literature. Gathering our results for the entanglement
dependence on each variable concerned, we can provide a spatial topography of
quantum entanglement, thus enabling a visualized understanding of the behavior
of quantum field-mediated entanglement. In particular we can quantify the
definition of a three-dimensional \textit{entanglement domain} between the two
atoms, how it varies with their coupling, their separation and their distances
from the conducting surface, and for practical applications, how to exercise
effective control of the entanglement between two atoms by changing these
parameters. Our findings are expected to be useful for studies of
atom-field-medium interactions in vacuum and surface physics.

### [92] [Efficient Gaussian State Preparation in Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20317)
*Yichen Xie,Nadav Ben-Ami*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to efficiently prepare Gaussian states on gate-based quantum computers by using a circuit-based approach that minimizes resource usage. The technique leverages single-qubit rotations and the quantum Fourier transform, allowing optional phase angle pruning to reduce gate count to near-linear while maintaining fidelity. The authors suggest this approach could be useful for quantum algorithms and machine learning on current and future quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of preparing Gaussian states efficiently on gate-based quantum computers, which is crucial for various quantum applications including quantum chemistry, machine learning, and quantum simulation. Existing methods face scalability issues, so a more efficient approach is needed.

Method: The method involves initializing qubits with single-qubit rotations to form an amplitude profile resembling a Gaussian and then applying the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) to convert this into a Gaussian state. The QFT is modified by pruning small controlled-phase angles, reducing the number of gates required without significantly affecting the fidelity of the resulting state.

Result: The proposed method achieves high fidelity with the target Gaussian state and reduces gate complexity to near-linear in O(n), which is a significant improvement over previous methods. This suggests the approach is scalable and suitable for noisy quantum hardware.

Conclusion: The technique introduced by the authors provides a promising solution for preparing Gaussian states on gate-based quantum computers. It reduces resource overhead while maintaining high fidelity, making it practical for real-world quantum applications, especially in the context of noisy current hardware. The implementation is available in the Classiq library, facilitating further research and development. The authors acknowledge the importance of optimizing the QFT phase shifts and integrating error mitigation strategies for future work.

Abstract: Gaussian states hold a fundamental place in quantum mechanics, quantum
information, and quantum computing. Many subfields, including quantum
simulation of continuous-variable systems, quantum chemistry, and quantum
machine learning, rely on the ability to accurately and efficiently prepare
states that reflect a Gaussian profile in their probability amplitudes.
Although Gaussian states are natural in continuous-variable systems, the
practical interest in digital, gate-based quantum computers demands discrete
approximations of Gaussian distributions over a computational basis of size
\(2^n\). Because of the exponential scaling of naive amplitude-encoding
approaches and the cost of certain block-encoding or Hamiltonian simulation
techniques, a resource-efficient preparation of approximate Gaussian states is
required. In this work, we propose and analyze a circuit-based approach that
starts with single-qubit rotations to form an exponential amplitude profile and
then applies the quantum Fourier transform to map those amplitudes into an
approximate Gaussian distribution. We demonstrate that this procedure achieves
high fidelity with the target Gaussian state while allowing optional pruning of
small controlled-phase angles in the quantum Fourier transform, thus reducing
gate complexity to near-linear in \(\mathcal{O}(n)\). We conclude that the
proposed technique is a promising route to make Gaussian states accessible on
noisy quantum hardware and to pave the way for scalable implementations on
future devices. The implementation of this algorithm is available at the
Classiq library: https://github.com/classiq/classiq-library.

Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising metaheuristic for solving constrained
combinatorial optimization problems. However, parameter tuning difficulties and
hardware noise often prevent optimal solutions from being properly encoded as
the ground states of the problem Hamiltonian. This study investigates
mid-anneal measurement as a mitigation approach for such situations, analyzing
its effectiveness and underlying physical mechanisms. We introduce a
quantitative metric to evaluate the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement and
apply it to the graph bipartitioning problem and the quadratic knapsack
problem. Our findings reveal that mid-anneal measurement is most effective when
the energy difference between desired solutions and ground states is small,
with effectiveness strongly governed by the energy structure. Furthermore, the
effectiveness increases as the Hamming distance between the ground and excited
states gets small, highlighting the role of state similarity. Analysis of
fully-connected Ising models demonstrates that the effectiveness of mid-anneal
measurement persists with increasing system size, indicating its scalability
and practical applicability to large-scale quantum annealing.

Result: Demonstrates a method to reduce the complexity of quantum circuits by replacing non-Clifford gates with teleportation-based alternatives, which is a practical advancement in fault-tolerant computing.

Conclusion: Presents an architecture that supports universal quantum computing using minimal teleportation, offering a practical approach for building fault-tolerant systems.

Abstract: We present an architecture for early fault-tolerant quantum computers based
on the smallest interesting colour code (Earl Campbell, 2016). It realizes a
universal logical gate set consisting of single-qubit measurements and
preparations in the X and Z bases, single-qubit Hadamard (H) gates, and
three-qubit controlled-controlled-Z (CCZ) gates. State teleportations between
[[4, 2, 2]] (2D) and [[8, 3, 2]] (3D) error-detecting color codes allow one to
make use of the respective transversal H and CCZ gates that these codes
possess. As such, minimizing the number of logical quantum teleportation
operations, not the number of logical quantum non-Clifford gates, is the
relevant optimization goal. To help hardware developers characterize this
architecture, we also provide an experimental protocol tailored to testing
logical quantum circuits expressed in it.

Berry curvature is intrinsically related to the eigenvectors rather than the
Hamiltonian itself. Our approach utilizes the standard Bloch (k-space)
framework for spatially periodic systems, illustrating these effects from first
principles and discussing potential implications for solid-state systems.

Abstract: Corresponding to a finite dimensional Hilbert space $H$ with $\dim H=n$, we
define a geometric algebra $\gscript (H)$ with $\dim\sqbrac{\gscript (H)}=2^n$.
The algebra $\gscript (H)$ is a Hilbert space that contains $H$ as a subspace.
We interpret the unit vectors of $H$ as states of individual fermions of the
same type and $\gscript (H)$ as a fermion quantum field whose unit vectors
represent states of collections of interacting fermions. We discuss creation
operators on $\gscript (H)$ and provide their matrix representations. Evolution
operators provided by self-adjoint Hamiltonians on $H$ and $\gscript (H)$ are
considered. Boson-Fermion quantum fields are constructed. Extensions of
operators from $H$ to $\gscript (H)$ are studied. Finally, we present a
generalization of our work to infinite dimensional separable Hilbert spaces.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Discover bulk localized transport (BLT) states in quasicrystalline structures, which exhibit unique scaling laws and properties compared to edge states. BLT states appear in specific parameter ranges and can cluster, offering potential robustness for applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces a novel topological state, BLT states, which are bulk localized in quasicrystals. This is significant because it challenges the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence and offers new insights into the electronic properties of quasicrystals.

Method: An algorithm based on a crosshair marker and robustness analysis is used to identify BLT states through the Hofstadter model on Ammann-Beenker tiling.

Result: BLT states appear within magnetic flux intervals and can coexist with various state densities. They display geometric localization and can cluster within the energy spectrum, suggesting robustness.

Conclusion: The findings expand our understanding of topological states in quasicrystals and provide a new avenue for studying their electronic structure and potential applications.

Abstract: In contrast to the usual bulk-boundary correspondence, topological states
localized within the bulk of the system have been numerically identified in
quasicrystalline structures, termed bulk localized transport (BLT) states.
These states exhibit properties different from edge states, one example being
that the number of BLT states scales with system size, while the number of edge
states scales with system perimeter. Here, we define an algorithm to identify
BLT states, which is based on the physically motivated crosshair marker and
robustness analyses. Applying the algorithm to the Hofstadter model on the
Ammann-Beenker tiling, we find that the BLT states appear mainly for magnetic
fluxes within a specific interval. While edge states appear at low densities of
states, we find that BLT states can appear at many different densities of
states. Many of the BLT states are found to have real-space localization that
follows geometric patterns characteristic of the given quasicrystal.
Furthermore, BLT states can appear both isolated and in groups within the
energy spectrum which could imply greater robustness for the states within such
groups. The spatial localization of the states within a certain group can
change depending on the Fermi energy.

Abstract: Single photons source (SPS) is a key component required by quantum

lines observed within the 500-800 nm range in photoluminescence (PL) spectra of
the surface layer of untreated Yakut diamonds rich in nitrogen and hydrogen
belong to SPS. Moreover, unknown narrow-line PL observed earlier in nitrogen-

Abstract: Levitated optomechanics, the interaction between light and small levitated
objects, is a new macroscopic quantum system that is being used as a testing
ground for fundamental physics and for the development of sensors with
exquisite sensitivity. The utility of this system, when compared to other
quantum optomechanical systems, is its extreme isolation from the environment
and, by the relatively few degrees of freedom that a levitated object has.
While work in the field has strongly focused on the three translational degrees
of freedom of this system, it has become increasingly important to understand
the induced rotational motion of levitated objects, particularly in optical
trapping fields, but also in magnetic and electric traps. These additional
three degrees of freedom, which are intrinsic to levitated systems, offer a new
set of optomechanical nonlinear interactions that lead to a rich and yet
largely unexplored roto-translational motion. The control and utilization of
these interactions promise to extend the utility of levitated optomechanics in
both fundamental studies and applications. In this review, we provide an
overview of levitated optomechanics, before focusing on the roto-translational
motion of optically levitated anisotropic objects. We first present a classical
treatment of this induced motion, bridging the gap between classical and
quantum formalisms. We describe the different types of roto-translational
motion for different particle shapes via their interaction with polarized
optical trapping fields. Subsequently, we provide an overview of the
theoretical and experimental approaches as well as applications that have
established this new field. The review concludes with an outlook of promising
experiments and applications, including the creation of non-classical states of
roto-translational motion, quantum-limited torque sensing and particle
characterization methods.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has great potential for the analysis of
chemical datasets. However, conventional quantum data-encoding schemes, such as
fingerprint encoding, are generally unfeasible for the accurate representation
of chemical moieties in such datasets. In this contribution, we introduce the
quantum molecular structure encoding (QMSE) scheme, which encodes the molecular
bond orders and interatomic couplings expressed as a hybrid Coulomb-adjacency
matrix, directly as one- and two-qubit rotations within parameterised circuits.
We show that this strategy provides an efficient and interpretable method in
improving state separability between encoded molecules compared to other
fingerprint encoding methods, which is especially crucial for the success in
preparing feature maps in QML workflows. To benchmark our method, we train a
parameterised ansatz on molecular datasets to perform classification of state
phases and regression on boiling points, demonstrating the competitive
trainability and generalisation capabilities of QMSE. We further prove a
fidelity-preserving chain-contraction theorem that reuses common substructures
to cut qubit counts, with an application to long-chain fatty acids. We expect
this scalable and interpretable encoding framework to greatly pave the way for
practical QML applications of molecular datasets.

### [101] [Electron charge coherence on a solid neon surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20476)
*Xinhao Li,Shan Zou,Qianfan Chen,Dafei Jin*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper reports a solid-state electron charge qubit with a coherence time of 0.1 ms on solid neon, which is unusually long. Theoretical analysis shows decoherence is mainly due to phonon-induced displacement and permittivity modulation. Coherence time decreases with higher qubit frequencies, and simulations underestimate the observed coherence times, indicating potential for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of maintaining long coherence times for solid-state qubits, which is crucial for scalable quantum computing.

Method: The study uses theoretical models to analyze decoherence mechanisms in electron charge states on solid neon, considering phonon effects at cryogenic temperatures.

Result: The coherence times decrease as qubit frequency increases, showing phonon effects dominate. Simulations predict longer coherence times than observed, suggesting more room for improvement.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into optimizing qubit design for longer coherence times, essential for advancing quantum computing technologies.

Abstract: Recent experiments show ~0.1 ms coherence time for a single electron charge
qubit on a solid neon surface. This remarkably long coherence time is believed
to result from the intrinsic purity of solid neon as a qubit host. In this
paper, we present theoretical studies on the decoherence mechanisms of an
electron's charge (lateral motional) states on solid neon. At the typical
experimental temperature of ~10 mK, the two main decoherence mechanisms are the
phonon-induced displacement of the neon surface and the phonon-induced
modulation of the neon permittivity (dielectric constant). With a qubit
frequency increasing from 1 GHz to 10 GHz, the charge coherence time decreases
from about 366 s to 7 ms, and from about 27 s to 0.3 ms, respectively, limited
by the two mechanisms above. The calculated coherence times are at least one
order longer than the observed ones at ~6.4 GHz qubit frequency, suggesting
plenty of room for experimental improvement.

Result: 获得了精确解，揭示了谱崩溃和PT对称性破坏，确认了两种模型的动力学差异。

Conclusion: 该研究深入探讨了非厄米tpQRM的特性，提供了理论基础用于未来的实验实现。

Abstract: We investigate two non-Hermitian two-photon quantum Rabi models (tpQRM) that
exhibit $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry: the biased tpQRM (btpQRM), in which the qubit
bias is purely imaginary, and the dissipative tpQRM (dtpQRM), where the
two-photon coupling is made imaginary to introduce dissipation. For both
models, we derive exact solutions by employing Bogoliubov transformations. In
the btpQRM, we identify spectral collapse at a critical coupling strength, with
accompanying $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking that correlates with exceptional
points (EPs) arising from coalescing eigenstates. We establish a direct
correspondence between $\mathcal{PT}$-broken regions and the doubly degenerate
points of the Hermitian tpQRM, and analyze the effects of qubit bias via an
adiabatic approximation. In the dtpQRM, although no spectral collapse occurs,
both EPs and Juddian-type degeneracies are present, with well-separated
behaviors distinguished by parity conservation. Through biorthogonal fidelity
susceptibility and c-product, we successfully identify and classify the nature
of these two types of level crossings. Finally, we compare the dynamical
evolution of both models, revealing fundamentally different pathways to steady
states governed by their respective non-Hermitian spectral structures. Our
results provide exact characterizations of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric
non-Hermitian tpQRMs and may offer theoretical insights for future experimental
realizations.

Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating
many-body quantum systems, but their practical use is often hindered by
limitations of current sampling techniques. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods suffer from slow mixing and require manual tuning, while autoregressive
NQS impose restrictive architectural constraints that complicate the
enforcement of symmetries and the construction of determinant-based multi-state
wave functions. In this work, we introduce Neural Importance Resampling (NIR),
a new sampling algorithm that combines importance resampling with a separately
trained autoregressive proposal network. This approach enables efficient and
unbiased sampling without constraining the NQS architecture. We demonstrate
that NIR supports stable and scalable training, including for multi-state NQS,
and mitigates issues faced by MCMC and autoregressive approaches. Numerical
experiments on the 2D transverse-field Ising model show that NIR outperforms
MCMC in challenging regimes and yields results competitive with density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Our results establish NIR as a robust
alternative for sampling in variational NQS algorithms.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses a novel approach using superconducting cores to trap superconducting particles in levitation, addressing the challenge of trapping within spiraling magnetic fields, and suggests using diamond NV centers for magnetometry to detect residual fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve quantum mechanics studies with large superconductors by overcoming levitation challenges, specifically trapped flux and low frequencies.

Method: Used superconducting cores, anti-Helmholtz coils, diamond NV centers for measurements.

Result: Damping occurs when lower critical field is exceeded, detected strong fields post-coil operation, trapped particle motion observed.

Conclusion: New strategies to prevent damping and improve levitation are needed, relying on residual field detection and other mitigation methods.

Abstract: Magnetic levitation of superconductors is a promising platform to study
quantum mechanics in the large-mass limit. One major limitation is the weak
trapping potential, which results in low vibrational eigenfrequencies and
increased susceptibility to low-frequency noise. While generating strong
magnetic fields is relatively straightforward, creating a tightly confined
harmonic potential - essentially achieving a large magnetic field gradient -
remains a significant challenge. In this work, we demonstrate a potential
solution using superconducting cores that concentrate magnetic flux into
arbitrarily small volumes. We show the ability to trap superconducting
particles using an anti-Helmholtz coil configuration incorporating these cores.
However, we observe rapid damping of the levitated particle motion due to flux
trapping within the cores, occurring once the lower critical field is exceeded
locally. To investigate this mechanism, we employ diamond NV center
magnetometry and detect substantial remanent fields persisting after
high-current operation of the coils. Finally, we discuss possible strategies to
mitigate this effect and improve the levitation properties.

Motivation: The paper's motivation is to explore the application of quantum computing in finance, particularly in portfolio optimization, by evaluating different quantum algorithms and enhancing their practical relevance through expert feedback.

Method: The study method involves benchmarking VQE and QAOA under various experimental conditions such as different asset universes, ansatz architectures, and circuit depths. It also introduces an expert evaluation framework to assess portfolio quality.

Result: Both VQE and QAOA show effective cost minimization, but resulting portfolios often lack essential financial criteria like diversification and realistic risk exposure.

Conclusion: The study concludes that despite quantum algorithms' optimization potential, their practical application in finance requires rigorous expert evaluation to ensure portfolios meet critical financial benchmarks.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms have gained increasing attention for addressing complex
combinatorial problems in finance, notably portfolio optimization. This study
systematically benchmarks two prominent variational quantum approaches,
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA), under diverse experimental settings, including different
asset universes, ansatz architectures, and circuit depths. Although both
methods demonstrate effective cost function minimization, the resulting
portfolios often violate essential financial criteria, such as adequate
diversification and realistic risk exposure. To bridge the gap between
computational optimization and practical viability, we introduce an Expert
Analysis Evaluation framework in which financial professionals assess the
economic soundness and the market feasibility of quantum-optimized portfolios.
Our results highlight a critical disparity between algorithmic performance and
financial applicability, emphasizing the necessity of incorporating expert
judgment into quantum-assisted decision-making pipelines.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子计算与-classical协同优化提供了新的思路，未来可通过调整参数进一步优化算法性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an expansion of the Expected Maximum Improvement
over Confident Regions (EMICoRe) Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) -- a
technique advanced by Nicoli et al., which utilizes both quantum and classical
components to approximate the ground state of a quantum system -- by
introducing an alternative threshold for EMICoRe's Confident Region that
depends on both the Gaussian process (GP) prior variance and the model's change
in predicted energy over a set number of iterations. This modification is a
more lenient threshold for the Confident Region and accounts for natural
fluctuations in the predicted energy that EMICoRe punishes by eliminating the
exploratory benefits presented by the Confident Region. We test both algorithms
with the original EMICoRe model as a baseline and our results suggest
improvement over EMICoRe's state-of-the-art results for a common benchmark for
VQEs, the Ising Hamiltonian, and similar performance for more complex
optimization regimes. We analyze the accuracy in approximated ground state
energy and how the threshold evolves during optimization to compare the EMICoRe
model with the proposed alternative. After comparison, we discuss the potential
optimization of the degrees of freedom present in the new threshold for better
performance and a more varied choice of system to be approximated.

TL;DR: This abstract discusses the effect of accidental counts in photonic Bell tests on quantum violations, affecting QKD and RNG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address practical issues in quantum experiments, specifically how noise from accidental photon pairs impacts Bell inequalities in real-world devices like QKD.

Method: The method involves modeling accidental counts, testing the model with experimental data from SPDC-based Bell tests, and predicting Bell values based on pump strength.

Result: The model accurately predicts Bell values across pump settings, useful for optimizing QKD and RNG.

Conclusion: The research provides a way to balance source brightness and quantum nonlocality for high-rate quantum technologies.

Abstract: We investigate how accidental counts, the detection events not originating
from genuine entangled photon pairs, impact the observed violation of Bell
inequalities in photonic experiments. These false coincidences become
increasingly significant at higher laser pump powers, limiting the strength of
Bell violations and thus the performance of quantum protocols such as
device-independent quantum random number generation and quantum key
distribution. We propose a simple noise model that quantitatively links the
Bell value to the pump strength. Using experimental data from recent SPDC-based
Bell tests, we fit the model to a Bell expression, and demonstrate accurate
prediction of Bell values across a range of pump settings. Our results provide
practical guidance for optimizing source brightness while preserving quantum
nonlocality, with direct implications for high-rate, secure quantum
technologies.

Abstract: Applying quantum computing in the computer-aided engineering (CAE) problems
are highly expected since quantum computers yield potential exponential
speedups for the operations between extremely large matrices and vectors.
Although efficient quantum algorithms for the above problems have been
intensively investigated, it remains a crucial task to extract all the
grid-point values encoded in the prepared quantum states, which was believed to
eliminate the achieved quantum advantage. In this paper, we propose a
quantum-classical hybrid Fourier space readout (FSR) method to efficiently
recover the underlying function from its corresponding quantum state. We
provide explicit quantum circuits, followed by theoretical and numerical
discussions on its complexity. In particular, the complexity on quantum
computers has only a logarithmic dependence on the grid number, while the
complexity on classical computers has a linear dependence on the number of
target points instead of the grid number. Our result implies that the achieved
quantum speedups are not necessarily ruined when we read out the solutions to
the CAE problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of incompatible measurements is crucial in quantum information theory as incompatible measurements underpin quantum cryptography and quantum state tomography. This paper provides an analysis of random measurements, which are relevant in practical quantum systems.

Method: The authors employ incompatibility witnesses to measure incompatibility between pairs of random measurements. They utilize tools from random matrix theory to generate and analyze these measurements, particularly focusing on dichotomic projective and basis measurements. Free probability techniques are likely used to assess the expected properties of these measurements.

Result: For certain parameters, the analyzed random measurements are very close to being maximally incompatible.

Conclusion: This research contributes to understanding the fundamental limits of incompatible measurements, which is vital for developing secure quantum communication protocols and efficient quantum state tomography methods.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the incompatibility of random quantum
measurements. Most previous work has focused on characterizing the maximal
amount of white noise that any fixed number of incompatible measurements with a
fixed number of outcomes in a fixed dimension can tolerate before becoming
compatible. This can be used to quantify the maximal amount of incompatibility
available in such systems. The present article investigates the incompatibility
of several classes of random measurements, i.e., the generic amount of
incompatibility available. In particular, we show that for an appropriate
choice of parameters, both random dichotomic projective measurements and random
basis measurements are close to being maximally incompatible. We use the
technique of incompatibility witnesses to certify incompatibility and combine
it with tools from random matrices and free probability.

Abstract: We present the simulation of the quench dynamics of the Z3 Schwinger model,
that describes an approximation of one-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics, on
a digital noisy Rydberg atom platform, aiming at the observation of multiple
dynamical quantum phase transitions. In order to reach long-time dynamics, we
exploit an enconding dictated by the symmetries, combined with a circuit
compression procedure. We focus on a quench that evolves the Dirac vacuum by
means of a Hamiltonian depending on a negative mass parameter. This leads to
resonant Rabi oscillations between the Dirac vacuum and mesonic states. The
population concentration exhibits oscillations with negligible fluctuations of
detuned states also with the inclusion of combined noise sources, from which we
can clearly detect multiple dynamical phase transitions.

Abstract: Tensor networks have proven to be a valuable tool, for instance, in the
classical simulation of (strongly correlated) quantum systems. As the size of
the systems increases, contracting larger tensor networks becomes
computationally demanding. In this work, we study distributed memory
architectures intended for high-performance computing implementations to solve
this task. Efficiently distributing the contraction task across multiple nodes
is critical, as both computational and memory costs are highly sensitive to the
chosen partitioning strategy. While prior work has employed general-purpose
hypergraph partitioning algorithms, these approaches often overlook the
specific structure and cost characteristics of tensor network contractions. We
introduce a simulated annealing-based method that iteratively refines the
partitioning to minimize the total operation count, thereby reducing
time-to-solution. The algorithm is evaluated on MQT Bench circuits and achieves
an 8$\times$ average reduction in computational cost and an 8$\times$ average
reduction in memory cost compared to a naive partitioning.

The existing methods are memory intensive and unsuitable for real-time execution of large programs. The need for an efficient way to manage these large programs, particularly during transpilation, is the motivation behind this work.

Method: The approach taken is the development of caches and compressors. Caches save time on repetitive tasks, while compressors reduce memory usage by efficiently representing the circuits. These tools are designed to work during the automatic transpilation process.

Result: The numerical analysis demonstrates that the proposed caches and compressors can reduce latency by a factor of five orders of magnitude, which is a significant improvement.

Conclusion: This advancement will enable more efficient handling of large-scale quantum programs, facilitating the practical application of quantum computing at utility scales.

Abstract: Utility-scale quantum programs contain operations on the order of $>10^{15}$
which must be prepared and piped from a classical co-processor to the control
unit of the quantum device. The latency of this process significantly increases
with the size of the program: existing high-level classical representations of
quantum programs are typically memory intensive and do not na\"ively
efficiently scale to the degree required to execute utility-scale programs in
real-time. To combat this limitation, we propose the utilization of high-level
quantum circuit caches and compressors. The first save on the time associated
with repetitive tasks and sub-circuits, and the latter are useful for
representing the programs/circuits in memory-efficient formats. We present
numerical evidence that caches and compressors can offer five orders of
magnitude lower latencies during the automatic transpilation of extremely large
quantum circuits.

### [115] [Optimization and Synthesis of Quantum Circuits with Global Gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20694)
*Alejandro Villoria,Henning Basold,Alfons Laarman*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a circuit compilation technique that optimizes quantum circuits by reducing the number of global interactions using ZX-calculus, showing significant performance improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing requires efficient circuit compilation to improve performance, especially in hardware-constrained platforms. Reducing gate operations, particularly non-Clifford and global gates, is crucial for practical quantum computing.

Method: The authors use ZX-calculus to design an algorithm that optimizes arbitrary quantum circuits by replacing certain gates with Global Molmer-Sorensen gates, focusing on global interactions. The algorithm also groups entangling gates to minimize their number.

Result: The algorithm shows improvements in reducing the number of global interactions compared to a naive approach and Qiskit's optimizer, leading to better overall circuit performance under state-of-the-art hardware metrics.

Conclusion: The method leverages ZX-calculus for efficient circuit optimization by exploiting global interactions, enhancing Quantum Computing's practical applications from theoretical developments.

Abstract: Compiling quantum circuits to account for hardware restrictions is an
essential part of the quantum computing stack. Circuit compilation allows us to
adapt algorithm descriptions into a sequence of operations supported by real
quantum hardware, and has the potential to significantly improve their
performance when optimization techniques are added to the process. One such
optimization technique is reducing the number of quantum gates that are needed
to execute a circuit. For instance, methods for reducing the number of
non-Clifford gates or CNOT gates from a circuit is an extensive research area
that has gathered significant interest over the years. For certain hardware
platforms such as ion trap quantum computers, we can leverage some of their
special properties to further reduce the cost of executing a quantum circuit in
them. In this work we use global interactions, such as the Global
M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate present in ion trap hardware, to optimize and
synthesize quantum circuits. We design and implement an algorithm that is able
to compile an arbitrary quantum circuit into another circuit that uses global
gates as the entangling operation, while optimizing the number of global
interactions needed. The algorithm is based on the ZX-calculus and uses an
specialized circuit extraction routine that groups entangling gates into Global
M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gates. We benchmark the algorithm in a variety of
circuits, and show how it improves their performance under state-of-the-art
hardware considerations in comparison to a naive algorithm and the Qiskit
optimizer.

Abstract: Spin-phonon interaction is known to drive magnetic relaxation in solid-state
systems, but little evidence is available on how it affects coherence time.
Here we extend fourth-order quantum master equations to account for coherence
terms and describe the full effect of up to two-phonon processes on spin
dynamics. We numerically implement this method fully ab initio for a
single-molecule magnet with large magnetization blocking temperature and show
that while strong axial magnetic anisotropy ensures slow magnetic relaxation
approaching seconds at 77 K, the superposition of Kramers doublets is coherent
for less than 10 ns due to a novel two-phonon pure dephasing mechanism.

Abstract: Ideal quantum measurement requires divergent thermodynamic resources. This is
a consequence of the third law of thermodynamics, which prohibits the
preparation of the measurement pointer in a fully erased, pure state required
for the acquisition of perfect, noiseless measurement information. In this
work, we investigate the consequences of finite resources in the emergence of
intersubjectivity as a model for measurement processes with multiple observers.
Here, intersubjectivity refers to a condition in which observers agree on the
observed outcome (agreement), and their local random variables exactly
reproduce the original random variable for the system observable (probability
reproducibility). While agreement and reproducibility are mutually implied in
the case of ideal measurement, finite thermodynamic resources constrain each of
them. Starting from the third law of thermodynamics, we derive how the
achievability of ideal intersubjectivity is affected by restricted
thermodynamic resources. Specifically, we establish a no-go theorem concerning
perfect intersubjectivity and present a deviation metric to account for the
influence of limited resources. We further present attainable bounds for the
agreement and bias that are exclusively dependent on the initial state of the
environment. In addition, we show that either by cooling or coarse-graining, we
can approximate ideal intersubjectivity even with finite resources. This work
bridges quantum thermodynamics and the emergence of classicality in the form of
intersubjectivity.

Motivation: 矩阵理论在许多领域中基础且重要，现有的二元分类方法无法描述矩阵元素在时间上的连续变化。因此，开发一种能够描述这种连续变化的新理论具有重要意义。

Abstract: Matrix theory, foundational in diverse fields such as mathematics, physics,
and computational sciences, typically categorizes matrices based strictly on
their invertibility-determined by a sharply defined singular or nonsingular
classification. However, such binary classifications become inadequate in
describing matrices whose elements vary continuously over time, thereby
transitioning through intermediate states near singular configurations. To
address this fundamental limitation, we develop a rigorous and original
mathematical theory termed Continuity Norm Framework for the Evolution of
Nonsingular Matrices. Within this framework, we introduce a novel mathematical
structure enabling continuous and differentiable transitions between singular
and nonsingular matrix states, explicitly governed by a specialized continuity
norm and evolution operators derived through a well-defined differential
formulation. Our theoretical formalism rigorously quantifies the proximity of a
matrix to singularity, alongside its temporal evolution, through precisely
constructed functional relationships involving determinants and their time
derivatives. Furthermore, we elucidate the direct applicability and relevance
of our approach to physical systems by demonstrating how our formalism can
seamlessly describe continuous quantum state transitions-scenarios frequently
encountered but insufficiently captured by existing matrix theory. The theory
presented herein is meticulously constructed to maintain mathematical
exactitude, comprehensive rigor, and broad accessibility, bridging advanced
mathematical innovation and clear interpretability for the wider scientific
community.

*Bruno Oziel Fernandez,Rodrigo Bloot,Marcelo Moret*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for quantum optimizations using circuits with variable topology to avoid convergence issues, showing promising results more effectively than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find efficient quantum algorithms for integer optimization problems, aiming to overcome limitations in current quantum devices.

Method: The paper presents two approaches: one ansatz-free evolutionary method and another using a pseudo-counterdiabatic term, tested on the set partitioning problem in noisy and non-noisy scenarios.

Result: The variable topology circuits performed better, especially avoiding convergence stagnation, outperforming standard VQE methods.

Conclusion: Variable topology quantum circuits offer a viable alternative for integer optimization, potentially outperforming existing quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms are of great interest for their possible use in
optimization problems. In particular, variational algorithms that use classical
counterparts to optimize parameters hold promise for use in currently existing
devices. However, convergence stagnation phenomena pose a challenge for such
algorithms. Seeking to avoid such difficulties, we present a framework based on
circuits with variable topology with two approaches, one based on ansatz-free
evolutionary method known from literature and the other using an introduction
of an ansatz with circuital structure inspired by the physics of the
Hamiltonian related to the problem, considering a, named here,
pseudo-counterdiabatic evolutionary term. The efficiency of the proposed
framework was tested on several instances of the set partitioning problem. The
two approaches were compared with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver in noisy
and non-noisy scenarios. The results demonstrated that optimization using
circuits with variable topology presented very encouraging results. Notably,
the strategy employing a pseudo-counterdiabatic evolutionary term exhibited
remarkable performance, avoiding convergence stagnation in most instances
considered. This framework circumvents the need for classical optimizers, and,
as a consequence, this procedure based on circuits with variable topology
indicates an interesting path in the search for algorithms to solve integer
optimization problems targeting efficient applications in larger-scale
scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum entanglement is crucial for quantum technologies, but its detection and quantification are challenging. The paper addresses these limitations by proposing a scalable algorithm.

Method: They developed a variational quantum algorithm based on Uhlmann's theorem, tailored for Bures entanglement and extensible to other quantum resources.

Result: The algorithm's complexity scales polynomially, making it practical, and it's demonstrated through successful applications.

Conclusion: This provides a versatile tool for practical quantum resource evaluation.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a foundational resource in quantum information
science, underpinning applications across physics. However, detecting and
quantifying entanglement remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a
variational quantum algorithm inspired by Uhlmann's theorem to quantify the
Bures entanglement of general quantum states, a method that naturally extends
to other quantum resources, including genuine multipartite entanglement,
quantum discord, quantum coherence, and total correlations, while also enabling
reconstruction of the closest free states. The algorithm requires a polynomial
number of ancillary qubits and circuit depth relative to the system size,
dimensionality, and free state cardinality, making it scalable for practical
implementations. Thus, it provides a versatile and efficient framework for
quantifying quantum resources, demonstrated through several applications.

Motivation: 随着量子计算的快速发展，提高量子算法的效率成为关键。构建快速的块编码对实现量子加速至关重要。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于FOQCS-LCU的方法，利用检查矩阵形式的oracle来减少多控制门的数量，从而降低总体门道数。通过优化状态准备 oracle，使用参数化的高效Dicke态制备方法，使得门道数减少，尤其是CNOT门的数量减少了一个数量级。

Result: 通过FOQCS-LCU，门道数减少显著，尤其是CNOT门的数量相比传统LCU减少了至少一个数量级。

Conclusion: FOQCS-LCU提供了一种高效构建块编码的方法，扩展了量子算法的适用范围。

Abstract: As algorithmic tools exemplified by the Quantum Singular Value Transformation
(QSVT) continue to emerge as a unifying framework for diverse quantum speedups,
the efficient construction of block encodings--their fundamental input
model--becomes increasingly crucial. However, devising explicit block encoding
circuits remains a well-recognized and challenging problem. One of the most
widely studied and versatile approaches to block encoding is the Linear
Combination of Unitaries (LCU). Despite its generality, the practical use of
LCU is often limited by significant gate overhead, primarily stemming from the
multi-controlled gates required in the SELECT oracle. We introduce a compact
LCU formulation, dubbed FOQCS-LCU, which leverages the check matrix formalism
to implement a constant-depth SELECT oracle using a linear number of singly
controlled Pauli gates and ancillae. We demonstrate that, by exploiting the
structure of the problem, the cost of the state preparation oracle can also be
substantially reduced. We accomplish so by designing a parametrized family of
efficient Dicke state preparation routines. We construct explicit block
encoding circuits for representative spin models such as the Heisenberg and
spin glass Hamiltonians and provide detailed, non-asymptotic gate counts. Our
numerical benchmarks validate the efficiency of the FOQCS-LCU approach,
illustrating an order-of-magnitude improvement in CNOT count over conventional
LCU. This framework opens the door to efficient block encodings of a broad
class of structured matrices beyond those explored here.

Abstract: We introduce a simple definition of dynamical entropy for quantum systems
under continuous monitoring, inspired by Connes, Narnhofer and Thirring. It
quantifies the amount of information gained about the initial condition. A
nonzero entropy rate can be obtained by monitoring the thermal fluctuation of
an extensive observable in a generic many-body system (away from classical or
large N limit). We explicitly compute the entropy rate in the thermodynamic and
long-time limit, in terms of the two-point correlation functions. We conjecture
a universal Planckian bound for the entropy rate. Related results on the
purification rate are also obtained.

Abstract: In this work, we present a new framework for a relativistic quantum analouge
of the classical Otto engine. Considering a single qubit as the working
substance, we analyse its interaction with a massless quantum scalar field
while undergoing two half-circular rotations at ultra-relativistic velocities.
The quantum vacuum serves as a thermal bath through the Unruh effect induced
due to the acceleration from the circular motions. We observe that the response
function of the qubit gets significantly modified by the presence of the
qubit's trajectory. Analysing the transition probability behaviour, we find
that in the high-acceleration regime, it asymptotically approaches a constant
value, determined solely by the properties of the correlation function.
Furthermore, our results emphasize the crucial role of the circular trajectory
in determining the engine's work output. In particular, the extracted work
increases with detector acceleration and approaches an asymptotic limit in the
high-acceleration regime. Notably, the efficiency of this model remains
unaffected by the circular motion and is consistent with previously studied
models.

Abstract: We present a general and simple formula for computing the entanglement

condition for the area law in mixed free fermion states with long-range
correlations. In addition, we establish an area-law bound on entanglement
generation in open systems, analogous to previously known results for

Abstract: Quantum steering enables one party to influence another remote quantum state
by local measurement. While steering is fundamental to many quantum information
tasks, the existing detection methods in the literature are mainly constrained
to either specific measurement scenario or low-dimensional systems. In this
work, we propose a majorization lattice framework for steering detection, which
is capable of exploring the steering in arbitrary dimension and measurement
setting. Steering inequalities for two-qubit states, high-dimensional Werner
states and isotropic states are obtained, which set even stringent bars than
what have reached yet. Notably, the known high-dimensional results turn out to
be some kind of approximate limits of the new approach.

Abstract: We explore how the fundamental problems in quantum molecular dynamics can be
modelled using classical simulators (emulators) of quantum computers and the
actual quantum hardware available to us today. The list of problems we tackle
includes propagation of a free wave packet, vibration of a harmonic oscillator,
and tunneling through a barrier. Each of these problems starts with the initial
wave packet setup. Although Qiskit provides a general method for initializing
wavefunctions, in most cases it generates deep quantum circuits. While these
circuits perform well on noiseless simulators, they suffer from excessive noise
on quantum hardware. To overcome this issue, we designed a shallower quantum
circuit for preparing a Gaussian-like initial wave packet, which improves the
performance on real hardware. Next, quantum circuits are implemented to apply
the kinetic and potential energy operators for the evolution of a wavefunction
over time. The results of our modelling on classical emulators of quantum
hardware agree perfectly with the results obtained using the traditional
(classical) methods. This serves as a benchmark and demonstrates that the
quantum algorithms and Qiskit codes we developed are accurate. However, the
results obtained on the actual quantum hardware available today, such as IBM's
superconducting qubits and IonQ's trapped ions, indicate large discrepancies
due to hardware limitations. This work highlights both the potential and
challenges of using quantum computers to solve fundamental quantum molecular
dynamics problems.

TL;DR: Classical shallow networks are universal approximators, but this quantum protocol only requires constant optical resources and any number of neurons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper suggests that quantum optical networks can leverage advantages from quantum mechanics, possibly offering more efficient resource usage compared to classical networks, which is a significant development in quantum machine learning.

Method: The quantum optical protocol encodes input data and parameters into single-photon states, using the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. The network's output is determined by coincidence rates after photons interfere at a beam splitter, with multiple neurons represented as mixtures of single-photon states.

Result: The protocol performs tasks similar to classical shallow networks but with constant optical resources, meaning it doesn't scale with the number of input features or neurons.

Conclusion: This approach opens new possibilities for quantum-enhanced machine learning, potentially outperforming classical models in resource efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Classical shallow networks are universal approximators. Given a sufficient
number of neurons, they can reproduce any continuous function to arbitrary
precision, with a resource cost that scales linearly in both the input size and
the number of trainable parameters. In this work, we present a quantum optical
protocol that implements a shallow network with an arbitrary number of neurons.
Both the input data and the parameters are encoded into single-photon states.
Leveraging the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, the network output is determined by the
coincidence rates measured when the photons interfere at a beam splitter, with
multiple neurons prepared as a mixture of single-photon states. Remarkably,
once trained, our model requires constant optical resources regardless of the
number of input features and neurons.

Abstract: It is demonstrated that identifying information-theoretic limitations of
quantum Bell nonlocality alone cannot completely distinguish quantum theory
from generalized nonsignaling theories. To this end, an information-theoretic
concept of certifying nonobjective information by the Popescu-Rohrlich box
fraction is employed. Furthermore, in the aforementioned demonstration, a
partial answer to the question of what distinguishes quantum theory from
generalized nonsignaling theories emerges beyond the one provided by the
principle of information causality alone. This is accomplished by demonstrating
that postquantum models identified by the information causality are isolated by
the emergence of the Popescu-Rohrlich box fraction of nonobjective information
in Bell-local boxes of a generalized nonsignaling theory, over the two other
generalized nonsignaling theories that have simplicial local state spaces.

Designed to probe mucoadhesion in the context of mucociliary clearance, our
system applies controlled magnetic forces to ligand-coated beads adhered to
functionalized substrates and tracks detachment events using high-speed
microscopy and calibrated z-displacement mapping. The platform combines
substrate- and bead-side surface chemistry control with high-throughput imaging
and in situ force calibration via Stokes drag. We demonstrate the ability to
distinguish sub-nanonewton to nanonewton force regimes across a range of
bead-substrate pairings, including COOH-COOH, PEG-PEG, and cell culture-derived
human bronchial epithelial (HBE) mucus interactions. Surface functionalization
was validated via fluorescence imaging and zeta potential measurements, while
detachment forces were used to estimate binding energy and infer dissociation
constants. This assay enables detailed characterization of multivalent,
force-sensitive adhesive interactions and offers a powerful new approach for
studying bioadhesive systems, including mucus-pathogen interactions and drug
delivery materials.

### [130] [Comprehensive characterization of nonlinear viscoelastic properties of arterial tissues using guided-wave optical coherence elastography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20107)
*Yuxuan Jiang,Guo-Yang Li,Ruizhi Wang,Xu Feng,Yanhang Zhang,Seok-Hyun Yun*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of Optical Coherence Elastography to study the mechanical properties of arterial walls, revealing their complex viscoelastic behavior and how it changes under stress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding arterial mechanical properties is critical for cardiovascular health, and this paper suggests advanced imaging methods to better assess them.

Method: Used broadband guided-wave optical coherence elastography based on viscoelasto-acoustic theory to measure nonlinear viscoelastic, anisotropic, and layered properties of arterial walls.

Result: Arterial walls show strong stretch dependence in viscoelasticity, with increasing prestress reducing tissue viscosity. Adscientia becomes stiffer under load, likely due to collagen engagement. Chemical degradation of collagen fibers contributes to the nonlinear viscoelasticity.

Conclusion: The study shows OCE can effectively profile vascular biomechanics, aiding both research and clinical applications in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: The mechanical properties of arterial walls are critical for maintaining
vascular function under pulsatile pressure and are closely linked to the
development of cardiovascular diseases. Despite advances in imaging and
elastography, comprehensive characterization of the complex mechanical behavior
of arterial tissues remains challenging. Here, we present a broadband
guided-wave optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique, grounded in
viscoelasto-acoustic theory, for quantifying the nonlinear viscoelastic,
anisotropic, and layer-specific properties of arterial walls with high spatial
and temporal resolution. Our results reveal a strong stretch dependence of
arterial viscoelasticity, with increasing prestress leading to a reduction in
tissue viscosity. Under mechanical loading, the adventitia becomes
significantly stiffer than the media, attributable to engagement of collagen
fibers. Chemical degradation of collagen fibers highlighted their role in
nonlinear viscoelasticity. This study demonstrates the potential of OCE as a
powerful tool for detailed profiling of vascular biomechanics, with
applications in basic research and future clinical diagnosis.

*Shuo Zhang,Leonardo Shoji Aota,Mahander P. Singh,Eric V. Woods,Fantine Périer Jouet,Tim M. Schwarz,Baptiste Gault*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges and advancements in using APT to study biomolecules, particularly with ferritin showing promise but requiring further study and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The folding of biomacromolecules significantly impacts their function, so understanding their structure is crucial. APT offers unique insights but is difficult to apply to biomolecules in their native state.

Method: The authors used cryogenic techniques on ferritin, including plunge freezing and APT analysis, facing issues like particle destruction and ice crystal formation. They tried high-pressure freezing and used various materials to improve the process.

Result: urred particles were destroyed during the experiment, but APT worked on hydraulically pressurized samples. Future work is needed to better understand the method for intact samples.

Conclusion: >
SWOT analysis of APT for biomolecule studies: Strengths include high-resolution imaging, with Cryo-EM as complement. Weaknesses are that APT is technically challenging. Opportunities involve using more samples and better techniques. Threats include cryopreservation challenges, particularly with hydrated samples.

Abstract: The folding and structure of biomacromolecules depend on the 3D distributions
of their constituents, which ultimately controls their functionalities and
interactions with other biomacromolecules. Atom probe tomography (APT) with its
unparalleled compositional sensitivity at nanoscale spatial resolution, could
provide complementary information to cryo-electron microscopy, yet routine APT
analysis of biomacromolecules in their native state remains challenging. Here,
a ferritin solution was used as a model system. Following plunge freezing in
liquid nitrogen, cryogenic lift-out and cryo-APT analysis were performed.
Elements from the ferritin core and shell are detected yet particles seem
destroyed. We hence demonstrate the feasibility of preparing and analyzing bulk
hydrated biological samples using APT, however, the cooling was too slow to
vitrify the solution. This caused irrecoverable damage to the protein shell
surrounding the ferritin particles due to ice crystal formation. We report on
preliminary data from high-pressure frozen (HPF) deionized (DI) water,
demonstrating a proof-ofprinciple experiments that intact biomacromolecules
could be analyzed through a similar workflow in the future. We report on many
trials (and errors) on the use of different materials for substrates and
different substrate geometries, and provide a perspective on the challenges we
faced to facilitate future studies across the community.

Abstract: We show that interlayer excitons in double-layer semiconductor
heterostructures can form a Bose solid, which is an incompressible supersolid
characterized by exactly one boson per lattice site. This exciton Bose solid
would be the first realization of an incompressible supersolid, unlike the
generally compressible cluster supersolids seen in dipolar quantum gases.
Capturing its characteristics and associated emergent phenomena requires
extending the Gross-Pitaevskii formalism to include strong two-particle
correlations and exclude exciton self-interactions. We develop such a
formalism, we apply it across experimentally accessible exciton densities and
interlayer separations, and we show that it incorporates both superfluid and
incompressible supersolid ground states. This extended framework allows us to
determine the superfluid-supersolid transition and explore the low-temperature
properties of the exciton supersolid across its complete parameter space.

Abstract: We investigate the on-shell approximation in the context of s-wave scattering
for ultracold two-body collisions. Our analysis systematically covers spatial
dimensions D=1,2,3 , with the aim of identifying the regimes in which the
approximation remains valid when applied to commonly used model interaction
potentials. Specifically, we focus on the square well and delta shell
potentials, both of which admit analytical solutions for the s-wave scattering
problem in all dimensions considered. By employing the exact analytical
expressions for the s-wave scattering phase shift, we perform a direct
comparison between the exact on-shell matrix element of the interaction
potential and their corresponding approximations across a range of collision
momenta. Particular attention is given to the low-energy regime. Our findings
indicate that, although the on-shell approximation generally improves with
increasing momentum, its accuracy also improves for weaker potentials.
Remarkably, in the limit of weak interactions, we demonstrate that the on-shell
approximation becomes exact at leading order. In this regime, the approximation
offers a controlled means of deriving the low-momentum expansion of the
potential and may serve as a useful tool in constructing effective interactions
for quantum field theories.

Abstract: We analyze the zero energy collision of three identical bosons in the same
internal state with total orbital angular momentum $L=2$, assuming short range
interactions. By solving the Schr\"odinger equation asymptotically, we derive
two expansions of the wave function when three bosons are far apart or a pair
of bosons and the third boson are far apart. The scattering hypervolume $D$ is
defined for this collision. Unlike the scattering hypervolume defined by one of
us in 2008, whose dimension is length to the fourth power, the dimension of $D$
studied in the present paper is length to the eighth power. We then derive the
expression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's
expansion. We also calculate the energy shift of such three bosons with three
different momenta $\hbar \mathbf{k_{1}}$, $\hbar\mathbf{k_{2}}$ and
$\hbar\mathbf{k_{3}}$ in a large periodic box. The obtained energy shift
depends on $D^{(0)}/\Omega^{2}$ and $D/\Omega^{2}$, where $D^{(0)}$ is the
three-body scattering hypervolume defined for the three-body $L=0$ collision
and $\Omega$ is the volume of the periodic box. We also calculate the
contribution of $D$ to the three-body T-matrix element for low-energy
collisions. We then calculate the shift of the energy and the three-body
recombination rate due to $D^{(0)}$ and $D$ in the dilute homogeneous Bose gas.
The contribution to the three-body recombination rate constant from $D$ is
proportional to $T^2$ if the temperature $T$ is much larger than the quantum
degeneracy temperature but still much lower than the temperature scale at which
the thermal de Broglie wave length becomes comparable to the physical range of
interaction.

Abstract: Fluctuations are fundamental in physics and important for understanding and
characterizing phase transitions. In this spirit, the phase transition to the
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is of specific importance. Whereas fluctuations
of the condensate particle number in atomic BECs have been studied in
continuous systems, experimental and theoretical studies for lattice systems
were so far missing. Here, we explore the condensate particle number
fluctuations in an optical lattice BEC across the phase transition in a
combined experimental and theoretical study. We present both experimental data
using ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms and numerical simulations based on a hybrid
approach combining the Bogoliubov quasiparticle framework with a master
equation analysis for modeling the system. We find strongly anomalous
fluctuations, where the variance of the condensate number $\delta N_{\rm
BEC}^2$ scales with the total atom number as $N^{1+\gamma}$ with an exponent
around $\gamma_{\rm theo}=0.74$ and $\gamma_{\rm exp}=0.62$, which we attribute
to the 2D/3D crossover geometry and the interactions. Our study highlights the
importance of the trap geometry on the character of fluctuations and on
fundamental quantum mechanical properties.

Abstract: In Keplerian dynamics, a test body orbiting a point particle in circular
motion has a monotonically increasing frequency, with decreasing radius. If a
dissipative channel is introduced, such as gravitational wave (GW) emission,
(say) under the quadrupole approximation, the corresponding GW strain has an
ever increasing frequency with time. A similar statement holds for equatorial
motion of a test particle on the Kerr manifold, except such inspiral is cut off
at the ISCO, wherein stable circular orbits cease to exist and a plunge is
expected. We analyse circular timelike orbits in generic spinning spacetimes
and study the conditions in which exotic motion can occur, due to the presence
of non-Kerr features. In particular, we derive conditions under which an
inspiral towards a compact object is naturally followed by an outspiral motion,
and give concrete examples, as well as the corresponding GW phenomenology. This
analysis serves both as a theoretical exploration of non-Kerrness as well as an
example of a concrete smoking gun of exotic spacetimes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation is to investigate inflationary and late-time accelerated expansion scenarios using higher-order gravity models, which are motivated by the desire to avoid ghost-like instabilities and explore alternative gravitational theories.

Method: The authors employ a combination of numerical simulations and geometric analysis, recasting field equations into a slow-fast dynamical system to study phase space evolution under various coupling regimes and potential parameters.

Result: The results reveal stable de Sitter solutions, phantom divide line crossings, cyclic behavior, and cosmological scenarios that mimic matter-dominated and accelerated expansion eras.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the viability of Pais-Uhlenbeck scalar models in cosmology, providing a framework for analyzing inflationary and dark energy phenomena, offering useful diagnostic tools for higher-derivative cosmological theories.

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of scalar fields governed by
higher-order gravity, with particular emphasis on models inspired by the
Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator--a prototypical fourth-order system known for its
connection to ghost-free formulations. By recasting the field equations into a
slow-fast dynamical system, we analyze phase space evolution across exponential
and power-law coupling regimes. Our approach integrates numerical simulations
and geometric methods to visualize trajectories, stream flows, and asymptotic
behavior under varying potential parameters. The underlying system admits
singular surfaces and non-smooth transitions, revealing intricate dynamical
structures. We examine the stability of de Sitter solutions, the crossing of
the phantom divide, and the emergence of cyclic behavior through multiple-scale
analysis. The inclusion of radiation and dust fluids enables the creation of
realistic cosmological scenarios, including a transient matter-dominated era
and a late-time accelerated expansion. Our results highlight the viability of
Pais-Uhlenbeck scalar models in accounting for inflationary dynamics and dark

Abstract: Two-body gravitational interactions will occasionally lead to a stellar-mass
compact object entering a very highly eccentric orbit around a massive black
hole at the center of a galaxy. Gravitational radiation damping will
subsequently result in an extreme mass ratio inspiral. Much of the inspiral
time of these events is spent with the compact object on a long-period orbit,
with a brief burst of gravitational wave emission at periapsis firmly in the
mHz band. Burst orbits have been previously modeled as parabolic, with a focus
on extreme examples that could be detectable by space-based gravitational wave
detectors. This work focuses on the recurring bursts called "peeps". Peeps are
not likely to be individually resolvable; however, it is also important to
consider them as possible sources of signal confusion noise because they do
generate a signal within the LISA band with every pericenter passage. To
account for peeps, we must utilize estimates for EMRI capture parameters along
with tracking the massive black hole population out to a redshift of 3 using
the Illustris Project. Then, this population is combined with an EMRI formation
rate to estimate the number of EMRI events per unit volume for LISA. In this
study, we model three different assumptions for the gravitational wave
background produced by these highly eccentric peeps. We find that with our two
most likely backgrounds, the signal may result in a slight rise of the LISA
noise floor (SNR $\sim 0.3-2.4$); however, in the most abundant case, the
background generated by these sources would be detectable on its own and likely
obscure many potentially detectable sources (SNR $\sim77$).

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This study extends a thermodynamic methodology for de Sitter black holes to higher dimensions, finding that convergence at certain points doesn't affect universal conclusions. Including angular momentum shifts leads to a more universal relation, suggesting broader applicability to quantum gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to build upon existing work on black hole thermodynamics, aiming to generalize or refine universal relations in higher dimensions, possibly with practical implications for quantum gravity.

Method: They extended the Goon and Penco methodology, performed higher-dimensional analysis, considered angular momentum, and formulated a new conjecture connecting thermodynamic quantities across different black holes.

Result: The extended method yields new universal thermodynamic relations, especially when accounting for angular momentum, which could enhance our understanding of black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity.

Conclusion: The findings support the idea of universal thermodynamic principles in various black hole configurations, hinting at deeper connections in quantum gravity theories.

Abstract: In this study, the methodology proposed by Goon and Penco for investigating
the universality on thermodynamic relations with corrections in de Sitter black
holes is extended. A universal thermodynamic extremality relation, under
consideration of the mass of the spacetime $M$ with various state parameters,
proposed by Goon and Penco is investigated in higher dimensional spacetime, the
established universal conclusions are not impacted by the convergence of energy
from the coexistence region of two horizons to the point $N$ or $C$.
Furthermore, by incorporating the shift of the angular momentum into our
analysis, a more universal relation is derived, specifically applicable to
rotating configurations. Notably, a novel conjecture is formulated that
establishes a universal relationship framework connecting shifted thermodynamic
quantities across arbitrary black hole backgrounds. These findings are expected
to offer profound insights into the fundamental principles of quantum gravity.

Abstract: This thesis explores the late-time cosmic acceleration within the framework
of $f(R,T)$ gravity, a general relativity modification that incorporates the
Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. Motivated by
observational evidence for the universe's accelerated expansion and the
limitations of Einstein's theory in explaining dark energy, we study exact
cosmological solutions using various parametrizations of the deceleration
parameter. The analysis includes isotropic and anisotropic models such as
Bianchi type I universes with string fluid, bulk viscous matter, and magnetized
strange quark matter. Several forms of time-varying deceleration parameters are
employed to understand the dynamical behavior of the universe. We also examine
finite-time singularities like the Big Rip and discuss their occurrence in both
anisotropic and FLRW backgrounds. In addition, the thesis investigates
higher-order curvature corrections and geometric modifications, including
wormhole solutions, within the $f(R,T)$ formalism. Energy conditions are
analyzed to assess the physical plausibility of these models. The overall work
aims to provide a coherent and viable description of the universe's evolution

Abstract: A new formalism in general relativity with a linear response relation between
perturbed Einstein tensor and the stress-energy tensor is presented. Basic
concepts are borrowed from statistical physics and theory of stochastic
processes by extending them for a spacetime structure. We show qualitatively
new results of the first applications which lay foundations for a sub-hydro
mesoscopic theory in dense matter relativistic stars. This will enable one to
probe structure and phenomena at intermediate scales in relativistic stars and
exotic fluids that they are made up of. The overall aim is to build foundations
for studying dynamical equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of
astrophysical bodies based on stochastic correlations of perturbations of
spacetime and matter fields. This will add to the present literature on
asteroseismology a new insight in a significant way.It is also expected that
this will lead to direct or indirect observational consequences of meso scale
physics under extreme conditions present in the exotic objects.

### [144] [Thermodynamic stability of superflows in General Relativity and Newtonian gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19985)
*Lorenzo Gavassino*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Landau's criterion for superfluidity is a special case of a broader thermodynamic principle, providing new constraints for superfluid mixtures that are valid across all temperatures, even for gapless superfluids. However, these constraints are only necessary conditions, not sufficient, because they rely on fluid descriptions and do not account for stochastic fluctuations beyond hydrodynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the conditions for superfluidity and its generalizations is important for both theoretical physics and potential applications in areas like quantum fluids and neutron stars.

Method: The analysis begins with General Relativity and transitions to the Newtonian limit, applying the thermodynamic criterion to derive macroscopic constraints for superfluid mixtures.

Result: The paper introduces new thermodynamic constraints that generalize Landau's criterion, holding at all temperatures, but acknowledges they are only necessary conditions, not sufficient, due to the limitations of fluid mechanics.

Conclusion: The work deepens our understanding of superfluidity by broadening the theoretical framework but emphasizes that further considerations beyond hydrodynamics are needed for complete characterization.

Abstract: Landau's criterion for superfluidity is a special case of a broader
principle: A moving fluid cannot be stopped by frictional forces if its state
of motion is a local minimum of the grand potential. We employ this general
thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid
mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a
certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These
macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they
hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids.
Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a
frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid
description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability
against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations. We first formulate our analysis
within the framework of General Relativity, and then we take the Newtonian
limit.

Motivation: 研究者继续探索NFDG模型的潜力，以解释更广泛的星系动态，而无需依赖暗物质.

Method: 引入了一个新的mass-dimension field equation，使用这种方式推导出D_m(R)，并重新分析了部分星系.

Result: 模型的结果仍然支持其有效性，尽管精度有所下降，但潜在的改进激发了进一步研究的希望.

Conclusion: NFDG模型显示出继续在分析新的星系数据方面的潜力，该模型可能为解释不同星系的旋转曲线提供了一种新的方法.

Abstract: We resume our analysis of Newtonian Fractional-Dimension Gravity (NFDG), an
alternative gravitational model which does not require the Dark Matter (DM)
paradigm. We add three more galaxies (NGC 6946, NGC 3198, NGC 2841) to the
catalog of those studied with NFDG methods. Once again, NFDG can successfully
reproduce the observed rotation curves by using a variable fractional dimension
$D\left (R\right )$, as was done for nine other galaxies previously studied
with these methods.
  In addition, we introduce a mass-dimension field equation for our model,
which is capable of deriving the fractional mass-dimension $D_{m}\left( R
\right)$ from first principles, as opposed to the previous $D\left (R\right )$
which was obtained simply by matching the experimental rotational velocity data
for each galaxy. While the NFDG predictions computed with this new
$D_{m}\left(R\right)$ dimension are not as accurate as those based on the
original $D\left (R\right )$, they nevertheless confirm the validity of our
fractional-dimension approach. Three previously studied galaxies (NGC 7814, NGC
6503, NGC 3741) were analyzed again with these new methods and their structure
was confirmed to be free from any dark matter components.

### [146] [On the Reinterpretation of Dark Energy as the Elasticity of Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20073)
*Muhammad Ghulam Khuwajah Khan*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes interpreting dark energy as the tension of a 3-dimensional elastic brane in space, drawing from string theory concepts and providing a mechanism for the cosmological constant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to unify dark energy with string theory's brane tension, offering a physical explanation within a broader theoretical framework.

Method: Mathematical modeling of a 3-brane's vacuum stress-energy tensor and comparison to dark energy density, leveraging string theory concepts.

Result:  establish a direct correspondence between the cosmological constant and brane tension.

Conclusion: Supports the idea of the cosmological constant as a fundamental constant of nature rooted in brane tension, justifying its treatment as such.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that by treating space as a three dimensional
elastic membrane, one can interpret the energy density stored in it as Dark
Energy. In particular, we will model space as an infinitely large fundamental 3
brane and show that its vacuum stress energy tensor has the same mathematical
form which one expects from the stress energy tensor describing a Lorentz
invariant vacuum energy density (Dark Energy). We identify the dark-energy
density with the tension of the fundamental 3 brane and thereby establish a
direct correspondence between the cosmological constant and brane tension.
Finally, we present a brief argument as to why the Cosmological Constant should
be treated as a fundamental constant of nature, based on some light ontological
discussion regarding the origin of the tension term in the broader framework of
String Theory. In a forthcoming work, we will articulate a dynamical mechanism,
which will be grounded in Q-theory, Hawking-Wu flux neutralization and broken
super-symmetry, demonstrating the precise cancellation of vacuum energy in a
manner such that the fundamental brane (spatial) tension remains the unique
source of the Cosmological Constant.

### [147] [Corrected first law of thermodynamics for dynamical regular black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20124)
*Tianxu Huo,Chengzhou Liu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper corrects the first law of thermodynamics for dynamical regular black holes by accounting for the mass dependence of the energy-momentum tensor's T^v_v component, leading to a modified first law where black hole mass is no longer the internal energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper addresses the first law of thermodynamics for dynamic regular black holes, highlighting that traditional approaches give different temperatures, requiring a correction. I'm interested in understanding how to adjust the first law in such cases.

Method: The authors derive the corrected first law from Einstein's field equations, considering the T^v_v component's dependence on black hole mass, which affects the identification of mass as internal energy.

Result: The result is a corrected form of the first law where black hole mass isn't directly the internal energy, necessitating corrections to the thermodynamic laws.

Conclusion: This indicates that the dynamics of regular black holes introduce modifications to the first law of thermodynamics, aligning with static cases but with additional considerations for time-dependent scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we establish the corrected first law of thermodynamics for
dynamical regular black holes on both the event horizon and apparent horizon.
We find that the temperature of dynamical regular black holes derived from the
traditional first law differs from that obtained through other approaches. This
indicates that, similar to static cases, the first law of thermodynamics
requires correction. We then derive the corrected first law of thermodynamics
from the Einstein field equations. Our analysis reveals that the corrected
factor originates from the fact that the $ T^v_v $ component of the
energy-momentum tensor depends on the black hole mass. This dependence implies
that the mass of a regular black hole can no longer be directly identified as
the internal energy, leading to the corrections of the first law of
thermodynamics.

Method: 使用了Hamilton-Jacobi隧道效应法来计算Hawking温度，并分析了该温度随参数的变化。

Result: 提出了新的正则黑洞解，没有曲率奇点，拥有正的、明确定义的准局部质量；所有模型都有多个地平线，包括极值和非对称情况，通常在反弹附近违反经典能量条件；这些解在结构和热力学稳定性上表现出良好的特性。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了新正则解的有效性，并为研究黑洞结构和热力学提供了新的视角。

Abstract: In this work, we tested the thermal behavior of a class of regular black hole
solutions defined as generalized black-bounce spacetimes. We introduce several
novel configurations governed by different mass functions and geometric
deformations, illustrated by parameters controlling regularity and horizon
structure. Using the Hamilton Jacobi tunneling method, we compute the Hawking
temperature associated with each model and analyze its dependence on the
underlying parameters. We find that all proposed geometries are free of
curvature singularities and exhibit positive, well defined quasi-local masses
in the Hernandez Misner Sharp formalism. Also, we demonstrate that these models
may possess multiple horizons, including extremal and asymmetric cases, while
typically violating classical energy conditions in the vicinity of the bounce.
Our results show and illustrate the structure and thermodynamic stability of
these regular solutions.

Result: 零角速度的测地线显示出粒子运动的偏转比之前的结果更大，并且这些偏转可能与伽马射线暴中的观测现象一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果为了解释伽马射线暴中的粒子运动偏转提供了新的理论框架，并为进一步研究这类极端事件提供了基础。

Abstract: In our previous work (Phys. Rev. Research 7, 033079), we derived the metric
tensor for cylindrically shaped pulses with uniform energy density. Building
upon that framework, we derive the complete set of geodesics with zero angular
velocity. We show that perturbations in particle trajectories may be observed
in gamma ray bursts. Also, deviations in the motion of moving particles are
significantly larger than those previously found for particles that are
initially at rest.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces LensingFlow, an automated workflow to detect gravitational lensing in gravitational wave events, built on Asimov and CBCFlow, handling various lensing scenarios, managing computation priorities, and successfully tested on mock data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational lensing offers unique opportunities to study astrophysical phenomena, but automated detection is challenging, so this work is motivated by the need to streamline and enhance the analysis process.

Method: LensFlow combines automated tasks, including lensing pipeline integration and workflow scheduling, using Asimov and CBCFlow, with a prioritization system for computational resources.

Result: Testing on mock data with diverse lensing signals, LensFlow successfully identified candidate events.

Conclusion: LensFlow demonstrates the potential for automated, large-scale gravitational lensing analysis, offering a scalable solution for future studies.

Abstract: In this work, we present LensingFlow. This is an implementation of an
automated workflow to search for evidence of gravitational lensing in a large
series of gravitational wave events. This workflow conducts searches for
evidence in all generally considered lensing regimes. The implementation of
this workflow is built atop the Asimov automation framework and CBCFlow
metadata management software and the resulting product therefore encompasses
both the automated running and status checking of jobs in the workflow as well
as the automated production and storage of relevant metadata from these jobs to
allow for later reproduction. This workflow encompasses a number of existing
lensing pipelines and has been designed to accommodate any additional future
pipelines to provide both a current and future basis on which to conduct large
scale lensing analyses of gravitational wave signal catalogues. The workflow
also implements a prioritisation management system for jobs submitted to the
schedulers in common usage in computing clusters ensuring both the completion
of the workflow across the entire catalogue of events as well as the priority
completion of the most significant candidates. As a first proof-of-concept
demonstration, we deploy LensingFlow on a mock data challenge comprising 10
signals in which signatures of each lensing regime are represented. LensingFlow
successfully ran and identified the candidates from this data through its
automated checks of results from consituent analyses.

Conclusion: 理论研究对理解早期宇宙仍有挑战，需更多观测数据提升约束。

Abstract: Using the latest observational data, we constrain the inflationary dynamics
and the subsequent reheating epoch. Predictions for both phases can be
significantly improved by employing numerically computed results compared to
the slow-roll approximations. These results enable a more accurate reassessment
of the observational viability of inflationary models, provide tighter
constraints on the reheating history, and help lift the degeneracies in the
predictions of inflation and reheating dynamics. Given current observational
bounds, this enables a more accurate understanding of the early universe
physics.

### [152] [Fuzzy dark matter soliton as gravitational lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20323)
*Ke Wang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes that the FDM soliton can act as a gravitational lens for GWs with low magnification, but this effect isn't detectable by current pulsar timing arrays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the idea that dark matter might influence gravitational wave propagation through solitons, providing a new way to detect dark matter or FDM.

Method: The study uses numerical simulations to model GW propagation through FDM solitons, focusing on the magnification effects caused by the soliton's structure.

Result: Simulations show a small magnification factor despite a large magnification zone, which is too subtle for current pulsar timing arrays to detect.

Conclusion: While the FDM soliton's gravitational lensing effect exists, it's beyond the current detection capabilities so further research is needed to explore its implications or detectability in other ways.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations predict fuzzy dark matter (FDM)
solitons. Given the FDM mass $\sim10^{-20}\rm~{eV}/c^2$, the FDM soliton in the
Milky Way is massive $\sim 10^7~M_{\odot}$ but diffuse $\sim 10{\rm~pc}$.
Therefore, this FDM soliton can serve as a gravitational lens for gravitational
waves (GWs) with frequency $\sim10^{-8}{\rm~Hz}$. In this paper, we investigate
its gravitational lensing effects by numerical simulation of the propagation of
GWs through it. We find that the maximum magnification factor of GWs is very
small $\sim10^{-4}$, but the corresponding magnification zone is huge
$\sim6{\rm~pc}$ for FDM with mass equal to $8^{-21}\rm~{eV}/c^2$. Consequently,
this small magnification factor in that large magnification zone means a small
antisotropy of $\sim10^{-4}$ over a large solid angle in the GW background,
even though this antisotropy is out of the sensitivity of the pulsar timing
arrays today.

Motivation: 文章探讨了带有复标量场的黑洞动态阴影的演化，通过对复标量场随时间变化的分析，揭示了影子半径的变化规律及其与视界半径的关系，为黑洞动力学和阴影研究提供理论支持。

Method: 数值模拟法，通过求解演化方程计算了复标量场、视界半径、影子半径和光线传播时间等参数随时间的变化。

Result: 影子半径随时间先迅速增加然后减小，视界半径逐渐增大趋于稳定，且影子半径的变化受到复标量场的影响。当存在吸盘盘时，影子半径的变化与视界半径一致；而无吸盘盘时，影响因素是光球半径。

Conclusion: 该研究通过数值模拟揭示了带有复标量场的黑洞阴影动态演化规律，进一步验证了视界、影子半径和光线传播时间的变化关系，为黑洞动力学研究提供新视角。他并没有显式提到时间延迟，但光线传播延迟可能在影响观察效果。

Abstract: We research dynamic shadows of a black hole with a self-interacting massive
complex scalar hair. The complex scalar field $\psi$ evolves with time $t$,
whose magnitude on apparent horizon $|\psi_{h}|$ starts from zero, undergoes a
sharp rise followed by rapid oscillations, and eventually converges to a
constant value. The variation of the photon sphere radius $r_{ps}$ is similar
to that of the magnitude $|\psi_{h}|$. The emergence of the complex scalar hair
$\psi$ causes the apparent horizon radius $r_{h}$ to start increasing sharply,
and smoothly approaches a stable value eventually. The shadow radius $R_{sh}$
of the black hole with an accretion disk increases with $t_{o}$ the time at the
observer's position. In the absence of an accretion disk, the shadow radius
$R_{sh}$ is larger and also increases as $t_{o}$ increases. Furthermore, we
slice the dynamical spacetime into spacelike hypersurfaces for all time points
$t$. For the case with an accretion disk, the variation of $R_{sh}$ is similar
to that of the apparent horizon $r_{h}$, because the inner edge of the
accretion disk extends to the apparent horizon. In the absence of an accretion
disk, the variation of $R_{sh}$ is similar to that of the photon sphere
$r_{ps}$, because the black hole shadow boundary is determined by the photon
sphere. Since the variation of $r_{ps}$ is induced by $\psi$, it can be stated
that the variation in the size of the shadow is likewise caused by the change
of $\psi$. Regardless of the presence or absence of the accretion disk, the
emergence of the complex scalar hair $\psi$ causes the radius $R_{sh}$ of the
shadow to start changing. Moreover, we investigate the time delay $\Delta t$ of
lights propagating from light sources to observer. These findings not only
enrich the theoretical models of dynamic black hole shadows but also provide a
foundation for testing black hole spacetime dynamics.

Result: 结果包括局部存在性和唯一性证明，新的几何边值条件，这些条件下场的光滑性条件，以及示例分析。这提供了关于边界发射条件的新见解。

Conclusion: 这一研究为构造4维反商壁空间提供了理论框架和边界条件，可能会引导我们更深入地理解这些空间的几何和物理特性。这也有助于研究量子重力的边界行为。

Abstract: This article solves the initial boundary value problem for the vacuum
Einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant in dimension 4, giving
rise to asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces. We introduce a new family of
geometric reflective boundary conditions, which can be regarded as the
homogeneous Robin boundary conditions, involving both the conformal class and
the stress-energy tensor of the timelike conformal boundary. This family
includes as a special case the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition,
consisting of setting the boundary stress-energy tensor to zero. It also
agrees, in a limit case, with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition,
where one fixes a locally conformally flat conformal class on the boundary,
already covered in Friedrich's pioneering work of 1995.
  The proof of local existence and uniqueness for this family of boundary
conditions relies notably on Friedrich's framework and his extended conformal
Einstein equations. These are rewritten in a tensorial formalism, rather than a
spinorial one, as it facilitates the comparison with the Fefferman-Graham
expansion of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter metrics. Similarly to Friedrich's
proof, our geometric boundary conditions are eventually inferred from
gauge-dependent boundary conditions by means of an auxiliary system on the
conformal boundary.
  In addition, our analysis also comprises new necessary and sufficient
conditions for the unphysical fields associated to the initial data to be
smooth up to the conformal boundary. Finally, the paper contains examples of
asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces, with a focus on their conformal boundary
data. This provides valuable insight into the possible shapes of boundary
stress-energy tensors.

primordial matter in the post-inflation era. This matter does not depend on the
curvature parameter and is described by a stiff equation of state. It can have
the properties of spin matter, consisting of particles with a spin quantum
number (spin) s = 1/2. Such a matter can be plausibly identified with quark
matter at the early stage of the evolution of the universe.

TL;DR: The study from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration shows GW231123 originated from a binary black hole merger.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the nature of gravitational waves from binary black holes and their mergers is crucial, especially to confirm the origins of such events which could provide insights into cosmic phenomena.

Method: A Bayesian model comparison analysis was conducted to evaluate the probabilities of the signal arising from a binary black hole merger versus other sources like cosmic string cusps or kinks.

Result: The Bayesian analysis found strong evidence supporting the binary black hole merger as the source of GW231123, indicating a higher probability compared to other models.

Conclusion: This finding contributes to the confirmation of binary black hole mergers and reinforces the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA detection framework for future gravitational wave studies.

Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration recently reported an exceptional
gravitational-wave event, GW231123. This gravitational-wave signal was assumed
to be generated from the merger of a binary black hole system, with source
frame masses of $137^{+22}_{-17}~\textup{M}_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}~
\textup{M}_\odot$ (90\% credible intervals). As seen by the two LIGO detectors,
the signal has only $\sim 5$ cycles, between 30 and 80 Hz, over $\sim 10$ ms.
It is of critical importance to confirm the origin of this signal. Here we
present the results of a Bayesian model comparison to test whether the
gravitational-wave signal was actually generated by a binary black hole merger,
or emitted from cusps or kinks on a cosmic string. We find significant evidence
for a binary black hole merger origin of the signal.

Conclusion: 该研究通过自旋测量数据限制了超轻粒子的存在，为隐性物质领域提供了新的数据支撑。

Abstract: In the presence of an ultralight scalar or vector boson, a spinning black
hole will be spun down through the superradiant instability. We use spin
measurements from gravitational wave observations of binary black holes, in
particular the heavy binary black hole merger event GW231123, along with the
lower-mass GW190517 event, to constrain the existence of ultralight bosons. We
disfavor scalars with masses in the range of $[0.55, 11]\times 10^{-13}$ eV and
vectors in the range of $[0.11, 18]\times 10^{-13}$ eV, making only a
conservative assumption that the black hole lifetimes are greater than $10^5$
years. The lower ends of these ranges, where the exclusion confidence is the
highest, were not previously excluded by spin measurements from electromagnetic
or gravitational wave observations. We map these constraints to axion and dark
photon models with interactions.

Motivation: 研究引力系统中的相变和临界现象是理论物理和高能物理的重要方向，这次分析-black hole标度定律不仅扩展了现有知识，还揭示了黑洞相变的独特性质和潜在的对称破坏，这有助于深化我们对黑洞热力学的理解。

Method: 作者通过构建黑洞的自由能景观，研究其相变临界点的性质，特别关注常容热和临界指数的关系，用统计物理的方法分析这些现象。

Result: 在某些黑洞案例中，标度定律被违背，尤其是当常容热为零时，临界指数α无法由标度假设确定，而其他三个指数仍符合标度关系。这表明在这些情况下，相变的性质发生了根本变化，可能暗示物理系统的对称性被破坏。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了标度理论的应用范围，并揭示了黑洞相变的独特属性，未来可以进一步探索这些现象与黑洞信息问题的关系。

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the scaling laws in gravitational system from the
perspective of free energy landscape. It has been found that for some special
black holes, their critical exponents are beyond mean field theory, and more
surprisingly violate the scaling laws. We find that the main reason for the
violation of the scaling laws is that the heat capacity at constant volume for
these black holes is 0, so the critical exponent $\alpha$ is often treated as 0
and can not be derived from the scaling hypothesis while another three critical
exponents can. We also find that the strange critical exponents means there is
a symmetry violation in the order parameter.

Abstract: We employ an all-particle multireference Fock-space relativistic
coupled-cluster (FSRCC) theory to compute the ionization potential, excitation
energy, transition rate and hyperfine structure constants associated with
$7s^2\;^{1}S_{0}\rightarrow 7s7p\;^{3}P_{1}$ and $7s^2\;^{1}S_{0}\rightarrow
7s7p\;^1P_{1}$ transitions in nobelium (No). Using our state-of-the-art
calculations in conjunction with available experimental data \cite{raeder-18},
we extract the values of nuclear magnetic dipole ($\mu$) and electric
quadrupole ($Q$) moments for $^{253}$No. Further, information on nuclear
deformation in even-mass isotopes is extracted from the isotope shift
calculations. Moreover, we employ a perturbed relativistic coupled-cluster
(PRCC) theory to compute the ground state electric dipole polarizability of No.
In addition, to assess the accuracy of our calculations, we compute the
ionization potential and dipole polarizability of lighter homolog ytterbium
(Yb). To account for strong relativistic and quantum electrodynamical (QED)
effects in No, we incorporate the corrections from Breit interaction, vacuum
polarization and self-energy in our calculations. The contributions from triple
excitations in coupled-cluster is accounted perturbatively. Our calculations
reveal a significant contribution of $\approx$10\% from the perturbative
triples to the transition rate of $7s^2\;^1S_{0}\rightarrow 7s7p\;^3P_{1}$
transition. The largest cumulative contribution from Breit+QED is observed to
be $\approx$4\%, to the magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constant of
$7s7p\;^1P_{1}$ state. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of
atomic and nuclear properties of nobelium with valuable insights into the
electron correlation and relativistic effects in superheavy elements.

### [160] [Accelerating magnonic simulations with the pseudospectral Landau-Lifshitz equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19572)

TL;DR: 摘要：伪谱Landau-Lifshitz模型（PS-LL）通过使用一个卷积内核，可以在连续的框架内描述原子尺度的磁交换相互作用，其并不依赖网格结构。该模型不仅适用于描述原子交换，还可以适用于任何非局部内核。在磁子ics领域，磁子的色散关系依赖于磁偶极相互作用，后者具有长程。通常数值方法依赖卷积计算。这里展示了使用PS-LL模型通过解析解获得一个内核，并利用此模型进行磁子模拟，加速计算速度是原来计算的两倍。该方法在激发态是线性的情形下有效，通常用于磁子。结果是该方法为逆设计方法提供了加速，因为它需要进行多次模拟以获得预期结果。

Result: PS-LL模型通过解析解内核计算，减少了计算时间，速度比原来快一倍多。这意味着该方法在磁子ics领域的模拟中具有更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: 通过伪谱Landau-Lifshitz模型利用解析解内核的计算，磁子ics领域的模拟速度大大提升。这在进行磁子逆设计等需要大量计算的情况下，带来了显著的优势。因此，这种方法的引入对于提升磁子ics研究的速度和效率具有重要意义。

Abstract: The pseudospectral Landau-Lifshitz (PS-LL) model can describe atomic-scale
magnetic exchange interactions within a continuum framework. This is achieved
by employing a convolution kernel that models the nonlocal interaction in a
grid-independent manner. Even though the PS-LL was originally introduced to
address atomic exchange, any nonlocal kernel can be modeled. In the field of
magnonics, the dipole field is fundamental to describe the dispersion relation
of magnons, the quasiparticle representation of angular momentum. Because
dipole-dipole interactions are long-range, numerical approaches typically rely
on convolutions. Here, we demonstrate that the PS-LL model can be used to
perform magnonic simulations with a single convolution kernel derived from
analytical solutions. We demonstrate a twofold increase in computational speed
compared with the full dipole calculation. This approach is valid insofar as
the excitations are linear, which is typically the case for magnons. Our
results have the potential to accelerate magnonic research, particularly for
the inverse design method, where several simulations must be performed to
achieve the desired outcome.

Abstract: Ferromagnetic topological insulators in the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH)
regime host chiral, dissipationless edge states whose propagation direction is
determined by the internal magnetization. Under suitable conditions, a strong
electrical bias can induce magnetization reversal, and thus flip the
propagation direction. In this work, we perform time-resolved measurements to
investigate the switching dynamics. Our results reveal characteristics
consistent with a disordered magnetic landscape and demonstrate that the
reversal process is thermally activated, driven by Joule heating during the
current pulse. The understanding of the magnetization dynamics in QAH systems
opens pathways for local, controlled manipulation of chiral edge states via
thermal effects.

Abstract: A radical restructuring of the optical response of highly excited
electron-hole plasma formed in a mesoscopic GaAs/AlGaAs channel in a quantizing
magnetic field when an electric current flows in the channel has been
discovered. In the absence of current, the emission spectra are caused by
transitions between Landau levels formed in the conduction band and in the
valence band of heavy holes. A critical electric current leads to a drastic
change in the emission spectra with a predominant contribution from light
holes. It is shown that the current causes local accumulation of light holes
due to Coulomb drag, which leads to strong electron-hole coupling and, as a
consequence, the formation of excitons and trions.

Abstract: The engineering of acoustic phonons in the gigahertz (GHz) range holds
significant potential for technological breakthroughs in areas such as data
processing, sensing and quantum communication. Novel approaches for
nanophononic resonators responsive to external stimuli provide additional
control and functionality for these devices. Mesoporous thin films (MTFs) for
example, featuring nanoscale ordered pores, support GHz-range acoustic
resonances. These materials are sensitive to environmental changes, such as
liquid and vapor infiltration, modifying their effective optical and elastic
properties. Here, a SiO$_{2}$ MTF-based open-cavity nanoacoustic resonator is
presented, in which the MTF forms the topmost layer and is exposed to the
environment. Using a transient reflectivity setup, acoustic responses under
varying humidity conditions are investigated. A pronounced shift in acoustic
resonance frequency with changes in relative humidity is observed for the first
time, demonstrating a simple way to tune hypersound confinement. In addition,
resonators with varying pore sizes and thicknesses are compared, revealing that
resonance frequencies are primarily influenced by material properties and film
thickness, rather than pore size. The proposed open-cavity resonator design
provides a versatile platform for future studies on the mechanical response of
MTFs to liquid and vapor infiltration, opening the gate to
environment-responsive hypersound devices.

Abstract: The dynamics of vortex states in confined geometries like thin-film disks are
characterized by a sub-GHz gyration, representing the damped oscillatory motion
of the vortex core about the disk center. It has recently been shown that
interactions between the core and azimuthal spin waves, lying in the GHz range
and driven by magnetic fields, can result in steady-state core gyration. The
gyration in turn provides a time-periodic modulation for the spin waves,
resulting in the emergence of Floquet states. Here, we present results of a
theoretical and computational study in which we examine how Floquet modes
sustain this core gyration. In particular, we find that multiple steady-state
gyration radii are possible under certain field conditions, resulting from the
nonlinear interactions between the core and Floquet modes. Different gyration
radii result in distinct Floquet frequency comb spectra and allow for
hysteretic effects, as reported in recent experiments.

tight-binding model based off the Kane-Mele Hamiltonian. Device implementations
are shown for a range of non-trivial configurations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modular architecture for time-bin encoded qubits in quantum Hall edge channels, enabling a scalable electronic quantum platform. Encoding uses temporally separated EMP wave packets to eliminate spatial separation and enhance coherence. The platform supports various qubit operations, including initialization, phase modulation, readout, and entangling gates, via dynamic control mechanisms and maintains waveform integrity. Coherence is discussed in terms of single-electron sources and Coulomb interactions, while addressing readout methods for single qubits and strategies for multi-qubit operations such as synchronized injection and engineered interactions.


<details>

Abstract: We present the basic elements for a modular architecture for time-bin encoded
qubits based on quantum Hall edge channels, forming the foundation of a
scalable electronic quantum information platform named TEMPO (Time-binned
Electronic Modular Platform for Qubits). Quantum states are encoded in
temporally separated edge magnetoplasmon (EMP) wave packets propagating along a
single chiral edge, eliminating the need for spatial path separation and
enhancing coherence. The platform supports full qubit

EMP propagation and describe strategies for maintaining waveform integrity.
Various single-electron sources, including ohmic injection and capacitive
excitation, are discussed in the context of coherence. Multi-qubit operations
are enabled through synchronized injection and engineered Coulomb interactions
between adjacent channels, while single-qubit readout is addressed via
spin-based or capacitive charge sensors. Our approach integrates gate-tunable
coherent control of chiral edge states, offering a comprehensive pathway toward
scalable electron quantum optics in solid-state platforms.

*Robert Alicki*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper challenges the noniteracting electrons model and proposes that 2-body electrostatic interactions are crucial for electron transport. It argues that the model is insufficient for passive transport and generation of electromotive force and suggests modifications to existing formulas. It also discusses active transport as a pump mechanism powered by external energy sources. For more details, refer to the full paper.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper discusses fundamental aspects of electron transport theory, aiming to correct outdated models that are still used in analyses of mesoscopic systems.

Method: The theoretical basis is revisited using Landauer theory, Master equations, and Onsager's thermodynamics. The paper analyzes the noniteracting model's limitations and modifies passive transport formulas by considering electrostatic interactions.

Result: The paper concludes that the noniteracting model is insufficient for passive transport and electromotive force generation, emphasizing the role of 2-body electrostatic interactions. Active transport can be achieved through self-oscillating double layers powered by external energy sources.

Conclusion: The paper proposes modifications to traditional transport models, highlighting the importance of electrostatic interactions and the potential for active transport through self-driven double layers powered by external energy sources.

Abstract: Theoretical foundations of electron transport in mesoscopic systems, based on
Landauer theory, Master equations or Onsager linear thermodynamics, are
revisited to show that the noniteracting electrons model is insufficient to
describe neither passive transport, nor generation of electromotive force
(active transport). It is argued that 2-body electrostatic interactions
creating double layers and surface charge distributions are crucial for the
electron transport through a junction. Phenomenological modifications of the
passive transport formulas based on the carefull analysis of the fundamental
notions of chemical, electrostatic, electrochemical, build-in potentials, band
bending and bias voltage, are proposed. On the other hand active transport can
be generated by a self-oscillating double layer (a pump ) driven by an external
heat, light or chemical energy source.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots are a promising platform for generating single and
entangled photons.Still, their use is limited even in the most advanced
structures by changes in the charge state of the quantum dot and its
environment. Here, we present detailed time-resolved resonance fluorescence
measurements on a single charge-tunable GaAs quantum dot, shedding new light on
the spectral shadows invoked by the complex impurity environment.
Detuning-dependent measurements reveal the existence of multiple Stark-shifted
resonances, which are associated with rare spectral jumps smaller than the
homogeneous linewidth and, therefore, typically concealed in the measurement
noise. We observe similar environmentally induced Stark shifts for both the
neutral exciton and negatively charged trion transitions, while the positively
and doubly negatively charged trions exhibit significant differences. Our
investigation quantifies the underlying impurity charge dynamics over a range
from well below milliseconds to seconds, revealing that the hole occupation of
the positively charged trion transition is constrained by rapid hole loss and
slow hole recapture dynamics. Utilizing a second non-resonant laser, we
increase the hole occupancy by over an order of magnitude and identify both a
prolonged hole residence time and an enhanced hole tunneling rate into the
quantum dot. These findings are supported by complementary spin noise
spectroscopy measurements, which offer a significantly higher bandwidth
compared to the time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在 Bulky gating 下，应用垂直外加电压可以显著控制和调节电子隧道效应，特别是在低能区。外加电势裂解的能隙从而产生大幅的反射，同时在不同转角和能隙下，电子的出射方向和极ron分布表现出很强的不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Twisted bilayer graphene 的两层间具有可调参数，其调制效应和奇特的能隙特性吸引了大量研究。智能调制Bulky gating能有效调控 Landau level 能隙，这一特性与强烈的 Berry 相位效应和电子极化特性相关。研究外加电压对电子隧道效应的影响，特别是极性间隙调节和极性对称性的打破，可以使我们更好地理解材料中的施加电场效应及其在不同角度和能量的传播特性。

Method: 通过构建带有相互垂直控制的双层栅阵模型，分别调节载流子密度和层间电压差，计算不同转角、能量和电压下的传输和反射概率。

Result: 在带有垂直外加电压的情况下，电子的正常入射传输被抑制，形成能隙；载流子间迁移依赖于转角和能隙。建立在垂直外加电压下，系统外加势能可以打破有效反转对称性，导致极性相关的大不均匀和方向相关性。应用不同的入射角度会带来显著的传输变化，尤其是在不同转角和能隙下的极性对称性打破较为明显。

Conclusion: 在 Bulky gating 下应用垂直外加电压可以有效地调控电子在 TBLG 中的隧道效应，特别是在低能区。通过控制外加电压的大小，可以有效调节传输和反射概率，这对设计和实现新异构型电子极性材料和异质结构电子学器件具有重要参考价值。

Abstract: In twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG), chiral tunneling can be tuned by
parameters such as the twist angle, barrier height, and Fermi energy. This
differs from the tunneling behavior observed in monolayer and Bernal bilayer
graphene, where electrons either pass completely through or are fully blocked
due to the Klein paradox. Here we investigate the effect of a perpendicular
interlayer bias on electron tunneling through electrostatic barriers in TBLG.
Using a dual-gated model, which controls the carrier density and interlayer
potential difference independently, we compute the transmission and reflection
probabilities of electrons at different angles and energies for representative
twist angles of $\theta = 1.8^{\circ}$, $3.89^{\circ}$, and $9.43^{\circ}$. We
find that a moderate bias suppresses normal-incidence transmission by opening a
band gap in the low-energy spectrum. Our results show this leads to near-total
reflection at low energy, with transmission starting to increase just above the
gap due to twist-dependent conducting channels. The applied bias breaks the
system's effective inversion symmetry, resulting in pronounced
direction-dependent and valley-specific asymmetries in the angular distribution
of transmitted electrons. We show that electrons incident at different angles
show notable variations in transmission under bias. Furthermore, interlayer
bias modulates Fabry--P\'{e}rot--like resonances in the TBLG barrier, shifting
the energies of transmission peaks and altering their intensity.

Abstract: We propose using Andreev bound states (ABS) as spectroscopic probes to
characterize Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in quantum-dot based minimal Kitaev
chains. Specifically, we show that tunneling conductance measurements with a
superconducting probe hosting an ABS reveal four subgap peaks whose voltage
positions and relative heights enable extraction of the MZM energy splitting
and Bogoliubov-de Gennes coherence factors. This provides direct access to
zero-splitting regimes and to the local Majorana polarization - a measure of
the Majorana character. The method is compatible with existing experimental
architectures and remains robust in extended chains.

Motivation: Understanding optical nonlinearities in hybrid systems is crucial for advancing optoelectronic devices, which likely impacts quantum computing and communication technologies.

Method:  ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy on a 1L WS2 layer coupled to a plasmonic nanostructure.

Result: Significant polarization-dependent optical nonlinearity observed, with ultrafast evolution of 2DES spectra and coherent polariton dynamics.

Conclusion: This suggests the potential of coherent polaritons for all-optical switching, providing new insights into optoelectronic device performance.

Abstract: Exciton polaritons based on atomically thin semiconductors are essential
building blocks of quantum optoelectronic devices. Their properties are
governed by an ultrafast and oscillatory energy transfer between their
excitonic and photonic constituents, resulting in the formation of polaritonic
quasiparticles with pronounced nonlinearities induced by the excitonic
component. In metallic nanoresonators, dissipation phenomena limit the
polariton lifetime to a few ten femtoseconds, so short that the role of these
polaritons for the nonlinearities of such hybrids is yet unexplored. Here, we
use ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to uncover
coherent polariton dynamics in a hybrid monolayer (1L) WS2/plasmonic
nanostructure. With respect to an uncoupled WS2 flake, we observe an over
20-fold, polarization-dependent enhancement of the optical nonlinearity and a
rapid evolution of the 2DES spectra within ~70 fs. We relate these dynamics to
a transition from coherent polaritons to incoherent excitations, unravel the
microscopic optical nonlinearities, and show the potential of coherent
polaritons for ultrafast all-optical switching.

Motivation: Understanding the effects of material alignment on correlated phases is crucial for advancing moiré physics and device applications.

Method: Low-temperature transport measurements and scanning SQUID-on-tip magnetometry were used to compare devices with different alignment orientations.

Result: The study revealed a significant difference in moiré potential strengths between the two orientations, which can be explained by lattice relaxation and the electronic structure of the graphene layers.

Conclusion: Aligning hBN at 0° or 180° relative to the graphene significantly affects moiré effects, establishing alignment orientation as a critical parameter in moiré-engineered systems.

Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene hosts a rich landscape of correlated
symmetry-broken phases, driven by strong interactions from its flat band edges.
Aligning to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) creates a moir\'e pattern, leading to
recent observations of exotic ground states such as integer and fractional
quantum anomalous Hall effects. Here, we show that the moir\'e effects and
resulting correlated phase diagrams are critically influenced by a previously
underestimated structural choice: the hBN alignment orientation. This binary
parameter distinguishes between configurations where the rhombohedral graphene
and hBN lattices are aligned near 0{\deg} or 180{\deg}, a distinction that
arises only because both materials break inversion symmetry. Although the two
orientations produce the same moir\'e wavelength, we find their distinct local
stacking configurations result in markedly different moir\'e potential
strengths. Using low-temperature transport and scanning SQUID-on-tip
magnetometry, we compare nearly identical devices that differ only in alignment
orientation and observe sharply contrasting sequences of symmetry-broken
states. Theoretical analysis reveals a simple mechanism based on lattice
relaxation and the atomic-scale electronic structure of rhombohedral graphene,
supported by detailed modeling. These findings establish hBN alignment
orientation as a key control parameter in moir\'e-engineered graphene systems
and provide a framework for interpreting both prior and future experiments.

Abstract: We present a transparent and analytically tractable approach to the problem
of time-dependent electron transport through tunneling barriers. Using the
Single-Electron Approach, we study a model system composed of a time-dependent
tunneling barrier coupled to two reservoirs of finite bandwidth. Avoiding
Floquet expansions, we derive simple expressions for the time-dependent
tunneling current in both adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes. Our formulation,
based on the tunneling Hamiltonian framework, relates barrier modulation to
measurable phase shifts in the steady-state current, offering a physically
intuitive definition of the tunneling (or traversal) time. Remarkably, in the
Markovian limit (wide-band reservoirs), we recover the well-known result of
vanishing tunneling time. In contrast, for finite-bandwidth leads, we predict a
finite time delay given by the inverse bandwidth. Our findings provide a robust
foundation for understanding tunneling dynamics in non-Markovian environments
and may serve as a benchmark for experimental investigations involving tunable
band structures.

*Miguel Sánchez Sánchez,Tobias Stauber*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper evaluates a projection method for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, showing accurate results even when symmetry is broken. They use order parameters to study both flat and non-flat bands and find the method reliable for understanding correlated phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The search for new materials in exfoliable 2D systems continues, and graphene derivatives like MATBG are promising. To study their electronic properties, especially in different phases, having accurate methods is crucial. This paper addresses this by evaluating a projection method, which is a practical contribution for researchers in the field.

Method: The study involves comparing the projection method with full tight-binding models. They analyze band structures, total energies, and symmetry-breaking phases. Real-space visualizations of wave functions are employed using new order parameters, which helps in quantifying symmetry violations in correlated phases.

Result: The projection method’s results closely match the full models, showing minimal energy differences and validating its use. Additionally, the order parameters effectively highlight the wave function structure and symmetry breaking in different states, aiding in understanding these phases.

Conclusion: This work not only validates the projection method’s effectiveness but also provides a framework for probing symmetry and structural phase transitions in graphitic materials, making it a valuable tool for both experimental and theoretical studies of MATBG and similar systems.

Abstract: We benchmark the recently proposed projection method [Phys. Rev. B 111,
205133 (2025)] for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) across various
symmetry-breaking phases at charge neutrality. The flat-band projected
solutions agree well with the full tight-binding, with band structures and
total energies differing by only a few meV. The projection to the flat bands is
justified, owing to the increased gap to the remote bands in the normal state.
Moreover, we employ a novel set of order parameters that allow us to visualize
the wave functions locally in real space and quantify the breaking of various
symmetries in the correlated phases. These order parameters are suitable to
characterize MATBG and generic honeycomb systems.

Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), particularly at half-filling of
Landau levels, provides a unique window into topological phases hosting
non-Abelian excitations. However, experimental platforms simultaneously
offering large energy gaps, delicate tunability, and robust non-Abelian
signatures remain scarce. Here, we report the observation of a cascade of
even-denominator FQH states at filling factors ${\nu}$ = ${-5/2}$, ${-7/2}$,
${-9/2}$, ${-11/2}$, and ${-13/2}$, alongside numerous odd-denominator states
in mixed-stacked pentalayer graphene, a previously unexplored system
characterized by intertwined quadratic and cubic band dispersions. These
even-denominator states, representing the highest filling half-filled states
reported so far in the zeroth Landau level (ZLL), emerge from two distinct
intra-ZLL and exhibit unprecedented displacement field tunability driven by LL
crossings in the hybridized multiband structure. At half fillings, continuous
quasiparticle phase transitions between paired FQH states, magnetic Bloch
states, and composite Fermi liquids are clearly identified upon tuning external
fields. Numerical calculations, revealing characteristic sixfold ground-state
degeneracy and chiral graviton spectral analysis, suggest the observed
even-denominator FQH states belong to the non-Abelian Moore-Read type. These
results establish mixed-stacked multilayer graphene as a rich and versatile
crystalline platform for exploring tunable correlated topological phases.

Conclusion: 该方法为研究 Quasiparticles 的局部性质提供了新的工具。

Abstract: The coherence factors of quasiparticles in a superconductor determine their
properties, including transport and susceptibility to electric fields. In this
work, we propose a way to infer the local coherence factors using local
transport to normal leads. Our method is based on measuring the local current
through a lead as the coupling to a second one is varied: the shape of the
current is determined by the ratio between the local coherence factors,
becoming independent of the coupling to the second lead in the presence of
local electron-hole symmetry, {\it i.e.} coherence factors $|u|=|v|$. We apply
our method to minimal Kitaev chains: arrays of quantum dots coupled via narrow
superconducting segments. These chains feature Majorana-like quasiparticles
(zero-energy states with $|u|=|v|$) at discrete points in parameter space. We
demonstrate that the local current allows us to estimate the local Majorana
polarization (MP) -- a measurement of the local Majorana properties of the
state. We derive an analytical expression for the MP in terms of local currents
and benchmark it against numerical calculations for 2- and 3-sites chains that
include a finite Zeeman field and electron-electron interactions. These results
provide a way to quantitatively assess the quality of Majorana states in short
Kitaev chains.

### [177] [Theory of off-diagonal disorder in multilayer topological insulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20713)
*Z. Z. Alisultanov,A. Kudlis*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper discusses the effects of off-diagonal disorder on multilayer topological insulators, analyzing how it alters the system's properties and phase transitions. It introduces a bound state marker for topology and examines the impact on edge modes and localization. The study finds that off-diagonal disorder modifies the system's behavior, particularly in strong versus weak disorder conditions, with implications for experimental observations like quantum Hall plateaus and conductance anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of topological insulators under disorder is crucial for understanding how these materials behave in realistic conditions. This paper contributes by specifically examining off-diagonal disorder, providing insights into topology detection, phase transitions, and edge mode effects, which are all essential for both fundamental research and potential applications in quantum technologies.

Method: The authors use two complementary diagrammatic approaches to analyze the density of states for different quantum phases: normal, topological, Weyl, and anomalous quantum Hall. They model the system within the Burkov-Balents framework, considering both Hermitian and non-Hermitian defects, and simulate the effects of disorder using Gaussian and Lorentzian distributions to study edge mode localization.

Result: The results show that off-diagonal disorder introduces bulk states into the gap and can close it under certain conditions. The Weyl phase is robust against strong disorder, while the anomalous quantum Hall effect is only stable for weak disorder. The study also reveals that in Gaussian disorder, edges can become delocalized, increasing their conductance beyond quantized values and affecting edge currents. Diagrammatic methods confirm the topological phase transitions and the presence of bound states following defect introduction.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that off-diagonal disorder significantly affects the properties of multilayer topological insulators. The introduced bound state marker serves as a robust tool for topology detection in these systems. The study's comprehensive approach using diagrammatic methods validates the expected phase transitions and provides a deeper understanding of how disorder influences edge modes and localization, offering guidance for both theoretical models and experimental setups aimed at observing topological materials under realistic conditions with disorder.

Abstract: We study multilayer topological insulators with random interlayer tunnelling,
known as off-diagonal disorder. Within the Burkov-Balents model a single
Hermitian defect creates a bound state whose energy crosses the middle of the
gap in the trivial phase but never in the topological phase; a non-Hermitian
defect splits this level yet preserves the same crossing rule, so the effect
serves as a local marker of topology. However, the key distinction persists:
the bound state crosses zero in the trivial phase but not in the topological
phase. Two complementary diagrammatic approaches give matching densities of
states for the normal, topological, Weyl and anomalous quantum Hall regimes.
Off diagonal disorder inserts bulk states into the gap and can close it: the
Weyl phase remains robust under strong disorder, whereas the anomalous quantum
Hall phase survives only for weak fluctuations, and the added bulk states
shrink the Hall plateau, clarifying experimental deviations. Finally, we
analyse edge modes. Uniform disorder shortens their localization length
slightly, while Gaussian and Lorentzian disorder enlarge it and in the Gaussian
case can even delocalize the edges. Although chirality is maintained, the
enhanced overlap permits tunnelling between opposite edges and pulls the
longitudinal conductance away from its quantized value.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that chiral ionic liquids can be used to control magnetic properties in FeSi thin films through electric double-layer transistors, distinguishing between electric field and electric double-layer gating mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is driven by the goal to explore innovative methods for controlling magnetic behavior in materials, which has implications for spintronics and material design.

Method: Chiral ionic liquids are employed in an electric double-layer transistor setup to gate FeSi films, examining the effects of both achiral and chiral conditions on magnetic responses.

Result: Chiral ionic gating exhibits a handedness-dependent control over magnetized domain ratios, while both gating methods affect properties like anomalous Hall conductivity.

Conclusion: Chiral ion gating provides a promising approach for precise manipulation of magnetic ordering, highlighting the role of chirality in spintronic applications.

Abstract: Chiral molecular systems offer unique pathways to control spin and magnetism
beyond conventional symmetry operations. Here, we demonstrate that chiral ionic
liquids enable electric-field modulation of two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism
in FeSi(111) thin films via electric double-layer transistor (EDLT) gating.
FeSi hosts chemically-stable, surface-confined ferromagnetism without bulk
moments, making the interfacial spins highly responsive to chiral-ion
adsorption. Using both achiral and chiral ionic liquids, we systematically
compare electrochemical and electrostatic gating effects. While both gating
modes modulate magnetic properties such as anomalous Hall conductivity and
coercive field, only chiral ionic gating biases the ratio of up- and
down-magnetized domains in a handedness-dependent manner, evidencing
chirality-induced symmetry breaking. This work establishes chiral ion gating as
a novel strategy for controlling magnetic order and opens new directions for
chiral spintronics.

Abstract: The spatially resolved near-field radiative heat transfer between a nanoscale
probe and a substrate is studied in the fluctuational electrodynamics framework
within the dipolar approximation. It is shown that the introduction of a thin
polar film atop a non-dispersive substrate can lead to both an enhancement and
a lateral focusing of the heat exchange. The influence of the probe--substrate
separation, film thickness and substrate permittivity is analyzed, revealing
that the effect originates from near-field interactions governed by the
interplay between film-induced modifications of electromagnetic mode dispersion
and the distance-dependent coupling strength. The results highlight a viable
route toward the active control of local radiative heat transfer at the
nanoscale.

Abstract: We study the interplay between strong correlations and Markovian dephasing,
resulting from monitoring the charge or spin degrees of freedom of a quantum
dot described by a dissipative Anderson impurity model. Using the Auxiliary
master equation approach we compute the steady-state spectral function and
occupation of the dot and discuss the role of dephasing on Kondo physics.
Furthermore, we consider a two-lead setup which allows to compute the
steady-state current and conductance. We show that the Kondo steady-state is
robust to moderate charge dephasing but not to spin dephasing, which we
interpret in terms of dephasing-induced heating of low-energy excitations.
Finally, we show universal scaling collapse of the non-linear conductance with
a dephasing-dependent Kondo scale.

Conclusion: 临界NHSE特殊非摄动特性，GBZ理论在有限尺寸和边界效应的捕捉上有局限性，需要同时考虑 bulk和边界动态。

Abstract: We study the Green's functions in non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the
critical non-Hermitian skin effect (critical NHSE) using a double-chain
Hatano-Nelson model with inter-chain coupling $\Delta$. For $\Delta=0$, the
system decouples into two independent chains, and the Green's functions follow
predictable patterns based on the GBZ theory. For small $\Delta$
($\Delta=1/10000$), in conventional regions with trivial OBC spectral winding
numbers, inter-chain coupling induces a zigzag scaling structure in Green's
functions due to competition between the two chains, explainable by first-order
perturbation theory. In anomalous regions with non-trivial winding numbers,
Green's functions match GBZ predictions in the bulk but diverge near
boundaries, with residual contributions from the $\Delta=0$ GBZ accounting for
the deviations. These results reveal the unique non-perturbative features of
critical NHSE and highlight the limitations of GBZ theory in capturing
finite-size and boundary effects, emphasizing the need to consider both bulk
and boundary dynamics in such systems.

Abstract: Morphoelasticity represents a foundational theory for tracing back growth,
remodelling, and morphogenesis, yet crucial challenges persist. A unified
growth law -- independent of a priori assumptions about constitutive relations
or specified structures of the growth tensor -- remains in fact elusive, as
does an intimate connection between local anisotropic growth, morphogenesis
dynamics, diffusion phenomena and mechanics. When anisotropy of growth is not
prescribed arbitrarily, current frameworks mainly attribute shape emergence to
growth-induced global configurational switches, somehow neglecting the
existence of local drivers of spontaneous patterning or distorsions also in
stress-free conditions. To overcome these limitations, in this work we propose
a theoretical approach that reformulates anisotropic growth, remodeling, and
morphogenesis starting from first principles, grounded in mass balance. In
particular, by positing mass conservation as the sole dynamic constraint for
the growth problem, we generalize the mass balance equation to derive evolution
laws for mass distribution and geometric reconfiguration. This reveals how mass
transport and associated microstructural evolution of the tissue fabric
synergistically guide biological, geometric, and constitutive changes of living
matter, with the isochoric component of growth orchestrating local anisotropy
and, at the macroscale, even spontaneous shape development. The proposed fully
coupled modelling approach integrates chemo-mechanical and biological
interactions inherent to living systems, offering a pathway to investigate
complex scenarios in growth and morphogenesis, redefining the latter in a
Continuum Mechanics framework. It is felt that this strategy could help to take
a step forward a unified perspective for biomechanical and mechanobiological
problems, bridging scales from local drivers to emergent tissue forms and
shapes.

Abstract: We propose cyclotron resonance as an optical probe for emergent
fractionalized excitations in $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum spin liquids, focusing on
kagome antiferromagnets. In contrast to conventional systems, where cyclotron
resonance directly couples to charged carriers, spinons in spin liquids are
charge-neutral and interact only through an emergent gauge field. We identify
two key mechanisms by which an external physical electromagnetic field induces
emergent electric and magnetic fields, enabling indirect coupling to spinons.
Using these mechanisms, we compute the absorption rate of the cyclotron
resonance response for Dirac spinons forming Landau levels. Our analysis shows
that, although the absorption per layer is small, the absence of a skin-depth
limitation in insulating spin liquids allows for cumulative absorption
comparable to graphene in realistic sample sizes for the recently discovered
spin-liquid candidate material
YCu${}_3$(OH)${}_6$Br${}_2$[Br${}_{1-y}$(OH)${}_y$]. Our findings shows that
cyclotron resonance is a viable experimental probe of spinon Landau
quantization and emergent gauge fields, providing powerful positive
experimental signatures of quantum spin liquids.

Abstract: Gauge theories compose a large class of interacting conformal field theories
in 3d, among which an outstanding category is critical Chern-Simons-matter
theories. In this paper, we focus on one of the simplest instances: one complex
critical scalar coupled to $\mathrm{U}(1)_2$ Chern-Simons gauge field. It is
theoretically interesting as it is conjectured to exhibit dualities between
four simple Lagrangian descriptions, but also practically important as it
describes the transition between Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (or
$\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state) and trivially gapped phase. Using the fuzzy
sphere regularisation, we realise this theory as a transition on the spherical
lowest Landau level between a $\nu_f=2$ fermionic integer quantum Hall state
and a $\nu_b=1/2$ bosonic fractional quantum Hall state. We show that this
transition is continuous and has emergent conformal symmetry. By studying the
operator spectrum, we show that there exists only one relevant singlet with
scaling dimension $\Delta_S=1.52(18)$. We also discuss other higher operators
and the consequences of our results.

Abstract: Localized orbital-based quantum embedding, as originally formulated in the
context of density matrix embedding theory (DMET), is revisited from the
perspective of lattice density functional theory (DFT). An in-principle exact
(in the sense of full configuration interaction) formulation of the theory,
where the occupations of the localized orbitals play the role of the density,
is derived for any (model or ab initio) electronic Hamiltonian. From this
general formalism we deduce an exact relation between the local
Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential of the full-size Kohn-Sham (KS)
lattice-like system and the embedding chemical potential that is adjusted on
each embedded fragment, individually, such that both KS and embedding cluster
systems reproduce the exact same local density. When well-identified
density-functional approximations (that find their justification in the
strongly correlated regime) are applied, a practical self-consistent local
potential functional embedding theory (LPFET), where the local Hxc potential
becomes the basic variable, naturally emerges from the theory. LPFET differs
from previous density embedding approaches by its fragment-dependent embedding
chemical potential expression, which is a simple functional of the Hxc
potential. Numerical calculations on prototypical systems show the ability of
such an ansatz to ease convergence and improve substantially the description of
density profiles (localized orbital occupations in this context) in strongly
correlated systems.

Abstract: The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equations are widely used to study spin
dynamics in Mott insulators. However, because energy dissipation is typically
introduced phenomenologically, its validity for describing nonequilibrium
processes and long-time dynamics in real materials remains questionable. In
this paper, we derive a generalized stochastic LLG equation from first
principles for spin-orbital coupled Mott insulators, explicitly incorporating
the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and lattice vibrations. Our
approach is based on the path-integral formalism formulated along the Keldysh
contour, which naturally accounts for dissipation and thermal fluctuations
through interactions with a phonon bath and emergent stochastic noise. We
benchmark our theoretical framework by numerically integrating the equations of
motion for a two-orbital spin chain coupled to Einstein phonons. The resulting
energy relaxation mimics realistic cooling dynamics, exhibits nontrivial
transient behavior during thermalization, and accurately reproduces
thermodynamic properties upon equilibration. This demonstrates the robustness
and reliability of our formalism for capturing both equilibrium and
nonequilibrium aspects of dissipative spin dynamics in strongly correlated
systems. We further show how electron-phonon coupling induces hybridization
between electronic and phononic modes in the excitation spectrum. Finally, we
demonstrate how the conventional LLG equations can be recovered as a limiting
case of our microscopic theory, and discuss their applicability to real
materials.

TL;DR: The paper discusses Cs₂RuO₄, a 4d metal frustrated magnet in the Cs₂MX₄ family. It presents thermodynamic, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering data. The study reveals a quantum critical point with a continuous spin-flop transition. A magnetic model Hamiltonian is derived, emphasizing significant magnetic anisotropy frustration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on a unique frustrated magnet system, which is underexplored. It's of interest to the field of condensed matter physics due to its potential implications for spintronics and quantum critical phenomena.

Method: The researchers used thermodynamic measurements, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering to analyze Cs₂RuO₄. Magneto-thermal effects and magnetic field dependencies were analyzed. A model Hamiltonian was extracted by analyzing the magnetic excitation spectrum.

Result: The study identifies a quantum critical point and explains the spin-flop phase transition through magnetic frustration. The model aligns well with experimental data and offers a new perspective on frustrated magnetism.

Conclusion: This work opens up new avenues for understanding high-dimensional frustrated magnetism, which is relevant to spintronics and quantum information processing. It also raises questions about the design of materials with controllable quantum criticality.

Abstract: We report thermodynamic, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron
scattering measurements on Cs$_2$RuO$_4$, a member of the celebrated family of
frustrated magnets Cs$_2$MX$_4$ (M = Cu, Co, X = Br, Cl). Unlike the previously
studied members, it is based on $4d$ transition metal ions with $S=1$. Mapping
out the $H-T$ magnetic phase diagram reveals an unusual continuous
spin-flop-like phase transition associated with a quantum critical point within
the antiferromagnetically ordered phase. A quantitative analysis of the complex
magnetic excitation spectrum measured in zero field allows us to derive a model
magnetic Hamiltonian for this compound. Its main feature is a frustration of
magnetic anisotropy on a level that is much higher than in any of the
previously studied species. This frustration naturally explains the peculiar
phase transition observed.

Abstract: We explore the quench dynamics of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian systems by
utilizing the biorthogonal formalism. We analyze quench dynamics of observable
quantities, the quantum geometric tensor, and various entanglement quantities,
including the entanglement entropy, the SVD entropy, and the Tu-Tzeng-Chang
entropy. Our results show that a sudden quench into a PT-broken phase generally
leads to exponential growth in these quantities, driven by the biorthogonal
density matrix's non-positivity. In contrast to generic interacting systems, we
observe a surprising linear decay in the TTC entropy for non-interacting
fermionic systems. This finding originates from the approximate spectral
symmetry of the biorthogonal reduced density matrix, and we confirm our
findings using the Yang-Lee and non-Hermitian XXZ models.

Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of the transverse field Ising
chain (TFIC) using time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (tr-RIXS)
in a pump-probe setup within a condensed matter setting. The tr-RIXS spectra
reveal distinctive features, including two-kink continua at high energies and
oscillatory spectral weight at low energies, both strongly influenced by the
pump dynamics. By systematically analyzing the nonequilibrium tr-RIXS cross
section under various pump configurations, we demonstrate how the spectra
encode detailed information about the system's transient states, capturing
instantaneous Hamiltonian parameters and the traversal of equilibrium quantum
critical points during dynamic evolution. Notably, we uncover a one-to-one
correspondence between oscillatory features in the low-energy spectra and
dynamical quantum phase transitions, offering a novel and experimentally
accessible approach for their detection. These findings highlight the
versatility of tr-RIXS as a powerful tool for studying quantum systems far from
equilibrium and their critical phenomena.

Motivation: 为了理解Kagome结构下自旋二分之一Heisenberg模型的量子磁性现象，特别是低磁化率时的有序态，作者进行了一系列的理论研究。

Method: 采用了变分有 resonating valence bond（RVB） 态的方法和优化算法来模拟模型，分析了多个磁化率下的现象。

Result: 在m=1/9时，模型出现了一个3×3周期的VBC态，具有独特的风车形结构模式，与其他先前的VBC和李颜色环流体态相比，具有更低的能量。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持3×3周期的VBC态在m=1/9时的出现，并支持模型在所有磁化率下的强不均匀性现象。

Abstract: Numerical simulations find that there are multiple plateaus in the
magnetization curve of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kagome antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg model(KAFH) at fractional magnetization $m=1/9,1/3,5/9,7/9$. While
it is well known that the $m=1/3,5/9,7/9$ plateau feature a
$\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ valence bond crystal(VBC) ordering pattern with a
David-star-shaped motif, the origin of the narrow plateau at $m=1/9$ remains
elusive. Some researchers claim that a subtle translational symmetry breaking
pattern with the same $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ periodicity occurs at the
$m=1/9$ plateau. On the other hand, it has also been argued that the $m=1/9$
plateau may harbor a novel $Z_{3}$ chiral spin liquid phase. To resolve this
controversy, we have proposed the most general variational ansatz based on the
resonating valence bond(RVB) picture that is consistent with the spin symmetry
of the system and developed a new algorithm to optimize such a complicated
ansatz. We find that a peculiar VBC state with a $3\times3$ periodicity and a
windmill-shaped motif has significantly lower energy than the claimed $Z_{3}$
chiral spin liquid state and other proposed VBC states around the $m=1/9$
plateau. We find that there are strong spatial modulation in the local
magnetization at the $1/9$ plateau, so strong that even its polarization can be
reversed. Our general RVB ansatz also well reproduces all other more
conventional magnetization plateaus of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ KAFH. We find
that the local magnetization is always strongly inhomogeneous below the
saturating field for such a strongly frustrated quantum magnet.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The study presents a new impurity solver that uses QTCI for implementing third-order calculations, showing accuracy in DMFT for specific interaction and temperature ranges. The method avoids analytical continuation by working directly in real frequency, which is beneficial for spectral analysis in various states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve computational efficiency in DMFT studies, specifically for the single-band Hubbard model. The motivation behind this work is to address limitations in current impurity solvers when dealing with higher-order calculations, aiming for higher accuracy and efficiency in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios.

Method: The method involves developing a real-frequency third-order strong-coupling impurity solver. They employ quantics tensor cross interpolation (QTCI) to evaluate diagram weights efficiently. The solver is applied to DMFT calculations on the Bethe lattice to determine accurate interaction and temperature ranges where the third-order approach is reliable. The computations are performed on the real-time/frequency axis, avoiding the need for analytical continuation.

Result: The results demonstrate that the third-order approach provides accurate spectral function details for paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and photo-doped states without requiring analytical continuation. This offers a viable alternative for high-order impurity solvers in DMFT studies.

Conclusion: This work establishes a promising method for extending impurity solvers to higher orders, enhancing the capabilities of DMFT studies in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions. The findings are particularly useful for spectral analysis in complex states without the need for additional analytical steps, making it a valuable tool for researchers in this field.

Abstract: We present a real-frequency third-order strong-coupling impurity solver which
employs quantics tensor cross interpolation (QTCI) for an efficient evaluation
of the diagram weights. Applying the method to dynamical mean-field theory
(DMFT) calculations of the single-band Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice, we
clarify the interaction and temperature range in which the third-order approach
yields accurate results. Since the calculations are implemented on the
real-time/frequency axis, the detailed structure of spectral functions can be
obtained without analytical continuation, as we demonstrate with examples for
paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic and photo-doped states. Our work establishes a
viable path toward high-order, real-frequency impurity solvers for both
equilibrium and non-equilibrium DMFT studies.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of entanglement halos, a set of strongly entangled
distant sites within the ground state of a quantum many-body system. Such halos
emerge in star-like systems with exponentially decaying couplings, as we show
using both free-fermions and the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model.
Depending on the central connectivity, entanglement halos may exhibit trivial
and non trivial symmetry-protected topological features. Our findings highlight
how geometry and connectivity can generate complex entanglement structures with
rich physical content, which can be experimentally accessible via
state-of-the-art technologies.

Abstract: We study the model for spin-1/2 J1-J2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a square
lattice in the presence of spin vacancies. In order to overcome the
methodological challenges associated with analyzing models with magnetic
frustration and inhomogeneities, we introduce a new semi-classical approach in
which singlet dimers are treated as effective classical degrees of freedom. The
energetic and entropic aspects of the dimer formation are included via a
classical Monte Carlo scheme that allows for the dynamical conversion of spin
pairs into dimers and vice versa. We show that our semi-classical approach
recovers the qualitative physics of the J1-J2 model in the absence of
vacancies. The vacancies lead to a broadening of the spin-liquid regime between
the N\'eel and the stripe antiferromagnetic phases. This suggests a possible
new route to discover spin-liquid ground states by tuning the J2/J1 ratio in
doped square lattice antiferromagnets.

Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices enable engineering of correlated quantum states through
tunable periodic potentials, where twist angle controls periodicity but dynamic
potential strength modulation remains challenging. Here, we develop a
high-pressure quantum transport technique for van der Waals heterostructures,
achieving the ultimate pressure limit (~9 GPa) in encapsulated moir\'e devices.
In aligned graphene/h-BN, we demonstrate that pressure induces a substantial
enhancement of the moir\'e potential strength, evidenced by the suppression of
the first valence bandwidth and the near-doubling of the primary band gap.
Moreover, we report the first observation of a tertiary gap emerging above 6.4
GPa, verifying theoretical predictions. Our results establish hydrostatic
pressure as a universal parameter to reshape moir\'e band structures. By
enabling quantum transport studies at previously inaccessible pressure regimes,
this Letter expands the accessible parameter space for exploring correlated
phases in moir\'e systems.

Abstract: We study a dimerized spin-1/2 chain, such as CuGeO$_3$, hosting triplon
excitations coupled to optical phonons under weak terahertz laser driving. Both
phonons and triplons weakly lose energy into the surrounding baths, forming a
non-equilibrium steady state. In the strong phonon-triplon coupling regime,
phonons near the two-triplon continuum hybridize strongly with triplons. Using
mean-field Lindblad dynamics, we show that this strong hybridization induces
sharp first-order phase transitions -- either single or simultaneous double --
in the emission spectrum, mainly due to dissipation-induced nonlinearities.
Using mean-field Floquet analysis of harmonic modes in both sectors, we
analytically confirm the existence of these phase transitions. Furthermore, we
map the complete steady-state phase diagram by varying key control parameters
and provide experimentally relevant parameters for observing these transitions
in laser-driven CuGeO$_3$.

TL;DR: The paper investigates CeGaSi single crystals, finding a magnetic phase transition at 11 K with a split magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity anomalies. Transport properties show suppressed spin-disorder scattering and anomalous Hall effect, which may be nodal-line metal characteristics. Using first-principles calculations supported these findings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents detailed studies on CeGaSi, likely a new magnetic material or metal, which could have implications for novel electronic properties and applications, prompting interest across materials science and physics communities.

Method: The study combines experimental methods like powder X-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements with point charge model analysis and first-principles calculations.

Result: Magnetic transition at 11 K, negative MR near Tm, significant anomalous Hall effect, nodal-line metal nature confirmed by computations.

Conclusion: CeGaSi exhibits magnetic and electronic properties indicating a possible nodal-line metal, with implications for superconductivity and anomalous transport phenomena. Further studies suggested for exploring these novel properties.

Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of CeGaSi single crystals, including
magnetic, thermodynamic, electronic, and magnetotransport properties. The
powder x-ray diffraction refinement revealed that CeGaSi crystallizes in
LaPtSi-type tetragonal structure with space group I41md. The electrical
resistivity data show a metallic nature with a sharp drop occurring around T_m
= 11 K, revealing a magnetic phase transition, which is confirmed by magnetic
susceptibility and heat capacity data. The magnetic susceptibility,
magnetization, and heat capacity data are analyzed through the crystalline
electric field based on point charge model, suggesting that the six degenerate
ground states of Ce3+ (J = 5/2) ion split into three doublets with an overall
splitting energy = 288 K. The maximum negative magnetoresistance in CeGaSi for
both B\parallel c and B\parallel ab field-direction is observed near T_m, it is
attributed to the suppression of spin-disorder scattering by the magnetic
field. The Hall resistivity data for B \parallel c and B\parallel ab show
anomalous Hall signal. Our scaling analysis suggests that anomalous Hall effect
in CeGaSi is dominated by the skew scattering mechanism. In addition,
first-principles calculations identify CeGaSi as a nodal-line metal.
