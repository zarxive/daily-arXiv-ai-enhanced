A remarkable example is the case of weakly interacting bosonic systems, whose ground state is a squeezed vacuum state, and whose elementary excitations have a collective nature. In this work, we report on the direct observation of the peculiar microscopic quantum structure of these elementary excitations. We perform time- and frequency-resolved two-photon correlation measurements on the fluctuations of weakly interacting polaritons in a resonantly-driven microcavity, and observe that upon decreasing the average number of fluctuation quanta below unity, large pair correlations build up together with strong time-ordering of the emitted photons. This behavior is a direct signature of the particle-hole quantum superposition which is at the heart of Bogoliubov excitations."}

Here, we report that hydrated DNA exhibits a reproducible magnetic-field-induced transition characterized by a sharp transverse-voltage threshold (40-50 mV), followed by a regime of regular, phase-stable oscillations in the transverse polarization signal. These features emerge only beyond the threshold and display a pronounced temperature dependence, consistent with the formation of a collective mode within the hydrogen-bond network of the DNA-water interface. Motivated by recent studies of Hall-like responses carried by neutral excitations, including phonons, magnons, and excitons, we interpret the observed transverse signal in terms of coherent polarization dynamics of proton-proton-hole dipoles confined to a quasi-two-dimensional hydrated layer. Within this framework, the transverse response is attributed to a field-organized polarization mode; the measured transverse voltage arises from collective dipolar dynamics rather than steady carrier transport. These results identify hydrated DNA as a soft-matter system in which magnetic field and temperature jointly modulate collective polarization dynamics, providing a biologically relevant platform for exploring coherence and transverse responses in hydrogen-bonded media."}

Building upon the Active Plasma Lens (APL) and its curved extension, the Active Plasma Bending (ABP), this work introduces the concept of the Plasma Discharge Undulator (PDU). In a PDU, a high-current discharge within a capillary generates an azimuthal magnetic field providing strong linear focusing ($O(1)$ (kT/m)), while a controlled and periodical spatial modulation of the discharge axis acts as a geometric driving term. The resulting beam dynamics can be modeled as a forced harmonic oscillator, yielding a well-defined oscillation at wavelength $λ_{\\mathrm{PDU}}$, distinct from the natural betatron wavelength $λ_β$ related to APL focusing. Proper injection conditions result in the suppression of collective betatron oscillations, significantly reducing the intrinsic undulator strength spread typical of conventional plasma undulators, while allowing for matched beam transport thanks to APL strong focusing. Analytical models for particle trajectories and radiation emission are developed, and the one-dimensional requirements for free-electron laser (FEL) emission are evaluated, providing scaling relations and feasibility criteria for FEL operation in the proposed scheme. Theoretical estimates and multi-particle simulations indicate that the PDU can operate in the short-period regime ($λ_{\\mathrm{PDU}} = $ mm-cm) with tunable undulator strength $K_{\\mathrm{PDU}}$, supporting narrow-band radiation emission. The PDU thus provides a pathway toward miniaturized, tunable, fully-plasma-based light sources with enhanced control over focusing and spectral properties."}

This regime is somewhat reminiscent of the Cherenkov regime, in which the velocity of a charged particle exceeds the phase velocity of light in a medium. However, because it involves two media and a moving interface, it gives rise to richer and more complex scattering dynamics, with a single scattered wave when the incident wave propagates in the same direction as the interface and three scattered waves when they propagate in opposite directions. Existing studies address only limited non-magnetic configurations, and a general formulation has yet to be established. In this paper, we present a complete and general solution to scattering in the interluminal regime using a symmetric decomposition approach based on subluminal and superluminal limit interfaces, together with a space-time impulse response. This approach provides clear physical insight into the scattering features of the interluminal regime. Our results bridge the long-standing gap between the subluminal and superluminal regimes and elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying interluminal scattering."}

We map out a rich ground state phase diagram featuring diverse spin and charge ordered states. These include conventional ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases with layer staggered charge densities, a layer-coherent phase characterized by spontaneous interlayer quantum coherence, and a novel maximally spin-layer-entangled phase with a hidden composite spin-layer order. We show that this exotic hidden ordered phase arises from the spontaneous breaking of an emergent O(4) symmetry down to a O(3), manifesting a unique excitation spectrum with three entangled gapless Goldstone modes. Our results uncover a geometrically driven mechanism for realizing composite entanglement in strongly correlated bilayer systems and provide a concrete theoretical framework relevant to bilayer nickelate superconductors and other multi-component correlated materials."}

Other developments have also urged caution regarding the idea of causality as a fundamental principle. In this paper, we examine the problem from multiple perspectives, including locality and predictivity, and extend the existing skepticism in several directions. Emphasizing the impact of unruly \"disruptors\", we point out that the illusory arrow of time associated with causality and predictivity is inherently statistical. This renders the cause-effect relation strained at the microscopic level. We also show that causation is a borderline concept that demands belief in entities which can act on nature without being part of it. Ultimately, not only is renouncing microcausality a reasonable price to pay for a consistent and predictive theory of quantum gravity (as is the one based on the fakeon idea), but the very notion of causality is misleading. Resting as it does on metaphysical assumptions, it should therefore be abandoned in fundamental physics."}

These material systems serve as an excellent platform for controlling waves, such as engineering wavenumber band gaps, flat bands, and zero-frequency band gaps. However, combining one or more of these exotic features within the same unit cell design remains a challenge. Moreover, once a metamaterial is realized, its dispersive properties are usually fixed. In this work, we present a tunable passive hierarchical metamaterial capable of exhibiting wavenumber band gaps, flat bands, and zero-frequency band gaps within the same dispersion curve. Our metamaterial is composed of magnetic elements confined within a fixed magnetic boundary. The metamaterial can be tuned by adjusting the magnetic boundary, which in turn can alter the lattice periodicity. We open wavenumber band gaps by incorporating magnetic coupling within the unit cell elements, resulting in negative physical stiffness. The tunability of the magnetic coupling also enables complete flattening of the dispersion bands. Moreover, the ground stiffness within our unit-cell design causes the opening of zero-frequency band gaps. We present our approach through a combination of analytical, numerical, and experimental methods. The analytical framework provides a blueprint for obtaining each of these exotic dispersion characteristics. The numerical analysis, using both linear and nonlinear models, validates our analytical predictions, which we further confirm through experimental demonstrations. Our work opens the door to exploring magnetic tunability and hierarchy in engineering metamaterial systems with exotic properties that can be harnessed in advanced acoustic and mechanical devices."}

Sensitivity to slow neutrons was achieved using boron-coated CR-39 (BCR) detectors, which register charged particle tracks arising from the $^{10}$B$(n,α)^{7}$Li reaction. These detectors were positioned adjacent to identically prepared uncoated CR-39 control detectors (CCR), which are effectively insensitive to slow neutrons and serve to quantify background contributions from charged particles and fast neutrons under the present experimental conditions. A reproducible differential detector signature (BCR $>$ CCR) would thus indicative of slow neutron fluences. Across multiple independent D$_2$O electrolysis experiments in $0.25~\\mathrm{T}$ field, the BCR exhibited significantly excess track signals relative to CCRs. Under these conditions, the observed differential response corresponds to an inferred detector-equivalent slow neutron flux of approximately $(6.7 \\pm 0.2)~\\mathrm{cm^{-2},s^{-1}}$. Removal of the magnetic field resulted in a reduction of the differential signal by a factor of $\\sim6$, indicating a strong empirical dependence on the applied field. In contrast, H$_2$O electrolysis performed under otherwise identical conditions produced no measurable differential detector response, establishing the necessity of deuterated electrochemical conditions for the observed effect. The results are reported strictly as detector signatures consistent with slow neutron capture and do not assert any theoretical explanation. Instead, this work establishes a control verified and detector validated experimental protocol for detecting low flux slow neutrons, and provides empirical constraints relevant to slow neutron studies in experiments involving metal-deuteride systems."}

Surprisingly, in the presence of a net fluid flow, proprioceptive noise improves Bayesian inference, rather than degrading it. An optimal noise exists that efficiently leverages additional information hidden within the geometry of the odor plume. Empirical tuning of noise functions well across a range of distances and may be implemented in practice. Other sources of noise also improve accuracy, owing to their ability to break the spatiotemporal correlations of the turbulent plume.

The continuous potential approximation was used to identify isolines of constant peak energy, providing a reference for regions of spectral stability.

Using numerically exact lattice Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate AM-like phases within the Ising-Kondo lattice model which is commonly employed to describe heavy-fermion materials. By incorporating an alternating next-nearest-neighbor hopping (NNNH) term, which arises from the influence of non-magnetic atoms in altermagnetic candidate materials, our results reveal key signatures of AM-like states, including spin-splitting quasiparticle bands and spectral functions, and demonstrate that d-wave AM remains stable across a broad range of interaction strengths, doping levels, NNNH amplitudes and temperatures, highlighting its robustness. Furthermore, through an analysis of non-magnetic impurity effects, we further confirm the d-wave symmetry of the AM phase. These findings establish a solid theoretical foundation for exploring AM-like phases in f-electron compounds, paving the way for future investigations into their exotic magnetic and electronic properties."}

In four-dimensional, type-D Einstein (vacuum/$Λ$-vacuum) spacetimes admitting a non-degenerate Killing-Yano (KY) tensor, we reduce via a Dirac bracket to the 10-dimensional physical phase space and model the quadratic sector with a spin-induced quadrupole characterized by a deformability $κ$ ($κ=1$ for black-hole--like; $κ\\neq 1$ for material or exotic compact objects). For $κ=1$, we construct five independent first integrals -- an autonomous Hamiltonian, two KY-generated Killing invariants, a linear Rüdiger constant, and a quadratic Carter-Rüdiger constant -- establishing Liouville-Arnold integrability at quadratic order in spin. For $κ\\neq 1$, the symmetry-generated invariants are not conserved in general and integrability does not persist at this order. The proof proceeds via covariant Poisson-bracket computations using a null bivector decomposition; Kerr is recovered as a special case. These results show that integrability can persist beyond Kerr and beyond the linear-in-spin regime, laying groundwork for symmetry-based, beyond-Kerr modelling of asymmetric-mass, spinning compact binaries."}

The present work provides a detailed computational and theoretical study investigating the source of such discrepancy. Electronic spectroscopy data are calculated by time-dependent density function theory and then compared with experimental results. Electronic couplings between exciton donor and acceptor are estimated based on both transition density cube method and transition dipole approximation. These results confirm that the delocalization of exciton to the bridge parts contribute to significant enhancement of donor-acceptor electronic coupling. Mechanistic details of exciton transfer are examined by estimating the contributions of the bridge electronic states, vibrational modes of the dyads commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor, inelastic resonance energy transfer mechanism, and dark exciton states. These analyses suggest that the contribution of common vibrational modes serves as the main source of deviation from Förster's spectral overlap expression."}

A slender-beam structure instrumented with collocated piezoelectric sensor-actuator pairs distributed periodically along the length is used as the host medium, with decentralized second-order low-pass resonant filter with negative position feedback controllers implemented in real time on an FPGA platform. Unlike conventional approaches that assess bandgap formation through tip displacement, this study relies on bending strain minimization of piezoelectric sensors as the principal indicator of control-induced bandgaps. This reflects more accurately the moment-based phase cancellation dynamics similar to resonator behavior. We derive analytical expressions for transmissibility in an n x n decentralized feedback architecture and verify them experimentally using a 7 x 7 unit-cell configuration. The findings show that resonant controllers with negative feedback applied at the unit-cell level can be systematically tuned through controller gain and damping to open targeted low-frequency bandgaps and significantly improve vibration attenuation. By shifting the focus to localized dynamics, this work deepens the understanding of how control-induced bandgaps emerge and demonstrates a scalable pathway for designing programmable mechatronic metamaterials based on unconventional resonator behavior."}

Evanescent modes play a crucial role in energy localization and in the emergence of thickness resonances. We report the first unambiguous experimental evidence of Lamb mode tunneling near turning points, revealing how energy can traverse an evanescent barrier and recover its propagative nature after a finite transit time. Focusing on waveguides with linearly varying thickness, we show that the $S_2$ mode becomes evanescent over a narrow frequency band, enabling a tunnelinglike phenomenon. Our study demonstrates that the barrier width is governed by the elastic properties of the material, particularly the Poisson's ratio, within a confined range bordering the Dirac cone. Numerical results exhibit excellent agreement with predictions from the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. These findings provide compelling evidence that, for a specific barrier width, evanescent modes mediate energy transfer across regions classically forbidden to propagating waves, revealing the mechanisms governing transmission, localization, and mode conversion in structured or corrugated elastic waveguides."}

From the numerical analysis, we show that the SIT is essential to generate os- cillations in the order of GHz and without it the magnetization reaches steady state after exhibiting switching. Without FLT, the frequency of the oscilla- tions decreases with the current while the power of oscillations increases. In the presence of the negative strength of the FLT the power spectral density confirms that the frequency, power and the Q-factor increase with the current.

We show that latent splitting enables the detection of nonclassicality by combining observational and interventional data even when conventional interventions fail. Focusing on the triangle network, we derive new analytical witnesses that robustly certify nonclassicality, including nonlinear inequalities for minimal binary-variable scenarios and extensions of the nonclassical region of previously proposed experiments."}

We classify topologically trivial photonic bands using SRSIs, treating them as the fundamental building blocks of 3D photonic band structures. This means that if certain bands cannot be constructed from these building blocks, they are necessarily topological. Furthermore, we distinguish between photonic and electronic band structures by analyzing which SRSI values are allowed in systems with and without polarization singularity.

Interestingly, recent experimental studies have suggested the preferential accumulation of $SO_4^{2-}$ ions at the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interface in disagreement with the generally known tendency of cations to accumulate at graphene-electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we resolve the atomistic structure of the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interfaces in the 0.1-2.0 M concentration range using machine learning interatomic potential-based simulations and simulated sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra to reveal the molecular origins of the conundrum. Our results show that Na+ ions accumulate between the outermost and second water layers whereas $SO_4^{2-}$ ions accumulate within the second interfacial water layer indicating cation dominated interfaces. We find that the interfacial region (within ~10 $Å$ of the graphene sheet) is negatively charged due to sub-stoichiometric $Na^+$/$SO_4^{2-}$ ratio at the interface. Our simulated SFG spectra show enhancement and a red-shift of the spectra in the hydrogen bonded region as a function of $Na_2SO_4$ concentration similar to measurements due to $SO_4^{2-}$-induced changes in the orientational order of water molecules in the second interfacial layer.

The phase fluctuation of the injection-locked magnetron, without the presence of a phase-locked loop, measured nearly 2.5 degree.

In the regime where environmental correlations decay rapidly, the evolution of a subsytem is well described by a Lindblad quantum master equation. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for simulating unital Lindbladian dynamics by sampling unitary quantum channels without extra ancillas. Using ancillary qubits we show that this algorithm allows approximating general Lindbladians as well. For interacting dephasing Lindbladians coupling two subsystems, we develop a decoupling scheme that reduces the circuit complexity of the simulation. This is achieved by sampling from a time-correlated probability distribution - determined by the evolution of one subsystem, which specifies the stochastic circuit implemented on the complementary subsystem. We demonstrate our approach by studying a model of bosons coupled to fermions via dephasing, which naturally arises from anharmonic effects in an electron-phonon system coupled to a bath. Our method enables tracing out the bosonic degrees of freedom, reducing part of the dynamics to sampling an instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuit. The sampled bitstrings then define a corresponding fermionic problem, which in the non-interacting case can be solved efficiently classically. We comment on the computational complexity of this class of dissipative problems, using the known fact that sampling from IQP circuits is believed to be difficult classically."}

The interaction between low-energy zero-modes (ZMs) not only contributes to frontier bands but can form the basis for magnetically ordered phases. Here, we present the bottom-up synthesis of a non-centrosymmetric GNR that places all ZMs on the majority sublattice sites. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy reveal that strong electron-electron correlation drives the system into a ferromagnetically ordered insulating ground state featuring a sizeable band gap of Eg ~ 1.2 eV. At higher temperatures, a chemical transformation induces an insulator-to-metal transition that quenches the ferro-magnetic order. Tight-binding (TB) and first-principles density functional theory calculations corroborate our experimental observations. This work showcases how control over molecular symmetry, sublattice polarization, and ZM hybridization in bottom-up synthesized nanographenes can open a path to the exploration of many-body physics in rationally designed quantum materials."}

By numerically solving the TOV equations, we obtain the interior solutions of neutron stars for different densities. The results indicate that as the polynomial index $n_c$ increases, the mass, radius, and compactness of the neutron star all increase, which has a significant impact on its optical properties. Under the assumption that the light is truncated at the surface of the neutron star, we find that for a spherical light source, an increase in $n_c$ leads to an enlargement of the Einstein ring radius. For a thin accretion disk, the light intensity always reaches its maximum at the surface of the neutron star. The increase in $n_c$ also causes the outline of the neutron star to grow. When the observer inclination angle $θ_o$ changes, the neutron star's outline deforms from a circular shape to a D shape, with the left side being significantly brighter than the right side. In addition, this paper also investigates the distribution characteristics of the redshift factor. At lower observer inclination angles, gravitational redshift dominates, while at higher inclination angles, the Doppler effect induces noticeable blueshift. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole, the optical appearance of the neutron star shows significant differences. The study provides a theoretical basis for distinguishing neutron stars from black holes using high-resolution imaging and for constraining the equation of state."}

The objective is to characterize their molecular structures, spectroscopic constants, and electronic energies, and to elucidate plausible formation and destruction pathways, providing data critical for astrochemical and atmospheric detection. High-accuracy ab initio methods were employed, notably CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 for optimized geometries. Additional calculations were performed at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ, CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ, MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ, and CIS levels. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to explore reaction pathways. Zero-point energy corrections were determined for all isomers considered. Six low-energy C2H4N2 isomers were identified, all within 1 eV of the global minimum. Among them, methylcyanamide (MCA) exhibits the lowest relative energy (~0.2 eV) and a significant electric dipole moment of 5.00 D, making it a strong candidate for gas-phase detection. The rotational constants for MCA, computed at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level, are Ae = 34932.44 MHz, Be = 4995.31 MHz, and Ce = 4520.30 MHz. The V3 torsional barrier was found to be 631.19 cm^{-1}. Centrifugal distortion constants were computed up to sextic order for all isomers. Formation pathways for MCA, such as CH3N + HCN -> CH3NHCN and related isomers, were characterized. The combination of large dipole moments and distinct rotational signatures supports the detectability of methylcyanamide and related C2H4N2 isomers via radioastronomy, infrared, and microwave spectroscopy. Isomerization and reaction pathways involving radical-neutral and neutral-neutral processes were found to be key to their formation in gas-phase environments. These results provide a robust foundation for future observational and modeling efforts."}

Under review at Nonlinear Dynamics", "summary": "This paper develops a comprehensive two-dimensional generalisation of the recently introduced Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD) framework for rolling contact problems. The proposed formulation extends the one-dimensional FrBD model to accommodate simultaneous longitudinal and lateral slips, spin, and arbitrary transport kinematics over a finite contact region. The derivation combines a rheological representation of the bristle element with an analytical local sliding-friction law. By relying on an application of the Implicit Function Theorem, the notion of sliding velocity is then eliminated, and a fully dynamic friction model, driven solely by the rigid relative velocity, is obtained. Building upon this local model, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, covering standard linear rolling contact, as well as linear and semilinear rolling in the presence of large spin slips. For the linear formulations, well-posedness, stability, and passivity properties are investigated under standard assumptions. In particular, the analysis reveals that the model preserves passivity under almost any parametrisation of practical interest. Numerical simulations illustrate steady-state action surfaces, transient relaxation phenomena, and the effect of time-varying normal loads. The results provide a unified and mathematically tractable friction model applicable to a broad class of rolling contact systems."}

These environments frequently undergo modifications, such as the inclusion of different auxiliary devices depending on the experiment or facility, adding further complexity. The successful management of such dynamic configurations demands a flexible and robust system capable of controlling data acquisition, monitoring experimental setups, enabling seamless reconfiguration, and integrating new devices with limited effort.\n  This paper presents Constellation, a flexible and network-distributed control and data acquisition software framework tailored to laboratory and beamline environments, that addresses the limitations of existing solutions. The framework is designed with a focus on extensibility, providing a streamlined interface for instrument integration. It supports efficient system setup via network discovery mechanisms, promotes stability through autonomous operational features, and provides comprehensive documentation and supporting tools for operators and application developers such as controllers and logging interfaces.\n  At the core of the architectural design is the autonomy of the individual components, called satellites, which can make independent decisions about their operation and communicate these decisions to other components. This paper introduces the design principles and framework architecture of Constellation, presents the available graphical user interfaces, shares insights from initial successful deployments, and provides an outlook on future developments and applications."}

This situation necessitates the investigation of alternative signatures of AHCs. The gapless phonons of the emergent electronic lattice provide a clear distinction from conventional quantum Hall states, but it may be difficult to disentangle these phonons from the plethora of other possible low-lying modes. Intriguingly, the quantum geometry of the underlying electronic ground state can imprint on the collective modes, possibly leading the phonons themselves to be topological. Were this the case, the resulting neutral chiral edge modes would provide a further signature of an AHC. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we compute the spectra of collective modes of Wigner crystals (WCs) and AHCs arising in minimal models and study the topology of the phonons and low-lying excitons. Across the WC to AHC transition, we observe a series of band inversions among collective modes, producing topological phonons and excitons, and a sharp sign change in the phonon Chern number upon entering the AHC phase. We conclude by discussing the relevance of collective mode topology to experiments on candidate systems for AHCs."}

When exploring the transmission of quantum states, faster transmission times are mandatory to avoid the deleterious effects of multiple sources of decoherence that spoil the transmission process. In particular, using Reinforcement Learning to devise sequences of step-wise external controls provides good transfer policies at short transmission times. We present two approaches to control the transmission of quantum states in qubit chains using external controls to force the dynamical evolution of the chain state. The first approach relies on the well-known Genetic Algorithm to generate a sequence of external controls, while the second approach uses a variant of Reinforcement Learning. The Genetic algorithm achieves excellent transmission fidelity at as short transmission times as Reinforcement Learning, surpassing the fidelities achieved by the latter method. Nevertheless, the Reinforcement Learning method offers robust control policies when the control pulses are noisy enough, owing to an imperfect timing of the pulses, deficient control devices, or other sources of phase decoherence. We present the regime where each method is best suited to control the transmission of arbitrary qubit states."}

Imposing compatibility of this quantum framework with the semiclassical results creates a novel link between the particle angular momentum and the black hole electric charge before and after emission, leading to a nontrivial interplay between the superradiance effect and other channels. We evaluate single scalar (neutral and charged) emission of Kerr-Newman and single and di-particle emission of photons, gravitons and spinors in the Kerr spacetime. We uncover that quantum corrections may affect late time evaporation rates, which further slows down the whole evaporation process because of the near-balance between the $s$-wave channel and the superradiance channel. Specifically, we find energy decay of the form $E(t)\\sim t^{-8/21}$ for scalar emission of a small, slowly rotating and charged black hole which differs from the analogous spherically symmetric quantum correction of $E(t)\\sim t^{-2/5}$ already suppressed with respect to the semiclassical rate of $E(t)\\sim t^{-1}$.

Here we present Speckle Clean Network (SCNet), a physics-guided foundation model for universal speckle removal that makes photon-limited, single-fiber collection compatible with high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse scattering conditions without target-specific retraining. SCNet combines a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with material-aware routing, wavelet-based frequency decomposition to separate structure from speckle across sub-bands, and a curriculum-style optimization that progressively enforces spectral consistency before spatial fidelity. Using an ultrathin dual-fiber holographic probe, we deliver wavefront-shaped illumination through one s and collect backscattered photons through a parallel MMF. We validate SCNet on 3D plastic objects over varying working distances, resolve 5.66 lp/mm on a paper USAF target, and restore fine structures on leaves and metal surfaces. On rabbit heart and kidney tissues, SCNet improves recovery of low-contrast anatomical texture under the same ultrathin collection constraint. We further compress SCNet through multi-teacher distillation to reduce computation while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling inference at 60 FPS. This work effectively decouples image quality from probe size, establishing a speckle-free ultrathin endoscopy for stand-off imaging in confined spaces."}

Please cite published version when available", "summary": "This paper diagnoses a much-discussed problem in quantum thermodynamics, that of generalizing classical work into the quantum domain. I begin with the no-go theorem of Perarnau-Llobet et al (2017): no universal measurement scheme for quantum work satisfies two intuitive, classically consilient desiderata. I assess this incompatibility as stemming from the measurement problem. Decoherence restores compatibility for all practical purposes, but raises questions about what 'universality' should mean and whether any measurement scheme can be 'universal'. I consider a different standard of universality -- in terms of ontology -- by defining a trajectory-based notion of quantum work using the quantum potential. While this preserves the classical role of work as the integral of forces over distances, and evades the tension of the no-go theorem, consilience fails elsewhere; no single quantum work concept seems capable of preserving all classical features, raising questions for what it takes for successful generalization of the work concept to quantum thermodynamics."}

While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\\text{TY}(\\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations."}

Conventional methods using Bézier clipping are computationally prohibitive, and a previously proposed mirror surface subdivision method suffered from the computation time increasing with mirror curvature. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel calculation method based on Fermat's principle that directly and efficiently determines the reflection point by minimizing the optical path length from a point light source to a hologram pixel via the mirror surface, using Newton's method for optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly reduces computation time compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, it enables the rendering of multiple reflections from several mirrors, a capability that was challenging for conventional techniques."}

In this paper, we focus on the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter case and present a unified analytic treatment of the horizon structure and its physical properties, allowing for a transparent comparison between general relativity and $ f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature. We solve the quartic equation determining the horizon locations and derive closed analytic expressions for the horizon radii. Focusing on extremal configurations, we obtain analytic formulas for the squared rotation parameter $ a^2 $ and the inverse square of the curvature radius $ l^{-2} $ as functions of the horizon location and the electric charge. For generic values of these parameters, the extremality conditions are non-universal, reducing to the familiar Kerr-Newman bound only in the limit of vanishing background curvature. We identify an ultra-extremal configuration in which $ a^2 $ attains its maximal value at zero charge and decreases monotonically to zero as the charge approaches its limiting value, while $ l^{-2 }$ increases correspondingly. As an illustrative example, we show that black holes with charge $ q=M/2 $ necessarily possess a minimum rotation, which emerges naturally as an intersection point in our analytic description of $ a^2 $ and $ l^{-2 }$, when embedded in a universe characterized by a critical value of $ l^{-2} $ (equivalently, the scalar curvature or the cosmological constant). Finally, we demonstrate that when the mass satisfies $ M^2= (a^2+q^2)(1-a^2/l^2)$, the quartic horizon equation factorizes, leading in the extremal regime to a chiral-like horizon structure that allows only the outer-cosmological horizon merger."}

Here, we propose the Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments (BASE) Scale, a 6-level taxonomy (Levels 0-5) specifically adapted for these unique constraints. Unlike owner-operator models, User Facilities require zero-shot deployment where agents must operate immediately without extensive training periods. We define the specific technical requirements for each tier, identifying the Inference Barrier (Level 3) as the critical latency threshold where decisions shift from scalar feedback to semantic digital twins. Fundamentally, this level extends the decision manifold from spatial exploration to temporal gating, enabling the agent to synchronise acquisition with the onset of transient physical events. By establishing these operational definitions, the BASE Scale provides facility directors, funding bodies, and beamline scientists with a standardised metric to assess risk, define liability, and quantify the intelligence of experimental workflows."}

Despite coming from the backfolding of the acoustic phonons of the individual layers, many of these modes become infrared active when the system is doped. We illustrate this effect by a direct calculation of the optical absorption of twisted bilayer graphene (tBG) around different twist angles, including the magic angle. Several modes -including the acoustic-like phason- acquire a dipole moment via interband matrix elements of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) when the flat band is filled or emptied, giving rise to new resonances in the optical conductivity within the single-electron gap that are strongly affected by relaxation. The phason in particular gains a charge that equals the amount of electrons per moiré cell added/removed to/from neutrality. Geometrically, this can be understood as the topological quantization of a sliding Chern number. The charged phason yields a Drude-like conductivity with an effective mass that increases with lattice relaxation. Our findings are testable via THz spectroscopy, and provide an experimental knob to characterize EPC strength and disorder in moiré materials at small twist angles."}

We propose protocols to simultaneously control the internal (related to its pseudospin-1/2) and motional (position-related) states of a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a Morse potential. In the presence of synthetic spin-orbit coupling, the state transition of a noninteracting condensate can be implemented by Raman coupling and detuning terms designed by invariant-based inverse engineering. The state transfer may also be driven by tuning the direction of the spin-orbit-coupling field and modulating the magnitude of the effective synthetic magnetic field. The results can be generalized for interacting condensates by changing the time-dependent detuning to compensate for the interaction. We find that a two-level algorithm for the inverse engineering remains numerically accurate even if the entire set of possible states is considered. The proposed approach is robust against the laser-field noise and systematic device-dependent errors."}

For graph state resources shared across two QPUs, this task reduces to finding bipartitions with minimal cut rank. We introduce a simulated annealing-based algorithm that efficiently updates the cut rank when two vertices swap sides across a bipartition, such that computing the new cut rank from scratch, which would be much more expensive, is not necessary.

We evaluate the photonic quasicrystal accurately by a generalized spectral method that embeds the quasiperiodic structure into a higher-dimensional periodic system. We study the spectral distribution of one-dimensional photonic quasicrystals and find some interesting phenomena. As the computational resolution N increases, there are more eigenvalues within finite frequency bandwidths, and the maximum localization always occurs at spectral gap edges for states near index N + 1. By varying βwithin the range of (0,1), we present a butterfly-shaped spectral structure with abundant band gaps. We find that the spectral structure factor Q (defined as I_{mg}/N, where I_{mg} is the maximum gap index) exhibits different linear patterns as βchanges: Q = 1 - βwhen β< βc, while Q = βwhen β> βc, where βc \\approx 0.424 is the transition point. This linear relationship holds robustly in the strong quasiperiodic regime (βaway from 0 or 1) and is independent of the specific type of irrational number used. The relationship disappears (weak quasiperiodic regime) near β= 0 or β= 1. It demonstrates that the intrinsic spectral properties of one-dimensional photonic quasicrystals are fundamentally governed by the magnitude of the irrational parameter β."}

Transport measurements revealed striking stepwise anomalies in magnetoresistance when crossing phase boundaries, accompanied by pronounced hysteresis loops arising from magnetic moment flopping processes.

It is shown that the microscopic D-brane description fails to admit any extremal state, even classically. This positive energy is expected to destabilize the near horizon AdS2. The positive minimum energy is a direct consequence of the pattern of supersymmetry breaking by the D-branes. The black hole entropy is found to be the logarithm of the number of isolated minima and hence is related to the configurational entropy of the microscopic potential. We also find multiple continua of local minima corresponding to marginally bound states of the constituent D-branes."}

However, the scalability of PPICs faces critical power consumption barriers. Therefore, we propose a novel non-volatile PPIC architecture utilizing MEMS with mechanical latching, enabling stable passive operation without any power connection once configured. To ensure practical applicability, we present a system-level solution including both this hardware innovation and an accompanying automatic error-resilient configuration algorithm. The algorithm compensates for the lack of continuous tunability inherent in the non-volatile hardware design, thereby enabling such new operational paradigm without compromising performance, and also ensuring robustness against fabrication errors. Functional simulations were performed to validate the proposed scheme by configuring five distinct functionalities of varying complexity, including a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), a MZI lattice filter, a ring resonator (ORR), a double ORR ring-loaded MZI, and a triple ORR coupled resonator waveguide filter. The results demonstrate that our non-volatile scheme achieves performance equivalent to conventional PPICs. Robustness analysis was also conducted, and the results demonstrated that our scheme exhibits strong robustness against various fabrication errors. Furthermore, we explored the trade-off between the hardware design complexity of such non-volatile scheme and its performance. This study establishes a viable pathway to a new generation of power-connection-free PPICs, providing a practical and scalable solution for future photonic systems."}

This study investigates the properties of quantum fields by exploring the quantum coherence of a two-mode Gaussian state near a black hole, where Hawking quanta originate from the quantum atmosphere region. It is demonstrated that both physically accessible and inaccessible quantum coherence for continuous variable quantum states distinctly exhibit hallmark features of the quantum atmosphere. Specifically, the quantum coherence for these states varies continuously with changes in the normalized distance; it undergoes rapid decreases (or increases) just outside the event horizon before gradually stabilizing through subsequent increases (or decreases). This behavior contrasts with the behaviors of quantum coherence where originates solely from the black hole's event horizon. The quantum features of the fields distinctly reflect characteristics attributable to the quantum atmosphere, thereby deepening our understanding of the origins of Hawking radiation. We also find that the continuous variable coherence is highly dependent on both the squeezing parameter and field frequency of the prepared state; therefore, appropriately adjusting these values can enhance our ability to detect features within the quantum atmosphere. It is noteworthy to observe that quantum features of fields do not entirely dissipate in the quantum atmosphere region, indicating that tasks related to quantum information processing can still be executed there."}

Formulating the deformation as a modification of the asymptotic variational principle in AdS$_3$, we obtain the exact quadratic trace relation for the stress tensor without introducing a finite radial cutoff, which we take as the fundamental definition of the deformed theory. When restricted to a BCFT without independent boundary degrees of freedom, the intrinsic $T\\bar T$ deformation becomes genuinely boundary-localized. Imposing reflective boundary conditions collapses the bulk composite operator to a universal one-dimensional irrelevant flow governed entirely by the displacement operator. We integrate this flow in closed form and derive an induced boundary action, showing that the deformation reorganizes existing boundary data without introducing new boundary degrees of freedom. We further establish a precise equivalence between a fixed-boundary description and a moving-boundary description, interpreted as a reparametrization of the variational problem rather than physical boundary dynamics.\n  On the holographic side, we analyze two inequivalent realizations in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$, referred to as Type~A and Type~B. In Type~A, a rigid cutoff surface intersects the end-of-the-world brane at finite position, leading to an apparent boundary displacement. In Type~B, the cutoff surface is asymptotically AdS$_2$, so that the BCFT boundary is geometrically pinned and the displacement operator vanishes identically. Using entanglement entropy at zero and finite temperature, we disentangle universal consequences of the intrinsic boundary-localized flow from features that depend on the holographic implementation."}

We identify the optimal conditions for efficient vortex light transmission, analyze the influence of detuning on transmission efficiency and phase distortion, and specifically examine the scenario where the control field carries OAM the latter being essential for a complete characterization of OAM conservation in the FWM process, while all three aspects have been largely overlooked in the existing literature.

In space quantum communication and sensing, where a shared RF is absent, the interplay between locality and symmetry imposes fundamental restrictions on physical systems. A restriction on realizable unitary operations results in a no-go theorem prohibiting the extraction of locally encoded information in RF-independent distributed metrology. Here, we propose a reversed-encoding method applied to two copies of local-unitary-invariant network states. This approach circumvents the no-go theorem while simultaneously mitigating decoherence-like noise caused by RF misalignment, thereby enabling the complete recovery of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Furthermore, we confirm local Bell-state measurements as an optimal strategy to saturate the QFI. Our findings pave the way for the field application of distributed quantum sensing, which is inherently subject to unknown RF misalignment and was previously precluded by the no-go theorem."}

Here, we introduce a single-exposure holographic three-dimensional (3D) printing approach that synthesizes an entire volumetric dose distribution optically in one step. The method combines inverse-designed microstructured phase masks with photopolymer resins engineered for controlled optical absorption. By precisely tailoring the phase-mask topography, we generate arbitrary 3D light-intensity distributions within the resin, including intentionally encoded dark regions that define hollow internal features. Simultaneously, the resin formulation is designed to balance optical penetration with sufficient local energy deposition to achieve high-fidelity polymerization throughout the volume. Using this approach, millimeter-scale architectures comprising more than $10^{6}$ addressable voxels are fabricated in a single 7.5~s exposure, corresponding to a volumetric throughput of $\\sim$1~mm$^{3}$/s ($>10^{5}$~voxels/s). The demonstrated performance is presently limited by resin kinetics and illumination geometry rather than by the phase-mask framework itself. Because the volumetric information capacity scales with the space--bandwidth product of the phase mask, this approach provides a clear pathway toward substantially higher throughput, enabling scalable fabrication of micro-optical components, biomedical scaffolds, and other precision-engineered mesoscale systems."}

On the pure-state manifold, the even contribution vanishes identically, while the odd contribution coincides with the QFI derived from the natural metric on the Siegel upper half-space, revealing a direct geometric underpinning of pure-Gaussian metrology. This also provides a link between the graphical representation of pure Gaussian states and an explicit expression for the QFI in terms of graphical parameters. For evolutions completely generated by passive Gaussian unitaries (orthogonal symplectics), the odd QFI vanishes, while thermometric parameters contribute purely to the even sector with a simple spectral form; we also derive a state-dependent lower bound on the even QFI in terms of the purity-change rate. We extend the construction to the full QFI matrix, obtaining an additive even odd sector decomposition that clarifies when cross-parameter information vanishes. Applications to unitary sensing (beam splitter versus two-mode squeezing) and to Gaussian channels (loss and phase-insensitive amplification), including joint phase loss estimation, demonstrate how the decomposition cleanly separates resources associated with spectrum versus correlations.

Motivated by this issue, we introduce a modified total energy, which is still computed via holographic renormalization but the final value is independent of the choice of quantization schemes.

Exploiting the fact that the relevant equatorial optical manifold is two dimensional, we introduce isothermal (conformal) coordinates in which the optical metric is locally conformal to a flat reference metric and the Gaussian curvature reduces to a Laplacian of the conformal factor. Such an identity converts the curvature area term in the Gauss-Bonnet theorem into a pure boundary contribution via Green/Stokes-type relations, yielding a deflection formula that depends only on boundary data and controlled closure terms. The residual normalization freedom of the isothermal radius is isolated as an additive freedom in the conformal factor and is shown to leave physical observables invariant, eliminating the need for orbit dependent calibration prescriptions. We explicitly implement the boundary only formalism in weak deflection, where the leading bending reduces to elementary one-dimensional integrals evaluated on a flat reference ray in the conformal plane, with finite distance dependence entering solely through endpoint data. We validate the construction by reproducing finite distance weak deflection for Schwarzschild, deriving the leading finite distance charge correction for Reissner-Nordström, and applying the same boundary only framework to the Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) geometry as a representative non-asymptotically flat test case, recovering the standard finite distance expansion including the explicit $\\mathcal{O}(Λ)$ and mixed $\\mathcal{O}(ΛM)$ contributions to the total deflection angle."}

In the presence of open boundary conditions, this system is precisely mapped, through a nonunitary gauge transformation, to the Hermitian AAH model with balanced hopping terms. The mapping leaves the spectrum unchanged but reshapes each eigenfunction by a realization-dependent random-walk envelope. In a parameter regime where the Hermitian counterpart hosts spectrally isolated in-gap boundary modes, we identify two such modes with sharply different responses to the envelope: one stays anchored at the boundary, while the other is controllable via the gauge, allowing its peak intensity to be relocated solely by altering the gauge setup without modifying the associated eigenenergy. Additionally, we demonstrate that this steerable mode can be preferentially enhanced and generated from an initial bulk wavefunction by introducing mild site-specific amplification at a location determined exclusively from the Hermitian model using the biorthogonal function.

However, these detectors typically have pixel sizes about ten times larger than those of direct electron detectors commonly used for imaging and more prominent electron multiple scattering effects. To overcome these limitations, machine learning approaches can be utilized to reconstruct the electron entrance point and achieve super-resolution. As this process is inherently stochastic, and machine learning relies on suitable training data, high-quality, representative training data are essential for developing models that achieve the best possible resolution. In this work, we present two novel experimental methods for generating such training data. The first method employs precise microscope alignment to scan the detector plane using a finely focused electron beam of 2 μm diameter, enabling controlled sub-pixel mapping. The second method utilizes specially designed aperture masks with sub-pixel-sized holes to accurately localize electron entry points. We developed and validated two experimental strategies for collecting training data at acceleration voltages of 60, 80, 120, and 200 keV, which enable sub-pixel labeling for hybrid pixel detectors.

The system comprises an optical mode, a molecular vibrational mode, and $N$ excitonic modes, where excitons couple to molecular vibrations via conditional displacement interactions and to photons through electric dipole interactions. We show that the effective exciton-vibration coupling provides a powerful mechanism for coherent GHS control: in its absence, the system exhibits a pronounced GHS at resonance, while activating it strongly suppresses the shift. The effective cavity detuning and the cavity length serve as additional tunable parameters for GHS manipulation. Furthermore, increasing the collective exciton-optical coupling enhances the GHS. Our results establish a framework for probing the GHS in polariton optomechanical systems and offer new avenues for designing optical devices that exploit beam-displacement phenomena."}

We analyze more than twenty distinct stackings, including high- and low-symmetry configurations, and reveal that the spin splittings of graphene's Dirac bands span a wide range from 1 to 100 meV, depending on the local hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$, hBN $p_z$, and graphene $p_z$ orbitals. The strongest proximity effects emerge at geometric resonances, or \"proximity hot spots\", where the three orbital states overlap maximally. The local spin polarization also depends sensitively on energy: Dirac states aligned with resonant Co orbitals experience the most pronounced exchange interaction. At these energies, the pseudospin Hamiltonian description of magnetic proximity effects breaks down. Outside these resonances, the pseudospin picture is restored. Our findings highlight the intrinsically local nature of proximity effects, governed by the spectral resonance and interlayer wavefunction overlap. We further quantify how additional hBN layers, interlayer twist, and multilayer graphene modify the proximity exchange and TSP, offering microscopic insight for designing spintronic van der Waals heterostructures with engineered interfaces and optimized spin transport."}

The two excited spin-wave modes interact in a strongly nonlinear fashion giving rise to quasiperiodicity, hysteresis and non-commutativity of steady-state oscillation regimes. To disentangle such a complex variety of dynamics, we develop a reduced-order model based on magnetization normal modes that is amenable of appropriate analytical treatment, leading to quantitative description of parametric instability thresholds, post-instability steady-state amplitude saturation and complete determination of phase diagrams for steady-state oscillation regimes. We have performed validation of the theory using numerical simulations.

Emphasizing the impact of unruly \"disruptors\", we point out that the illusory arrow of time associated with causality and predictivity is inherently statistical. This renders the cause-effect relation strained at the microscopic level. We also show that causation is a borderline concept that demands belief in entities which can act on nature without being part of it. Ultimately, not only is renouncing microcausality a reasonable price to pay for a consistent and predictive theory of quantum gravity (as is the one based on the fakeon idea), but the very notion of causality is misleading.

Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we compute the spectra of collective modes of Wigner crystals (WCs) and AHCs arising in minimal models and study the topology of the phonons and low-lying excitons. Across the WC to AHC transition, we observe a series of band inversions among collective modes, producing topological phonons and excitons, and a sharp sign change in the phonon Chern number upon entering the AHC phase.

In this paper, we focus on the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter case and present a unified analytic treatment of the horizon structure and its physical properties, allowing for a transparent comparison between general relativity and $ f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature. We solve the quartic equation determining the horizon locations and derive closed analytic expressions for the horizon radii. Focusing on extremal configurations, we obtain analytic formulas for the squared rotation parameter $ a^2 $ and the inverse square of the curvature radius $ l^{-2} $ as functions of the horizon location and the electric charge. For generic values of these parameters, the extremality conditions are non-universal, reducing to the familiar Kerr-Newman bound only in the limit of vanishing background curvature. We identify an ultra-extremal configuration in which $ a^2 $ attains its maximal value at zero charge and decreases monotonically to zero as the charge approaches its limiting value, while $ l^{-2 }$ increases correspondingly. As an illustrative example, we show that black holes with charge $ q=M/2 $ necessarily possess a minimum rotation, which emerges naturally as an intersection point in our analytic description of $ a^2 $ and $ l^{-2 }$, when embedded in a universe characterized by a critical value of $ l^{-2} $ (equivalently, the scalar curvature or the cosmological constant). Finally, we demonstrate that when the mass satisfies $ M^2= (a^2+q^2)(1-a^2/l^2)$, the quartic horizon equation factorizes, leading in the extremal regime to a chiral-like horizon structure that allows only the outer-cosmological horizon merger."}

Alternatively, optical co-self-injection-locking (co-SIL) offers inherent simplicity but is limited by the large thermo-refractive noise and confined mode volumes of integrated cavities. Here, we demonstrate a two-point OFD-based microwave oscillator that combines an ultrahigh-Q miniature Fabry-Perot cavity with optical co-SIL.

In the regime where environmental correlations decay rapidly, the evolution of a subsytem is well described by a Lindblad quantum master equation. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for simulating unital Lindbladian dynamics by sampling unitary quantum channels without extra ancillas. Using ancillary qubits we show that this algorithm allows approximating general Lindbladians as well. For interacting dephasing Lindbladians coupling two subsystems, we develop a decoupling scheme that reduces the circuit complexity of the simulation. This is achieved by sampling from a time-correlated probability distribution - determined by the evolution of one subsystem, which specifies the stochastic circuit implemented on the complementary subsystem. We demonstrate our approach by studying a model of bosons coupled to fermions via dephasing, which naturally arises from anharmonic effects in an electron-phonon system coupled to a bath. Our method enables tracing out the bosonic degrees of freedom, reducing part of the dynamics to sampling an instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuit. The sampled bitstrings then define a corresponding fermionic problem, which in the non-interacting case can be solved efficiently classically. We comment on the computational complexity of this class of dissipative problems, using the known fact that sampling from IQP circuits is believed to be difficult classically."}

However, the practical deployment of CV-QKD systems remains vulnerable to various quantum attacks. In this paper, we propose a quantum machine learning (QML)-based attack detection framework (QML-ADF) that safeguards the security of high-rate CV-QKD systems. In particular, two alternative QML models -- quantum support vector machines (QSVM) and quantum neural networks (QNN) -- are developed to perform noise-resistant and feature-aware attack detection before conventional data postprocessing. Leveraging feature-rich quantum data from Gaussian modulation and homodyne detection, the QML-ADF effectively detects quantum attacks, including both known and unknown types defined by these distinctive features. The results indicate that all twelve distinct QML variants for both QSVM and QNN exhibit remarkable performance in detecting both known and previously undiscovered quantum attacks, with the best-performing QSVM variant outperforming the top QNN counterpart. Furthermore, we systematically evaluate the performance of the QML-ADF under various physically interpretable noise backends, demonstrating its strong robustness and superior detection performance. We anticipate that the QML-ADF will not only enable robust detection of quantum attacks under realistic deployment conditions but also strengthen the practical security of quantum communication systems."}

Exploiting the fact that the relevant equatorial optical manifold is two dimensional, we introduce isothermal (conformal) coordinates in which the optical metric is locally conformal to a flat reference metric and the Gaussian curvature reduces to a Laplacian of the conformal factor. Such an identity converts the curvature area term in the Gauss-Bonnet theorem into a pure boundary contribution via Green/Stokes-type relations, yielding a deflection formula that depends only on boundary data and controlled closure terms. The residual normalization freedom of the isothermal radius is isolated as an additive freedom in the conformal factor and is shown to leave physical observables invariant, eliminating the need for orbit dependent calibration prescriptions. We explicitly implement the boundary only formalism in weak deflection, where the leading bending reduces to elementary one-dimensional integrals evaluated on a flat reference ray in the conformal plane, with finite distance dependence entering solely through endpoint data. We validate the construction by reproducing finite distance weak deflection for Schwarzschild, deriving the leading finite distance charge correction for Reissner-Nordström, and applying the same boundary only framework to the Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) geometry as a representative non-asymptotically flat test case, recovering the standard finite distance expansion including the explicit $\\mathcal{O}(Λ)$ and mixed $\\mathcal{O}(ΛM)$ contributions to the total deflection angle."}

Although multiple comb lines can occupy a single resonance during the Kerr comb formation process, their mutual interactions have remained largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate a Kerr comb formation that is confined to a single resonance of a microresonator via dual-pumping.

Although the pressure inside of a neutron star is typically assumed to be isotropic, pressure anisotropy can arise from various physical mechanisms, including elasticity, viscosity, and magnetic fields. Previous studies of nonradial stellar quasi-normal mode oscillations with anisotropic pressure have focused primarily on fluid modes. In this paper, we compute, for the first time, spacetime oscillation modes (so-called w-modes) of anisotropic neutron stars. Using a perturbative framework for stellar oscillations with pressure anisotropy, developed previously by some of the authors, together with a phenomenological anisotropy model, we find that both the real and imaginary parts of the w-mode frequencies decrease as the tangential pressure becomes dominant over the radial pressure. Although we do not find any unstable w-modes within the physically viable parameter space, unstable w-modes appear in an unphysical branch of solutions when the tangential pressure strongly dominates the radial one. We also find that the relation between the real part of the w-mode frequency and the stellar compactness is quasi-universal with respect to variations in the equation of state and the degree of pressure anisotropy. In contrast, the relation between the imaginary part of the w-mode frequency and the stellar compactness depends on the degree of anisotropy, but remains equation-of-state universal when the anisotropy is fixed. Finally, we discuss potential mode crossings and the validity of certain approximations that have been shown to work well for w-mode calculations in the isotropic case."}

We illustrate this effect by a direct calculation of the optical absorption of twisted bilayer graphene (tBG) around different twist angles, including the magic angle. Several modes -including the acoustic-like phason- acquire a dipole moment via interband matrix elements of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) when the flat band is filled or emptied, giving rise to new resonances in the optical conductivity within the single-electron gap that are strongly affected by relaxation. The phason in particular gains a charge that equals the amount of electrons per moiré cell added/removed to/from neutrality. Geometrically, this can be understood as the topological quantization of a sliding Chern number.

In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an information-theoretically secure COW-QKD protocol that can resist source side-channel attacks, with secure transmission distances up to 100 km. Our system achieves a secure key rate on the order of kilobits per second over 50 km in the finite-size regime, sufficient for real-time secure voice communication across metropolitan networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the encrypted transmission of a logo with information-theoretic security over 100 km of optical fiber. These results confirm that COW-QKD can simultaneously provide simplicity and security, establishing it as a strong candidate for deployment in small-scale quantum networks."}

While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\\text{TY}(\\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations."}

They have proven useful for constructing numerical gravitational waveforms and for characterizing gravitational memory. As the precision of current and future detectors continues to improve, such constraints become increasingly important for high-precision tests of gravity, including searches for deviations from general relativity. This motivates a systematic understanding of analogous balance laws in theories beyond general relativity. In this work, we investigate the existence and structure of flux laws at null infinity in diffeomorphism-invariant extensions of general relativity. Our analysis is based on the covariant phase space formalism and the definition of conserved quantities, as presented by Wald and Zoupas. For a particularly relevant class of Horndeski theories, we derive a general expression for the flux and formulate the corresponding balance equation via the associated non-conserved charges. We cross-check our general results by comparing them with previous studies of Brans-Dicke gravity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the employed methods extend straightforwardly to a broader class of diffeomorphism-invariant theories. The null part of the resulting flux laws associated with null memory is compared with and validated against the alternative derivation based on the Isaacson approach to gravitational radiation. Beyond the specific results obtained, this work is intended to serve as a practical guide for computing balance laws in generic diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity and paves the way for an in-depth comparison between the Isaacson approach and the covariant phase space formalism."}

To this end, we use a femtosecond laser pulse to resonantly generate excitons within the light cone. These excitons can then either recombine radiatively or scatter out of the light cone, gaining an in-plane momentum in the process. In samples without disorder, such as the CdTe quantum wells used here, the resulting fast excitons can diffuse over mesoscopic distances before recombining radiatively. Using coherent nonlinear micro-spectroscopy, we carry out exciton time-of-flight measurements. Specifically, we monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of launched exciton wave packets, selectively observing their coherence or density on a scale of up to 10$\\,μ$m. Our proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates that free excitons inherit a phase modulation from the optical pulsed excitation and can generate coherent links within excitonic circuits, offerring a higher level of miniaturisation and compactness than photonic or polaritonic architectures."}

However, imposing this assumption globally obstructs the construction of self-consistent compact-star solutions. In this work, we elucidate the origin of this inconsistency through a detailed analysis of the field equations and construct neutron-star configurations by abandoning the global vanishing-potential assumption.

While universal upper bounds on the photon sphere radius have been established for both four-dimensional and higher-dimensional black holes, the question of a corresponding lower bound in higher-dimensional black holes remains less explored. In this work, we derive a universal lower bound for the photon sphere radius in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes of arbitrary dimension $n\\ge 4$. Under the assumptions of the weak energy condition, a non-positive trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and a monotonicity condition on the radial pressure function $|r^{n-1}p_r(r)|$, we prove that the photon sphere radius $r_γ$ satisfies $r_γ\\ge (\\frac{n-1}{2})^{1/(n-3)}r_H$, where $r_H$ is the radius of the outer event horizon. For $n=4$, this reduces to the known result $r_γ\\ge \\frac{3}{2}r_H$. Our result generalizes Hod's four-dimensional theorem to higher dimensions, and provides a new geometric constraint on the structure of black holes in extended theories of gravity."}

Most of existing QSS protocols are limited by the linear rate-distance bound, and cannot realize the long-distance and high-capacity multipartite key distribution. This paper proposes a polarization (Pol) and phase (Ph) dual degrees of freedom (dual-DOF) QSS protocol based on the weak coherent pulse (WCP) sources. Our protocol combines the single-photon interference, two-photon interference and non-interference principles, and can resist the internal attack from the dishonest player. We develop simulation method to estimate its performance under the beam splitting attack. The simulation results show that our protocol can surpass the linear bound. Comparing with the differential-phase-shift twin-field QSS and WCP-Ph-QSS protocols, our protocol has stronger resistance against the beam splitting attack, and thus has longer maximal communication distance and higher key rate. By using the WCPs with high average photon number ($μ$ = 1.5), our protocol achieves a key rate about 5.4 times of that in WCP-Ph-QSS protocol. Its maximal communication distance (441.7 km) is about 7.9% longer than that of the WCP-Ph-QSS. Our protocol is highly feasible with current experimental technology and offers a promising approach for long-distance and high-capacity quantum networks."}

Quantum computing algorithms promise to alleviate this scaling bottleneck by leveraging entanglement and superposition to represent correlated states more compactly. We introduced the Handover-Iterative Variational Quantum Eigensolver (HI-VQE) as a practical quantum computing algorithm with an iterative \"handover\" mechanism that dynamically exchanges information between quantum and classical computers, even using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. In this work, we extend the HI-VQE to benchmark two prototypical strongly correlated systems, the nitrogen molecule $N_2$ and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster, which serve as stringent tests for both classical and quantum electronic-structure methods. By comparing HI-VQE results against Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (HCI) benchmarks, we assess its accuracy, scalability, and ability to capture multireference correlation effects.

We numerically solve for the evolution of $Φ(t)$ and the corresponding potential $V(Φ)$ in order to track the collapse dynamics leading to singularity formation.

We further examine the causal structure of the resulting singularity and find that future-directed null geodesics originating from the singularity can propagate to future null infinity, making the singularity globally visible. The strength of the singularity is also examined by extending Tipler's strong curvature condition to the Brans--Dicke field equations.

In this work, we systematically investigate the parameter-estimation biases induced by neglecting orbital eccentricity when analyzing eccentric compact-binary coalescences with quasi-circular waveform templates. Focusing on the deci-Hertz detector B-DECIGO and the milli-Hertz detector LISA, we model eccentric inspiral signals using a frequency-domain waveform that incorporates eccentricity-induced higher harmonics and the time-dependent response of spaceborne detectors. We quantify systematic biases in the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, and luminosity distance using both Bayesian inference and the Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) formalism, and assess their significance relative to statistical uncertainties. By constructing mock gravitational-wave catalogs spanning stellar-mass and massive black-hole binaries, we identify critical initial eccentricities at which systematic errors become comparable to statistical errors. We find that for B-DECIGO, even very small eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ at 0.1 Hz, can lead to significant biases, whereas for LISA such effects typically arise at larger eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ at $10^{-4}$ Hz, due to the smaller number of in-band cycles.

We apply these processes to the entanglement of a two-level atom, realized with a circular Rydberg atom, and a light field of a high-quality microwave cavity. The entropy production is computed from the full quantum-state tomography of the system performed at different stages of the interaction-decorrelation sequence.

We construct the first examples of such Lorentzian quasicrystals (the spacetime analogues of the Penrose or Ammann-Beenker tilings), and point out key novel features of these structures (compared to their Euclidean cousins). We end with some (speculative) ideas about how such spacetime quasicrystals might relate to reality. This includes an intriguing scenario in which our infinite $(3+1)$D universe is embedded (like one of our spacetime quasicrystal examples) in a particularly symmetric $(9+1)$D torus $T^{9,1}$ (which was previously found to yield the most symmetric toroidal compactification of the superstring).

Previous works that achieve these guarantees and provide modularity necessary to optimization of protocols to real-world hardware are most often expressed in the Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) model. This leaves architectures based on the circuit model -- in particular those using the Magic State Injection (MSI) -- with fewer options to verify their computations or with the need to compile their circuits in MBQC leading to overheads.\n  This paper introduces a family of noise robust, composable and efficient verification protocols for Clifford + MSI circuits that are secure against arbitrary malicious behavior. This family contains the verification protocol of Broadbent (ToC, 2018), extends its security guarantees while also bridging the modularity gap between MBQC and circuit-based protocols, and reducing quantum communication costs. As a result, it opens the prospect of rapid implementation for near-term quantum devices.\n  Our technique is based on a refined notion of blindness, called magic-blindness, which hides only the injected magic states -- the sole source of non-Clifford computational power. This enables verification by randomly interleaving computation rounds with classically simulable, magic-free test rounds, leading to a trap-based framework for verification. As a result, circuit-based quantum verification attains the same level of security and robustness previously known only in MBQC. It also optimizes the quantum communication cost as transmitted qubits are required only at the locations of state injection."}

However, temperature is not a quantum observable, and most theoretical studies have therefore concentrated on analyzing fundamental precision limits set by the quantum Fisher information through the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. In contrast, whether a direct temperature readout can be achieved in quantum thermometry remains largely unexplored, particularly under the nonequilibrium conditions prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we develop a direct temperature readout scheme based on a thermodynamic inference strategy. The scheme integrates two conceptual developments: (i) By applying the maximum entropy principle with the thermometer's mean energy as a constraint, we assign a reference temperature to the nonequilibrium thermometer. We demonstrate that this reference temperature outperforms a commonly used effective temperature defined through equilibrium analogy. (ii) We obtain positive semi-definite error functions that lower-bound the deviation of the reference temperature from the true temperature-in analogy to the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for the mean squared error-and vanish upon thermalization with the sample. Combining the reference temperature with these error functions, we introduce a notion of corrected dynamical temperature which furnishes a postprocessed temperature readout under nonequilibrium conditions. We validate the corrected dynamical temperature in a qubit-based thermometer under a range of nonequilibrium initial states, confirming its capability to estimate the true temperature. Importantly, we find that increasing quantum coherence can enhance the precision of this readout."}

In this chapter, we examine strategies for integrating QEC and quantum error detection (QED) into QML under realistic resource constraints. We first quantify the resource demands of fully error-corrected QML and propose a partial QEC approach that reduces overhead while enabling error correction. We then demonstrate the application of a simple QED method, evaluating its impact on QML performance and highlighting challenges we have yet to overcome before we achieve fully fault-tolerant QML."}

Subsequently, Gordillo and Puebla pointed out that simulation results depend on whether the state space in the simulations is even or odd [2]. Using additional derivations, they argued that the oscillatory dynamics is unphysical and that the photon number must increase monotonically as a function of the squeezing parameter $r$. We agree with the observation of an even-odd parity dependence in the simulations. We independently noticed the same feature in our simulations after the publication of Ref. [1]. This observation led us to perform a more detailed investigation of the numerical simulation and mathematical aspects of the generalized squeezing problem. Our new findings were reported in Ref. [3]. Further analysis was reported in Ref. [4]. Our conclusion is that the generalized squeezing operator is physically not well defined but can be made well defined when combined with additional information about the physical system under study. We demonstrated this point in the case where we include an additional nonlinear interaction term in the Hamiltonian. We disagree with the claim that the photon number must be a monotonically increasing function of $r$. This claim contradicts the mathematically rigorous results of Ref. [4]. Furthermore, we show that the oscillatory behaviour persists in two closely related, well-behaved models."}

For this, entangled states of high quality and rate must be distributed. Currently, two main types of entanglement distribution protocols exist, namely emission-based and scattering-based, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. On the one hand, scattering-based protocols with cavities or waveguides are fast but demand stringent hardware such as high-efficiency integrated circulators or strong waveguide coupling. On the other hand, emission-based platforms are experimentally feasible but so far rely on Bell-pair fusion with extensive use of slow two-qubit memory gates, limiting thresholds to $\\approx 0.16\\%$. Here, we consider a fully distributed surface code using emission-based entanglement schemes that generate GHZ states in a single shot, i.e., without the need for Bell-pair fusions. We show that our optical setup produces Bell pairs, W states, and GHZ states, enabling both memory-based and optical protocols for distilling high-fidelity GHZ states with significantly improved success rates. Furthermore, we introduce protocols that completely eliminate the need for memory-based two-qubit gates, achieving thresholds of $\\approx 0.19\\%$ with modest hardware enhancements, increasing to above $\\approx 0.24\\%$ with photon-number-resolving detectors.

Under open boundaries, states that would otherwise extend freely become localized at the edges of the finite momentum space, forming quasienergy edge states. While the bulk response measured by the MCD is strongly affected once the evolving wave packet reaches the boundaries, the persistence of these edge states still reflects the bulk-edge correspondence and provides reliable signatures of topological transitions."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose a family of sub-symmetric witnesses (SSWs), which are tractable both theoretically and experimentally. Analytically, we establish a connection between SSWs and the cut space of graph theory, enabling several powerful detection criteria tailored to practical quantum networks. Numerically, we show that the optimal detection can be formulated as a linear program, offering a significant efficiency advantage over the semidefinite programs commonly employed in quantum certification. Experimentally, SSWs can be evaluated via local measurements, with resource requirements independent of the local dimension in general, and even independent of the overall network size in many practical networks."}

We then show that this same quantum theory naturally provides a representation of $Ξ$ in terms of bosonic modes, whose features match those of the Hawking radiation; this facilitates the establishment of precise relations between the phenomenological parameters of the SBH and the microscopic details of the quantum model for $Ξ$. Finally, we recognize that the conditions used to characterize $Γ$ and $Ξ$ coincide with those required by the Page and Wootters mechanism for identifying an evolving system and an associated clock.

In particular, it relies on the ``quantum equilibrium hypothesis'' and accepts explicit nonlocality as fundamental. A deeper completion is available in stochastic mechanics, where the wavefunction and the Born rule emerge from an underlying diffusion process, and in a contextual, category-theoretic semantics in which measurement and EPR--Bell correlations are reinterpreted as features of contextual truth rather than of mysterious dynamics. In this framework, the measurement problem and ``spooky action-at-a-distance'' are dissolved rather than solved. Finally, a dynamics based on Rosen's ``classical Schrödinger equation'' provides a continuous passage between quantum and classical regimes, eliminating any sharp Heisenberg cut."}

By coupling this bath to a target system prior to relaxation, useful thermodynamic tasks can be performed, enabling performance beyond conventional thermodynamic limits. As an application, we analyze information erasure and derive the resulting gain analytically. We further demonstrate the framework by implementing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm on IBM's superconducting quantum processor. Despite substantial noise and errors in current hardware, our method achieves erasure with heat dissipation below the Landauer limit.

The Levin and Rytov approach is applicable in principle to bodies of arbitrary shape if the diffraction loss fields for electric and magnetic dipoles are determined, while the Van Kampen approach is applicable to any plane-layered structure and is quite simple. It is enough to write down the dispersion equations of the plasmon-polaritone structure. The specific dispersion force for a number of structures is calculated based on the Van Kampen method. It is shown that at small gaps, the force (pressure) density changes the inverse fourth-degree dependence on the distance and practically ceases to depend on it at distances less than 1 nm.

This example serves to validate the approach and underscores its potential in simplifying quantum algorithms. Grover's Algorithm was realized through the use of quantum-specific instructions.

Here, we introduce the 1-Bit Quantum Filter, a domain-specific adaptation of HHL that reformulates tracking from matrix inversion to binary ground-state filtering. By replacing high-precision phase estimation with a single-ancilla spectral threshold and exploiting the Hamiltonian's sparsity, we achieve an asymptotic gate complexity of $O(\\sqrt{N} \\log N)$, given Hamiltonian dimension $N$. We validate this approach by simulating LHCb Vertex Locator events with a toy model, and benchmark performance using the noise models of Quantinuum H2 trapped-ion and IBM Heron superconducting processors.

Lett. 126, 153201 (2021), that the current can increase with disorder in the Disorder-Enhanced-Transport (DET) regime. Here, by analyzing models with variable hopping range decaying as $1/r^α$ with the distance $r$ among the sites, we show that the DET regime is a general feature of long-range hopping systems and it occurs, not only in the strong long-range limit $α<1$ but even for weak long-range $1 \\le α\\le 3$. Specifically, we show that, after an initial decrease, the current grows with the disorder strength until it reaches a local maximum. Both disorder thresholds at which the DET regime starts and ends are determined. Our results open the path to understand the effect of disorder on transport in many realistic systems where long range hopping is present."}

It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of many-body quantum states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods reduce the runtime to $O(N d^{2N})$, an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, while exposing substantial parallelism and enabling GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG.jl, which provides a high-performance, GPU-enabled toolbox for computing SRE and mana. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems."}

Electronic spectroscopy data are calculated by time-dependent density function theory and then compared with experimental results. Electronic couplings between exciton donor and acceptor are estimated based on both transition density cube method and transition dipole approximation. These results confirm that the delocalization of exciton to the bridge parts contribute to significant enhancement of donor-acceptor electronic coupling. Mechanistic details of exciton transfer are examined by estimating the contributions of the bridge electronic states, vibrational modes of the dyads commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor, inelastic resonance energy transfer mechanism, and dark exciton states. These analyses suggest that the contribution of common vibrational modes serves as the main source of deviation from Förster's spectral overlap expression."}

We identify the optimal conditions for efficient vortex light transmission, analyze the influence of detuning on transmission efficiency and phase distortion, and specifically examine the scenario where the control field carries OAM the latter being essential for a complete characterization of OAM conservation in the FWM process, while all three aspects have been largely overlooked in the existing literature. Furthermore, we investigated the tunability of the group velocity between the probe and signal fields by modulating the Rabi frequencies of the two control fields and the relative phase between the probe and signal fields during the FWM process.

Here we demonstrate a metasurface-integrated quantum emitter (metaQE) platform enabling room-temperature on-chip generation of single-photon skyrmions. Near-field coupling between QEs and propitiously designed surface arrays of meta-atoms mediates spin-orbit interaction, transforming nanoscale-localized dipole emission into free-propagating topologically structured photonic modes.

While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\\text{TY}(\\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations."}

We show that the effective exciton-vibration coupling provides a powerful mechanism for coherent GHS control: in its absence, the system exhibits a pronounced GHS at resonance, while activating it strongly suppresses the shift. The effective cavity detuning and the cavity length serve as additional tunable parameters for GHS manipulation. Furthermore, increasing the collective exciton-optical coupling enhances the GHS.
