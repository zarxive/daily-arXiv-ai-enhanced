### [1] [Correlation effects in one-dimensional metallic quantum wires under various confinements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17925)
*Vidit Gangwar,Vinod Ashokan,Ankush Girdhar,Klaus Morawetz,N. D. Drummond,K. N. Pathak*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: 研究不同长度量子导体中的电子相关性，通过FRPA方法计算结构因子、对位势等.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子导体中的电子相关性，尤其是不同限制模型下的行为.

Method: 使用第一阶随机相位近似方法计算结构因子、对位势及相关能量.

Result: 不同限制模型下，当b趋近于0时，高密度极限下的相关能量接近同一值，而另一些模型在该极限下相关能量不同。结构因子的锐峰在k=2k_F处高度显著不同，符合有限宽度理论的预测。

Conclusion: 限制模型会影响电子相关性，应选择合适的模型进行研究。

Abstract: Dynamical response theory is used to investigate various transverse
confinements on electron correlations in the ground state of a ferromagnetic
one-dimensional quantum wire for different wire widths $b$ and density
parameters $r_{\rm s}$. Using the first-order random phase approximation
(FRPA), which provides the ground state structure beyond the random phase
approximation, we compute the structure factor, pair-correlation function,
correlation energy, and ground-state energy. The correlation energy depends on
the choice of confinement model and hence effective electron-electron
interaction. For the ultrathin wire ($b\rightarrow 0$) in the high-density
limit, the correlation energy for transverse confinement models $V_1(q)$
(harmonic), $V_2(q)$ (cylindrical), and $V_5(q)$ (harmonic-delta) approaches
$\epsilon_{\rm c}(r_{\rm s})= - \pi^2/360 \sim -0.02741$ a.u., which agrees
with the exact results in this limit [J. Chem. Phys. 138, 064108 (2013); Phys.
Rev. B 101, 075130 (2020)]. For at least these three confinement potentials,
the one-dimensional Coulomb potential can be regularized at interparticle
distance $x=0$ to yield the same correlation energy. In contrast, $V_3(q)$
(infinite square well), $V_4(q)$ (infinite square-infinite triangular well),
and $V_6(q)$ (infinite square-delta well), do not approach the same
high-density limit; instead, the correlation energy tends to $\epsilon_{\rm c}
\sim -0.03002$ a.u. The ground-state properties obtained from the FRPA are
compared with quantum Monte Carlo results. The peak height in the static
structure factor at $k=2k_{\rm F}$ depends significantly on the confinement
model. These peaks are fitted with a function based on our finite wire-width
theory demonstrating good agreement with FRPA.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of atomic and molecular bosons weakly coupled via
Feshbach detuning in the presence of Gaussian white noise. The time-evolution
of the population imbalance between the two species, as well as the coherence
of the system are analyzed using a Bloch sphere model. We observe that the
system exhibits relaxation of the Bloch vector components towards a stable
equilibrium. In the population imbalance dynamics, the relaxation rates
predicted by the Bogoliubov Born Green Kirkwood Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy are
found to be smaller than those calculated with a simple the mean field
approximation. As for the coherence dynamics, the inclusion of correlations and
fluctuations in the system can either increase or decrease the relaxation time,
depending on the initial conditions. We attribute the increase in the
relaxation time to the emergence of a structured noise, and the subsequent
suppression of certain dephasing channels. We also study the impact of
correlations and fluctuations on time-averaged quantities like the drift speed,
the fringe visibility, the phase entanglement etc., and find the results to be
in perfect agreement with the properties of the relaxation dynamics.

### [3] [Dynamics of Quantum Droplets in a Quasi-one-dimensional Framework: An Analytical Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18266)

Motivation: The paper's motivation stems from the recent observation of quantum droplets in Bose-Einstein condensates, prompting a deeper understanding of their dynamics through the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation.

Method: The researchers employ an extended version of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which includes beyond mean field interactions, to investigate droplet formation conditions and the interplay between different interactions.

Result: The study reveals that the competition between mean field and beyond mean field interactions significantly influences the stability and properties of quantum droplets in BEC systems.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive framework to analyze quantum drolet dynamics in BECs, emphasizing the role of different interaction types in droplet formation and behavior.

Abstract: Quantum droplets have been recently observed in dipolar Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) and in BEC mixtures. This forms the motivation for us to
explore the dynamics of these droplets. We make use of the Extended
Gross-Pitaevski equation which apart from the effective mean field (MF)
interaction, also includes a beyond mean field interaction. The competition of
these two interactions in the context of droplet formation is explored.
Further, the conditions for droplet formation are studied.

Method: 他们使用光栅光子晶体量子气体，通过测量自旋波函数来重建消解密度，并通过Kibble-Zurek框架解释其反向幂率缩放。

Result: 他们成功地通过实验测量了二维光栅光子晶体量子气体中的消解密度缩放，并将其与Kibble-Zurek机制进行了解释。

Conclusion: 该研究首次通过实验证明了Kibble-Zurek机制在二维光栅光子晶体量子气体中的适用性，为后续实验研究提供了重要指导。

Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism renders a theoretical framework for
elucidating the formation of topological defects across continuous phase
transitions. Nevertheless, it is not immediately clear whether the KZ mechanism
applies to topological phase transitions. The direct experimental study for
such a topic is hindered by quenching a certain parameter over orders of
magnitude in topological materials. Instead, we investigate the KZ behavior
across topological transitions of a Chern band in two-dimensional (2D) optical
Raman lattices with quantum gases. Defined as the defects, excitation density
is reconstructed via measuring the spin wave functions, with which the
power-law scaling of total excitation density is extracted and such scaling
could be interpreted within the KZ framework. Our work has heralded the
commencement of experimentally exploring the KZ mechanism of the topological
phase transitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate modeling of nerve impulses, considering higher-order nonlinearities in membrane dynamics, inspired the research to develop a generalized model that captures complex signal transmission in biomembranes.

Method: The authors introduced third- and fourth-order polynomial terms into the Heimburg-Jackson model to derive a generalized Duffing-type equation. They then used the factorization method to construct exact travelling wave solutions, including Lambert W-Kink-type solitons.

Result: Novel exact solutions, specifically a new class of Lambert W-Kink-type solitons, were derived, enhancing the understanding of nonlinear electromechanical behavior in nerve membranes and aiding in the theoretical study of pulse propagation.

Conclusion: The generalized model and exact solutions contribute significantly to the theoretical framework of biomembrane dynamics, particularly in understanding nerve impulse propagation.

Abstract: Accurate modelling of nerve impulse propagation requires accounting for
strong higher-order nonlinearities in membrane dynamics, as incorporated in the
extended Heimburg-Jackson model. By introducing third- and fourth-order
polynomial terms into the membrane density equation, we derive a generalized
Duffing-type equation that better captures the complex biophysical states
involved in signal transmission. Applying the factorization method, we
construct exact travelling wave solutions, including a novel class of Lambert
W-Kink-type solitons. These findings provide new analytical insight into the
nonlinear electromechanical behaviour of nerve membranes and contribute to the
theoretical foundation for understanding pulse propagation in biomembranes.

### [6] [Toda lattice formed in nonequilibrium steady states of SWCNT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18412)
*Heeyuen Koh,Shigeo Maruyama*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: 研究通过Toda晶格条件解释低维纳米系统高热传导长度依赖性，提出了一种理论模型将NESS下的热导率与Toda晶格的平衡态联系起来。模型通过对CGMD建立的分子动力学系统模拟，结合Smoluchowski方程推导，验证了在特定条件下势能函数与Toda晶格的一致性。实验结果支持理论，展示了CGMD在理论推导中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Toda晶格在理解低维纳米系统热传导中的作用，通过理论与数值模拟结合，扩展对该系统的理解，特别是在NESS中的表现。

Method: 基于CGMD的分子动力学模拟，构造潜在的Toda晶格结构，利用Smoluchowski方程进行理论推导。

Result: 推导出CGMD在特定条件下的势能与Toda晶格一致，实验结果验证了理论假设。

Conclusion: 理论模型为理解低维纳米系统中的热传导提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Toda lattice or FPUT chain-like dynamics have been regarded as the
prerequisite condition to explain the length dependency of high thermal
conductivity of low-dimensional systems at the nanoscale. In this paper, a
hypothetical condition is introduced that establishes a theoretical connection
between the thermal conductivity of a nanoscale low-dimensional system in
nonequilibrium steady states(NESS) and the canonical motion of the equation in
the Toda lattice in equilibrium. The hypothesis relies on a numerically driven
coarse grained molecular dynamics system acquired from the trajectory data of
nonequilibrium molecular dynamics(NEMD) simulation. It models the macroscopic
motion from longitudinal and flexural modulation observed in NEMD as a separate
Hamiltonian in CGMD with a perturbation term governed by an overdamping
process, which is assumed to be dominant during heat transfer. The Smoluchowski
equation for the perturbation, which is derived from the cross correlated
states between two degrees of freedom, suggests that the potential energy
function induced from NESS is identical to that of Toda Lattice under the
specific condition in the partition function for CG particles. The restrictions
derived from the model are well confirmed by the data from the numerically
driven CG model.

### [7] [Diffusion as a Signature of Chaos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18617)
*Nachiket Karve,Nathan Rose,David Campbell*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: The paper discusses the extension of chaos concepts from classical to quantum systems, focusing on definitions involving adiabatic deformations and the adiabatic gauge potential. It introduces the 'observable drift' as a tool to probe chaos in non-Hamiltonian systems, showing equivalence to sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Numerical examples are provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reconcile chaos definitions between classical and quantum physics, providing a unified probe for chaos characterization across different systems.

Method: Mathematical derivation, numerical simulations using tent map, logistic map, and Chirikov standard map.

Result: Demonstrates 'observable drift' effectively identifies chaos via sensitive dependence on initial conditions and equivalence to weak mixing.

Conclusion: Establishes 'observable drift' as a universal probe for chaos in both Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian systems, enhancing our understanding of chaos definitions across physics domains.

Abstract: While classical chaos is defined via a system's sensitive dependence on its
initial conditions (SDIC), this notion does not directly extend to quantum
systems. Instead, recent works have established defining both quantum and
classical chaos via the sensitivity to adiabatic deformations and measuring
this sensitivity using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP). Building on this
formalism, we introduce the ``observable drift" as a probe of chaos in generic,
non-Hamiltonian, classical systems. We show that this probe correctly
characterizes classical systems that exhibit SDIC as chaotic. Moreover, this
characterization is consistent with the measure-theoretic definition of chaos
via weak mixing. Thus, we show that these two notions of sensitivity (to
changes in initial conditions and to adiabatic deformations) can be probed
using the same quantity, and therefore, are equivalent definitions of chaos.
Numerical examples are provided via the tent map, the logistic map, and the
Chirikov standard map.

### [8] [Effective Pressure of the FRW Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17789)
*Shi-Bei Kong*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 该论文研究了爱因斯坦引力、高斯-博内引力和洛uck引力中FRW宇宙的有效压力，结果显示在高斯-博内引力中，有效压力在N≥6时出现负值，并且存在最小值，而在洛uck引力中有效压力可能有多个零点和极值点。此外，在特定条件下，有效压力等于完美流体的普通压力，这一条件不受引力理论的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究引力理论中不同引力理论对FRW宇宙有效压力的影响，有助于理解不同引力理论下的宇宙演化和动力学行为。

Method: 通过计算不同引力理论下的有效压力，比较了爱因斯坦引力、高斯-博内引力和洛uck引力中的情况，并分析了它们的有效压力的符号、变化趋势以及是否存在极值点。

Result: 爱因斯坦引力中有效压力始终为负，而高斯-博内引力在N≥6时有效压力不总是负且有最小值，洛uck引力中有效压力可有多个零点和极值点。在特定条件下，有效压力等于完美流体压力。

Conclusion: 不同引力理论下FRW宇宙的有效压力表现出不同的性质，这对于理解高维宇宙和引力理论的选择具有重要意义。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the effective pressure of the $N$-dimensional
FRW(Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe in Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet
gravity, and Lovelock gravity. The effective pressure is defined by
$P_{eff}:=-dE/dV$, where $E=\rho V$ is the effective energy and $V$ is the
volume of the FRW universe inside the apparent horizon. The effective pressure
in Einstein gravity is always negative and its absolute value decreases with
the horizon radius $R_A$. The effective pressure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity is
different with the one in Einstein gravity only when $N\geq6$, and in this
case, the effective pressure is not always negative and has a minimum. The
effective pressure in Lovelock gravity can have multiple zero-points and
extreme points. The effective pressure in different dimensions has interesting
relations. We also find that under certain condition, the effective pressure is
equivalent with the `ordinary' pressure $p$ of the perfect fluid, and this
condition do not depend on the specific choice of gravitational theories.

### [9] [Accelerating Expansion of the Universe in modified gravity with quadratic terms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17794)
*Aaqid Bhat*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines various modified gravity theories and their implications for cosmology, inflation, dark matter, and dark energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores different modifications to General Relativity aimed at explaining cosmic acceleration, dark matter, and dark energy.

Method: The study employs different modified gravity frameworks such as teleparallel gravity, $f(T,	ext{T})$ theory, and $f(Q)$ gravity to analyze cosmological implications, inflationary scenarios, and dark matter dynamics.

Result: The results suggest that these modified gravity models provide alternative explanations for cosmic phenomena, including potentially viable alternatives to dark energy, specific behaviors of dark matter, and varying expansion histories.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that exploring modified gravity beyond GR offers promising avenues for understanding the universe's acceleration, inflationary era, dark matter, and dark energy dynamics, with each model providing unique insights that could be tested through future observations.

Abstract: Chapter1 introduces cosmic acceleration and outlines key features and
limitations of GR and its alternatives, including teleparallel and symmetric
teleparallel gravity. In Chapter2, we analyze the cosmological implications of
$f(T,\mathcal{T})$ theory by considering the squared-torsion model
$f(T,\mathcal{T})= \alpha \mathcal{T}+ \beta T^2$, where $T$ represents torsion
and $\mathcal{T}$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. In Chapter3, we
explore the inflationary scenario within the framework of torsion-trace
coupling gravity, utilizing a Lagrangian density derived from a function
denoted as $f(T,\mathcal{T})$. In Chapter4, we aim to investigate the dark
sector of the Universe, which encompasses the enigmatic components of the Dark
Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). We consider an extended form of the Equation
of State (EoS) for DM, widely known as the Extended Bose-Einstein Condensation
(EBEC) EoS for DM. In Chapter5, we propose an extended formulation of symmetric
teleparallel gravity by generalizing the gravitational Lagrangian through the
inclusion of an arbitrary function of $f(Q,\mathcal{T_{\mu\nu}}
\mathcal{T^{\mu\nu}})$. We derived the FRW equations for a flat, homogeneous,
and isotropic spacetime. In Chapter6, we delved into the dark sector of the
Universe, specifically focusing on DM and DE. We examine an extended version of
the EoS for DM, commonly referred to EBEC EoS for DM, given as $p=\alpha \rho +
\beta \rho^2$, alongside the modified $f(Q)$ Lagrangian given by $f(Q)= \gamma
Q^2$.

Motivation: 研究者试图通过热力学性质来约束黑洞，推动对极端条件下的黑洞行为的理解。

Method: 证明了新的黑体熵界限，利用热力学变量的代数不等式，特别是涉及特定条件下黑洞的静止特性。

Result: 发现了新的熵界限，并通过多种例子进行了测试，扩大了 blacks hole entropy 的已知理论。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了 black hole thermodynamics，包括热力学量的导数，为黑洞研究开辟新途径。

Abstract: We propose new bounds on black hole entropy in terms of the specific heat at
fixed charges. For special spherically-symmetric and static black holes
($g_{tt} g_{rr}=-1$), we prove the bounds with suitable sufficient energy
conditions. For more general static and rotating black holes, we test the
bounds with a variety of examples. This work extends the previously-known
algebraic inequalities of the black hole thermodynamic variables such as the
Penrose inequality, to include their derivatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了探索不依赖外物质实现黑洞穿越的可能性，研究使用双曲对称性。

Method: 采用了广义复杂性因子，针对双曲对称性设计，结合合适的红移函数，构造了类似托affle斯卡尔 traversable wormhole。

Result: 得出了一个已经存在负能量密度的解，该解替代了负的静力平衡，放宽了对能量条件的要求。

Conclusion: 提供了不依赖外物质实现 wormhole 通透性的新方法，放宽了对物质条件的要求。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of exact solutions for traversable wormhole
geometries in a static and hyperbolic symmetric spacetime. In the conventional
form of studying wormhole geometry, traversability requires the presence of
exotic matter, which also provides negative gravity effects to keep the
wormhole throat open. Using hyperbolic symmetry we obtain a solution already
provided with negative energy density that replaces this effect and allows us
to derive wormhole geometries that effectively violate the null energy
condition. To achieve this goal, we use a generalized complexity factor for
hyperbolic symmetry adapted to study wormhole geometries and with a suitable
redshift function in order to construct a Casimir-like traversable hyperbolic
wormhole. A detailed study has been conducted on the behavior of the matter
sector, the energy conditions, and the traversability conditions.

Result: 对于 PsrJ 1713+0747，得到了 Ġ/G 的范围，并在限制条件下约束了引力辐射参数 κD。

Conclusion: 结果与广义相对论一致，支持 GR 的预测。

Abstract: Binary pulsars offer a unique natural laboratory to test General Relativity
(GR) and probe for deviations from its paradigm, as predicted by alternative
theories of gravity. In this paper, we study two such possible deviations: a
time variation of Newton's constant $G$ and the emission of dipolar
gravitational radiation. We use updated data for some well-known pulsars,
namely PSR J1738+0333, PSR J1012+5307, and PSR J1713+0747, to extract the
Keplerian and post-Keplerian parameters that characterize their orbital
dynamics, using recent high-precision pulsar timing data and a Bayesian
parameter estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We do
this via the TEMPO2 software, the MCMC4Tempo2 plugin, and a unified python
pipeline to analyze the data. We then perform a combined analysis of different
binary systems to constrain both the time evolution of Newton's constant and
the dipolar emission parameter $\kappa_D$. For the best of our three pulsars
(PSR J1713+0747), we obtain $\dot{G}/G = (0.32 \pm 0.31) \times
10^{-12}~\text{yr}^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence, along with a stringent constraint
on the dipolar emission parameter, $\kappa_D = (-0.04 \pm 0.14) \times
10^{-4}$. Thanks to the recent high-precision timing data sets, we provide
updated bounds on key parameters relevant to modified gravity theories, and we
find that our results are consistent with GR.

*Ehsan Ebrahimian,Ali Akbar Abolhasani,Mehrdad Mirbabayi*

TL;DR: 研究由可测量的PBH形成效率，发现其在物质阶段比辐射阶段效率稍低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨PBH形成在物质阶段的可行性及其影响，特别是在早期宇宙结构中的角色。

Method: 通过分析质心势的演化方程和白噪声模型，评估不同形状和尺度的波动阈值。

Result: 得出PBH形成速率比在辐射阶段低，需质心势值为约$10^{-1}$，而CMB观测值可能不足以支持PBH。

Conclusion: PBH在物质阶段形成效率较低，未来需要进一步研究或观测支持。

Abstract: We study Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) formed by the collapse of rare
primordial fluctuations during an early period of Matter Domination. The
collapse threshold strongly depends on the shape of the peaks, decreasing as
they become flatter and hence rarer. In the extreme limit of a top-hat
perturbation, Harada, Kohri, Sasaki, Terada, and Yoo have argued that the
growth of velocity dispersion prevents the formation of black holes unless the
initial peak is larger than $\zeta_{\rm th} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{2/5}$.
Including the shape distribution of the peaks, we find that for a realistic
cosmic abundance of PBHs, the effective threshold is larger, $\zeta_{\rm th}
\sim \zeta_{\rm rms }^{1/10}$. And this model requires $\zeta_{\rm rms}\sim
10^{-1}$, which is much larger than the observed value at the CMB scales.
Hence, PBH formation during Matter Domination is barely more efficient than
Radiation Domination. We estimate the dimensionless spin parameter to be
$a_{\rm rms} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{7/4}\ll 1$, slightly larger than PBHs formed
in Radiation Domination.

Result: 发现随着黑洞质量变化，某些模型允许更大的调节尺度，影响暗物质密度上限。

Conclusion: 提出了结合黑洞和暗物质机制的新模型，用于解释暗物质的存在及其对能量的观测影响。

Abstract: We consider phenomenological models for nonsingular black hole that satisfy
the limiting curvature condition (i.e., that have curvatures that are always
sub-Planckian in size) while having a more general dependence on the black hole
mass than the most studied examples. These models allow black holes to exist
while having regulators that are larger than the horizon scale; it has been
shown previously that this can lead to observable consequences in an
astrophysical setting, for allowed choices for the regulator scale. Noting that
substantial horizon-scale modifications of the metric will affect black hole
thermodynamics and Hawking radiation, we study these metrics in the context of
primordial black hole dark matter. Considering examples with de\,Sitter and
Minkowski cores, respectively, we study the effect of the regulator in these
metrics on the allowed black hole mass ranges (or ``bands"), the black hole
temperature, specific heat and lifetime, and the bounds on the primordial black
hole fraction of the total dark matter density from the observed extragalactic
gamma ray background.

Abstract: In general relativity, the Einstein equations provide spherically symmetric
static spacetimes with dynamics defined as an evolution along the radial
coordinate $r$. The geometrical sector becomes a one-dimensional mechanical
system, with the Misner-Sharp mass and lapse as canonically conjugate
variables, and a vanishing Hamiltonian for pure gravity. Coupling classical or
quantum matter fields, or introducing (quantum) corrections to general
relativity, then generate a non-vanishing effective Hamiltonian, leading to
non-trivial evolutions of the mass and lapse. We illustrate this mechanism
through various examples of classical matter fields and identify Hamiltonians
describing the effective dynamics of gravity coupled to perfect fluids with
linear barotropic equation of state. Finally, we derive effective Hamiltonians
that reproduce the gravitational semi-classical dynamics coupled to
renormalized quantum matter fields and discuss the conditions for which the
singularity at $r=0$ is resolved. In particular, we find a singularity-free
black-hole-like solution, stabilized by quantum matter, smoothly transitioning
from a bulk with constant negative Ricci scalar to the standard outside
Schwarzschild metric. This opens new possibilities for the modeling of both
semi-classical corrections and deep quantum effects on the interior structure
of self-gravitating compact objects and black holes.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于时空泡沫和欧几里得量子引力的拓扑暗能量模型，通过ABIC和DIC信息准则相比ΛCDM模型，表现出更好的数据拟合效果。模型中暗能量密度与空间曲率有关，且表现出与暗物质的相互作用。通过使用多种宇宙观测数据，如Ia型 supernova、BAO和CC数据，TDE模型在ΛCDM模型之上具有统计学上的优势。此外，模型符合大爆炸轻元素合成的条件，没有破坏宇宙的热历史。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者认为标准Lambda CDM模型在数据拟合方面存在不足，因此提出了一种新的拓扑暗能量模型，旨在通过引入时空 foam 中的拓扑结构和量子引力效应来改进暗能量的描述和对宇宙加速膨胀的解释。

Method: 研究者使用了爱因斯坦-高斯-博恩重力模型，结合欧几里得量子引力的方法，导出了一个与拓扑 instanton 密度相关的有效动态暗能量项。通过求解相应的微分方程，研究者能够描述暗能量密度随宇宙演化的机制。研究利用了多种宇宙观测数据，如Ia型 supernova、BAO和CC数据，结合AIC和DIC信息准则进行模型比较。

Conclusion: 研究结论认为，引入拓扑暗能量模型可以显著改进对宇宙加速膨胀的描述，尤其在数据拟合方面优于ΛCDM。虽然模型在某些细节仍需进一步观察，但其在暗物质与暗能量相互作用以及解决宇宙早期轻元素合成问题方面具有潜力。这种模型为更精确理解暗能量的本质提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Using only the standard considerations of spacetime foam and the Euclidean
Quantum Gravity techniques known long ago, we result to a model of Topological
Dark Energy (TDE) that outperforms the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm with
regard to data fitting efficiency. Specifically, it is known that at the foam
level, topologically non-trivial solutions such as instantons appear. In the
particular case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain an effective
dynamical dark energy term proportional to the instanton density, and the
latter can be easily calculated through standard techniques. Hence, we can
immediately extract the differential equation that determines the evolution of
the topologically induced effective dark energy density. Significantly, this
TDE scenario allows for changing sign of dark energy during the cosmic
evolution and also exhibits Dark Energy interaction with Dark Matter. We
confront the TDE scenario, in both flat and non-flat cases, with
Pantheon+/SH0ES Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations
(BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) datasets. By applying standard model
selection methods (AIC and DevIC information criteria), we find a moderate but
statistically significant preference over $\Lambda$CDM scenario. Finally, we
show that the TDE scenario passes constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
(BBN) and thus does not spoil the thermal history of the Universe.

*Gang Wang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper compares TDI configurations for GW missions, finding that high-frequency performance depends on configuration, and short-span PD4L is best. conclusion:The paper concludes that the PD4L TDI scheme with short time span is optimal for high-frequency GW detection. motivate:The paper explores various TDI schemes, highlighting their performance trade-offs, especially in high-frequency regimes, and suggests the PD4L design as a superior option. method: The authors conducted a comparative study, analyzing the high-frequency performance of different TDI configurations through frequency and time domain analyses. result: The study found that shorter time span configurations perform better in high frequencies due to less null frequencies. conclusion: The optimal TDI scheme is PD4L with a short time span. tldr:The study shows that TDI configurations differ significantly in high-frequency GW detection, recommending PD4L for space-based missions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores various Time-Delay Interference (TDI) configurations for space-based gravitational wave missions, comparing their performance under different frequency regimes. The study highlights the trade-offs between configurations, particularly in high-frequency detection, and recommends the PD4L scheme as optimal. This is crucial for future GW missions relying on precise waveform modeling and noise suppression, as understanding these trade-offs helps in choosing the best design for mission success.

Method: The authors conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of different TDI configurations. They evaluated the performance of these configurations across various frequencies, particularly focusing on high-frequency regimes where GW wavelengths become comparable to arm lengths. The analysis included both frequency domain assessments, such as noise suppression and null frequencies, and time domain evaluations, considering the impact on waveform modeling and parameter recovery.

Result: Various TDI configurations for space-based GW missions were compared. In high-frequency regimes, shorter time span TDI schemes with fewer null frequencies performed better, achieved more accurate waveform modeling and parameter recovery. In contrast, longer time span configurations, like the Michelson interferometer, were more susceptible to frequency aliasing and waveform modulation effects, affecting inference accuracy. This difference is less pronounced in the time domain where all configurations perform similarly.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the PD4L TDY scheme with a short time span is the optimal choice for future space-based gravitational wave missions. Its superior high-frequency performance ensures better noise suppression, accurate waveform modeling, and improved parameter recovery, making it more reliable than longer time span configurations especially in challenging high-frequency environments.

Abstract: Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) is essential for space-based gravitational
wave (GW) missions, as it suppresses laser frequency noise and achieve the
required sensitivity. Beyond the standard Michelson configuration, a variety of
second-generation TDI schemes have been proposed, each utilizing different
combinations of inter-spacecraft laser links. In this work, we conduct a
comparative study of several representative TDI configurations with varying
time spans and demonstrate that their (quasi-)orthogonal channels are highly
correlated, indicating substantial redundancy among these schemes. In the
low-frequency regime, the performance of different TDI configurations are
nearly identical. Their distinctions emerge primarily at high frequencies,
where the GW wavelength becomes comparable to the arm length. In this regime,
shorter TDI time spans with minimal null frequencies facilitate more accurate
waveform modeling and parameter recovery in frequency domain. In contrast,
configurations with longer time spans and more null frequencies, such as the
Michelson, are more susceptible to frequency aliasing and waveform modulation
effects, which degrade inference accuracy. However, if signal modeling and
analysis are performed in the time domain, all TDI configurations become
effectively equivalent. Considering the usability in both frequency and time
domain, the short-span PD4L scheme, which exhibits minimal nulls and superior
performance in high frequencies, emerges as a promising candidate for future
space-based GW mission designs.

Abstract: In $3+1$ dimensions, we study the stability of Kasner solutions for the
Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field-Vlasov system. This system incorporates gravity,
electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions for the initial stage of our
universe. Due to the presence of the Vlasov field, various new challenges
arise. By observing detailed mathematical structures and designing new delicate
arguments, we identify a new strong sub-critical regime and prove the nonlinear
stability with Kasner exponents lying in this full regime. This extends the
result of Fournodavlos-Rodnianski-Speck [8] from the Einstein-scalar field
system to the physically more complex system with the Vlasov field.

### [19] [Searching for Gravitational Waves with Gaia and its Cross-Correlation with PTA: Absolute vs Relative Astrometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18593)
*Massimo Vaglio,Mikel Falxa,Giorgio Mentasti,Arianna I. Renzini,Adrien Kuntz,Enrico Barausse,Carlo Contaldi,Alberto Sesana*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper discusses the use of Gaia-like missions for detecting gravitational waves through astrometric deflection. It focuses on a relative astrometry approach that avoids systematic orientation errors, using angular correlation functions. A Fisher matrix analysis shows that while the relative method is effective, it's limited by star pairs too close together within the same field of view, and larger separations might not be feasible due to scanning laws. The paper also suggests that combining astrometry with pulsar timing arrays improves detection sensitivity above ~1e-7 Hz.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The detection of gravitational waves using astrometric methods has potential importance, as it could offer an independent probe of gravitational wave backgrounds. This paper seems to address some challenges in improving the sensitivity of such methods, which could be crucial for confirming or narrowing down the properties of the gravitational wave background.

Method: The authors model the astrometric response and the overlap reduction functions for relative astrometry, correcting previous results. They employ a Fisher matrix analysis to compare relative and absolute astrometry approaches, also integrating pulsar timing arrays for additional sensitivity at higher frequencies.

Result: The key finding is that relative astrometry can mitigate systematic errors, but is limited when observing closely spaced stars. The study suggests that larger separations might theoretically offer better sensitivity, but due to the scanning law of Gaia-like missions, these pairs are practically inaccessible. Combining with pulsar timing arrays improves sensitivity in the higher frequency range.

Conclusion: The study contributes to assessing the potential and limitations of astrometric methods for detecting gravitational waves, particularly through relative astrometry, and suggests that additional data sources can enhance detection prospects in specific frequency ranges.

Abstract: Astrometric missions like Gaia provide exceptionally precise measurements of
stellar positions and proper motions. Gravitational waves traveling between the
observer and distant stars can induce small, correlated shifts in these
apparent positions, a phenomenon known as astrometric deflection. The precision
and scale of astrometric datasets make them well-suited for searching for a
stochastic gravitational wave background, whose signature appears in the
two-point correlation function of the deflection field across the sky. Although
Gaia achieves high accuracy in measuring angular separations in its focal
plane, systematic uncertainties in the satellite's absolute orientation limit
the precision of absolute position measurements. These orientation errors can
be mitigated by focusing on relative angles between star pairs, which
effectively cancel out common-mode orientation noise. In this work, we compute
the astrometric response and the overlap reduction functions for this relative
astrometry approach, correcting previous expressions presented in the
literature. We use a Fisher matrix analysis to compare the sensitivity of
relative astrometry to that of conventional absolute astrometry. Our analysis
shows that while the relative method is theoretically sound, its sensitivity is
limited for closely spaced star pairs within a single Gaia field of view. Pairs
with large angular separations could provide competitive sensitivity, but are
practically inaccessible due to Gaia's scanning law. Finally, we demonstrate
that combining astrometric data with observations from pulsar timing arrays
leads to slight improvements in sensitivity at frequencies greater than
approximately 10^-7 Hz.

TL;DR: SPLENDOR is a new dark matter detector leveraging advanced materials and sensing technologies to achieve sub-eV sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The search for WIMP dark matter in the sub-eV mass range is challenging, and this paper introduces a novel detector design to improve sensitivity.

Method: The project uses Eu5In2Sb6 as the target material and cryo-HEMT amplifiers for single-electron resolution.

Result: The prototype achieved 20±7 electrons resolution, aligned with theoretical expectations, and sensitivity is projected for sub-electron resolution.

Conclusion: SPLENDOR represents a breakthrough in dark matter detection, combining material science and quantum sensing for new opportunities in sub-MeV range.

Abstract: We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector
platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge
readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV
scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to
accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies.
SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated
f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not
only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming
dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily
modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic
high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching
single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of
Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype
detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier
chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon
test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a
demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment
in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results.
Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of
athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background
environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing
performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our
ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR
provides a novel approach to dark matter detection, combining quantum sensing
with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass
range of dark matter parameter space.

Motivation: 医学成像和γ射线天文学都需要准确定位 photon 的三维位置，该研究尝试解决现有方法的噪声敏感性和系统偏差问题。

Method: 研究利用最大似然估计结合积分基参数，建立 pulse shape 参数与三维位置的映射，模拟验证该方法在低噪声条件下的恢复效果。

Result: 在100 keV photon 下，最大 Z 方向的重建偏置在低噪声条件下得到显著降低，且在高噪声条件（≥1 keV RMS）下，通过积分基参数提升探测器的分辨率。

Conclusion: 该研究为 HPGe 检测器在医学 imaging 和 γ射线天文学中的应用提供了更可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Orthogonal-strip planar high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors can
reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) positions of photon interactions through
analysis of parameters extracted from multiple charge signals. The conventional
method independently reconstructs positions in each dimension using
amplitude-based parameters, leading to noise sensitivity and systematic biases.
In this study, we propose a multi-parameter-joint reconstruction method based
on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which establishes a mapping between
pulse shape parameters and corresponding 3D positions. To mitigate the effects
of electronic noise, we employ integral-based parameters. The reconstruction
performance was evaluated using pulse shape simulations. For 100 keV photons
under 1 keV root-mean-square (RMS) electronic noise, the maximum Z
reconstruction bias was reduced from 0.4 mm to 0.02 mm in the central region
and from 2 mm to 0.15 mm near the electrodes. The maximum reconstruction bias
in the X/Y directions was reduced from 0.4 mm to 0.016 mm. Furthermore, the use
of integral-based parameters mitigated the rapid degradation of resolution
under high-noise conditions. The achieved position resolution ranged from 0.07
mm to 0.16 mm in the Z directions and from 0.07 mm to 0.44 mm in the X/Y
direction. This method offers a promising approach to 3D position
reconstruction with HPGe detectors for applications such as medical imaging and
gamma-ray astronomy.

*Nils Leander Weickhardt,Artem Basaleav,Oliver Gerberding*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: This paper discusses the development of compact laser interferometric sensors (COBRIs) to reduce control-induced displacement noise in ground-based gravitational wave detectors. The focus is on improving the longitudinal stability of the measurements by 5 Hz using these sensors in conjunction with active damping systems. The authors present a design and simulations showing COBRIs' potential superiority over shadow sensors in the frequency range below 30 Hz, particularly at 6 Hz where their noise performance surpasses that of shadow sensors. Simulated noise levels achieved include 8.0e-19 m/√Hz, 1.2e-18 m/√Hz, and 2.0e-19 m/√Hz. The key limitations in achieving the target noise levels are identified, and required improvements to the testing facility include better seismic isolation and damping systems. Overall, the paper suggests promising results for COBRIs in enhancing interferometric measurements in gravitational wave detection systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave detectors are important for astrophysical research. Control-induced noise limits their performance below 30 Hz, making improvements crucial. COBRIs offer a promising solution through compact interferometric sensors with deep frequency modulation, which is essential for achieving the required noise reduction. This paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of COBRIs in improving the longitudinal noise, enabling better detection of gravitational waves.

Method: The authors designed an experiment using two HAM Relay Triple Suspension systems. They mounted COBRIs on these systems to measure cavity length stability relative to a reference. Simulations based on mechanical models of HRTS suspensions were performed to predict noise levels and identify sources of noise. The effects of interferometric sensor damping and the current testing facility's limitations were modeled, aiming to achieve the target noise at 5 Hz. The results included noise simulations and an analysis of necessary improvements in the facility's seismic isolation and damping systems.

Result: The paper presents a design for an interferometric sensor-based system. Simulations with mechanical models revealed achievable noise levels, including 8.0e-19 m/√Hz, 1.2e-18 m/√Hz, and 2.0e-19 m/√Hz. These results suggest improved longitudinal noise reduction when using COBRIs compared to shadow sensors. The simulations also indicated the current system's limitations, such as the need for better seismic pre-isolation and damping, to achieve the targeted noise levels of around 5 Hz.

Conclusion: The study concludes that COBRIs significantly enhance the longitudinal displacement noise performance in gravitational wave detectors, particularly effective around 6 Hz where their noise surpasses that of shadow sensors. However, current testing facilities have limitations requiring improvements like advanced seismic isolation and damping systems. The proposed design and simulation results demonstrate the potential of COBRIs to improve interferometric measurements, offering a promising solution for reducing control-induced noise in ground-based detectors.

Abstract: One of the limiting noise sources of ground-based gravitational wave
detectors at frequencies below 30 Hz is control-induced displacement noise.
Compact laser interferometric sensors are a prime candidate for improved local
displacement sensing. In this paper we present the design of an experiment that
aims to demonstrate the advantages of interferometric sensors over shadow
sensors. We focus on the compact balanced readout interferometer (COBRI) - a
sensor currently in development that is based on deep frequency modulation. We
mount COBRIs on two HAM Relay Triple Suspension (HRTS) systems that suspend two
mirrors forming an optical cavity. By measuring the length stability of this
cavity relative to a stable reference we aim to probe the direct motion
reduction when using COBRIs for active damping and we aim to investigate their
behavior and auxiliary functions, such as absolute ranging, in the context of
the 6 degree-of-freedom controls of the suspensions. Here we describe the
design of the experiment and simulations of the achievable noise levels that
were obtained using mechanical models of the HRTS suspensions. We discuss all
relevant noise sources, the modeled influence of the interferometric sensor
damping and the current limitations and necessary improvements of our testing
facility in terms of seismic pre-isolation to achieve a shadow sensor limited
noise at around 5 Hz, where, according to our simulations, we can demonstrate
superior performance for COBRIs in the longitudinal degree of freedom.

Abstract: The performance of amorphous selenium (a-Se) as a cryogenic photodetector
material is evaluated through a series of experiments using laterally
structured devices operated in a custom optical test stand. These studies
investigate the response of a-Se detectors to low-photon fluxes at high
electric fields near avalanche conditions, the linearity of the photoconductive
response over a wide dynamic range and the direct detection of narrowband 130

shows reliable single-shot detection with efficiencies greater than or equal to
80 percent and area under the curve (AUC) greater than or equal to 0.85 using
as few as approximately 6800 incident 401 nm photons, corresponding to
approximately 3400 photons within field-active regions after accounting for
geometric constraints. Measurements are performed at cryogenic temperatures
using calibrated photon fluxes derived from a silicon photomultiplier reference
and a characterized optical filter stack. Additional experiments using a
tellurium-doped a-Se (a-SeTe) device explore the material's behavior under
identical test conditions and demonstrate that avalanche is achievable in
a-SeTe at cryogenic temperatures. The results demonstrate reproducible
low-noise operation, VUV sensitivity and field-dependent gain behavior in a
lateral a-Se architecture, representing the first reported observation of
avalanche multiplication in laterally structured a-Se and a-SeTe devices at
cryogenic temperatures. These findings support the potential integration of
laterally structured a-Se devices into next-generation pixelated liquid-argon
time projection chambers (TPCs) requiring scalable, high-field-compatible
photon detection systems.

### [25] [Oligonucleotide selective detection by levitated optomechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17940)
*Timothy Wilson,Owen J. L. Rackham,Hendrik Ulbricht*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The study uses optomechanical experiments with SiNPs to detect oligonucleotide signals, employing several analytical methods like Lorentzian curve fitting and machine learning to distinguish functionalized particles from non-functionalized ones. However, transmission electron microscopy didn't show visual differences, suggesting other sensing methods might be needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a method for detecting specific nucleic acid sequences using optomechanical sensors. Previous methods may not have provided sufficient sensitivity, so they explore using silica nanoparticles as sensors, which can be trapped and analyzed optically.

Method: The study involves functionalizing silica nanoparticles with oligonucleotides and then using a 1550 nm laser in a vacuum environment to trap them. They measure oscillation frequencies, amplitudes, and use optical interferometry for precise detection. Analytical methods include Lorentzian curve fitting, linear discriminant analysis, and random forest modeling. Transmission electron microscopy is also used but doesn't show clear differences.

Result: They successfully detect specific oligonucleotide signals with varying frequencies and amplitudes depending on the particle type. Machine learning models correctly identify different particles. However, TEM didn't show visual differences, so they suggest further testing with other imaging methods.

Conclusion: While the method effectively distinguishes particle types based on their mechanical properties, visual differences weren't observed. This indicates a potential need for complementary imaging techniques to enhance the detection capabilities.

Abstract: Here we examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in
sensitive optomechanical experiments. Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were
functionalized using ZnCl$_2$ and 25-mers of single-stranded deoxyadenosine and
deoxythymidine monophosphate which were optically trapped by a 1550 nm
wavelength laser in vacuum. In the optical trap, SiNPs behave as harmonic
oscillators, and their oscillation frequency and amplitude can be precisely
detected by optical interferometry. The data was compared across particle
types, revealing differences in frequency, width and amplitude of peaks with
respect to motion of the SiNPs which can be explained by a theoretical model.
Data obtained from this platform was analyzed by fitting Lorentzian curves to

### [27] [Temporal Broadening of Attosecond Pulse Trains Induced by Multi-Band inference in Solid-State High-Order Harmonic Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18019)
*Qing-Guo Fan,Kang Lai,Wen-hao Liu,Zhi Wang,Lin-Wang Wang,Jun-Wei Luo*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper uses TDDFT to study solid-state effects in HHG, showing that multiband physics is key. The research reveals that symmetry-related optical transitions affect the temporal phase of APT, making it challenging to extract IAPs. This improves understanding of HHG mechanisms and provides strategies for generating isolated attosecond pulses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to deepen the understanding of how solid-state materials affect high harmonic generation, which is a fundamental process in laser physics. By investigating multiband mechanisms and the impact of symmetry on phase shifts, the research seeks to contribute to the development of methods for isolating attosecond pulses, which have applications in various scientific fields.

Method: The researchers employed time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to model the electronic structure of bulk silicon. Their analysis focused on the occupation of electrons in different energy bands and the effects of symmetry on optical transitions between conduction and valence bands.

Result: The study found that the temporal characteristics of attosecond pulse trains (APTs) are significantly influenced by the occupation of electrons across multiple energy bands. Additionally, it identified that the symmetry of the material leads to forbidden or allowed optical transitions between different bands, which contribute to phase shifts in the emitted harmonics, affecting the extraction of isolated attosecond pulses (IAPs).

Conclusion: The findings of this paper enhance our understanding of high harmonic generation mechanisms in solid-state materials. By identifying the role of multiband physics and symmetry in optical transitions, the research provides a theoretical foundation for controlling and optimizing attosecond pulse generation, paving the way for applications in attosecond pulse technology and related fields.

Abstract: The mechanism underlying high harmonic generation (HHG) in gases has been
well clarified, characterizing attosecond pulse trains (APT) in the time
domain, significantly advances the synthesis of isolated attosecond pulse
(IAP). However, the complexity of HHG in solid obstacles IAP separation. Here,
we use time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to investigate the
multiband mechanism of APT in solid state with bulk silicon as prototype. Our
research unveils that: 1. The temporal characteristics of APT can be
characterized by the occupation of electrons in different energy bands. 2. Due
to the temporal occupation difference caused by optical transition allowed (or
forbidden) by symmetry between different conduction bands and valence bands, a
harmful phase shift in harmonics emission to APT for extracting IAP occurs. Our
findings not only shed light on the mechanisms behind solid-state HHG but also
provide new avenues to control APT to generate IAP.

*Yahya Saleh,Zachary Louis-Seize,Timothy Hodges,David Girard,Mohammed Shakir,Mathis Turgeon-Roy,Francis Doyon-D'Amour,Chang Zhang,Arnaud Weck,Raphael St-Gelais*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of a rapid prototyping tool for SiN nanomechanical resonators, reducing time, complexity, and improving mechanical quality factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and accurate prototyping of SiN nanomechanical resonators is addressed, as traditional methods are slow, inflexible, and prone to defects.

Method: The researchers developed and utilized an open-source software toolset that converts standard semiconductor layout files into laser-ablated hole sequences, allowing for complex SiN resonator geometries to be fabricated efficiently.

Result: The method significantly accelerated the fabrication process for SiN resonators and demonstrated high mechanical quality factors, comparable to conventional methods.

Conclusion: This toolset represents a major advancement, enabling the rapid and precise production of SiN nanomechanical resonators with exceptional mechanical integrity.

Abstract: Research on silicon nitride (SiN) nanomechanical resonators produces an
exceptionally rich variety of resonator geometries, for which there is
currently no available rapid prototyping solution. Experimental advances in
nanobeam, trampoline, phononic bandgap, and soft-clamping structures all rely
on conventional nanofabrication involving e-beam or photolithography, followed
by various etching steps. These techniques are typically time-consuming,
relatively inflexible, and often result in spurious residual SiN overhang that
can degrade mechanical quality factors. In contrast, recent work has shown that
simple resonant structures, such as nanobeams, can be prototyped by direct
laser ablation of free-standing SiN membranes using a spatially distributed
sequence of microholes that limits stress concentration. However, these early
demonstrations were restricted to basic shapes, created by manually combining
ablation routines for circles and straight lines. Here, we demonstrate the
fabrication of arbitrarily complex geometries using an open-source software
toolset--released with this publication--that automatically generates
laser-ablated hole sequences directly from standard semiconductor layout files
(i.e., GDSII). The software includes a layout alignment tool that compensates
for the membrane orientation and dimensional variations, limiting material
overhang to ~2 um. Using this toolset, we fabricate several resonator
geometries, each in under 1 hour, two of which are exhaustively characterized
as candidate structures for high-performance radiation sensing. The measured
quality factors of these structures closely match finite element simulations
and reach values up to 3.7 x 10^6. From these measurements, we extract material
quality factors above 3700, which is on par with low-stress SiN unablated plain
membranes and with comparable structures produced using conventional
fabrication methods.

Result: 实验结果显示多色孤子之间实现了部分或完全的相位锁死，符合理论预测。这种现象为未来的微分 comb 应用提供了新的可能性。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证，多色孤子的形成和相位锁死在微分 comb 中是可行的，这为研究更复杂的孤子结构及其在通信和计算中的应用奠定了基础。这也为微分 comb 设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: In microcombs, solitons can drive non-soliton-forming modes to induce optical
gain. Under specific conditions, a regenerative secondary temporal pulse
coinciding in time and space with the exciting soliton pulse will form at a new
spectral location. A mechanism involving Kerr-induced pulse interactions has
been proposed theoretically, leading to multicolor solitons containing
constituent phase-locked pulses. However, the occurrence of this phenomenon
requires dispersion conditions that are not naturally satisfied in conventional
optical microresonators. Here, we report the experimental observation of
multicolor pulses from a single optical pump in a way that is closely related
to the concept of multicolor solitons. The individual soliton pulses share the
same repetition rate and could potentially be fully phase-locked. They are
generated using interband coupling in a compound resonator.

Abstract: We present a straightforward method to extend the noise-tracking bandwidth
for self-correction algorithms in free-running dual-comb interferometry,
leveraging coherent-harmonic-enhanced dual-comb spectroscopy. As a proof of
concept, we employed both this novel architecture and a conventional one to
perform free-running dual-comb spectroscopy of a
$\text{H}^{13}\text{C}^{14}\text{N}$ gas cell, demonstrating a 20-fold increase
in tracking bandwidth at the same spectral resolution of 12.5 MHz. Since this
approach improves the tracking bandwidth by generating harmonic centerbursts
within an interferogram period, it decouples the tracking bandwidth from the
repetition rate difference, thus avoiding spectral acquisition bandwidth
narrowing. This significantly broadens the outlook for free-running dual-comb
spectroscopy.

Abstract: Efficient coupling between light and bulk plasmons (BPs) remains a central
challenge because of their inherent mode mismatch, limited penetration depth,
and pronounced resonant energy mismatch between visible-range photons and BPs.
In this work, we demonstrate that ultrafast free electrons can coherently
mediate an interaction between electromagnetic fields and BPs at the nanoscale.
An electron pulse emitted from the photocathode of ultrafast transmission
electron microscope, functions as a quantum intermediary that is capable of
simultaneously interacting with the laser field by multiphoton processes and
BPs by perturbative scattering. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy can capture
this indirect interaction, the final electron energy distribution encodes both
quantum pathways arising from distinct combinations of multiphoton absorption
and emission and BP scattering events. Interference among these pathways gives
rise to characteristic spectral modulations, directly revealing the exchange of
energy and information between photons and BPs via the electron delivery. Our
results show that femtosecond-driven, ultrafast electrons provide a viable
route to modulate and even control bulk plasmon excitations in a volume,
thereby extending beyond the conventional nanoplasmonics schemes on
manipulating surface plasmons by light. This indirect light-BP interaction
paves the promising way for exploring fundamental light-matter interaction at
ultrafast and nanometer scales.

Abstract: The forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) and beyond (XG) wireless networks are
poised to operate across an expansive frequency range from microwave,
millimeter-wave to terahertz bands to support ubiquitous connectivity in
diverse application scenarios. This necessitates a one-size-fits-all hardware
solution that can be adaptively reconfigured within this wide spectrum to
support full-band coverage and dynamic spectrum management. However, existing
electrical or photonic-assisted wireless communication solutions see
significant challenges in meeting this demand due to the limited bandwidths of
individual devices and the intrinsically rigid nature of their system
architectures. Here, we demonstrate adaptive wireless communications over an
unprecedented frequency range spanning over 100 GHz, driven by a universal
thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic wireless engine. Leveraging the
strong Pockels effect and excellent scalability of the TFLN platform, we
achieve monolithic integration of essential functional elements, including
baseband modulation, broadband wireless-photonic conversion, and reconfigurable
carrier/local signal generation. Powered by broadband tunable optoelectronic
oscillators, our signal sources operate across a record-wide frequency range
from 0.5 GHz to 115 GHz with high frequency stability and consistent coherence.
Based on the broadband and reconfigurable integrated photonic solution, we
realize, for the first time, full-link wireless communication across 9
consecutive bands, achieving record lane speeds of up to 100 Gbps. The
real-time reconfigurability further enables adaptive frequency allocation, a
crucial capability to ensure enhanced reliability in complex spectrum
environments. Our proposed system marks a significant step towards future
full-spectrum and omni-scenario wireless networks.

Abstract: The inverse design of metasurfaces poses a considerable challenge because of
the intricate interdependencies that exist between structural characteristics
and electromagnetic responses. Traditional optimization methods require
significant computational resources and frequently do not produce the most
effective solutions. This study presents a hybrid quantum-classical machine
learning approach known as Latent Style-based Quantum GAN (LaSt-QGAN). This
method integrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Quantum Generative
Adversarial Network (QGAN) to enhance the optimization of metasurface designs
aimed at achieving narrow-band absorption and unidirectionality. The proposed
method results in a reduction of training time by one-third and a decrease in
data requirements by 30\% when compared to traditional GAN-based approaches.
The produced metasurface designs demonstrate a high fidelity of 95\% in
relation to the target absorption spectra. Additionally, the integration of a
material look-up table facilitates manufacturability by allowing for the
substitution of predicted material properties with viable alternatives, all
while preserving performance accuracy. Moreover the model is able to generate
Q-factor upto the order of $10^4$, while the training dataset has Q-factor upto
the order of $10^3$.

Abstract: High Q-factor narrow-band absorption exhibits high spectral selectivity
enabling high-sensitive photodetectors, sensors and thermal emitters.
All-dielectric metasurfaces are widely regarded as excellent candidates for
giving rise to such narrow-band absorption. However, designing metasurfaces
with specific functionalities remains a challenging task both experimentally
and computationally, which is why inverse design methods are increasingly being
explored. Inverse design process is highly complex due to its non-unique
solutions and the higher dimensionality of the design space, making it
challenging to precisely control the resonance wavelength, linewidth, and
absorption intensity. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid methodology that
integrates generative adversarial networks (GANs) (both classical and quantum)
with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the inverse design of
narrow-band absorbing metasurfaces. By introducing a Fano-shaped absorption
spectrum equation into the PINN loss function, we enforce physical constraints
on the resonance behavior, ensuring outputs that are both spectrally accurate
and physically consistent. The study presents a comparison between a
conventional GAN + PINN framework and a PINN augmented by a hybrid
quantum-classical GAN (QGAN). The findings indicate that the integrated PINN +
QGAN model achieves faster convergence, requires 99.5\% fewer training samples,
and yields an order of magnitude lower MSE compared to conventional GANs.
Remarkably, even though the training dataset only contains metasurfaces with
Q-factors on the order of $10^3$, the model is able to generate highly
asymmetric metasurface structures with Q-factors exceeding $10^5$. This study
presents a novel framework that integrates quantum machine learning with
physics-based modeling, providing a promising method for quantum-enhanced
inverse design in nanophotonic systems.

Abstract: Nanowire (NW) lasers hold great promise as compact, coherent on-chip light
sources that are crucial for next-generation optical communication and imaging
technologies. However, controlling their emission directionality has been
hindered by the complexities of lasing mode engineering and fabrication. Here,
we demonstrate spatially-engineered far-field emission from vertically emitting
InP NW lasers by establishing precise control over the optical coupling between
site-selective NWs, without relying on post-epitaxy transfer and alignment
processes. Leveraging this process capability, we design and grow NW pairs and
triplets that lase in the TE01 waveguide mode. We then demonstrate the ability
to modify their far-field emission profiles from the signature doughnut-like
emission to a double-lobed emission profile by changing their optical coupling
gap, evidenced by closely matching simulation and experimental profiles.
Moreover, through numerical simulations, we show further enhancement in the
far-field directionality by arranging the NW laser pairs in a periodic array,
demonstrating the feasibility of a directional lasing metasurface. Our results
provide a foundation for efficient integration of coherent light generation and
beam steering in on-chip light sources.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Direct ptychography is a method for phase retrieval using electron waves, which traditionally has resolution limitations due to probe step size. Parallax imaging is introduced to overcome this, and the two are combined to enable higher resolution through upsampling. Simulations and experiments support the analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to push the boundaries of direct ptychography by integrating parallax imaging to enhance resolution, which could be significant for imaging applications in fields like materials science and biology.

Method: The authors model parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation of direct ptychography and employ upsampling techniques to improve resolution beyond the Nyquist limit.

Result: They achieve higher resolution with simulations and experimental results, indicating successful integration of parallax imaging into direct ptychography.

Conclusion: By combining parallax imaging with direct ptychography, the study demonstrates a method to break the resolution barrier set by the probe step size, opening up new possibilities in coherent diffraction imaging.

Abstract: Direct ptychography enables the retrieval of information encoded in the phase
of an electron wave passing through a thin sample by deconvolving the
interference effect of a converged probe with known aberrations. Under the weak
phase object approximation, this permits the optimal transfer of information
using non-iterative techniques. However, the achievable resolution of the
technique is traditionally limited by the probe step size -- setting stringent
Nyquist sampling requirements. At the same time, parallax imaging has emerged
as a dose-efficient phase-retrieval technique which relaxes sampling
requirements and enables scan-upsampling. Here, we formulate parallax imaging
as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography and use this insight to
enable upsampling in direct ptychography. We also demonstrate analytical
results numerically using simulated and experimental reconstructions.

TL;DR: The paper explores the joint use of a polarization-controlled free-electron laser and near-infrared pulses in photoionization, showing how the polarization of both laser and NIR radiation affects the angular distribution of ejected electrons. The system demonstrates dichroism in electron ejection based on conversion intensity with different pathways in co- and counter-rotating configurations.

Motivation: The study aims to understand the role of polarization in photoionization processes and how it can be controlled for applications in areas like ultrafast science or precision spectroscopy.

Method: They used a synchronized two-color photoionization scheme with XUV-FEL and NIR radiation, analyzing angular distributions and intensity dependencies with both co-rotating and counter-rotating setups.

Result: The results show strong intensity and polarization-dependent dichroism, with two distinct ejection pathways for counter-rotating; co-rotating likely follows a single path dependent on angular momentum conservation.

Conclusion: Their findings offer a detailed understanding of how polarization controls electron ejection pathways and angular distributions, with potential applications in ultrafast manipulation of ions for precision spectroscopy, nanofabrication, or molecular studies.

Abstract: We report a joint experimental and theoretical study using a combination of
polarization-controlled free-electron-laser (FEL) and near-infra\-red (NIR)
pulses in a synchronized two-color photo\-ionization scheme. Excited He$^+$
ions, created by extreme ultraviolet (XUV) circularly polarized radiation from
the XUV-FEL FERMI in the oriented $3p\, (m\!=\!+1)$ state, are exposed to
circularly polarized 784-nm NIR radiation with peak intensities from
$10^{12}\,\rm W/cm^2$ to $\rm 10^{13}\,W/cm^2$. The angular distribution of the
ejected electrons exhibit a strong dichroism depending on the NIR intensity.
While the co-rotating case is defined by a single path, for the
counter-rotating case, there are two dominant pathways whose relative strength
and phase difference are determined.

Conclusion: This study provides a validated framework for predicting Stokes parameters in potassium vapor with buffer gases, improving models for atom-light interactions in buffer-gas environments, which is vital for precision metrology and spectroscopy applications.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive experimental and theoretical
characterisation of Stokes polarimetry in potassium (K) vapour on the D1 line.
Measurements were performed in the weak-probe regime, investigating the
influence of neon buffer gas in the presence of an applied magnetic field in
the Faraday geometry. While previous Stokes polarimetry studies in alkali-metal
vapours have been conducted, the specific effects of buffer gas-induced
broadening and shifts on the observed Stokes parameters remained largely
underexplored. Here, experimental measurements of absolute absorption and
dispersion were compared with a theoretical model for the electric
susceptibility of the vapour, calculated using the established software package
$ElecSus$. This work marks the first application of $ElecSus$ to model buffer
gas polarimetry of the potassium D1 line, with validation performed against
experimental spectra for magnetic fields up to 1.2 kG. Our findings provide new
insight into how the presence of buffer gas influences the observed Stokes
parameters, thereby enhancing the predictive capabilities of theoretical
frameworks for atom-light interactions in buffer-gas environments.

### [41] [Proximity-induced flat bands and topological properties in a decorated diamond chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17821)
*K Shivanand Thakur,Vihodi Theuno,Amrita Mukherjee,Biplab Pal*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: In this paper, the authors propose a novel method using strain to create and control flat bands in a diamond chain, which is different from the conventional approach using magnetic flux. They demonstrate that their approach leads to both gapless and gapped flat bands, showing robustness against disorder and confirming topological properties. This method can be experimentally realized.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of flat bands in photonic crystals is important due to their potential applications in long-range communication and topological photonics.

Method: The authors use a decorated diamond chain and apply strain to induce a proximity effect, allowing them to control one of the diagonal hoppings. They employ real space calculations to analyze the system's properties, including flat bands, compact states, density of states, and topological invariants.

Result: The results show that the proposed method effectively creates both gapless and gapped flat bands. The compact localized state amplitude and density of states calculations confirm these findings. Additionally, the system's robustness is verified by showing it withstands small amounts of disorder. Furthermore, nontrivial topological properties, like winding numbers and edge states, are observed in the gapped spectrum.

Conclusion: The authors suggest that their strain-induced method offers a promising alternative to the conventional magnetic flux-based approach for generating and controlling flat bands. This approach not only expands the theoretical understanding of photonic crystal systems but also opens up new avenues for practical applications in topological photonics and quantum devices.

Abstract: In the present study, we propose a unique scheme to generate and control
multiple flat bands in a decorated diamond chain by using a strain-induced
proximity effect between the diagonal sites of each diamond plaquette. This is
in complete contrast to the conventional diamond chain, in which the interplay
between the lattice topology and an external magnetic flux leads to an extreme
localization of the single-particle states, producing the flat bands in the
energy spectrum. Such a strain-induced proximity effect will enable us to
systematically control one of the diagonal hoppings in the decorated diamond
chain, which will lead to the formation of both gapless and gapped flat bands
in the energy spectrum. These gapless or gapped flat bands have been
corroborated by the computation of the compact localized states amplitude
distribution as well as the density of states of the system using a real space
calculation. We have also shown that these flat bands are robust against the
introduction of small amounts of random onsite disorder in the system. In
addition to this, we have also classified the nontrivial topological properties
of the system by calculating the winding numbers and edge states for the gapped
energy spectrum. These findings could be easily realized experimentally using
the laser-induced photonic lattice platforms.

Conclusion: 交替磁铁提供了一个新的磁性平台，用于研究和实现具有独特热电特性的材料。

Abstract: Altermagnets present a new class of fully compensated collinear magnetic
order, where the two sublattices are not related merely by time-reversal
combined with lattice translation or inversion, but require an additional
lattice rotation. This distinctive symmetry leads to a characteristic splitting
of the magnon bands; however the splitting is only partial -- residual
degeneracies persist along certain lines in the Brillouin zone as a consequence
of the underlying altermagnetic rotation. We consider a two-dimensional
$d$-wave altermagnetic spin model on the checkerboard lattice and introduce
additional interactions such as an external magnetic field and
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, that lift these degeneracies. The resulting
magnon bands become fully gapped and acquire non-trivial topology,
characterized by nonzero Chern numbers. We demonstrate the crucial role of
altermagnetism for the generation of the Berry curvature. As a direct
consequence of the topological magnons, we find finite thermal Hall
conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$, which exhibits a characteristic low-temperature
scaling, $\kappa_{xy}\propto T^4$. Moreover, $\kappa_{xy}$ changes sign under
reversal of the magnetic field, exhibiting a sharp jump across zero field at
low temperatures. We also demonstrate topologically protected chiral edge modes
in a finite strip geometry.

Abstract: A study of the dynamical two-dimensional (2D) nonlinear response of the
dimerized spin-$1{/}2$ chain to external electric fields is presented. The
coupling of the spin system to those fields is set to arise from the inverse
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In the XY-limit, we provide analytical
expressions for the second-order nonlinear dynamical response function. Apart
from multi spinon continua, this response displays a strong antidiagonal, i.e.
galvanoelectric, feature in the 2D frequency plane. This allows to read off
scattering rates of the fractional spinon excitations. For the XXZ-case, we
focus on the interaction-driven renormalization of the light-matter coupling by
considering vertex corrections which are induced by the zz-exchange. We show
this renormalization to modify the spinon joint density of states
significantly, potentially allowing for the formation of in-gap bound states.
As a result, the vertex corrected light-matter coupling can induce a dramatic
spectral weight transfer to lower energies for the dynamical response function
within the 2D frequency plane.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper investigates the dynamic charge susceptibility $	extit{χ(q,ω)}$ in Bi₂Sr₂CaCu₂O₈₊ₓ using EELS and IR data. IR data suggest a highly damped plasmon in the strange metal, while EELS shows discrepancies at larger $q$, indicating possible experimental or theoretical uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the strange metal's $	extit{χ(q,ω)}$ is crucial for 21st-century science, and EELS/IR comparison helps validate theoretical models.

Method: The authors use EELS and IR data analysis, comparing T-EELS and R-EELS results to build theoretical models using Lindhard and strange metal properties.

Result: IR data align with EELS at low $q$, but predictions don't match experimental EELS at larger $q$.

Conclusion: Further experimental work is needed to resolve discrepancies in the strange metal's $	extit{χ(q,ω)}$ behavior.

Abstract: The enigmatic strange metal remains one of the central unsolved problems of
21st century science. Understanding this phase of matter requires knowledge of
the momentum- and energy-resolved dynamic charge susceptibility,
$\chi(q,\omega)$, especially at finite momentum. Inelastic electron scattering
(EELS), performed in either transmission (T-EELS) or reflection (R-EELS)
geometries, is a powerful probe of $\chi(q,\omega)$. For the prototypical
strange metal Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$, T-EELS, R-EELS, and infrared (IR)
spectroscopy agree at $q \sim 0$, all revealing a highly damped plasmon near 1
eV. At larger $q$, however, EELS results show unresolved discrepancies. Since
IR data are highly reproducible, it is advantageous to use IR data to calculate
what the expected EELS response should be at modest $q$. Building on prior
R-EELS work [J. Chen \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. B. \textbf{109}, 045108
(2024)], we extend this approach to T-EELS for finite stacks of metallic
layers, comparing a "textbook" Lindhard metal to a strange metal. In the
Lindhard case, the low-$q$ response is dominated by long-lived, standing wave
plasmon modes arising from interlayer Coulomb coupling, with in-plane
dispersions that resemble the well-known Fetter modes of layered metals. This
behavior depends only on the geometry and the long-ranged nature of the Coulomb
interaction, and is largely insensitive to layer details. At larger $q$, the
response reflects the microscopic properties of individual layers. For the
strange metal, calculations based on IR data predict a highly damped plasmon
with weak dispersion and no distinct surface mode. While our results match IR
and R-EELS at low $q$, they do not reproduce any published EELS spectra at
large $q$, highlighting unresolved discrepancies that demand further
experimental investigation.

Abstract: CeRhSn is a valence fluctuating heavy-fermion metal with a twisted Ce-kagome
lattice, displaying zero-field quantum criticality, previously associated with
geometrical frustration. The partial substitution of Rh by Pd in
CeRh$_{1-x}$Pd$_x$Sn enlarges the unit-cell volume, suppresses valence
fluctuations, decreases the Kondo temperature and stabilizes a possible
long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordered ground state with $T_N=0.8$ K at
$x=0.5$. Previous thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements for $x=0.1$
suggested a quantum critical spin liquid. We report low-temperature dilatometry
and magnetization measurements on CeRh$_{0.9}$Pd$_{0.1}$Sn and compare with
published low-$T$ specific heat data. The absence of a Gr\"uneisen parameter
divergence excludes a conventional quantum criticality scenario. Instead, the
weak power-law divergences signal non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior, according to
a disorder-driven quantum Griffiths phase scenario. At low temperatures, a
negative thermal expansion is found in fields above approximately 0.5 T and the
NFL scaling breaks down, probably due to the polarization of AFM correlations.

### [46] [Deep Variational Free Energy Calculation of Hydrogen Hugoniot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18540)
*Zihang Li,Hao Xie,Xinyang Dong,Lei Wang*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel deep variational free energy framework for computing the equation of state of hydrogen in warm dense matter. It uses three deep generative models: a normalizing flow for nuclei, an autoregressive transformer for electron excited states, and a permutational equivariant flow for electrons. The method minimizes the variational free energy by optimizing these models together. The results are compared to existing deuterium Hugoniot curve data to resolve discrepancies, offering a new benchmark for warm dense matter studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the properties of hydrogen under extreme conditions, such as in stellar interiors or inertial confinement fusion, is crucial for both theoretical physics and practical applications. The equation of state (EOS) is a fundamental thermodynamic property that determines how matter behaves under pressure and temperature. Accurate EOS models for hydrogen are essential for simulations involving high-energy density matter. However, existing EOS models may not fully capture the quantum mechanical effects and many-body interactions present in dense hydrogen. Developing a more accurate and reliable framework for computing the EOS of hydrogen could lead to more precise predictions and better agreement with experimental data, addressing discrepancies in existing studies.

Method: The authors propose a deep variational free energy (DVFE) framework to model the equation of state of hydrogen in warm dense matter. The framework employs three distinct deep generative models: a normalizing flow to model the Boltzmann distribution of classical nuclei, an autoregressive transformer to model the distribution of electrons in excited states, and a permutational equivariant flow to construct backflow coordinates for electrons in Hartree-Fock orbitals. These models are integrated into a variational inference framework where the parameters of all three models are optimized collectively to minimize the variational free energy. This approach allows for a comprehensive modeling of the system's thermodynamic properties by accounting for nuclear distributions, electronic configurations, and quantum mechanical effects through the use of advanced deep learning architectures.

Result: The study calculates the equation of state and thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen and compares them with existing theoretical and experimental results on the deuterium Hugoniot curve. The discrepancies in the Hugoniot curve, which plots the relationship between shock compression and density, are analyzed and potentially resolved using the new framework. The results suggest that the proposed framework provides improved accuracy in modeling the behavior of dense hydrogen, although the extent of the discrepancy resolution is not explicitly stated in the abstract. The findings offer a valuable benchmark for future theoretical and experimental studies of warm dense hydrogen.

Conclusion: The paper presents a comprehensive deep learning approach for modeling the equation of state of warm dense hydrogen. By combining generative models for nuclei, electron excited states, and electron backflow coordinates, the framework accurately computes the thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen. The comparison with existing Hugoniot curve data highlights the potential to resolve discrepancies in current EOS models for hydrogen in the warm dense matter regime. This work lays the foundation for more reliable simulations involving high-energy density hydrogen, which is essential for advancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications in fields such as astrophysics, inertial confinement fusion, and high-energy-density physics.

Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation
of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes
the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite
temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model that
represents the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an
autoregressive transformer that models the distribution of electrons in excited
states, and a permutational equivariant flow model that constructs backflow
coordinates for electrons in Hartree-Fock orbitals. By jointly optimizing the
three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the
equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen. We
compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the
deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies. The
calculated results provide a valuable benchmark for deuterium in the warm dense
matter region.

Abstract: We perform the variational Monte Carlo calculation for recently proposed
chiral superconducting states driven by strong Coulomb interactions. We compare
the resulting energetics of these electronic phases for the electron dispersion
relation $E_k = c_2 k^2+c_4 k^4$. Motivated by the recent discovery of chiral
superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene systems, we apply our analysis to
relevant parameter regimes. We demonstrate that topological chiral
superconducting phases (including a spin-unpolarized state) can be
energetically favored over the spin-valley polarized Fermi liquid above the
density of Wigner crystal phase. Our results show that the preference for
chiral superconductivity is strongest when $c_2$ lies between zero and a
negative value, corresponding to a system on the verge of forming a hole pocket
around $k=0$. This finding suggests that superconductivity can arise from pure
repulsive Coulomb interactions in systems with an almost flat band bottom,
without relying on the pairing instability of a Fermi surface. This mechanism
opens a new pathway to superconductivity beyond the conventional BCS mechanism.

Abstract: How much current does a sliding electron crystal carry? The answer to this
simple question has important implications for the dynamic properties of the
crystal, such as the frequency of its cyclotron motion, and its phonon
spectrum. In this work we introduce a precise definition of a sliding crystal
and compute the corresponding current $\mathbf{j}_c$ for topological electron
crystals in the presence of magnetic field. Our result is fully
non-perturbative, does not rely on Galilean invariance, and applies equally to
Wigner crystals and (anomalous) Hall crystals. In terms of the electron density
$\rho$ and magnetic flux density $\phi$, we find that $\mathbf{j}_c =
e(\rho-C\phi)\mathbf{v}$. Surprisingly, the current receives a contribution
from the many-body Chern number $C$ of the crystal. When $\rho = C\phi$,
sliding crystals therefore carry zero current. The crystalline current fixes
the Lorentz force felt by the sliding crystal and the dispersion of low-energy
phonons of such crystals. This gives us a simple counting rule for the number
of gapless phonons: if a sliding crystal carries nonzero current in a magnetic
field, there is a single gapless mode, while otherwise there are two gapless
modes. This result can also be understood from anomaly-matching of emanant
discrete translation symmetries -- an idea that is also applicable to the
dispersion of skyrmion crystals. Our results lead to novel experimental
implications and invite further conceptual developments for electron crystals.

Abstract: Efficient and reliable identification and optimization of transition state
structures is a longstanding challenge in computational chemistry. Popular
chain-of-states methods require hundreds if not thousands of \textit{ab initio}
calculations to generate initial guesses for local quasi-Newton optimizers,
with persistent risk of collapse to an alternative stationary point on the
potential energy surface (PES). Here, we show that high-quality guess
structures for transition state optimization can be obtained by constructing
the geodesic path between reactant and product structures on the PES generated
by machine learning potentials (MLPs). We present an algorithm for optimization
of such geodesic paths, as well as the associated codebase. We demonstrate
effectiveness of this approach using the recent eSEN-sm-cons MLP. On average,
the highest-energy point along these MLP geodesics requires 30\% fewer
quasi-Newton optimization steps to converge to the transition state compared to
guesses from the fully \textit{ab initio} frozen string method. Our approach
therefore completely eliminates the need for \textit{ab initio} calculations
for generation of transition state guesses and considerably speeds up
subsequent structural optimization. Geodesic construction on ML PES thus
promises to be a useful approach for efficient computational elucidation of
complex chemical reaction networks.

Abstract: This work presents a strategy to efficiently and safely account for
decoherence in the fewest switches surface hopping method. Standard decoherence
corrections often lead to too strong coherence suppression. A simple and
general solution to this problem is to restrict decoherence to regions of low
nonadiabaticity measured by the dimensionless Massey parameter. The same
threshold values are suitable for a variety of systems, regardless of their
size and absolute energy scale. When restricted to uncoupled regions, a
Gaussian overlap decoherence correction consistently leads to more accurate
populations than using no correction. The article also examines under what
circumstances it is appropriate to decohere instantaneously.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on developing a method to improve the efficiency and accuracy of computational chemistry calculations, specifically in electronic structure theory.

Method: MADF generates DFBS by saturating the OBS product space with exponentials and then pruning based on 2-body energy contributions.

Result: Experiments with MADF show reduced DF errors up to 20 and 10 microhartree per electron across various molecules.

Conclusion: MADF provides effective basis sets with minimal parameters for accurate DF functional approximation.

Abstract: We present model-assisted density fitting (MADF) basis set generator, an
algorithm for generating primitive atomic Gaussian density fitting (DF) basis
sets (DFBSs) from a contracted Gaussian orbital basis set (OBS). The MADF
algorithm produces DFBSs suitable for accurate robust DF approximation of
2-particle interactions in mean-field and correlated electronic structure. The
algorithm is designed to (a) saturate the OBS product space by a large
regularized set of primitive solid-harmonic Gaussian shells with nonuniform
distribution of exponents followed by (b) pruning of the shells according to
their contributions to the 2-body energy of a correlated atomic ensemble.
Building the DFBS generator model almost exclusively on mathematical and
physical principles allows one to limit the number of parameters that control
the density fitting error to four, with a single set of parameters sufficient
for computations with all basis cardinal numbers, with and without correlation
of core electrons, with and without scalar and spin-dependent relativistic
effects, spanning almost all of the Periodic Table. Performance assessment
included basis sets up to quadruple-zeta quality from several major basis set
families, using molecules composed of main-group, d-block, and f-block
elements. The resulting DF errors in Hartree-Fock and second-order MP2 energies
(with relativistic all-electron treatments, when appropriate) were on the order
of 20 and 10 microhartree per electron, respectively.

Abstract: Multipactor is a nonlinear electron avalanche phenomenon that can severely
impair the performance of high-power radio frequency (RF) devices and
accelerator systems. Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across
different materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet
computationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF
engineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine

electron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models -
including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the
time-averaged electron growth rate, ${\delta}_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated
using Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and
Pearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs
in generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a
scalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian
hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those
trained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis
reveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint
feature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset
coverage. This study demonstrates both the promise and limitations of ML-based
multipactor prediction and lays the groundwork for accelerated, data-driven
modeling in advanced RF and accelerator system design.

Abstract: In view of future applications of plasma-based particle accelerators, within
the fields of high-energy physics and new light sources, the capability of
plasma sources to operate at high repetition rates is crucial. In particular
for gas-filled plasma discharge capillaries, which allow direct control over
plasma properties, a key aspect is the longevity of the material, subject to
erosion due to the heat flux delivered by high voltage plasma discharges. In
this regard, we present an innovative design of discharge capillaries based on
the use of different ceramic materials, which can sustain high voltage plasma
discharges at high repetition rate and, moreover, be easily machined for the
complex geometries required for plasma-based accelerators. Experimental
campaigns are carried out at 10-150 Hz, assessing the longevity of ceramic
capillaries by means of different diagnostic techniques. In addition, numerical
simulations are performed to analyze the heat transfer within the whole plasma
source. Results from experimental and numerical analysis highlight the
capability of ceramic capillaries to preserve plasma properties and the
integrity of the source during long-term plasma discharge operation at high
repetition rate. In particular, we demonstrated the suitability of the proposed
solution for the operative range of 100-400 Hz, foreseen for EuPRAXIA@SPARC_LAB

Conclusion: 模型为降低氚排放提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Tritium is a well-known byproduct of particle accelerator operations. To keep
levels of tritium below regulatory limits, tritium production is actively
monitored and managed at Fermilab. We plan to study tritium production in the
targets, beamline components, and shielding elements of the Fermilab facilities
such as NuMI, BNB, and MI-65. To facilitate the analysis, we construct a simple
model and use three Monte Carlo radiation codes, FLUKA, MARS, and PHITS, to
estimate the amount of tritium produced in these facilities. The analysis could
also serve as an intercomparison between these code results related to tritium
production. To assess the actual amounts of tritium that would be released from
various materials, we employ a semi-empirical diffusion model. The results of
this analysis are compared to experimental data whenever possible. This
approach also helps to optimize proposed target materials with respect to the
tritium production and release.

for commuting Hamiltonians, the general problem of spectral manipulation via
unitary control simplifies to a finite sequence of elementary switching
operations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that any desired relative spacing of
energy levels can be achieved. We also show that any modified spectrum can be
expressed as a convex combination of the original eigenvalues, with the convex
weights forming a bi-stochastic matrix. Through several single-parameter
estimation examples, we demonstrate that our spectral engineering method

Abstract: Silicon single-photon detectors (Si SPDs) play a crucial role in detecting
single photons in the visible spectrum. For various applications, photon
detection efficiency (PDE) is the most critical characteristic for effectively
collecting photons. Here, we present a Si SPD with a remarkable PDE of up to

thick-junction Si single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) that enhances the
avalanche probability through a backside-illumination structure, while
minimizing noise through the design of a doping-compensated avalanche region.
To maximize PDE, we implement a readout circuit with a 50 V quenching voltage,
enabling operation in free-running, gating, or hybrid modes. The SPAD, along
with its readout circuits and affiliated circuits, is integrated into a compact
SPD module. In free-running mode, the module achieves a maximum PDE of 84.4%,
with a dark count rate of 260 cps, and an afterpulse probability of 2.9% at 268
K. This work provides a practical solution for applications requiring
ultra-high-efficiency Si SPD with multiple operation modes.

sensing precision exhibits a unique quartic scaling with the perturbation
strength. The result generalizes to multimode squeezed-state sensors with
higher-order exceptional points catered to various quantum sensing platforms.

Abstract: The auto-correlative weak-value amplification (AWVA) technique demonstrates
distinct advantages over standard weak-value amplification (SWVA) for quantum

real-time multiplication and integrator modules. We implemented a real-time

amplifier for the integrator. The circuit was tested using Gaussian pointers in
the AWVA scheme, exhibiting sufficient sensitivity for Gaussian pointers with
frequencies 200 Hz < f < 20kHz. Compared to SWVA, AWVA achieves higher accuracy
and superior robustness against noise at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of -12
dB < SNR < -4 dB. Beyond quantum metrology, the circuit is applicable to

Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of colored stochastic noise as a source of
fluctuations in the dynamics of a two-level system, e.g. the states of a qubit
system or two local sites in a transfer problem. We derive the stochastic
Schr\"odinger equations (SSE) and related quantum master equations (QME) for
the average density matrix for different stochastic potentials. We compare the
case of memory and memoryless processes, which reflect different short-time
behaviors and, in some cases, can lead to different stationary distributions of
the average system state. Focusing on the use of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck coloured
noise driving the dynamics, in the same fashion as the white noise is the
formal derivative of a Wiener process, we shed light on how different
dissipative terms of a generic QME arise depending on the nature of the
stochastic potential involved, and their effect on the short and long time
evolution of the system. We rationalize the emergence of the different terms in
terms of the time- and frequency-dependent coefficients Redfield QME. Within
this framework, we explicitly derive a closure model for the open terms in the
QME derived from the SSE approach, and clarify how colored noise impacts the
coherence relaxation time scales

Abstract: Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information
science, including quantum cryptography, quantum simulation, and benchmarking
quantum devices. In this work, we discover a new ensemble of quantum states
that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing
extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. We show that those resources
such quantum states can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega\left(\log
(t/\epsilon)\right)$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for
fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, those resources do not scale with the system size,
i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$ in the system.
Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for
generating such states. To this end, we develop an algorithm that transforms
$k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones through a sequence of
multi-controlled gates, without increasing the support size. The depth of such
a quantum circuit is $O\left(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon)\right)$,
which is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A
class of shallow quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for
classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential
applications in various quantum information processing tasks. As a concrete
example for demonstrating utility of our algorithm, we propose classical shadow
tomography using an $O(1)$-entangled estimator, which can achieve shorter
runtime compared to conventional schemes.

Abstract: Simulating nuclear matter described by quantum chromodynamics using quantum
computers is notoriously inefficient because of the assortment of quark degrees
of freedom such as matter/antimatter, flavor, color, and spin. Here, we propose
to address this resource efficiency challenge by encoding three qubits within
individual ytterbium-171 atoms of a neutral atom quantum processor. The three
qubits are encoded in three distinct sectors: an electronic "clock" transition,
the spin-1/2 nucleus, and the lowest two motional states in one radial
direction of the harmonic trapping potential. We develop a family of composite
sideband pulses and demonstrate a universal gate set and readout protocol for
this three-qubit system. We then apply it to single-flavor quantum
chromodynamics in 1+1D axial gauge for which the three qubits directly
represent the occupancy of quarks in the three colors. We show that two atoms
are sufficient to simulate both vacuum persistence oscillations and string
breaking. We consider resource requirements and connections to error
detection/correction. Our work is a step towards resource-efficient digital
simulation of nuclear matter and opens new opportunities for versatile qubit
encoding in neutral atom quantum processors.

Abstract: Near term quantum devices have recently garnered significant interest as
promising candidates for investigating difficult-to-probe regimes in many-body
physics. To this end, various qubit encoding schemes targeting second quantized
Hamiltonians have been proposed and optimized. In this work, we investigate two
qubit representations of the planar rotor lattice Hamiltonian. The first
representation is realized by decomposing the rotor Hamiltonian projectors in
binary and mapping them to spin-1/2 projectors. The second approach relies on
embedding the planar rotor lattice Hilbert space in a larger space and
recovering the relevant qubit encoded system as a quotient space projecting
down to the physical degrees of freedom. This is typically called the unary
mapping and is used for bosonic systems. We establish the veracity of the two
encoding approaches using sparse diagonalization on small chains and discuss
quantum phase estimation resource requirements to simulate small planar rotor
lattices on near-term quantum devices.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: CTQWs in different networks are studied with various decoherence models, and the stability metrics show that network topology and decoherence influences quantum properties preservation, with heterogeneous networks, especially star and scale-free, showing higher stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of network topology and decoherence on quantum system stability is crucial for quantum computing applications.

Method: The research involved analyzing CTQWs across diverse network structures and applying different decoherence models. Metrics such as occupation probabilities and measures of coherence were used to assess stability.

Result: Heterogeneous networks show higher stability, while intrinsic decoherence has varying effects compared to Haken-Strobl and QSW models.

Conclusion: Network topology and decoherence models significantly affect the stability of quantum walks, with heterogeneous structures being more stable under decoherence.

Abstract: We investigate the stability of continuous time quantum walks (CTQWs) in a
range of network topologies under different decoherence mechanisms, defining
stability as the system's ability to preserve quantum properties over time. The
networks studied range from homogeneous to heterogeneous structures, including
cycle, complete, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, small-world, scale-free, and star
topologies. The decoherence models considered are intrinsic decoherence,
Haken-Strobl noise, and quantum stochastic walks (QSWs). To assess quantum
stability, we employ several metrics: node occupation probabilities, the
$\ell_1$-norm of coherence, fidelity with the initial state, quantum-classical
distance, and von Neumann entropy. Our results reveal that the interplay of
both network topology and decoherence model influences coherence preservation.
Intrinsic decoherence results in the slowest decay of coherence, followed by
Haken-Strobl noise, while QSW causes the most rapid loss of coherence. The
stability ranking among network topologies varies depending on the decoherence
model and quantifier used. For example, under Haken-Strobl and intrinsic
decoherence, the quantum-classical distance ranks the cycle network more stable
than scale-free networks, although other metrics consistently favour scale-free
topologies. In general, heterogeneous networks, such as star and scale-free
networks, exhibit the highest stability, whereas homogeneous topologies, such
as cycle and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks, are more vulnerable to decoherence.
The complete graph, despite its homogeneity, remains highly stable due to its
dense connectivity. Furthermore, in heterogeneous networks, the centrality of
the initialised node, measured by degree or closeness, has a pronounced impact
on stability, underscoring the role of local topological features in quantum
dynamics.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper extends correlated sampling in QC-AFQMC, addressing noise in gradient computations by improving correlation between nearby geometries through methods like synchronized random streams and deterministic integrals. They validate this through multiple species and find significant variance reduction compared to single-reference methods, especially in strong correlations. The method is applied to CO2 reaction, showing improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for accurate nuclear force computations in quantum Monte Carlo methods, which are essential for fields like nuclear physics and quantum chemistry. The challenges addressed include high statistical noise in gradient computations, making small changes in geometry computationally expensive. By improving correlation between nearby geometries, the method aims to reduce this noise, thereby enhancing efficiency and accuracy in quantum simulations.

Method: The method involves extending correlated sampling techniques from classical AFQMC to the QC-AFQMC framework. Key components include synchronizing random number streams, aligning orbitals, using deterministic integral decompositions, employing a consistent classical shadow ensemble, orbital-optimized trial wave functions, and utilizing quantum information metrics for active space selection and overlap evaluations.

Result: The results show significant improvements in force evaluations using QC-AFQMC. The method reduces statistical variance compared to single-reference approaches and demonstrates reliability in a variety of systems, including challenges in strongly correlated regions. Additionally, the QC-AFQMC framework is successfully applied to the MEA-CO2 reaction, highlighting its potential in exploring complex reaction pathways.

Conclusion: QC-AFQMC offers a robust, efficient, and accurate approach for computing nuclear forces, particularly in strongly correlated systems. Thevariance-reducing techniques employed significantly enhance the practicality of quantum Monte Carlo methods.

Abstract: We extend correlated sampling from classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte
Carlo to the quantum-classical (QC-AFQMC) framework, enabling accurate nuclear
force computations crucial for geometry optimization and reaction dynamics.
Stochastic electronic structure methods typically encounter prohibitive
statistical noise when computing gradients via finite differences. To address
this, our approach maximizes correlation between nearby geometries by
synchronizing random number streams, aligning orbitals, using deterministic
integral decompositions, and employing a consistent set of classical shadow
measurements defined at a single reference geometry. Crucially, reusing this
single, reference-defined shadow ensemble eliminates the need for additional
quantum measurements at displaced geometries. Together, these methodological
choices substantially reduce statistical variance in computed forces. We
validate the method across hydrogen chains, confirming accuracy throughout
varying correlation regimes, and demonstrate significant improvements over
single-reference methods in force evaluations for N$_2$ and stretched linear
H$_4$, particularly in strongly correlated regions where conventional coupled
cluster approaches qualitatively fail. Orbital-optimized trial wave functions
further boost accuracy for demanding cases such as stretched CO$_2$, without
increasing quantum resource requirements. Finally, we apply our methodology to
the MEA-CO$_2$ carbon capture reaction, employing quantum information metrics
for active space selection and matchgate shadows for efficient overlap
evaluations, establishing QC-AFQMC as a robust framework for exploring complex
reaction pathways.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum systems' behavior in extreme environments like near black holes is crucial for assessing the feasibility of quantum computing and communication. This paper contributes insights into decoherence and error resilience.

Method: Analyzed a three-qubit entangled Dirac system under different quantum channels in Schwarzschild spacetime, calculating QFI with respect to entanglement and phase parameters.

Result: QFI shows resistance to temperature changes under strong squeezing but degrades with higher temperatures. Squeezing helps mitigate errors, and environmental noise is the primary decoherence source.

Conclusion: Environmental noise and spacetime effects significantly impact QFI, with squeezing offering some mitigation. These findings are important for quantum computing in relativistic contexts.

Abstract: Quantum information processing promises significant advantages over classical

Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) as a diagnostic tool for entanglement and
parameter estimation in a three-qubit entangled Dirac system subjected to
dissipative noisy channels in the curved spacetime of a Schwarzschild black
hole. In particular, we examine the influence of the squeezed generalized
amplitude damping (SGAD) channel, along with its subchannels -- generalized
amplitude damping (GAD) and amplitude damping (AD) -- on the QFI with respect
to entanglement weight ($\theta$) and phase ($\phi$) parameters. Our results
show that under strong squeezing ($r = 1$), the QFI with respect to $\theta$
becomes completely resistant to variations in the Hawking temperature ($T_H$),
while still exhibiting degradation with increasing channel temperature ($T_C$).
The QFI decay is significantly slower at $r = 1$ compared to $r = 0$,
suggesting that squeezing can function as an error mitigation strategy. For QFI
with respect to $\phi$, a transient spike is observed at $T_C = 2$, potentially
due to thermal resonance or non-monotonic decoherence, and this behavior is
unaffected by $T_H$. Similar patterns are noted in the GAD and AD channels,
where $T_C$ consistently dominates as the principal source of decoherence.
Overall, the results highlight the intricate interplay between environmental
noise, relativistic effects, and quantum error resilience in curved spacetime.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling spin relaxation in molecular qubits is
essential for developing chemically tunable quantum information platforms. We
present a fully first-principles framework for computing the spin relaxation
tensor in a single-molecule magnet, \ce{VOPc(OH)8}, by combining density
functional theory with a mode-resolved open-system formalism. By expanding the
spin Hamiltonian in vibrational normal modes and evaluating both linear and
quadratic spin-phonon coupling tensors via finite differences of the
$g$-tensor, we construct a relaxation tensor that enters a Lindblad-type
quantum master equation. Our formalism captures both direct (one-phonon) and
resonant-Raman (two-phonon) relaxation processes. Numerical analysis reveals a
highly mode-selective structure: only three vibrational modes dominate
longitudinal ($T_1$) decoherence, while a single mode accounts for the majority
of transverse ($T_2$) relaxation. The computed relaxation times show excellent
agreement with experimental measurements, without any empirical fitting. These
results demonstrate that first-principles spin-phonon tensors can provide
predictive insight into decoherence pathways and guide the rational design of
molecular qubits.

Abstract: We present a detailed theoretical treatment of four-wave mixing (FWM) in a
quantized paraxial framework, capturing the multi-spatial-mode nature of the
biphoton state generated in the process. By analyzing the biphoton state both
in position and momentum representations, we identify the conditions under
which these descriptions become equivalent. We also highlight formal and
physical similarities between FWM and spontaneous parametric down-conversion
(PDC), showing that the transfer of pump structure to the spatial coincidence
profile, an important and well-known characteristic of the biphoton state,
carries over naturally to FWM. In addition, our treatment captures the
transition from position correlations in the near field to momentum
correlations in the far field, reflecting the underlying spatial entanglement.
The measures of entanglement, including the spiral bandwidth and the Schmidt
rank, are discussed. Our work consolidates known and new results on spatial
correlations in FWM and provides a theoretical framework that may support
future studies in nonlinear and quantum optics with structured light.

Abstract: Exploring potential empirical manifestations of quantum gravity is a
challenging pursuit. In this study, we utilise a lattice representation of a
(2+1)D massive gravity toy model interacting with Dirac fermions that can
support specific spacetime fluctuations. We focus on the evolution of the
fermion's spin due to its coupling to spacetime fluctuations. To monitor their
dynamics a minimal model is required that comprises two bosonic modes
describing spacetime geometry fluctuations coupled with the spin of the
fermion. A possible emulation of this system involves encoding spin degrees of
freedom in an atom coupled with a bimodal optical cavity that provides the two
bosonic modes. We observe diverse spin evolution patterns based on its
interaction with fluctuating spacetime geometry. Our proposal introduces a
novel approach for modelling the effect of interactions between quantum gravity
and matter that can be probed with current technology.

*Hao Jeng,Ping Koy Lam,Syed M. Assad*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  paper discusses adding single photons to two-mode-squeezed-vacuum states to enhance quantum entanglement, which improves secret key rates in QKD. Non-Gaussian entangled states are used, and the Gaussian extremity principle was not suitable, so a new analysis method was developed. Surprisingly, adding photons actually stabilized the protocol against decoherence, even with many qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is essential for secure communication. To improve its efficiency and reliability, especially in noisy environments, this paper explores techniques to add single photons to entangled states to boost secret key rates and extend distribution distances. The study is significant because achieving robust and high-capacity QKD protocols is a key challenge in quantum cryptography.

Method: The paper employs a technique involving adding single photons to two-mode-squeezed-vacuum states. It uses numerical simulations, QKD modeling, and statistical analysis to demonstrate the impact on entanglement quality, secret key rates, and error rates under decoherence. The authors also develop a new analysis framework that doesn't assume prior knowledge of the entangled state.

Result: Adding single photons to these states increases the secret key rate and extends the maximum distribution distance. The study shows that non-Gaussian states, though hard to characterize with Gaussian methods, can be effectively analyzed using non-Gaussian techniques. Surprisingly, adding single photons protects the protocol from decoherence, even with a large number of qubits.

Conclusion: This research offers a promising approach to enhance QKD by leveraging photon addition to resilient entangled states, providing a practical solution against decoherence while maintaining high secret key rates. The findings suggest that non-Gaussian state analysis is crucial for future QKD advancements, and photon addition techniques may be broadly applicable to other quantum information processing tasks. This study underpins the potential of non-Gaussian resources in overcoming limitations of Gaussian methods in quantum cryptography.

Abstract: Addition of single photons to two-mode-squeezed-vacuum states has the effect
of distilling quantum entanglement, and, when deployed in quantum key
distribution, should lead also to an increase in the secret key rate. However,
the extraction of secret keys from non-Gaussian entangled states is a complex
issue and is at present not fully understood. In this paper we describe a
technique for adding photons to entangled states, and demonstrate how it leads
to an increase in secret key rates and the maximal distance for which keys can
be distributed assuming asymptotic conditions. The quantum correlations thus
produced were found to be of a highly non-Gaussian character, such that the
Gaussian extremity principle returns a negative keyrate and effectively kills
the protocol; we have therefore developed methods of analysis that do not
require prior assumptions about the state. Although it could have been that the
addition of single photons would make the system more fragile, this turned out
not to be the case. Rather, the addition of a single photon was found to
protect the protocol against both passive and active decoherence.

Result: 展示了hBN缺陷的量子产率好且纯度高，electron-phonon耦合由缺陷引发，HR因数与配置相关。

Conclusion: 研究者开发了hBN缺陷数据库，推动量子材料实验与理论结合。

Abstract: Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant
attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and
single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN
defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than
calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out
on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for
discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an
extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN
defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database
features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge
states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most
stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the
zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys
(HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and
polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon
coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which
tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands.
Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are
independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration
coordinates. All data are publicly available at https://h-bn.info, along with a
new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with
machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the
gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of
quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven
approaches in quantum materials research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security in quantum key distribution is crucial. CV-QKD is more compatible with current telecommunication infrastructure than traditional QKD due to global efforts towards quantum internet.

Method: Used probabilistic non-Gaussian filters without known physical representation, implementing Gaussian and non-Gaussian adaptive filters at Alice and Bob's stations respectively. The security was analyzed without relying on Gaussian extremality, leading to higher key rates compared to GG02.

Result: Experiments showed threefold improvement over GG02, simulations for satellite communications indicated a 400-fold increase.

Conclusion: This protocol efficiently addresses limitations of CV-QKD, offering enhanced security and key rates with minimal system changes.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a promising approach to secure
communications, with continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) offering compatibility
with existing telecommunication infrastructure. Despite this advantage, CV-QKD
is limited by challenges such as losses in terrestrial fibres and atmospheric
scintillation in free-space channels. We introduce a QKD protocol that
surpasses the optimal Gaussian modulated CV-QKD (GG02) protocol by utilising
probabilistic filters without known physical representation. Our approach
employs a Gaussian filter at Alice's station and a non-Gaussian notch-like
filter at Bob's station. Alice's filter optimises modulation variance to
achieve key rates near the optimal GG02 performance, while Bob's filter adapts
the effective channel conditions, which can result in higher key rates than the
optimal GG02 protocol. Our security analysis avoids Gaussian extremality,
accurately bounding Eve's information. The protocol dynamically optimises the
secret-key rate for rapidly changing channels, such as terrestrial links and
satellite-to-ground communications, and can extract keys in regions deemed
non-secure by parameter estimation. Implemented at software level, our protocol
requires no hardware modifications and can be integrated into existing QKD
systems. Experimental results show a threefold increase in key rates over the
optimal GG02 protocol, while simulations for Low Earth Orbit satellite quantum
communications indicate a 400-fold increase compared to the non-optimised
counterpart.

TL;DR: Quantum annealing systems can exhibit quantum hysteresis even in situations where classical hysteresis is impossible, and this is explained by a combination of Landau-Zener transitions and quantum kinetic effects, with experiments confirming these predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum hysteresis in quantum annealing systems is crucial for advancing quantum computing, especially in identifying and mitigating limitations in quantum hardware.

Method: They combined theoretical modeling using Landau-Zener transitions and semiclassical kinetic theory with experimental tests on various D-Wave systems.

Result: Observed quantum hysteresis in quantum annealing, validated theoretical framework, shows genuine quantum memory effects.

Conclusion: Quantum annealing is a valuable tool for studying quantum many-body systems with non-equilibrium dynamics and memory effects.

Abstract: Quantum annealing leverages quantum tunneling for non-local searches, thereby
minimizing memory effects that typically arise from metastabilities.
Nonetheless, recent work has demonstrated robust hysteresis in large-scale
transverse-field Ising systems implemented on D-Wave's analog quantum hardware.
The quantum nature of these intriguing results remains to be understood at a
deeper level. Here, we present a conceptual framework that explains the
observed behavior by combining two-level Landau-Zener transitions via a
first-order piecewise-constant propagator with semiclassical domain-wall
kinetics. We test this approach experimentally on a quantum annealer, where we
observe clear coercivity even in one-dimensional rings with periodic boundary
conditions comprising up to 4,906 qubits-regimes where classical hysteresis is
forbidden, but quantum hysteresis is not. Our framework reproduces the measured
kink densities, hysteresis loop shapes, and longitudinal sweep-rate scaling
trends observed in data from three different D-Wave quantum annealers. In
particular, it captures striking non-monotonic features and transiently
negative susceptibilities, identifying them as genuine quantum memory effects.
These results establish programmable quantum annealers as powerful testbeds for
exploring memory-endowed non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems.

TL;DR: The paper presents an initialization-free quantum algorithm for solving the Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP) in finite abelian groups. The algorithm allows using an arbitrary unknown mixed state as an auxiliary register, removes the need for initialization, and restores the state after computation. Since the state can be reused, it suggests a method to reduce operational time in quantum algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to develop more efficient quantum algorithms by eliminating unnecessary steps like initialization, which can save computational resources and time.

Method: The method involves using an arbitrary mixed state as an auxiliary register, performing quantum computations without initialization, and restoring the state afterwards. This approach leverages the flexibility of the auxiliary state to improve efficiency.

Result: The result is a quantum algorithm that solves HSP in finite abelian groups without requiring initialization, preserving computational efficiency while allowing state restoration.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the potential of this approach to enhance quantum algorithm efficiency by reducing operational overhead related to initialization.

Abstract: Hidden Subgroup Problem(HSP) seeks to identify an unknown subgroup H of a
group G for a given injective function f defined on cosets of H. Here we
present an initialization-free quantum algorithm for solving HSP in the case
where G is a finite abelian group. Our algorithm can adopt an arbitrary unknown
mixed state as the auxiliary register and removes the need for initialization
while preserving computational cost comparable to existing methods. Our
algorithm also restores the state of the auxiliary register to its original
form after completing the computations. Since the recovered state can be
utilized for other operations, a single preparation of the auxiliary register
in an arbitrarily unknown mixed state is sufficient to execute the iterative
procedure in solving hidden subgroup problems. This approach provides a
promising direction for improving quantum algorithm efficiency by reducing
operational time of initialization.

Abstract: Locally repairable codes (LRCs) play a crucial role in mitigating data loss
in large-scale distributed and cloud storage systems. This paper establishes a
unified decomposition theorem for general optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs. Based on
this, we obtain that the local protection codes of general optimal
$(r,\delta)$-LRCs are MDS codes with the same minimum Hamming distance
$\delta$. We prove that for general optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs, their minimum
Hamming distance $d$ always satisfies $d\geq \delta$. We fully characterize the
optimal quantum $(r,\delta)$-LRCs induced by classical optimal
$(r,\delta)$-LRCs that admit a minimal decomposition. We construct three

TL;DR: The paper discusses coding theorems in quantum communication for large classes of arbitrarily varying channels. It provides an explicit capacity formula for a lossy bosonic channel with semi-classical attacks. The channel is modeled using a beam-splitter setup where the jammer controls one input port and the user controls the other, with the receiver observing one output. A new quantum entropy power inequality is conjectured to be related to the capacity formula.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to be focused on quantum communication and challenges in information theory, possibly looking to establish robust codes for channel variations which is significant for secure communication systems. The exploration of entropy power inequalities suggests an interest in information measures, which are fundamental in evaluating communication channels and codes.

Method: The authors likely use techniques from quantum information theory, such as capacity formulas and entropy inequalities, to analyze and derive the capacity for the described channel model. They may have used beam-splitter models and considered semi-classical states injected by an adversary to simulate attacks.

Result: The key result is an explicit capacity formula for an important bosonic channel under specific attacks. This could have implications for understanding secure communication limits in noisy quantum channels. Additionally, they link their result to a new entropy power inequality, which may open new avenues for proving similar results in the future.

Conclusion: The conclusion likely emphasizes the significance of their findings for quantum communication, possibly stating the implications of the capacity formula and the potential applications of the new entropy power inequality. They might suggest that this work opens new research directions in quantum information theory and secure communication channels.

Abstract: Arbitrarily varying channels offer a powerful framework for analyzing the
robustness of quantum communication systems, especially for classical-quantum
models, where the analysis displays strengths or weaknesses of specific signal
constellations under generic attacks. In this work, we provide a coding theorem
for a large class of practically relevant arbitrarily varying channel models.
Namely, we give an explicit capacity formula for the lossy bosonic channel
subject to semi-classical attacks, where an adversary injects semi-classical
states into the transmission line. Mathematically, this is modeled via a
beam-splitter setup, with transmitter and jammer controlling different input
ports and the receiver observing one output port. We show how a recently
conjectured new quantum entropy power inequality relates to our capacity
formula.

Abstract: We analyze the influence of Liouvillian exceptional points (LEPs) in the
three-level quantum absorption refrigerator, putting emphasis on the
non-equilibrium process before the convergence to the steady state. We search
for the second-order and third-order LEPs in the system with two types of
couplings. Focusing on the third-order LEPs, we analyze the damping of the
system state in the long term analytically and numerically. In addition, we
analyze the damping of heat currents and the influence of the non-equilibrium
process in the heat extraction from the cold bath. Critical damping at LEPs of
both the system state and the heat currents is achieved, implying the fastest
convergence to the equilibrium system. During the non-equilibrium process, we
find that much heat transfer from the cold bath to the hot bath with less
energy cost of the work bath is achieved at the third-order LEP, leading to
better performance of the refrigerator.

Abstract: We investigate the relationship between partial traces and their dilations
for general complex matrices, focusing on two main aspects: the existence of
(joint) dilations and norm inequalities relating partial traces and their
dilations. Throughout our analysis, we pay particular attention to rank
constraints. We find that every pair of matrices of equal size and trace admits
dilations of any rank larger than one. We generalize Audenaert's subadditivity
inequality to encompass general matrices, multiple tensor factors, and
different norms. A central ingredient for this is a novel majorization relation
for Kronecker sums. As an application, we extend the interval of Werner states
in which they are provably 2-undistillable in any dimension $d\geq4$. We also
prove new Schmidt-number witnesses and $k$-positive maps.

Abstract: Non-Gaussian states of light are essential for numerous quantum information
protocols; thus, certifying non-Gaussianity is crucial. Full quantum state
tomography achieves this, but it implies observing the Wigner function
negativity, which requires efficient detection. Certifying non-Gaussianity
through directly measurable parameters is a simpler alternative, typically
achieved by measuring photon-number probabilities - either directly using
photon-number resolving detectors or through Hanbury Brown-Twiss type
measurements with single-photon detectors. Here, we demonstrate theoretically
and experimentally that optical parametric amplification combined with
conventional intensity detectors can effectively replace this approach without
the need for photon-number resolution. In our method, we measure the mean
photon number and the second-order correlation function for the amplified
state. Using it, we successfully certify the non-Gaussianity of a heralded
quasi-single-photon state. Since optical parametric amplification is a
multimode process, our method provides a foundation for developing
high-dimensional quantum technologies utilizing multimode non-Gaussian states.

under non-Hermitian, PT-symmetric driving, showing that the resulting set of
Wigner-space trajectories of an initial coherent state is identical to the set
of real-space trajectories of the classical Foucault pendulum. Remarkably, in
the case mapped from the trivial 1D pendulum, the corresponding quantum
dynamics are those of an oscillator with periodically evolving momentum but
fixed position, a novel type of dynamics which are forbidden in classical
systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a quantum machine learning approach for virtual screening by encoding molecular structures into quantum states using parameterized gates. The model was evaluated under different settings and achieved promising results with an RMSD of 2.37 kcal/mol and Pearson correlation of 0.650, even with limited data, making it suitable for near-term quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of efficiently evaluating binding free energy in virtual screening by leveraging quantum computing. With the increasing availability of quantum hardware, integrating machine learning could enhance traditional methods, particularly in handling molecular conformations, which are computationally intensive. This suggests a potential breakthrough in accelerating drug discovery and related fields.

Method: The study employs a quantum machine learning approach where molecular structures are encoded into quantum states using parameterized quantum gates. The model is implemented in PyTorch, and its performance is assessed under three scenarios: ideal simulation, limited shots, and with quantum noise. This comprehensive evaluation helps understand the model's robustness and scalability.

Result: The model achieved an RMSD of 2.37 kcal/mol and a Pearson correlation of 0.650 with just 100,000 shots, and even with noise, the rankings remained accurate, indicating good compatibility with current quantum hardware and scalability.

Conclusion: The paper presents a promising quantum machine learning method for virtual screening, leveraging modern quantum hardware's potential. This approach balances accuracy with practicality for near-term applications, offering a viable path to accelerate drug discovery despite initial computational challenges.

Abstract: In structure-based virtual screening, it is often necessary to evaluate the
binding free energy of protein-ligand complexes by considering not only
molecular conformations but also how these structures shift and rotate in
space. The number of possible combinations grows rapidly and can become
overwhelming. While classical computing has limitations in this context,
quantum computing offers a promising alternative due to its inherent
parallelism. In this study, we introduce a quantum machine learning approach
that encodes molecular information into quantum states and processes them using
parameterized quantum gates. The model is implemented and trained using
PyTorch, and its performance is evaluated under three settings: ideal
simulation, limited-shot sampling, and simulations with quantum noise. With six
quantum circuit units, the model achieves an RMSD of 2.37 kcal/mol and a
Pearson correlation of 0.650. Even when using 100,000 shots, the predictions
remain consistent, indicating that the model is compatible with near-term
quantum hardware. Although noise slightly reduces accuracy, the ranking of
ligand affinities remains largely unchanged. These findings point to a
practical and scalable strategy that balances robustness and predictive power,
offering a viable path to accelerate virtual screening through moderately deep
quantum circuits.

Abstract: The unitary dynamics of quantum systems can be modeled as a trajectory on a
Riemannian manifold. This theoretical framework naturally yields a purely
geometric interpretation of computational complexity for quantum algorithms, a
notion originally developed by Michael Nielsen (Circa, 2007). However, for
nonunitary dynamics, it is unclear how one can recover a completely geometric
characterization of Nielsen-like geometric complexity. The main obstacle to
overcome is that nonunitary dynamics cannot be characterized by Lie groups
(which are Riemannian manifolds), as is the case for unitary dynamics. Building
on Nielsen's work, we present a definition of geometric complexity for a fairly
generic family of quantum channels. These channels are useful for modeling
noise in quantum circuits, among other things, and analyze the geometric
complexity of these quantum channels.

Abstract: One of the key features of information geometry in the classical setting is
the existence of a metric structure and a family of connections on the space of
probability distributions. The uniqueness of the Fisher--Rao metric and the
duality of these connections is at the heart of classical information geometry.
However, these features do not carry over straightforwardly to quantum systems,
where a Hermitian inner product structure on the Hilbert space induces a metric
on the complex projective space of pure states -- the Fubini-Study tensor,
which is preserved under the unitary evolution. In this work, we explore how
modifying the Hermitian tensor structure on the projective space may affect the
geometry of pure quantum states, and whether such generalisations can be used
to define dual connections with a direct correspondence to classical
probability distribution functions, modified by the presence of a non-trivial
phase. We show that it is indeed possible to construct a family of connections
that are dual to each other in a generalised sense with respect to the
real-valued sector of the Fubini--Study tensor. Using this biorthogonal
formalism, we systematically classify the four types of tensors that can arise
when the dynamics of a quantum system are governed by a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian, identifying both the complex-valued metric and the Berry
curvature. Finally, we elucidate the role of the metric in a quantum natural
gradient descent optimisation problem, generalised to the non-Hermitian case
for a suitable choice of cost function.

Abstract: Following the example of Shor's algorithm for period-finding in the integers,
we explore the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) for discrete infinite groups. On
the hardness side, we show that HSP is NP-hard for the additive group of
rational numbers, and for normal subgroups of non-abelian free groups. We also
indirectly reduce a version of the short vector problem to HSP in
$\mathbb{Z}^k$ with pseudo-polynomial query cost. On the algorithm side, we
generalize the Shor-Kitaev algorithm for HSP in $\mathbb{Z}^k$ (with standard
polynomial query cost) to the case where the hidden subgroup has deficient rank
or equivalently infinite index. Finally, we outline a stretched exponential
time algorithm for the abelian hidden shift problem (AHShP), extending prior
work of the author as well as Regev and Peikert. It follows that HSP in any
finitely generated, virtually abelian group also has a stretched exponential
time algorithm.

Abstract: Quantum states of motion are critical components in the second quantum
revolution. We investigate the generation and control of non-Gaussian motional
states in a tripartite hybrid quantum system consisting of a collection of
qubits coupled to a mechanical resonator, which in turn interacts with an
externally driven photonic cavity. This hybrid architecture provides a
versatile platform for quantum control by integrating nonlinear interactions
and multiple control parameters. Operating in the strong coupling regime, we
study the transient dynamics resulting from a time-dependent external drive
that has a boxcar profile. Starting from coherent states in both the mechanical
and cavity subsystems, we show that this drive protocol, combined with
time-independent interaction and frequency configurations, leads to the
emergence of highly non-Gaussian quantum states in the intermediary mechanical
degree of freedom. These states are characterized by a pronounced negative
volume in the Wigner quasi-probability distribution and enhanced quantum Fisher
information, indicative of their quantum utility. We systematically analyze the
impact of the qubit phase, interaction strengths, and drive parameters on the
degree of non-Gaussianity. Our findings underscore the tunability and richness
of this hybrid platform, paving the way for advanced quantum state engineering
and applications in quantum sensing, metrology, and information processing.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for
decision-making in partially observable environments, which can be modeled as
Markov decision processes and compactly represented through dynamic decision
Bayesian networks. Recent advances demonstrate that inference on sparse
Bayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined
with amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating
acceptance probabilities.\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum
Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead
algorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a
rigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions
for the quantum device. Unlike standard treatments that assume a black-box
oracle, we explicitly specify the inference process, allowing our bounds to
more accurately reflect the true computational cost. We show that, for
environments whose dynamics form a sparse Bayesian network, horizon-based
near-optimal planning can be achieved sub-quadratically faster through
quantum-enhanced belief updates.
  Furthermore, we present numerical experiments benchmarking QBRL against its
classical counterpart on simple yet illustrative decision-making tasks. Our
results offer a detailed analysis of how the quantum computational advantage
translates into decision-making performance, highlighting that the magnitude of
the advantage can vary significantly across different deployment settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work contributes to the field by extending well-known hierarchies and providing new insights through tau functions, which are central in soliton theory.

Method: The authors constructed a new hierarchy, analyzed its connections using Miura transformations, and derived equivalent conditions with tau functions.

Result: A new hierarchy, GbM-Toda, is introduced, linking mToda and mKP, with results formulated using tau functions providing deeper mathematical understanding.

Conclusion: The paper advances the mathematical study of hierarchies, offering new tools for future research in soliton equations and integrable systems.

Abstract: The modified Toda (mToda) hierarchy is a two-component generalization of the
1-st modified KP (mKP) hierarchy, which connects the Toda hierarchy via Miura
links and has two tau functions. Based on the fact that the mToda and 1-st mKP
hierarchies share the same fermionic form, we firstly construct the reduction
of the mToda hierarchy
$L_1(n)^M=L_2(n)^N+\sum_{l\in\mathbb{Z}}\sum_{i=1}^{m}q_{i,n}\Lambda^lr_{i,n+1}\Delta$
and $(L_1(n)^M+L_2(n)^N)(1)=0$, called the generalized bigraded modified Toda
hierarchy, which can be viewed as a new two-component generalization of the
constrained mKP hierarchy $\mathfrak{L}^k=(\mathfrak{L}^k)_{\geq
1}+\sum_{i=1}^m \mathfrak{q}_i\partial^{-1}\mathfrak{r}_i\partial$. Next the
relation with the Toda reduction
$\mathcal{L}_1(n)^M=\mathcal{L}_2(n)^{N}+\sum_{l\in
\mathbb{Z}}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\tilde{q}_{i,n}\Lambda^l\tilde{r}_{i,n}$ is discussed.
Finally we give equivalent formulations of the Toda and mToda reductions in
terms of tau functions.

Abstract: Parametric scale separation is notoriously difficult to achieve in flux
compactifications of gravitational effective theories. An appealing alternative
to conventional Freund-Rubin vacua involves Ricci-flat internal manifolds,
where the energy supplied by fluxes is balanced not by curvature but by the

producing anti-de Sitter geometries with parametric scale separation, including
an explicit example in eleven-dimensional supergravity. We study deformations
of these geometries, showing the presence of perturbative and non-perturbative
instabilities.

Abstract: We study entanglement entropy for slab like regions in quantum field
theories, using their holographic duals. We focus on the transition between
space like and time like separations. By considering boosted subsystems in
conformal and confining holographic backgrounds, we identify two classes of
extremal surfaces: real ones (Type I) and complex surfaces (Type II). These
interpolate between the usual Ryu Takayanagi prescription and its time like
generalisations. We derive explicit expressions for the entanglement entropy in
both conformal and confining cases. We discuss their behaviour across phase
transitions and null limits. The interpolation between Type I and Type II
surfaces reveals an analytic continuation of the extremal surface across the
light cone. Our analysis also finds the existence of a Ryu Takayanagi surface
(Type I) even for time like separations in the confining field theory case.

Conclusion: 扩展Calogero模型为研究其他对称性系统提供了新的视角，值得关注。

Abstract: The Calogero model is an interacting, $N$-particle, $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb
R)$-invariant quantum mechanics, whose Hilbert space is furnished by a tower of
discrete series modules. The system enjoys both classical and quantum
integrability at any $N$ and at any value of the coupling; this is guaranteed
by the existence of $N$ mutually-commuting currents, one of them being the
Hamiltonian. In this paper, we alter the Calogero model so that it may
accommodate states in the unitary principal series irreducible representation
of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$. Doing so requires changing the domain of the
quantum operators--a procedure which succeeds in preserving unitarity and
$\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$-invariance, but breaks the integrability of the
theory. We explicitly solve the deformed model for $N=2,3$ and outline a
procedure for solving the model at general $N$. We expect this deformed model
to provide us with general lessons that carry over to other systems with states
in the principal series, for example, interacting massive quantum field
theories on de Sitter space.

TL;DR: This paper presents a method combining high-precision numerical integration and lattice reduction to determine exact analytical forms of mathematical expressions, such as Feynman integrals, by strategically sampling the data points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a more effective approach for obtaining exact analytic solutions to problems that are traditionally solved using numerical methods. By utilizing function space knowledge and high-precision techniques, the authors demonstrate an enhancement over conventional methods in mathematical physics.

Method: The method involves high-precision numerical integration combined with lattice reduction to deduce exact forms. It samples data points strategically, using analytic function space knowledge to form a basis for lattice reduction, thereby solving for the coefficients of the basis functions to find the exact form.

Result: Through numerical experiments, the method successfully identifies exact analytical forms for given expressions by solving for basis coefficients using lattice reduction from sampled data points. The examples show that this approach can outperform previous methods in terms of accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that combining high-precision numerical techniques with lattice reduction, guided by function space knowledge, offers a robust method for determining exact analytical solutions. The approach is validated through various examples, highlighting its potential applicability beyond Feynman integrals to other mathematical and physical problems. This integration provides an additional tool for exact symbolic regression, complementing existing methods like the Landau bootstrap.

Abstract: In mathematics or theoretical physics one is often interested in obtaining an
exact analytic description of some data which can be produced, in principle, to

symbolic regression, since typical numerical methods lead only to
approximations. However, if one has some sense of the function space in which
the analytic result should lie, it is possible to deduce the exact answer by
judiciously sampling the data at a sufficient number of points with sufficient
precision. We demonstrate how this can be done for the computation of Feynman
integrals. We show that by combining high-precision numerical integration with
analytic knowledge of the function space one can often deduce the exact answer
using lattice reduction. A number of examples are given as well as an
exploration of the trade-offs between number of datapoints, number of
functional predicates, precision of the data, and compute. This method provides
a bottom-up approach that neatly complements the top-down Landau-bootstrap
approach of trying to constrain the exact answer using the analytic structure
alone. Although we focus on the application to Feynman integrals, the
techniques presented here are more general and could apply to a wide range of
problems where an exact answer is needed and the function space is sufficiently
well understood.

Abstract: Recently, several notions of entanglement in time have emerged as a novel
frontier in quantum many-body physics, quantum field theory and gravity. We
propose a systematic prescription to characterize temporal entanglement in
relativistic quantum field theory in a general state for an arbitrary subregion
on a flat, constant-time slice in a flat spacetime. Our prescriptions starts
with the standard entanglement entropy of a spatial subregion and amounts to
transporting the unchanged subregion to boosted time slices all the way across
the light cone when it becomes in general a complex characterization of the
corresponding temporal subregion. For holographic quantum field theories, our
prescription amounts to an analytic continuation of all codimension-two bulk
extremal surfaces satisfying the homology constraint and picking the one with
the smallest real value of the area as the leading saddle point. We implement
this prescription for the holographic conformal field theories in thermal
states on both a two-dimensional Lorentzian cylinder and three-dimensional
Minkowski space, and show that it leads to results with self-consistent
physical properties of temporal entanglement.

TL;DR: 在这个论文中，他们研究了二维（1+1）维爱因斯坦-希尔伯特作用量经维度约化得到的洞穴解和蒸发解的量子场论。他们使用量子极值表面方法应用“岛则”规则来研究塌缩情景下的精细熵，结果发现 Hawking 辐射遵循 Page 曲线，意味着 Hawking 辐射的演化的量子性是单位的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究 Hawking 辐射的量子性是一个重要的问题。特别地，Page 曲线的形式表明信息恢复过程是量子力学的不可逆过程，从而与量子力学的酉性原则相矛盾。因此，理解 Hawking 辐射是否遵循 Page 曲线是检验量子力学与引力相容性的重要问题。

Method: 他们使用了量子极值表面方法，并应用了洞穴规则（island rule）来计算演化过程中的精细熵。通过比较 Hawking 辐射的熵演化与 Page 曲线的形式，他们得出 Hawking 辐射的演化的量子性是单位的。

Result: 他们证明了 Hawking 辐射的熵在演化的过程中遵循 Page 曲线，这意味着 Hawking 辐射的演化是量子力学中的酉过程，即保持量子态的规范性。

Conclusion: 他们得出 Hawking 辐射的演化是 unitary 的结论。这种结果为理解量子力学和引力相容性提供了一个新的视角，尤其是在量子极值表面方法的应用上。可能存在关于洞穴解和热力学行为进一步研究的必要性。

Abstract: We study entanglement entropy of quantum fields in a (1+1)-dimensional model
of dilaton gravity derived from the four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action by
dimensional reduction. Scalar matter is coupled to gravity, while the
back-reaction is included via the Polyakov-Liouville action. This theory
exhibits both eternal and evaporating Schwarzschild black hole solutions. The
fine-grained entropy in a collapse scenario is investigated by applying the
"island rule" via the quantum extremal surface approach. We demonstrate that
the fine-grained entropy of the Hawking radiation follows the Page curve, and
therefore the evolution of the Hawking radiation is unitary.

Result: 发现了新的1/2-费米子共型配置，不同的轨道方向决定了未破坏的超对称，能量下限与角动量有关，可分组成SU(2)守恒量的不同扇区。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了AdS₂ × S²中的探针动力学，用于增强微黑洞状态计数及AdS₂/CFT₁ holography分析。

Abstract: We extend the $\kappa$-symmetry analysis of supersymmetric D-brane probes in
the $\mathrm{AdS}_2 \times \mathbf{S}^2$ attractor geometry, originally
performed by Simons, Strominger, Thompson, and Yin, to also include stationary
-- but non-static -- worldlines carrying angular momentum along the 2-sphere.
We demonstrate that certain special trajectories, with fixed radius and orbital
velocity, solve the equations of motion and moreover satisfy a supersymmetry
preserving condition, thus defining new $\frac12$-BPS configurations.
Furthermore, these classical paths are shown to saturate a lower bound for the
Hamiltonian generating global time translations, with the corresponding minimal
energy depending on a generalized angular momentum vector $\boldsymbol{J}$. The
direction of the latter, in turn, determines exactly which supercharges remain
unbroken. Our results reveal a richer spectrum of (multi-particle)
supersymmetric states in $\mathrm{AdS}_2 \times \mathbf{S}^2$, which can be
organized into distinct selection sectors labeled by the conserved $SU(2)$
charges. This construction has direct applications in black hole microstate
counting, the analysis of probe dynamics and $\text{AdS}_2/\text{CFT}_1$
holography.

Abstract: We investigate Lorentzian quantum gravity coupled to a template matter sector
with gauge fields, scalars and fermions. In the absence of quantised gravity,
the matter sector by itself is renormalisable, but UV-incomplete. Provided
quantum gravity offers an asymptotically safe UV-completion, we determine the
photon and scalar two-point functions in the presence of gravitational
fluctuations, and show that both possess a K\"all\'en-Lehmann spectral
representation. Our results are achieved using functional renormalisation
adapted for theories in Lorentzian signature. We explain why and how
interactions with gravity modify both the infrared as well as the ultraviolet
behaviour of matter spectral functions. We further determine the corresponding
form factors on the level of the quantum effective action. Limitations and
extensions of our study are discussed alongside implications for particle
physics and unitarity of quantum gravity with matter.

*Jonathan J. Heckman,Max Hübner,Chitraang Murdia*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses the packaging of global symmetry data in higher-dimensional quantum field theories and uses Wigner's quasi-probabilistic function to provide a physical interpretation in various contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors explore how symmetry data of D-dimensional QFTs can be extended into (D+1)-dimensional bulk systems with specific boundary conditions. They argue that in cases where absolute symmetry data is hard to define or cumbersome, Wigner's quasi-probabilistic function offers a unified physical interpretation for mixed states and entangled states of these systems. The paper also provides examples to illustrate their point.

Method: The method involves abstract mathematical arguments, considering abstract QFTs and their extensions, analyzing symmetry data packaging, and applying Wigner's function to interpret mixed and entangled states. They use string compactifications and holographic systems as examples.

Result: Wigner's quasi-probabilistic function provides a physical interpretation of symmetry data, particularly in mixed states and entangled scenarios, suggesting a deeper connection to quantum physics in various systems.

Conclusion: The use of Wigner's function offers a unified framework to interpret symmetry data across different quantum systems, enhancing our understanding of quantum states in complex theories.

Abstract: The global symmetry data of a $D$-dimensional absolute quantum field theory
can sometimes be packaged in terms of a $(D+1)$-dimensional bulk system
obtained by extending along an interval, with a relative QFT$_D$ at one end and
suitable gapped / free boundary conditions at the other end. The partition
function of the QFT$_D$ can then be interpreted as a wavefunction depending on
background fields. However, in some cases, it is not possible or simply
cumbersome to fix an absolute form of the symmetry data. Additionally, it is
also of interest to consider entangled and mixed states of relative QFTs as
well as entangled and mixed states of gapped / free boundary conditions. We
argue that Wigner's quasi-probabilistic function on phase space provides a
physical interpretation of the symmetry data in all such situations. We
illustrate these considerations in the case of string compactifications and
holographic systems.

Abstract: We propose alternative \textit{UV completion} of pure JT gravity as well as
CFT coupled to JT gravity, via a class of \textit{deformed} 2D CFT. In AdS/CFT
with a prescribed classical limit, pure JT gravity in \textit{one-sided}
AdS$_{2}$ black hole is argued to be described by certain holographic deformed
CFT on a strip. Equivalently, these deformed CFTs can be recast as CFTs on
one-sided AdS$_{2}$ black hole with \textit{emergent conformal boundary
condition on a stretched horizon}$-$providing a \textit{proper UV frame} of JT
gravity. On the other hand, JT gravity coupled to CFT with fixed central charge
of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, is also described by deformed CFT on strip satisfying
conformal boundary condition, with a different classical limit. The resulting
CFT Hilbert spaces in both of the above classical limits yield the black hole
entropy as thermal entropy and the high-energy density of states match that of
JT gravity with a precise energy scale correspondence. Moreover, the Hilbert
space defined for a two-sided black hole factorizes into two one-sided sectors
in both limits. Notably in the second limit, degenerate zero modes of the
deformed Hamiltonian$-$characterized by conformal primaries localized at the
horizon$-$appear as a residual effect of the stretched horizon boundary
condition. Exploiting the second limit, we compute entanglement entropy in
one-dimensional quantum systems dual to a conformally glued black
hole$-$Poincar\'e geometry in JT gravity, reproducing a `Page curve' via the
quantum extremal surface prescription, with `Page time' set by the stretched
horizon cutoff.

Conclusion: 该研究为二维散射引力提供了一个新角度来研究量子引力现象。学者提到了几个未解决的问题，如蒸发终点附近的状态和量子效应的更深入理解。

Abstract: We consider a class of two-dimensional dilaton gravity models with linear
dilaton vacuum including Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger (CGHS) model as the
special case. General thermodynamic properties of black holes in such models
are evaluated. We focus on the CGHS model and its modification with regular
black holes as empty-space solutions characterized by ever-present finite
curvature. We find generalized entanglement entropy blows-up for near-extremal
regular black holes considered as remnants. That signalling a possible
breakdown of the semiclassical approximation near the endpoint of evaporation.
We conjecture that remnants are unstable and decay by quantum fluctuations into
horizonless spacetimes. We give an estimate for the decay amplitude by using a
semiclassical regularization method and propose a path to mitigate the
unitarity loss problem.

Conclusion: 二维相互作用的极性Scaffold-克模型可以作为具有无能隙边缘的三维绝立项态系统的基础，提供量子相变研究的新视角。

Abstract: The chiral SYK model is an 1 + 1 dimensional generalisation of the
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with chiral Majorana fermions. The Dyson-Schwinger
equation of the model is exactly solvable in the large-N limit, leading to an
exact analytic solution of the two-point function valid across all energy
scales. We consider two chiral SYK systems coupled by a quadratic interaction
that explicitly breaks the scaling and time reversal symmetry. We compute the
two-point function analytically by solving the Dyson-Schwinger equations
perturbatively when the two systems are weakly coupled. We find that the system
does not acquire a mass gap unlike the 0+1 dimensional coupled SYK model. The
leading correction to thermal free energy is independent of temperature and the
ground state entropy remains the same as the entropy of 2N free chiral Majorana
fermions. The coupled model can be realised as a gapless edge theory of 2+1
dimensional gapped topological condensed matter systems that do not preserve
scaling and time reversal symmetry.

Result: GP关系在旋转带电圆柱形黑洞的背景下保留其形式，尤其是在变化的Λ和不同的能量状态参数下。

Conclusion: GP关系在任意Λ和非对称时空下都适用，显示出其普适性。

Abstract: The Goon-Penco (GP) relation was investigated on rotating charged black
strings with an arbitrary cosmological constant. It has been demonstrated that
the GP relation retains its form in the context of spacetimes described by
cylindrical coordinates. In addition, the GP relation is derived in scenarios
where the energy state parameters (including angular momentum $J$ and charge
$Q$, etc.) are expressed as functions of the perturbation parameter $\eta$.
This finding indicates that the GP relation is not only valid for spacetimes
described by spherically symmetric coordinates, but also prevalent for
non-spherically symmetric spacetimes, such as cylindrical coordinates.
Therefore, the present study demonstrated that the GP relation is universal for
spacetimes with arbitrary cosmological constants, irrespective of the adopted
coordinate system.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses the κ-deformed theory of a spin-1/2 field. It constructs a Poincaré-invariant action and analyzes its implications. Previous work on the κ-deformed scalar field established that an invariant action under both Poincaré and charge conjugation symmetry doesn't exist. This paper uses explicit calculations to demonstrate the consistency of κ-deformed spinor fields within the Poincaré framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is part of a series aiming to establish conditions under which a deformed field theory can maintain symmetries essential for physical consistency. The lack of an invariant action under specific symmetries raises questions about the theory's viability, which this paper addresses through calculations.

Method: The authors build a κ-deformed Dirac action, enforce Poincaré symmetry, and compute Noether charges to check their algebra. They prove the theory's internal consistency despite previous findings on the scalar field.

Result: The authors confirm the absence of an invariant action under both Poincaré and charge conjugation in the κ-deformed case, unlike in the scalar field. They demonstrate the closure of the Noether charges' algebra, ensuring the theory’s consistency.

Conclusion:  κ-deformed spinor field theories cannot support an action that is invariant under both Poincaré and charge conjugation, indicating limitations in constructing physically consistent deformed field theories with these symmetries.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the $\kappa$-deformed theory of a spin-1/2
field. We construct an action that is Poincar\'e invariant and analyze its
consequences within the deformed framework. Our results confirm the findings of
our recent analysis of the $\kappa$-deformed scalar field, where we established
that there is no action invariant under both Poincar\'e symmetry and charge
conjugation in the $\kappa$-deformed case. Furthermore, we present an explicit
calculation of the Noether charges associated with Poincar\'e symmetry and show
that their algebra closes, demonstrating the internal consistency of the
theory.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamical connection between the surface growth
scheme and the conformal field theory with $T\bar{T}$ deformation. By utilizing
the extended one-shot entanglement distillation tensor network, we find that
the iterative growth, i.e. radial evolution of homogenous and isotropic bulk
minimal surfaces in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime can be mapped
to the $T\bar{T}$ operator flow driven by the deformation parameter. Our
results show that the $T\bar{T}$ deformation can provide a dynamical mechanism
for the surface growth in asymptotically AdS spacetime, which may shed light on
reconstructing bulk gravitational dynamics from the surface growth scheme.

Abstract: The IKKT matrix model has been investigated as a promising nonperturbative
formulation of superstring theory. One of the recent developments concerning
this model is the discovery of the dual supergravity solution corresponding to
the model obtained after supersymmetry-preserving mass deformation, which is
dubbed the polarized IKKT model. Here we perform Monte Carlo simulations of
this model in the case of matrix size N = 2 for a wide range of the deformation
parameter Omega. While we reproduce precisely the known result for the
partition function obtained by the localization method developed for
supersymmetric theories, we also calculate the observables, which were not
accessible by previous work, in order to probe the spacetime structure emergent
from the dominant matrix configurations. In particular, we find that the saddle
point corresponding to the original IKKT model is smoothly connected to the
saddle represented by the fuzzy sphere dominant at large Omega, whereas the
dominant configurations become diverging commuting matrices at small Omega.

### [110] [Continuous spin superparticle in $4D$, ${\cal N}=1$ curved superspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18524)
*I. L. Buchbinder,S. A. Fedoruk*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper introduces a 4D, N=1 continuous-spin superparticle model in AdS superspace, generalizing a flat-space model. The model uses 4D, N=1 superspace coordinates plus commuting spinor variables. It derives the Lagrangian and phase space constraints, showing that constraints are consistent only in AdS geometry. The bosonic constraints are first-class, while fermionic constraints are split into one first-class and three second-class ones. In the flat limit, a second-class constraint becomes first-class.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores extending continuous-spin particle models into AdS superspace, which is significant for understanding higher spin theories and their behavior in curved spacetime. This could have implications for AdS/CFT correspondence and studies of conformal field theories with high spin fields.

Method: The authors start by defining the model within 4D, N=1 AdS superspace, incorporating additional commuting spinor variables typical for continuous-spin models. They derive the Lagrangian and constraints, analyze their consistency, categorize them into first and second-class, and compare the flat and AdS limits.

Result: The model is successfully constructed, with specific constraints classified by their commutator properties. In the AdS case, only one fermionic constraint is first-class. In the flat limit, this changes, showing how the structure adapts to flat spacetime.

Conclusion: The work provides a framework for studying continuous-spin particles in AdS backgrounds, which is expected to aid in developing higher spin field theories in curved spacetimes and understanding their flat space limits.

Abstract: We present a new particle model that describes the dynamics of a $4D,$
$\mathcal{N}{=}\,1$ continuous spin particle in $AdS_4$ superspace and is a
generalization of the continuous-spin superparticle model in flat $4D$,
$\mathcal{N}{=}\,1$ superspace proposed in 2506.19709 [hep-th]. The model is
described by $4D$, $\mathcal{N}{=}\,1$ superspace coordinates together with
commuting spinor additional variables, which are inherent ingredients of
continuous spin models. The Lagrangian and the system of four bosonic and four
fermionic phase space constraints are derived. The consistency condition for
constraints imposes a restriction on supergeometry to be $AdS$ superpace. It is
shown that the bosonic constraints are first-class constraints. A covariant
procedure based on the use of additional variables is developed to divide the
four fermionic constraints into first and second classes. It is proved that,
unlike the flat case, only one fermionic constraint is a first-class
constraint, while the other three are second-class constraints. In the flat
limit, one of these second-class constraints becomes a first-class one.

Abstract: The role of open strings is investigated in the context of AdS$_{3}$ flux
vacua arising from type IIB orientifold reductions. On the one hand, contrary
to expectations, the perturbative stability of certain recently found
non-supersymmetric AdS$_{3}$ flux vacua is shown to be robust under
fluctuations of the open-string moduli. On the other hand, a wealth of new
perturbatively stable AdS$_{3}$ flux vacua appears as a consequence of the
non-trivial dynamics of open-string moduli. We also comment on the issue of
scale separation in these AdS$_{3}$ flux vacua.

### [112] [Graviton scattering on self-dual black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18605)
*Tim Adamo,Giuseppe Bogna,Lionel Mason,Atul Sharma*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores the scattering of gravitons on a self-dual Taub-NUT black hole spacetime using integrability and twistor theory, leading to exact formulas for scattering amplitudes with spin effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of gravitational wave scattering on black hole spacetimes is complex, necessitating approximations or numerical methods. This paper seeks an exact solution using self-dual metrics and twistor theory, aiming to advance our understanding of gravitational interactions in such backgrounds.

Method: The authors utilize the self-dual sector's integrability to solve the linearized Einstein equations. They employ twistor theory to describe the metric and gravitons, derive amplitudes from a chiral sigma model perturbation, incorporate spin with the Newman-Janis shift, and examine holomorphic collinear limits for celestial symmetries.

Result: The paper presents an exact solution for the scattering amplitudes of gravitons with helicity and spin on self-dual Taub-NUT black holes. It reveals that celestial symmetry is preserved despite the curved background. The approach avoids numerical techniques, offering an analytic framework for gravitational wave scattering.

Conclusion: The research provides an exact and analytic method for understanding graviton scattering on curved black hole backgrounds, highlighting the utility of integrability and twistor theory in general relativity. This could open new avenues for studying quantum gravity effects on black holes without numerical simulators.

Abstract: The computation of gravitational wave scattering on black hole spacetimes is
an extremely hard problem, typically requiring approximation schemes which
either treat the black hole perturbatively or are only amenable to numerical
techniques. In this paper, we consider linearised gravitational waves (or
gravitons) scattering on the self-dual analogue of a black hole: namely, the
self-dual Taub-NUT metric. Using the hidden integrability of the self-dual
sector, we can solve the linearised Einstein equations on these self-dual black
hole backgrounds exactly in terms of simple, explicit quasi-momentum
eigenstates. Using a description of the self-dual Taub-NUT metric and its
gravitons in terms of twistor theory, we obtain an explicit formula, exact in
the background, for the tree-level maximal helicity violating graviton
scattering amplitude at arbitrary multiplicity, with and without spin. This is
obtained from the description of the MHV amplitudes in terms of the
perturbation theory of a chiral sigma model whose target is the twistor space
of the background. The incorporation of spin effects on these backgrounds is a
straightforward application of the Newman-Janis shift. We also demonstrate that
the holomorphic collinear splitting functions in the self-dual background are
equal to those in flat space so that the celestial symmetry algebra is
undeformed.

### [113] [Supersymmetry and integrability of the elliptic $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathrm{T}^4$ superstring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18548)
*Ben Hoare,Fiona K. Seibold*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses a fermionic integrable deformation of the elliptic AdS₃×S³×T⁴ superstring. It constructs a family of Ramond-Ramond fluxes and shows that the S-matrix satisfies the classical Yang-Baxter equation, indicating integrability. The authors conjecture processes beyond quadratic order and explore various limits, supporting a robust supersymmetric and integrable deformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding integrable deformations of AdS/CFT setups is crucial for exploring new dualities and phenomena in string theory and gauge theories. This paper contributes to this area by proposing a specific deformation with Ramond-Ramond fluxes and a constant dilaton, while preserving supersymmetry and integrability.

Method: The authors construct a 1-parameter family of Ramond-Ramond fluxes for the elliptic AdS₃×S³×T⁴ metric. They compute the tree-level worldsheet S-matrix in uniform light-cone gauge up to quadratic fermionic terms and demonstrate that it satisfies the classical Yang-Baxter equation. Based on this, they conjecture the validity of quartic fermionic processes for classical integrability. Additionally, they analyze interesting limits, including trigonometric deformations and the limit to AdS₂×S²×T⁶.

Result: The paper provides strong evidence for a supersymmetric and integrable elliptic deformation of the AdS₃×S³×T⁴ superstring, characterized by Ramond-Ramond fluxes and a constant dilaton. The S-matrix results and integrability conjectures contribute to the understanding of integrable deformations in string theory.

Conclusion: This study advances the understanding of integrable deformations of AdS₃×S³×T⁴ superstrings by introducing a Ramond-Ramond fluxed background with a constant dilaton. The findings, including the S-matrix satisfying the classical Yang-Baxter equation and supposing integrable processes beyond quadratic terms, provide significant support for the viability of such a deformation in maintaining supersymmetry and integrability.

Abstract: We construct a 1-parameter family of Ramond-Ramond fluxes supporting the
elliptic $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathrm{T}^4$ metric with
constant dilaton and preserving 8 of the 16 supercharges of the undeformed
background. On the supersymmetric locus, we compute the tree-level worldsheet
S-matrix in uniform light-cone gauge up to quadratic order in fermions and find
that it non-trivially satisfies the classical Yang-Baxter equation. Moreover,
imposing classical integrability and symmetries, we conjecture compatible
processes quartic in fermions. We also investigate different limits of
interest, including trigonometric deformations and the limit to the
$\mathrm{AdS}_2 \times \mathrm{S}^2 \times \mathrm{T}^6$ superstring. Our
results provide strong evidence for a supersymmetric and integrable elliptic
deformation of the $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathrm{T}^4$
superstring supported by Ramond-Ramond flux and a constant dilaton.

Abstract: We study an angular dipole deformation of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills

two-point functions of suitable single trace operators, restricted to an
invariant plane, are determined by scaling dimensions computable from an
integrable spin chain. This spin chain is a diagonally twisted version of the
famous integrable spin chain of SYM. It matches expectations from the dual
string theory perfectly, presenting a precision test of holography in this new
setting, and an important step to understanding general twisted integrable
AdS/CFT.

Abstract: We identify {\em injection} and {\em shift} rectified Raman forces, which are
phononic counterparts of the photogalvanic effect, that drive lattice
vibrations and trigger transient emergent properties. These forces are governed
by the {\em quantum geometric tensor}, a {\em phononic shift vector}, and
interband asymmetries in the electron-phonon coupling. The injection force acts
displacively, while -- unlike conventional impulsive mechanisms -- the shift
force emerges impulsively in the resonant interband absorbing regime when
time-reversal symmetry is broken. Using the bilayer Haldane model, we quantify
the injection and shift forces acting on interlayer shear phonons through both
analytical and numerical methods. Strikingly, we reveal strong tunability, both
in magnitude and direction, of the rectified forces by varying the driving
frequency and magnetic flux, uncovering a distinct quantum geometric mechanism
for ultrafast and coherent manipulation of quantum materials.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper proposes helically twisted homotrilayer transition metal dichalcogenides for achieving correlated topological phases with high, tunable Chern numbers, demonstrating that varying displacement fields can change the Chern number between -2 and -1 or even topologically trivial states. A tight-binding model valid for various twist angles is developed, and interactions preserve the Chern number at ν=-1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of topological phases in materials with complex crystal structures, especially with tunable properties, is a key area of interest in condensed matter physics. This study aims to explore and harness these properties for potential applications in quantum matter and electronic devices.

Method: The paper employs a combination of theoretical modeling and computational analysis. It uses an effective tight-binding model to derive the electronic structure and Chern numbers, and employs Hartree-Fock calculations to study the effects of interactions, particularly at specific filling fractions.

Result: tures with specific twist angles and displacement fields exhibit tunable Chern numbers, including topological states with C=-2 and non-topological states with C=-1. The inclusion of interactions maintains the topological nature at the filling fraction ν=-1.

Conclusion: This work provides a framework for designing topological materials with high and tunable Chern numbers, which could be crucial for advancing quantum computing and topological electronic devices.

Abstract: We propose helically twisted homotrilayer transition metal dichalcogenides as
a platform for realizing correlated topological phases of matter with higher
and tunable Chern numbers. We show that a clear separation of scales emerges
for small twist angles, allowing us to derive a low-energy continuum model that
captures the physics within moir\'e-scale domains. We identify regimes of twist
angle and displacement field for which the highest-lying hole band is isolated
from other bands and is topological with $K$-valley Chern number $C=-2$. We
demonstrate that varying the displacement field can induce a transition from
$C=-2$ to $C=-1$, as well as from a topologically trivial band to a $C=-1$
band. We derive an effective tight-binding description for a high-symmetry
stacking domain which is valid for a wide range of twist angles, and we show
that the $C=-2$ band can remain stable at filling fraction $\nu=-1$ in the
presence of interactions in Hartree-Fock calculations.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using a deep-subwavelength Fabry-Perot silver cavity to extend exciton lifetimes in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) by suppressing radiative recombination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study lays out the challenge with excitons in TMDs, namely short lifetimes which hinder thermalization and coherency, leading to limitations in optoelectronic applications. The motivation is to address this issue through an all-optical method.

Method: The research employs a deep-subwavelength Fabry-Perot silver cavity to enhance exciton lifetimes. The cavity is designed to suppress in-plane optical dipoles such as bright excitons and trions through radiative recombination.

Result: The result is a 1 nanometer decrease in photoluminescence (PL) linewidth, corresponding to a lifetime increase of 10 picoseconds. The cavity's effect is directly attributed to exciton-cavity interactions, as demonstrated by the return of original PL characteristics when the top silver layer is etched back.

Conclusion: This approach provides a pathway for engineering excited states in 2D materials, which could advance research into optically dark excitons and improve optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have extremely short,
picosecond-scale lifetimes which hinders exciton thermalization, limits the
emergence of collective coherence, and reduces exciton transport in
optoelectronic devices. In this work, we explore an all-optical pathway to
extend exciton lifetimes by placing MoSe$_2$ in a deep-subwavelength
Fabry-Perot silver cavity. The cavity structure is designed to suppress
radiative recombination from in-plane optical dipoles, such as bright excitons
and trions. We observe a consistent decrease in photoluminescence (PL)
linewidths of excitons and trions (~1 nm), along with a corresponding lifetime
increase (~10 ps). We confirm the experimental observations arise purely from
exciton-cavity interactions-etching back the top silver layer returns the PL
linewidth and lifetimes return to their original values. Our study offers a
pathway to engineer excited state lifetimes in 2D materials which can be
utilized for studies of optically dark excitons and have potential applications
for novel optoelectronic devices.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper discusses the magnetic-multipole orders in two types of 2D altermagnets. A minimal model shows a non-zero magnetic-octupole order, while a model based on FeSe shows a magnetic-hexadecapole order, with band structure effects from sublattice-isospin interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore magnetic ordering in 2D materials, which are important for developing new quantum materials with unique magnetic properties.

Method: Theoretical study using effective Hamiltonians and analysis of multipole indicators for two models.

Result: Different models exhibit distinct magnetic orders—octupole in minimal model and hexadecapole in FeSe-based model; band structure effects derived from sublattice interactions lead to the emergence of these orders.

Conclusion: It highlights the importance of effective Hamiltonians and multipole analysis for understanding complex magnetic orders in 2D materials, providing a framework to classify magnetic orders.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the magnetic-multipole orders in two-dimensional
(2D) altermagnets, focusing on two representative models: a generic minimal
three-site model, and a four-site model representative of monolayer FeSe. We
construct low-energy effective Hamiltonians for both systems and calculate
their respective multipole indicators to characterize the underlying magnetic
order. Our analysis reveals an intriguing contrast between the two systems. We
find that the generic minimal model exhibits the expected non-zero
magnetic-octupole order. In the monolayer-FeSe model, however, the
magnetic-octupole order vanishes globally, and a magnetic-hexadecapole order is
present instead. The emergence of altermagnetic splitting in the band structure
then arises via the interplay with a sublattice-isospin degree of freedom. Our
work demonstrates how the classification and comprehensive understanding of 2D
altermagnetic materials transcends bulk descriptions.

Abstract: While the quantum spin Hall effect leverages two-dimensional topological
states to manipulate spin without dissipation, layertonics extends this
paradigm to three dimension by enabling control over the layer degree of
freedom. Topological materials incorporating screw dislocations exhibit the
capability for simultaneous manipulation of both electronic spin and layer
degrees of freedom. In this work, the electronic transport properties of a
multilayer Kane-Mele model with screw dislocations is studied theoretically.
Numerical simulations of a screw dislocation reveal that dissipationless
quantum spin Hall edge states propagate not only at the outer boundaries of the
structure but also along the screw dislocation itself, working as layer-spin
filter. In detail, 1) the spin-up and spin-down carriers starting from the same
source layer flow to different drain layers along the topological channels,
respectively. 2) The spin of carriers flowing into a given drain layer is
determined by the input source layer. Moreover, we found that the transmission
coefficient and spin polarization remain robust against Anderson disorder.
Under magnetic disorder, spin flip and backscattering occur, suppressing the
transmission coefficient while maintaining nearly unchanged spin polarization.
Finally, the layer- and spin-resolved transport properties in a device with two
screw dislocations are investigated as well. We have developed an innovative
methodology to modulate electron transport with simultaneous layer and spin
resolution.

Motivation:  researchers aim to control magnetic order on ultrafast timescales for spintronic and recording applications.

Method:  use of in situ transmission electron microscopy, cumulative laser irradiation, femtosecond and picosecond pulses for studying the process.

Result:  altered nucleation pathways with heterogeneous nucleation, submicron vortices, and link between defects, nucleation, and morphology.

Conclusion:  provides new insight into controlling phase transitions with light for applications.

Abstract: Controlling magnetic order on ultrafast timescales, driven by spintronic and
recording applications, is one of the main directions of current research in
magnetism. Despite major advances in understanding the temporal evolution of
magnetic order upon its emergence or quenching, experimental demonstration of
the local link between microstructure and dynamic nucleation is missing. Here,
taking advantage of the high structural and magnetic resolution of in situ
transmission electron microscopy, we observe that cumulative laser irradiation
significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order
antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition of FeRh thin films, causing
the transition to switch from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation. This
leads to a decrease of 20 K in transition temperature and the emergence of
sub-micron magnetic vortices as preferential nucleation motifs. These vortices
are pinned in the film by underlying dislocation networks. We observe that the
dislocation networks are formed and rearranged upon repeated crossing of the
phase transition using femtosecond and picosecond laser pulses. Our results
establish a direct link between defect formation, nucleation energetics, and
the microscopic morphology of the nucleated ferromagnetic phase, with broad
implications for ultrafast stroboscopic experiments and defect-mediated phase
transitions in functional materials.

Abstract: Altermagnets are a recently discovered class of magnetic materials that
combine a collinear, zero-magnetization spin structure, characteristic of
antiferromagnets, with spin-split electronic bands, a hallmark of ferromagnets.
This unique behavior arises from the breaking of combined time-reversal and
spatial symmetries (such as inversion or lattice translation), which are
preserved in conventional antiferromagnets. To date, research has focused on
altermagnetic phases in periodic crystals, where the order is linked to
specific crystallographic rotation symmetries. In this work, we demonstrate
that quasicrystals, which possess rotational symmetries forbidden in periodic
lattices, can host exotic altermagnetic orders. Using symmetry analysis and
self-consistent mean-field theory, we predict stable $g$-wave and $i$-wave
altermagnetism in octagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystals, respectively. These
novel phases are characterized by global $C_8T$ and $C_{12}T$ symmetries and
manifest as unique anisotropic spin-splittings in their spectral functions and
spin conductance, featuring characteristic eight- and twelve-fold nodal
structures that serve as unambiguous experimental fingerprints. Our findings
establish quasicrystals as a versatile platform for realizing unconventional
altermagnetic orders beyond the constraints of crystallographic symmetry.

Abstract: We derive the expression for the local Hall conductivity for systems that
lack translation symmetry and use it to study the local fluctuations of the
Hall signal around disordered patches in magnetic insulators. We find that the
regime in parameter space over which the system is a Chern insulating state
increases upon inclusion of non-magnetic potential disorder. In addition, the
phase space over which the topological Anderson insulator exists can be
enhanced by breaking up a single disordered patch into multiple smaller patches
with the same total amount of disorder. We expect our results will motivate the
next generation of local scanning and local impedance spectroscopy experiments
to visualize Hall currents around patches in the bulk of a disordered
topological insulator.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the magnetotransport properties of 1T WTe2, focusing on how nonsymmorphic symmetries like glide mirror and screw rotation affect spin states in edge ribbons. Comparing ribbons with edges along different crystal axes shows anisotropic behavior, with spin splitting and conductance changes primarily observed along the y edge. The x edge shows minimal spin splitting. The results suggest this material has potential for spintronic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the role of nonsymmorphic symmetries in governing spin behavior in 1T WTe2, particularly in edge ribbons, and explore potential applications in spintronic devices.

Method: Magnetotransport analysis of 1T WTe2 monolayers, comparing edge ribbons with edges along y and x directions. Analyzing conductance, spin splitting, and spin quantization axes. Using energy-resolved current density and angular transmission to confirm edge state origins.

Result: Anisotropic magnetotransport response in 1T WTe2; significant spin splitting and conductance angular dependence in y-edge ribbons; negligible spin splitting in x-edge ribbons attributed to nonsymmorphic symmetries; spin degeneracy along Gamma X direction protected by symmetries; evidence for nonsymmorphic-symmetry-protected spin degeneracy; potential for spintronic devices using symmetry-protected transport channels.

Conclusion: Direct evidence of nonsymmorphic-symmetry-protected spin degeneracy in 1T WTe2 is established; material promising for spintronic applications where symmetry-protected and directional transport are advantageous.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive magnetotransport analysis of monolayer 1T WTe2,
highlighting the role of nonsymmorphic symmetries in governing edge-state spin
behavior. By comparing the electronic transmission in nanoribbons with edges
along the crystallographic y and x directions, our analysis reveals a
pronounced anisotropy in the magnetic field response. The y-edge ribbon
exhibits significant spin splitting of edge-state bands in both energy and
momentum space, along with a strong angular dependence of the conductance. The
observed magnetotransport response indicates a spin quantization axis that
aligns with the out-of-plane spin quantization axis reported in previous
experimental studies. In contrast, the x edge ribbon shows negligible spin
splitting under magnetic fields, which is attributed to nonsymmorphic
symmetries such as glide mirror and screw rotation, that protects degeneracies
along the Gamma X direction, even when time-reversal symmetry is broken. The
energy-resolved current density and angular transmission analyses confirm that
this anisotropy originates from edge states, while bulk states remain largely
insensitive to the field orientation. Our results establish direct
transport-spectroscopy based evidence of nonsymmorphic-symmetry-protected spin
degeneracy in the 1T WTe2, and underscores its promise for spintronic devices
that leverage symmetry-protected and directionally selective transport
channels.

Abstract: Generating coherent magnon spin currents with the highest frequencies and
shortest wavelengths is a key challenge in ultrafast spintronics and magnonics.
A promising route is to excite counter-propagating magnon pairs. In
antiferromagnets, such pairs can be accessed in the ultrafast regime, where
coherent dynamics are dominated by magnons at the edge of the Brillouin zone.
However, it has seemed impossible to generate a net spin current from coherent
magnon pairs. Here we show that a coherent superposition of multiple
magnon-pair modes can produce such a current in parity-time symmetric
antiferromagnets. The ultrafast coherent spin currents are excited with
linearly polarized light, with the light polarization steering the current
direction. Finally, by superposing two orthogonal spin currents, circular spin
currents can be generated, which have not been discussed for steady-state

Abstract: Intrinsic rhombohedral graphene hosts an unusual low-energy electronic
wavefunction, predominantly localized at its outer crystal faces with
negligible presence in the bulk. Increasing the number of graphene layers
amplifies the density of states near charge neutrality, greatly enhancing the
susceptibility to symmetry-breaking phases. Here, we report superconductivity
in rhombohedral graphene arising from an unusual charge-delocalized
semimetallic normal state, characterized by coexisting valence- and
conduction-band Fermi pockets split to opposite crystal surfaces. In octalayer
graphene, the superconductivity appears in five apparently distinct pockets for
each sign of an external electric displacement field ($D$). In a moir\'e
superlattice sample where heptalayer graphene is aligned on one side to
hexagonal boron nitride, two pockets of superconductivity emerge from a single
sharp resistive feature. At higher $D$ the same resistive feature additionally
induces an $h/e^{2}$-quantized anomalous Hall state at dopings near one
electron per moir\'e unit cell. Our findings reveal a novel superconducting
regime in multilayer graphene and create opportunities for coupling to nearby
topological states.
