Here, we develop a theoretical and computational framework to understand and predict multiphase morphologies in DNA-nanostar solutions. Because morphology is governed by interfacial energies between coexisting phases, we combine Flory-Huggins theory with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to examine how these energies depend on key microscopic features of DNA nanostars, including size, valence, bending rigidity, Debye screening length, binding strength, and sticky-end distribution. The phase behavior of DNA nanostars is quantitatively captured by a generalized lattice model, in which the interplay between sticky-end binding energy and conformational entropy determines the effective interactions. Focusing on condensates comprising two dense phases, we find that Janus-like morphologies are ubiquitous because the interfacial energies between the dense and dilute phases, $γ_{i\\in\\{1,2\\}}$, are typically comparable. In contrast, nested morphologies are rare as they require a large asymmetry in $γ_i$, which arises only for highly dissimilar nanostars such as those differing markedly in valence or size. Moreover, the interfacial energy between the two dense phases, $γ_{12}$, can be modulated either discretely, by varying sticky-end distribution, or continuously, by tuning the crosslinker ratio; the former may even eliminate nested configurations. These findings establish physical design principles for constructing complex condensate architectures directly from microscopic molecular parameters."}

In particular, the connections between memory effects, asymptotic symmetries, and soft theorems (the ``infrared triangle'') have been explored in much depth within the context of high-energy physics. In this paper, we show how sound also admits an infrared triangle. We consider the linear perturbations of the Euler equations for a barotropic and irrotational fluid and show how low-frequency changes in an acoustic source can lead to lasting displacements of fluid particles. We proceed to write these linear perturbations in terms of a two-form potential -- a Kalb--Ramond field, in the high-energy physics terminology. This phrases linear sound as a gauge theory and thus allows the use of standard techniques to probe the infrared structure of acoustics. We show how the memory effect relates to asymptotic symmetries in this dual formulation, and comment on how these notions can be connected to soft theorems. This exhibits the first example of an infrared triangle in a condensed matter system and provides new pathways to the experimental detection of memory effects."}

These interactions lead to band broadening, which can obscure the intrinsic spin-splitting in spectroscopic measurements. We consider a $d$-wave Lieb lattice altermagnet as a representative example. Our results reveal that the spin-splitting remains spectroscopically resolvable and provide theoretical estimates of lifetime effects relevant for experimental detection. For electron-magnon coupling, we find a distinct difference between spectral function broadening for up and down spins close to the Fermi surface, which is not present in the case of electron-phonon coupling. We relate it to the spin splitting of the magnon modes in altermagnets. The results, including magneto-elastic coupling, are very similar to the pure magnon case. This provides insights into quasiparticle dynamics in altermagnets and contributes to the broader understanding of many-body interactions in spin-split systems. By including the temperature dependence of the self-energies, we also quantify how thermal fluctuations influence the broadening of the electronic states."}

The hopping variation is controlled by a grading exponent, $α$, which serves as the tuning parameter of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, the ground state becomes localized as $|α| \\to 0$, signaling the presence of a critical point characterized by a diverging localization length. Using exact diagonalization, we perform finite-size scaling analysis and extract the associated critical exponent governing this divergence, revealing a universality class distinct from well-known Anderson, Aubry-Andre, and Stark localization. To further characterize the critical behavior, we analyze the inverse participation ratio, the energy gap between the ground and first excited states, and the fidelity susceptibility. We also investigate nonequilibrium dynamics by linearly ramping the hopping profile at various rates and tracking the evolution of the localization length and the inverse participation ratio. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism successfully captures the resulting dynamics using the critical exponents obtained from the static scaling analysis.

This work studies a class of fractional-order complex-valued bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks and proposes a unified analytical and data-driven framework for synchronization and local stability assessment. Using fractional Lyapunov stability theory together with Mittag-Leffler functions, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee global Mittag-Leffler synchronization of the drive-response systems under a linear error-feedback controller. In addition, an explicit conservative time-to-tolerance estimate is obtained via a standard upper bound on the Mittag-Leffler function. Numerical simulations corroborate the theory and demonstrate rapid decay of synchronization errors in both real and imaginary state components. To complement the model-based guarantees, two trajectory-driven Lyapunov proxies are introduced: (i) micro-ensemble FTLE estimation based on the geometric-mean growth of small perturbations, and (ii) a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) prediction-error index that quantifies local instability through short-term forecast errors. Both proxies reveal oscillatory transient divergence patterns and consistently reflect the stabilizing effect of the designed controller. The proposed integration of fractional calculus, synchronization control, and data-driven Lyapunov diagnostics provides a robust methodology for complex-valued fractional-order neural networks, with potential applications in secure communications and nonlinear signal processing."}

These bottlenecks hinder further advances in storage density and energy efficiency required by memory-centric computing. This Perspective outlines how coupling ferroelectric polarization with charge trapping can reconfigure the foundations of flash memory. In these hybrid architectures, polarization offers an energy-efficient pathway for charge modulation through enhanced Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, while trapped charges reinforce polarization-driven states to ensure stability. Such synergistic dynamics enable low-voltage operation and integration beyond one thousand layers without compromising process compatibility.

Here, we develop an analytically controlled theory of anyon dispersion in FQAH states realized in ideal or Aharonov-Casher (AC) bands by projecting interactions onto the space of Laughlin quasiholes. Constructing quasihole momentum eigenstates allows efficient evaluation of the single quasihole dispersion using Monte Carlo. We find that the quasihole bandwidth grows with increasing quantum-geometry inhomogeneity of the AC band and with increasing interaction screening length. For realistic parameters relevant to the bands of twisted MoTe${}_2$, the quasihole bandwidth is of order 1 meV, suggesting that itinerant-anyon physics may play an important role in sufficiently clean samples. Furthermore, we develop a microscopic Lagrangian framework in terms of a quasihole guiding-center coordinate, which reproduces the momentum-space formula for the dispersion. This approach reveals that quasihole dispersion originates from the combined effects of an interaction-generated periodic potential, arising from non-uniform quantum geometry of the single particle bands, and the quasihole many-body Berry phase arising from the background magnetic field. The latter endows the guiding-center coordinate with a noncommutative structure, converting the periodic potential into a finite dispersion. Finally, we outline how this framework generalizes to multiple quasiholes, enabling a microscopic theory of charged excitations in FQAH systems that retains only the anyon degrees of freedom."}

This particle production acts as a source of thermal friction on the field that can make it difficult to distinguish whether dark energy is due to a radiating field rolling down a steep potential, a purely self-interacting field moving down a flatter potential, or a cosmological constant. By reducing the acceleration of the scalar field, thermal friction increases the amount of accelerated expansion and can cause a sizable bump in the quintessence equation of state. We take special interest in the case where a steep potential rapidly changes from positive to negative as the field evolves, resulting in the end of cosmic expansion and the beginning of contraction. Even in this case, we find that thermal friction lengthens the period of accelerated expansion and consequently delays the end of cosmic expansion, making it challenging to detect the impending transition to contraction using conventional cosmological tests. However, particle production can also provide alternative avenues for detection by generating a background of thermal dark radiation, partly comprised of neutrinos or other particles, whose energy density exceeds the remnant photon energy density."}

We perform microwave-irradiated DNP using both monochromatic and frequency-modulated microwave excitation to explore the competition between these DNP mechanisms in diamond at room temperature. We demonstrate that frequency-modulated DNP is a tool for suppressing certain DNP mechanisms while enhancing others in a single-crystal diamond sample. Frequency modulation also enables higher enhancement of the NMR signal beyond traditional monochromatic DNP under some conditions. In a powder sample, competing enhancement mechanisms can also arise from different crystallite orientations in the powder. We observe that at certain microwave frequencies the DNP signal changes sign during the polarization build-up, even with monochromatic microwave irradiation. We do not observe this phenomenon in any single-crystal spectrum.

In order to investigate the radiation-induced bulk damage, these diodes have been irradiated with reactor neutrons at JSI (Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia) to fluences between $5\\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $1.5\\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$. This study focuses on the isothermal annealing behavior of the bulk material at different temperatures between 5.5°C and 60°C using electrical characterization and charge collection measurements. The results are used to extract the annealing time constants for this material and fluence range based on the Hamburg model approach to allow an estimation of the expected annealing effects in silicon sensors during the year-end technical stops and the long HL-LHC shutdowns. The annealing parameters found will make it possible to model the annealing behavior of p-type silicon detector projects at HL-LHC fluence ranges better than the existing Hamburg model."}

The ensuing multi-orbital variant of the Peregrine soliton features notable deviations from its mean-field sibling, including a reduced peak amplitude, wider core, absence of the side density dips, and earlier formation times. Moreover, Peregrine soliton generation yields coherence losses, while experiencing two-body bunching within each of its sides which show anti-bunching between each other. Controllable seeding of the Peregrine soliton is also demonstrated by tuning the atom number or the box length, while reducing the latter favors the generation of the time-periodic Kuznetsov-Ma breather.

Questions about finite time dynamics (evolution) were always considered as, although important for practical applications, but untreatable rigorously (mathematically). The same attitude was in the theory of strongly chaotic dynamical systems, which evolve similarly to stochastic processes. However, a natural question on dependence of the process of escape on a position of a \"hole\" in the state (phase) space, which was never asked in mathematical theory of open dynamical systems, opened up a new direction of research, which was dealing with finite time predictions of evolutions of such systems. It turned out, that transport of orbits in the phase space of the \"most strongly chaotic\" dynamical systems has three different stages. In the first stage there is a hierarchy of the first hitting probabilities, that shows which parts of the phase space the orbits of a system, which is an equilibrium state, will be more likely to visit the first. A principal (and the most important for applications) question was how the length of this interval changes with more refinement observations of the positions of the orbits in the phase space. Surprisingly, it turned out that the length of the time interval, where finite time predictions are possible, increases (rather to be shrinking), which, at the first sight, seems to be natural. However, this increase of the length of the time interval, where finite time predictions are possible, was rather slow (just linear) with respect to the growth of precision (partition of the phase space) of observations. In the present paper it is proved (by totally different technique) that this growth is actually exponential."}

Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the low-temperature phase diagram as a function of experimentally tunable parameters. We uncover a diverse landscape of phases driven by dipolar correlations. Under strong dipole fluctuations, a quadrupolar superfluid emerges. Suppressing charge tunneling nucleates a droplet state stabilized by the attractive interaction between antiparallel dipoles. At high exciton densities, the system gives way to a partially fragmented condensate, characterized by competing quadrupolar and dipolar superfluid states. Furthermore, at a large exciton mass and high density, we find a staggered dipolar crystal. Our detailed study of the dependence of exciton energy shifts on an external electric field directly interprets existing experimental data and underscores the crucial role of the antiparallel dipolar configuration.

However, traditional protective structures typically suffer from limitations such as excessive thickness and inadequate load-bearing capacity. Guided by the design concepts of debris-cloud deflection and hierarchical energy dissipation, this study proposes a trajectory-planning lattice protective structure. First, the lattice parameters and geometry were designed according to the functional relationship between the incident angle and the transmitted/ricochet trajectory angles. Subsequently, multi-angle hypervelocity impact experiments were carried out to evaluate the proposed lattice protection structure. In combination with post-impact CT three-dimensional reconstruction and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical simulations, the protective mechanisms of the lattice structure were systematically characterized and clarified. The results demonstrate that, for three oblique incidence conditions, the lattice structure remained intact and significantly deflected the debris-cloud momentum direction while effectively dissipating its kinetic energy. The angled plates with gradient designs enabled continuous changes in the momentum direction and stepwise kinetic energy dissipation through multiple cycles of debrisation, dispersion, and trajectory deflection. This research presents a novel, engineering-ready approach for spacecraft MMOD protection and validates the potential of trajectory-planning lattice structures for hypervelocity impact defense."}

In Part I, Curvature-Driven Dynamics on S3: A Geometric Atlas, we introduced the inertial curvature field Kgeo associated with a left-invariant metric on SU2, constructed a geometric Atlas of curvature regimes, and identified the inertia ratio 2:2:1 as a curvature-balanced regime giving rise to a pure-precession family for the heavy top, building on the prior dynamical discovery of this regime. Here we develop the curvature Atlas into a classification tool for integrable and near-integrable rigid-body regimes. We show that all classical integrable heavy-top cases (Euler, Lagrange, Kovalevskaya, Goryachev-Chaplygin) correspond to specific degenerate curvature signatures of Kgeo. In each case the inertia tensor imposes a simple algebraic structure on the inertial curvature field: vanishing of one component, symmetric curvature pairs, or orthogonal curvature splitting. We formulate and prove a curvature classification theorem describing these signatures and their relation to integrability. We then single out the mixed anisotropic ratio 2:2:1 as a minimally nondegenerate curvature-balanced regime: it destroys algebraic integrability while preserving an exact curvature balance, giving rise to pure precession for the heavy top. Finally, we introduce a curvature deviation functional measuring the distance to the nearest integrable curvature signature, describe near-integrable regimes in a neighbourhood of 2:2:1, and present an integrability map."}

These families are constructed via Brownian motions in the Hilbert space, defined using disordered, time-dependent couplings. The dimension spanned by them has zero variance over the ensemble of disordered couplings, and it is determined by certain replica partition functions. We apply these methods to finite dimensional $q$-local systems (spin clusters and SYK) and black holes. For $q$-local systems we find exact expressions at finite $q$, $N$, and $t$, for replica partition functions, together with universal behavior at large times and a semiclassical analysis at large-$N$ in appropriate master field variables. The right Hilbert space dimension is obtained for any time $t>0$, $q>1$ and $N>0$. For black holes, the Brownian motions prepare quantitatively generic ensembles of black hole microstates, and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is universally reproduced by counting those. There the $n$-replica partition functions are constructed by gluing $n$-traversable womrholes at their future and past. This method demonstrates the robustness of black hole microstate counting methods, avoiding several limitations of previous constructions, including the non-genericity of the microstates and associated interiors, implicit statistics of heavy operators, limited microscopic control over overlaps, and the need for specific limits in the calculation."}

While several types of Floquet phases have been classified, a unified picture of Floquet MBL is still emerging. Static phases have been fruitfully studied via \"symmetry topological field theory\" (SymTFT), wherein the universal features of $G$-symmetric systems are elucidated by placing them on the boundary of a topological order of one dimension higher. In this work, we provide a SymTFT approach to classifying $G$-symmetric Floquet MBL phases in 1D, for $G$ a finite Abelian group with on-site unitary action. In the SymTFT, these 1D systems correspond to the boundaries of the quantum double associated to $G$, and the classification naturally arises from considering the Lagrangian subgroups and boundary excitations of the quantum double. The classification covers all known Floquet phases while uncovering others previously unexplored, along with bulk features of phases thought to have only boundary signatures. We refer to the latter phases as \"dual\" time crystals. For static phases, we show how anyons of the quantum double and (string) order parameters provide a natural and simple interpretation of known classification schemes. By extending our framework to the boundaries of twisted quantum doubles, we uncover a new time-crystalline phase with non-onsite symmetry, which cannot be obtained through local, symmetric Hamiltonian drives. We numerically demonstrate evidence for the absolute stability of this phase, and observe that for open boundary conditions it has greater stability to symmetric perturbations. We finally discuss perspectives on using programmable quantum devices to realise and probe the phases we discuss. Our results show that SymTFT provides a powerful approach to unifying phases and features of Floquet systems."}

Coincident measurement of three-dimensional photoion and photoelectron momenta provides real-time access to both the instantaneous internuclear separation and the accompanying reorganization of the electronic structure, allowing us to determine the timescale of bond breaking.

Main contributions are open-source software code: A hybrid approach mixing \"traditional\" nonconvex and convex methods can make difficult problems more accessible. A demonstration of how to efficiently implement such an algorithm, avoiding interfacial bottlenecks, is provided, finding optimal protocols to establish entanglement through a lossy channel. The central software package developed addresses polynomial optimization problems. Many problems naturally involve only a polynomial objective and constraint polynomials. Such problems can automatically be cast into semidefinite programs that provide a hierarchy of outer approximations. The resulting problems are often so large and scale so unfavorably with respect to the variable number and degree involved that the boundary of the doable is reached quickly. However, technical progress both in hardware and algorithms has pushed this boundary - but software frameworks for polynomial optimization have not followed in the same manner, often now making them the bottleneck that before was the solver. The package PolynomialOptimization.jl developed during this thesis aims to fill the gap and provide a very resource-efficient intermediate layer together with a wide number of algorithms to reduce the problem size, and naturally supporting complex numbers and semidefinite constraints ubiquitous in quantum information problems. Its application on an entanglement distribution problem is demonstrated, showing that even relaxations with semidefinite matrices of three- and four-digit size can be solved conveniently. Finally, a new way to calculate interior-point barriers for the cone of sums-of-squares matrices in a nearly time-optimal way is developed, whose efficient implementation has the potential of further reducing resource consumption."}

In these circuits, the entanglement membrane determining operator growth and entanglement dynamics can be characterized analytically. Completely reducible circuits extend the notion of space-time symmetry to more general lattice geometries, breaking dual-unitarity globally but not locally, and allow for a rich phenomenology going beyond dual-unitarity. As example, we introduce circuits that support four and five directions of information flow. We derive a general expression for the entanglement line tension in terms of the pattern of information flow in spacetime. The solvability is shown to be related to the absence of knots of this information flow, connecting entanglement dynamics to the Kauffman bracket as knot invariant.

This occurs because BHs in this theory can only lose charge by emitting baryons, a process suppressed by a combinatoric factor $e^{-N\\log N}$. Once extremality is reached the BH evolution halts for exponentially long times, $τ_{\\rm BH}\\gtrsim e^{N\\log N}$, without being protected by any symmetry. At times $t\\ggτ_{\\rm BH}$ the BH forms a cloud of deconfined quarks around it, a \\textit{quark corona}. The quarks are connected to the horizon by strings extending throughout distances that can be much larger than the inverse of the confinement scale, $Λ_N^{-1}$. Strikingly, due to energy conservation, these long strings cannot break even for light quarks. These effects can be further enhanced in clockwork-like theories based on Yang-Mills sectors of the type, $SU(N_1)\\times SU(N_2)\\times ...\\times U(1)$. As an application to phenomenology, we give examples where BHs as light as one gram survive until today without evaporating, opening up regions of parameter space for primordial BH dark matter previously excluded by Hawking evaporation. This result relies only on large-$N$ combinatorics and is independent of the radiation mechanism from the BH, particle masses, and confinement scale. The theories we discuss pass non-trivial tests imposed by Swampland conjectures, including completeness of the spectrum as well as the weak gravity conjecture."}

In this variable, it is more natural to see how both mode families can be excited by initial data, and to approximate the Green's function with saddle points. Finally, we investigate the QNM emission from boson clouds - the latter effectively consisting of a single QBS - driven by the tidal perturbation of a second compact object. We show that while the resonant emission of QNMs is generally suppressed, QNM transitions may be more prominent when the interaction with the perturber is non-resonant, such as in the dynamical capture of unbound objects, and when the perturber transits close to the light ring."}

As this device utilizes sensors and readout electronics adapted from particle physics, where the expected energy and count rate differ significantly from radiotherapy, validation was necessary to ensure that these sensors would function effectively at the order 100 MeV/u energies and order MHz count rates expected during clinical irradiation. Tests were conducted using scattered subclinical 19 MeV protons at high intensity, and clinical 207 MeV/u carbon ions at low intensity to independently validate these variables.

This requires engineering systems with very low entropies, but the resulting temperature--interaction ratios $T/U$ of present experiments remain well above the domain where zero-temperature theories are expected to be reliable. The quantum-rotor approach (QRA), while analytically powerful and extremely flexible, inherits ground-state phase correlations and therefore breaks down once thermal winding of the phase field becomes significant. Here we construct a finite-temperature extension of QRA by (i) performing resummation of winding-number contributions for temperatures $k_{B}T/U\\lesssim 0.2$ and (ii) developing an auxiliary-variable expansion that remains accurate toward the classical limit. The resulting closed expression for the phase correlator is inserted into the standard spherical-approximation QRA without sacrificing the method's flexibility with respect to lattice geometry and dimensionality. The approach reproduces the shrinkage of Mott lobes from $T=0$ up to $k_{B}T/U\\simeq 0.2$ in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions and with in-situ imaging experiments. This finite-T QRA thus supplies an analytic, computationally light tool for strongly correlated lattice bosons and sets the stage for amplitude-fluctuation upgrades required at higher temperatures."}

The FPGA solution directly interfaces an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) with the subsequent data processing logic, eliminating buffering and interface overheads. As a baseline, the GPU-based system employs a high-speed PCIe image grabber for image input and I/O card for state output. We deploy Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models on hardware to evaluate measurement performance. Compared to conventional thresholding, DNNs reduce the mean measurement fidelity (MMF) error by factors of 1.8-2.5x (one-qubit case) and 4.2-7.6x (three-qubit case). FPGA-based MLP and ViT achieve nanosecond- and microsecond-scale inference latencies, while the complete single-shot measurement process achieves over 100x speedup compared to the GPU implementation. Additionally, clock-cycle-level signal analysis reveals inefficiencies in EMCCD data transmission via Cameralink, suggesting that optimizing this interface could further leverage the advantages of ultra-low-latency DNN inference, guiding the development of next-generation qubit detection systems."}

We observe striking electron-hole asymmetry in GWC melting: hole-doped GWCs yield interaction-driven disordered states whereas electron-doped GWCs melt into delocalized liquid-like states. This asymmetry arises from the broken particle-hole symmetry of the moiré superlattice, which produces electron and hole Fermi pockets with different momentum geometries upon GWC condensation. MI states melt without such asymmetry, consistent with the absence of a symmetry-breaking density modulation.

It has revealed a variety of new properties and structures even for tree-level gluon amplitudes such as hidden zeros and splits, and in this note we provide another example: we study differential operators acting on Yang-Mills amplitudes with respect to $2n$-scalar kinematic variables, which convert such scalar-scaffolded gluons into scalars. In particular, we find $(n{-}1)$-fold differential operators (using $2n$-scalar variables) that turn the $n$-gluon amplitude into a single planar $φ^3$ diagram; we then generalize such operators to those that convert $n$ gluons to mixed amplitudes with $r$ scalars and $n{-}r$ gluons (the latter can be viewed as insertions on $φ^3$ diagrams). We also show that the number of linearly independent mixed amplitudes with $r$ scalars and $n-r$ gluons is given by the number of $φ^3$ diagrams, the Catalan number $\\mathcal{C}_{r-2}$, which can be viewed as a generalization of the ``uniqueness\" theorem of gluon amplitudes (with $r=0$). Finally, our construction leads to a planar version of the universal expansion of Yang-Mills amplitudes into a sum of gauge-invariant prefactors built from nested commutators, each accompanied by an mixed amplitude in the natural basis. This formulation significantly reduces the redundancy present in the original expansion."}

We further obtain critical parameter relations that govern the dynamics, including a threshold linking initial compactness to immediate horizon formation. The model is geometrically self-consistent within Einstein's equations but exhibits violations of the standard point-wise energy conditions, highlighting known limitations of idealized anisotropic matter models and delineating the boundary where classical descriptions become inadequate.

Accurate results can often be obtained for such systems by employing periodic density functional theory using hybrid functionals; however, this is not always computationally feasible. One possibility to circumvent these expensive periodic calculations is the utilization of multimer embedding methods. Therein, the fully periodic crystal is described at a lower level of theory, and subsequently monomer energies, dimer interaction energies, etc. are corrected via high-level calculations. In this paper, we further extend such a multimer embedding approach by one multimer order for all investigated properties, allowing us to compute lattice energies up to the tetramer embedding level, and atomic forces, the stress tensor, and harmonic phonons up to the trimer level. We test the significance of including these higher-order multimers by embedding PBE0+MBD multimers into periodic PBE+MBD calculations utilizing the X23 benchmark set of molecular crystals and comparing the results to explicit periodic PBE0+MBD calculations. We show that tetramer interactions systematically improve the lattice energy approximation and explore multiple possibilities for multimer selection. Furthermore, we confirm that trimer interactions are crucial for the description of the stress tensor, yielding cell volumes within 1 % of those of PBE0+MBD. Subsequently, this also results in an improvement of the description of vibrational properties, giving on average gamma point frequencies within 1.3 wave numbers and vibrational free energies within 0.3 kJ/mol of the PBE0+MBD results."}

Many-body phases with supersolid properties in fact reduce to a few recent observations for weakly interacting Bose gases. Here, we demonstrate a new framework to realize supersolid crystals in the strong interaction regime, by confining dipolar bosons in a lattice with long-range hopping. We study dipolar excitons that genuinely realize this lattice model. At fractional lattice fillings - 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 - we report mesoscopic quantum solids, across over 100 sites, spontaneously breaking translational symmetry. At the same time, we show that off-diagonal long-range order is induced by long-range hopping, such that exciton solids are superfluids. State-of-the-art numerical methods quantitatively confirm that supersolidity builds up in the ground-state of the lattice Hamiltonian. Our studies of strongly-correlated supersolid crystals open new frontiers for exploration in condensed matter physics."}

We present a framework encompassing a large class of such non-integrable models with exactly solvable dynamics, which we term \\emph{completely reducible} circuits. In these circuits, the entanglement membrane determining operator growth and entanglement dynamics can be characterized analytically. Completely reducible circuits extend the notion of space-time symmetry to more general lattice geometries, breaking dual-unitarity globally but not locally, and allow for a rich phenomenology going beyond dual-unitarity. As example, we introduce circuits that support four and five directions of information flow. We derive a general expression for the entanglement line tension in terms of the pattern of information flow in spacetime. The solvability is shown to be related to the absence of knots of this information flow, connecting entanglement dynamics to the Kauffman bracket as knot invariant. Building on these results, we propose that in general non-integrable dynamics the curvature of the entanglement line tension can be interpreted as a density of information transport.

Finally, we show that while existing nonperturbative proofs of dimensional reduction apply only to scalar Lagrangians, our formulation of Cardy's argument extends to any theory with Parisi--Sourlas supersymmetry."}

We show that a single, synthetically plausible organic one-dimensional chain, tunable via chemical modification of its radical sites, hosts two such phases: an odd-Haldane phase of a dimerized $S=\\tfrac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain and a Haldane phase of an $S=1$ chain realized when Hund coupling locks two $S=\\tfrac{1}{2}$ spins per monomer into $S=1$. Density-functional theory places the active manifold deep in the Mott regime ($U/t\\!\\approx\\!126$), justifying a spin-only Heisenberg description; a compact $(t,U)\\!\\to\\!J$ mapping then fixes exchange couplings. Exact diagonalization and DMRG reveal a consistent SPT fingerprint across both phases, including a quantized many-body Zak phase, even-degenerate entanglement spectrum, protected edge spins, and characteristic triplon/Haldane features in $S^{+-}(q,ω)$. Our results identify a chemically programmable molecular platform for interacting SPT physics in one dimension and suggest concrete spectroscopic routes to organic Haldane spin chains for nanoscale quantum devices."}

The first dynamical system formulation applied to the toy NMDC model, although able to identify several invariant submanifolds, fails to fully investigate the fixed point structure, as all the fixed points turn out to be non-hyperbolic. We, however, discover an interesting feature that the qualitative dynamics are independent of the coupling strength between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field derivative. The second dynamical system formulation applied to the mixed $R^2$-Higgs inflation model performs much better, being able to correctly reduce to the individual phase spaces of the $R^2$ and Higgs inflation separately in special cases, as well as correctly delivering the expected invariant submanifolds and fixed points. For the mixed $R^2$-Higgs case, illustrative phase portraits are provided for a somewhat better understanding of the dynamics."}

Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the low-temperature phase diagram as a function of experimentally tunable parameters. We uncover a diverse landscape of phases driven by dipolar correlations. Under strong dipole fluctuations, a quadrupolar superfluid emerges. Suppressing charge tunneling nucleates a droplet state stabilized by the attractive interaction between antiparallel dipoles. At high exciton densities, the system gives way to a partially fragmented condensate, characterized by competing quadrupolar and dipolar superfluid states. Furthermore, at a large exciton mass and high density, we find a staggered dipolar crystal. Our detailed study of the dependence of exciton energy shifts on an external electric field directly interprets existing experimental data and underscores the crucial role of the antiparallel dipolar configuration. Our results provide a guide for future experimental explorations of quantum phases of trilayer excitons."}

First, assuming the field to be initially in a zero-mean Gaussian Hadamard state in a globally hyperbolic spacetime, we evaluate the field's two-point function in second-order perturbation theory by techniques of covariant curved spacetime quantum field theory, which allow a full control of the time and space localisation of the interaction, and do not rely on field mode decompositions or non-local particle countings. The detector's two-point function splits into a deterministic and a fluctuating part, and we show that this split is maintained in the back-action.\n  We then specialise to a two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector, prepared in an energy eigenstate, for which the back-action is fully fluctuating. We compute the renormalised stress-energy tensor for a massless scalar field in $(3+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime for a general detector trajectory, using the manifestly causal two-point function. We present explicit analytic and numerical results for an inertial detector and a uniformly linearly accelerated detector, switched on in the asymptotic past. The energy flux into and out of the accelerated detector accounts exactly for the energy gained and lost by the detector in its transitions due to the Unruh effect. The same holds for the outward flux associated with de-excitations of the inertial detector, which has a vanishing excitation rate and no inward flux. A novelty with the accelerated detector is two regions of negative energy density when the detector is initially prepared in its ground state, one near the Rindler horizon that bounds the causal future of the trajectory, the other in the far future of the trajectory."}

The model identifies key scaling relationships: surface acceleration scales as $τ^{-2}$ with pulse duration, while acoustic diffraction sets fundamental limits on optimal spot size $w \\gtrsim \\sqrt{vτd}$. Material figures of merit combine thermal expansion and optical absorption properties, suggesting alternatives to traditional aluminum substrates. The framework validates well against experimental data and demonstrates that compact laser systems with sub-nanosecond pulse durations can achieve performance competitive with existing laboratory-scale implementations despite orders-of-magnitude lower pulse energies.

Remarkably, the post-measurement state factorizes into a product of Bell pairs, establishing maximal interlayer entanglement entirely independent of the initial Gaussian state. We derive this post-measurement state exactly for general particle-number-conserving fermionic Gaussian states, establishing both the validity and universality of the mechanism, with numerical simulations serving as consistency checks. This phenomenon arises from a robust interplay between fermionic statistics and Gaussianity, revealing a distinct fermionic route to measurement-induced maximal entanglement."}

As the flow velocity $u$ exceeds a critical value, the system transitions to a state with coupled spatial and temporal oscillations. Experimentally, the instability should manifest as (i) a nonanalytic behavior characteristic of a second-order transition--an abrupt increase in time-averaged current--and (ii) narrow-band emission at the characteristic ``washboard'' frequency $f=u/λ$, where $λ$ is the modulation wavelength. This behavior parallels the AC and DC transport of sliding charge-density waves, but here it originates from a distinct, intrinsic mechanism unrelated to disorder. Estimates indicate that the emission frequency $f$, tunable by current, spans a broad range, highlighting Dirac bands as a promising platform for high-frequency electron-fluid dynamics."}

Expressions are obtained for GW damping and the consequent heating of the fluid, and implemented in computer code. The results are applied to astrophysical scenarios: Core collapse supernovae, the post-merger signal from a binary neutron star merger, and matter accreting at a binary black hole merger. It is found that, compared to the Minkowski case, the damping and heating effects increase, in some cases by several orders of magnitude.

Using a rigorous modal formulation for TM-polarized fields, we analyze the complex electromagnetic field and the associated time-averaged Poynt- ing vector.

This topological transition redirects the local energy flux and manifests as a convex scattering profile in the far field.

Detailed analysis reveals that these correlated plasmons, arising from the collective excitations within Mott-correlated bands, are driven by long-range electronic correlations in the Cu-O planes.

This method is implemented on a hybrid neural engine, with the physical layer realized by an integrated silicon photonic mesh and the digital layer by a simple regression algorithm. Non-linearities are intrinsically non-power depended and are generated through non-linear frequency to power mapping offered by optical filters. The numerical evaluation is based on an experimentally derived transfer function of an all-pass filter, implemented on a silicon reconfigurable photonic integrated chip -RPIC. RN-ELM is evaluated in a twofold manner; first as a machine learning scheme, where the expressivity offered by multiple, yet random, activation functions lead to a compact and highly simplified design with 5 optical filters, offering state-of-the-art performance in time-series prediction tasks with minimum hardware requirements. The second scenario entails its deployment as a physical unclonable function -PUF, for authentication applications directly in the physical layer. In this case, the random activation functions are associated with unavoidable, fabrication related waveguide imperfections that can act as hardware signatures. Numerical results reveal a probability of cloning as low as 10e-15, which corresponds to a highly secure authentication token."}

We uncover striking optical resonances that we identify as Wigner polarons, quasiparticles formed when the electron lattice is locally distorted by exciton-Wigner crystal coupling. We further achieve all-optical control of spins in the Wigner crystal, directly probing valley-dependent Wigner polaron scattering well above the magnetic ordering temperature and in the absence of any external magnetic field. Finally, we demonstrate optical melting of the Wigner crystal and observe intriguingly different responses of the umklapp (static) and Wigner polaron (dynamic) resonances to optical excitation.

However, its clinical success hinges on the availability of photosensitizers with strong optical sensitivity and high efficiency in generating reactive oxygen species. While classical computational methods have provided useful insights into photosensitizer design, they struggle to scale and often lack the accuracy needed for these simulations. In this work, we show how fault-tolerant quantum algorithms can be used to identify promising photosensitizer candidates for PDT. To predict photosensitizer performance, we assess two computational properties. First, we quantify light sensitivity by calculating the cumulative absorption in the therapeutic window with a threshold projection algorithm. Second, we determine the efficiency of reactive oxygen generation by estimating intersystem crossing (ISC) rates using the evolution-proxy approach, complemented by a vibronic dynamic treatment where appropriate. We apply these algorithms to a clinically relevant and actively pursued class of photosensitizers, BODIPY derivatives, including heavy-atom and transition-metal-substituted systems that are challenging for classical methods. Our resource estimates, obtained with PennyLane, suggest that systems with active spaces ranging from 11 to 45 spatial orbitals can be simulated using $180$-$350$ logical qubits and Toffoli gate depths between $10^7$ and $10^9$, placing our algorithms within reach of realistic fault-tolerant quantum devices. This paves the way to an efficient quantum-based workflow for designing photosensitizers that can accelerate the discovery of new PDT agents."}

Glitches cause biased and less precise inference for short-duration signals such as massive black hole binaries, but their effect on long-lived sources such as EMRIs has not been quantified. Using simulated LISA observations containing injected EMRIs and streams of shapelet-based glitches drawn from the LISA Pathfinder catalog, we estimate the glitch-induced parameter biases and uncertainties through a Fisher-matrix-based analysis whose accuracy we verify with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo. We find that moderately mitigated glitch streams i.e. ones containing only glitches of up to moderate SNRs ($ρ\\lesssim 90$) induce negligible to minor biases $[\\sim0.04σ,\\sim0.6σ]$ in the inferred EMRI parameters. In contrast, weakly mitigated glitch streams containing higher-SNR events ($ρ\\lesssim 400$) can produce biases nearing $1σ$. These results demonstrate that, when compared to inference of other sources such as massive black hole binaries, EMRI inference is notably more robust to glitches. We stress that at least some amount of glitch modeling and mitigation remains essential for unbiased EMRI analyses in the LISA era."}

We consider two initially decoupled, half-filled copies of a free-fermion system in arbitrary dimensions and perform post-selective Bell measurements on half of the corresponding sites across the two copies. Remarkably, the post-measurement state factorizes into a product of Bell pairs, establishing maximal interlayer entanglement entirely independent of the initial Gaussian state. We derive this post-measurement state exactly for general particle-number-conserving fermionic Gaussian states, establishing both the validity and universality of the mechanism, with numerical simulations serving as consistency checks. This phenomenon arises from a robust interplay between fermionic statistics and Gaussianity, revealing a distinct fermionic route to measurement-induced maximal entanglement."}

On the one hand, we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for a maximally supersymmetric supergravity theory in 3D to be a solution of 11D supergravity (but the result is general and also holds for 10D supergravities), with 8 dimensions compactified into a coset space. The used method is based on the formalism of generalised geometry, useful for the study of dualities in string theory and supergravity. The analysis extends the known results to the case in which the duality group of the reduced theory is $E_{8(8)}$, whose generalised geometry is still little understood. On the other hand, we study properties of the so-called covariant fracton gauge theory, computing the BRST cohomology and consistent anomalies, and showing that its solutions describe a specific subsector of an extension of General Relativity, called Moller-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. Covariant fracton theory is the gauge theory of a symmetric rank-2 tensor, invariant under gauge transformations depending on the second derivative of a scalar parameter, and is the Lorentz-covariant extension of the continuous limit of spin-chain theories admitting excitations with reduced mobility (called fractons), due to the conservation of the dipole moment. In both cases, the Weitzenböck torsion plays a crucial rôle. The Thesis includes a self-contained review of the main notions needed to understand the original results, comprising, in addition to the already mentioned topics, duality in supergravity theories, the generalised Lie derivative, formulation of eleven-dimensional supergravity suitable to reductions with duality groups given by exceptional Lie groups, salient aspects of three-dimensional gravity, and the BRST formalism for computing anomalies in field theories."}

Here, we propose an interlayer coupling scheme to generate higher Chern numbers in a flat-band system, where the interlayer coupling transforms two C = 1 bands in a bilayer checkerboard lattice into a single flat band with C = 2 by lifting their degeneracy and merging their topological indices. Exact diagonalization calculation reveals that this engineered band hosts two fractional Chern insulator states with C = 2/3 and 2/5, respectively. An experimental setup is proposed to simulate these states using cold alkaline-earth-like atoms in an effective bilayer optical lattice.

Often, however, it is not clear a priori whether a pair of monolayers twisted at a small angle will exhibit correlated or interaction-driven phenomena. The computational cost to make accurate predictions of the single particle states is significant, as small twists require very large unit cells, easily encompassing 10,000 atoms, and therefore implementing a high throughput prediction has been out of reach. Here we show a path to overcome this challenge by introducing a machine learning (ML) based methodology that efficiently estimates the twisted interlayer tunneling at arbitrarily low twist angles through the local-configuration based approach that enables interpolating the local stacking for a range of twist angles using a random forest regression algorithm. We leverage the kernel polynomial method to compute the density of states (DOS) on large real space graphs by reconstructing a lattice model of the twisted bilayer with the ML fitted hoppings. For twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), we show the ability of the method to resolve the magic angle DOS at a substantial improvement in computational time. We use this new technique to scan through the database of stable 2D monolayers (MC2D) and reveal new twistable candidates across the five possible points groups in two-dimensions with a large DOS near the Fermi energy, with potentially exciting interacting physics to be probed in future experiments."}

The resulting circuit is low depth, uses a fixed gate set, and (in this smallest setting) requires no entanglement in the input state. Beyond the specific example, the main message is operational. It highlights a regime in which optimal oracle discrimination is not only well-defined but implementably explicit: the optimal POVM collapses to a compact gate-level primitive that can be compiled, verified, and composed inside larger routines. Motivated by this, we discuss a \"what if\" question that is open in spirit: for fixed (n,m,k), could optimal k-query identification (possibly for large hypothesis classes) admit deterministic, closed-form descriptions of the inter-query unitaries and the final measurement unitary acting on the natural n+m-qubit input--output registers (and, if needed, small work registers)?

The hyperfine interaction suppresses the QCP and leads to a gradual crossover between induced electronic and nuclear hyperfine coupling dominated magnetic order. It is shown how the critical temperature depends on the electronic and nuclear control parameters including the nuclear spin size and its possible nuclear quadrupole splitting. In particular the dependence of the specific heat on the control parameters and applied field is investigated for ferro- and antiferromagnetic order.

We search for strongly lensed events in the newly acquired data by (1) searching for an overall phase shift present in an image formed at a saddle point of the lens potential, (2) looking for pairs of detected candidates with consistent frequency evolution, and (3) identifying sub-threshold counterpart candidates to the detected signals.

One major challenge in realizing the chip-scale self-referencing function is to generate octave-spanning soliton microcombs with low operation power. Accessing soliton states is also not trivial due to the thermal effect. Though an auxiliary laser was utilized to compensate for the thermal effect, deterministic single soliton generation is still elusive, especially for broadband operation. In this work, dispersion management is performed for a 4H-silicon carbide-on-insulator (SiCOI) multi-mode microring resonator, benefiting from the submicron-confinement waveguide layout. The fundamental transverse electric (TE) mode is engineered to anomalous dispersion for two dispersive waves generation over an octave span. While a higher order TE mode is engineered to normal dispersion to accommodate the auxiliary light for thermal compensation. The normal dispersion prevents modulation-instability Kerr comb generation, allowing for a large soliton existence range. We achieve microring resonators with Q up to 5.8 million and sub-milli-watt-threshold Kerr comb generation. Combining the dispersion-managed design and high Q device, we demonstrate the deterministic generation of a single soliton comb spanning beyond an octave with a low on-chip power of 60 mW.

Here, we develop an analytically controlled theory of anyon dispersion in FQAH states realized in ideal or Aharonov-Casher (AC) bands by projecting interactions onto the space of Laughlin quasiholes. Constructing quasihole momentum eigenstates allows efficient evaluation of the single quasihole dispersion using Monte Carlo. We find that the quasihole bandwidth grows with increasing quantum-geometry inhomogeneity of the AC band and with increasing interaction screening length. For realistic parameters relevant to the bands of twisted MoTe${}_2$, the quasihole bandwidth is of order 1 meV, suggesting that itinerant-anyon physics may play an important role in sufficiently clean samples. Furthermore, we develop a microscopic Lagrangian framework in terms of a quasihole guiding-center coordinate, which reproduces the momentum-space formula for the dispersion. This approach reveals that quasihole dispersion originates from the combined effects of an interaction-generated periodic potential, arising from non-uniform quantum geometry of the single particle bands, and the quasihole many-body Berry phase arising from the background magnetic field.

We develop a unified framework for incorporating a generic quantum resource, including athermality, quantum coherence, and entanglement, into fluctuation theorems. We work within the end point measurement scheme, which avoids an initial energy measurement and allows quantum resources in the initial state to affect nonequilibrium energy statistics. We derive a family of quantum fluctuation theorems, including generalized Jarzynski equalities and Crooks type fluctuation relations, in which corrections decompose into resource resolved contributions. For single systems, we introduce the concept of weight of athermality, and combine it with the weight of coherence to isolate distinct thermodynamic effects of these quantum resources. For bipartite systems, we furthermore obtain two families of entanglement-resolved fluctuation theorems using an appended correlation operator and the best separable approximation, respectively. Finally, we introduce the concepts of coherence and entanglement fluctuation distances, as Kullback Leibler divergences, which quantify the thermodynamic relevance of quantum resources in a process-dependent and operational manner."}

We focus on perturbations of $d$-dimensional Tangherlini black holes and recast the TTM problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem by utilizing the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. The results show that TTMs are generically spectrally unstable, with sensitivity increasing for higher overtones, in close analogy with quasinormal modes.

According to Copenhagen interpretation, an unobserved quantum system evolves continuously based on the Schrodinger equation, whereas observation induces an instantaneous collapse of the wave function to an eigenstate. This contrast between continuous evolution and sudden collapse renders the single particle behavior particularly enigmatic, especially given that quantum mechanics itself is constructed upon the statistical behavior of ensembles rather than individual entities. In this study, we introduce a Double Slit Diffraction Surrogate Model DSM based on deep learning, designed to capture the mapping between wave functions and probability distributions. The DSM explores multiple potential propagation paths and adaptively selects optimal transmission channels using gradient descent, forming a backbone for the information through the network. By comparing the interpretability of paths and interference, we propose an intuitive physical analogy: the particle behaves like a stretchable dough, extending across both slits, reconnecting after transmission, allowing detachment before the barrier. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that this framework can naturally reproduce the characteristic interference and diffraction probability patterns. Our approach offers a novel, physically interpretable perspective on quantum superposition and measurement induced collapse. The dough analogy is expected to extend to other quantum phenomena.

Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and $\\rm BiFeO_3$ as a model system, we first demonstrate how epitaxial strain exactly leads to anisotropic magnetic interactions where the exchange coupling along the $c$-axis differs from that in the $ab$-plane. We show that subtle structural modifications, specifically the distortion from a cubic to a tetragonal lattice, drive a magnetic phase transition from a G-type to a C-type antiferromagnetic (AF) phase. The anisotropy in magnetic interactions, which becomes prominent in the lower symmetry tetragonal phase, provides a direct link between the structural distortion and the potential change in magnetic ordering. For a more comprehensive study, we next investigate the role of strain in driving magnetic phase transitions within a half-filled one-band Hubbard model in three dimensions. In this framework, strain is introduced through anisotropic hopping processes between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor sites, inspired by the DFT calculations. Using a semiclassical Monte Carlo (s-MC) approach, we construct ground state phase diagrams in the nonperturbative regime, which show how uniaxial strain stabilizes distinct magnetic ground states: Compressive strain drives a transition from a G-type to a C-type AF insulator, whereas tensile strain suppresses the C-type AF order, favoring an A-type AF phase. Overall, our combined DFT and s-MC calculations highlight that strain is a powerful tuning parameter for controlling competing magnetic phases by governing exchange coupling mechanisms in correlated systems, offering valuable insights for the design of strain-controlled materials."}

We investigate this experimentally via the measured response of photoexcited SnSe, whereby photoinduced phase change dynamics lead to ultrafast changes of the charge carrier and lattice optical conductivity response. Two-dimensional time-frequency THz transmission maps subsequently show unexpected time-frequency features at early pump-probe delay times. These features are reproduced in both finite-difference time-domain simulations of the THz experiment and in an extension of non-equilibrium response function theory, demonstrating their systematic origin.

To date most experimental applications have focused on classical magnets, and a solid demonstration in a quantum magnet has yet to be established. Here we present a theoretical study of 2DCS in CoNb$_2$O$_6$, a quasi-one-dimensional Ising magnet that is believed to host fractionalized spinons which at low temperatures are confined by weak interchain coupling. Our analysis, which builds on an effective $S=1/2$ Hamiltonian is found to reveal unambiguous 2DCS signatures of spinon deconfinement above the low-temperature ordered phase. Using a four-spinon approximation, we track these 2DCS signatures by sequentially building a faithful microscopic model for CoNb$_2$O$_6$, starting from the exactly solvable one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model (1$d$ TFIM) and successively adding interactions to capture its key low-energy physics. In particular, adding a bond-dependent staggered YZ interaction to the 1$d$-TFIM already reproduces many key spectral features of the full material Hamiltonian. Within this TFIM+YZ model, we find a series of bound states, including a four-spinon bound state that is distinct from the familiar two-spinon bound states. We further find that introducing a confinement potential suppresses sharp spinon-echo features in the two-frequency space, which are thought to reflect an underlying continuum of fractionalized excitations.

A single AOD can generate multiple optical tweezers by multitone rf input in one dimension. Two-dimensional (2D) patterns can be realized with two perpendicularly oriented AODs. As the acousto-optical response depends nonlinearly on the applied frequency components, phases, and amplitudes, and in addition experiences dimensional coupling in 2D setups, intensity regulation becomes a unique challenge. Guided by coupled-wave theory and experimental observations, we derive a compute-efficient model which we implement on a graphics processing unit. Only one-time sampling of single-tone laser-power calibration is needed for model parameter determination, allowing for straight-forward integration into optical instruments. We implement and experimentally validate an open-loop diffraction efficiency control system that enables programmable 2D multibeam trajectories with intensity control applied at every time step during digital signal generation, overcoming the limited flexibility, pattern-size constraints, and bandwidth limitations of methods using precalculation and precalibration of a predefined pattern set or closed-loop feedback.

CVQKD has the advantage of being compatible with standard telecom equipment, but at long distances has to deal with very low signal to noise ratios, which necessitates labour-intensive error correction.

Across all classes of theories examined, we find that the null energy condition, thermodynamic stability, and a constraint on an effective spatial dimensionality are jointly sufficient to guarantee monotonicity of the timelike c-function along the RG flow. Moreover, we identify a geometric upper bound on the rate of change of the timelike c-function, which constrains how rapidly effective degrees of freedom can be coarse-grained along the RG flow whenever a timelike c-theorem applies.

Employing exact diagonalization of the Hubbard Hamiltonian, we find a connection between the existence of kinetic ferromagnetism and graph theory descriptions. Algebraic connectivity ($λ_2$) and Katz centrality (KC) are shown to be related to the spin-correlation over the system. In square arrays, the onset of NFM is found to be $t_c/U\\simeq λ_2^2$. In optimal cluster geometries, large $λ_2$ and low KC fluctuation per site are found to enhance $t_c/U$, extending the NFM phase while diminishing the strength of spin correlation clouds. A perpendicular magnetic field introduces Aharonov-Bohm phases, and a critical flux for which NFM is destroyed. We further find that tuning the flux phase to $π$ results in a ground state that exhibits antiferromagnetic correlations (counter-Nagaoka state). Our results illustrate how NFM and polaron formation can be predicted from the array's connectivity ($λ_2$ and KC), and how the introduction of flux results in the counterintuitive destruction of kinetic ferromagnetism in the system."}

We prove that this multivaluedness originates from two non-degenerate critical points in the temperature function $T(r_+)$, where $r_+$ is the horizon radius, which fold the parameter space into a three-sheeted covering structure. As a direct application, we propose that a black hole undergoes a first-order phase transition if and only if its $T(r_+)$ curve has two extrema.

As the wavelength is varied across resonance, the energy transport un- dergoes a topological transition characterized by vortical and saddle-type flow structures, localized backflow regions, and efficient energy funneling through the aperture. These features correlate with strong phase gradi- ents and phase singularities associated with the excited modal fields. The modal approach provides a unified and physically transparent interpre- tation of enhanced transmission in both slits and channels, applicable to perfect conductors and beyond plasmonic regimes."}

Previous studies have shown that the degree of entanglement between two quantum dot qubits is preserved when a metal nanoparticle is used to mediate the interactions between the qubits. In this work, we investigate long-range plasmonic mediation of qubit--qubit entanglement by studying the impact of the number of mediating metal nanoparticles on stationary concurrence. Collinear and periodically spaced metal nanoparticles that satisfy the weak-coupling approximation are considered. An effective model that enables the derivation of the mediated interactions within the framework of cavity quantum electrodynamics is employed. Under weak driving at the single particle resonance frequency, the model shows that odd-number arrays are more robust to entanglement decay. We attribute this to strong inter-qubit dissipative coupling as a result of a hybridized dipole plasmon resonating with the driving frequency in odd-number arrays. These arrays can sustain non-vanishing stationary entanglement beyond an inter-qubit spacing of one micron, opening up the possibility of independent spatial optical probing of each quantum dot."}

To directly examine how heat and charge respond in relation within a kagome metal, we investigate the ferrimagnetic rare-earth 1-6-6 compound TbCr6Ge6 using the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) framework. We observe a dramatic breakdown of the WF law across the ferrimagnetic transition, where both longitudinal and transverse Lorenz ratios, L_{xx,xy} = κ_{xx,xy} / (T σ_{xx,xy}), deviate strongly from the Sommerfeld value L_0. After a partial recovery toward L_0 near 5-7 K, the Lorenz ratios are sharply suppressed well below L_0 despite a metallic charge response. We further find a pronounced low-temperature suppression of both L_{xx} and L_{xy} and a sign-changing transverse Lorenz ratio, indicating a clear decoupling between heat and charge transport and signaling substantial contributions from charge-neutral excitations whose Berry-curvature-driven transverse response evolves with temperature and magnetic field. TbCr6Ge6 thus provides a tunable metallic platform in which exchange-driven ferrimagnetism governs both longitudinal and transverse thermal responses, enabling controlled departures from Wiedemann-Franz behavior over an experimentally accessible temperature and field range."}

Coincident measurement of three-dimensional photoion and photoelectron momenta provides real-time access to both the instantaneous internuclear separation and the accompanying reorganization of the electronic structure, allowing us to determine the timescale of bond breaking. We find that electronic rearrangement concludes well before the nuclei reach the bond-breaking distance, revealing a hierarchy imposed by electron-nuclear coupling.

Our scheme utilizes a linear potential in the atomic detuning to enhance the DTC order, without being tired to (Stark) many-body localization.

The smoking gun signal was the appearance of an umklapp branch in optical exciton spectroscopy coming from the periodic potential generated by the Wigner crystal assumed to be static. Vibrations of the Wigner crystal however leads to a gapless phonon spectrum, which may affect the exciton spectrum. To explore this, we develop a field theoretical description of an exciton interacting with electrons forming a Wigner crystal including the coupling to the phonons. We show that importance of the exciton-phonon coupling scales with the exciton-electron interaction strength relative to the typical phonon energy squared. The motion of the exciton leads to two kinds of scattering processes, where the exciton emits a phonon either staying within the same Bloch band (intraband scattering) or changing its band (interband scattering). Using a non-perturbative self-consistent Born approximation, we demonstrate that these scattering processes lead to the formation of quasiparticles (polarons) consisting of the exciton in Bloch states dressed by Wigner crystal phonons. The energy shift and damping of these polarons depend on the electron density in a non-trivial way since it affects both the exciton-phonon interaction strength, as well as the phonon and exciton spectra. In particular, the damping is strongly affected by whether the polaron energy is inside the gapless phonon scattering continuum or not. Using these results, we finally analyse their effects on the observed spectral properties of the exciton."}

In particular, the connections between memory effects, asymptotic symmetries, and soft theorems (the ``infrared triangle'') have been explored in much depth within the context of high-energy physics. In this paper, we show how sound also admits an infrared triangle. We consider the linear perturbations of the Euler equations for a barotropic and irrotational fluid and show how low-frequency changes in an acoustic source can lead to lasting displacements of fluid particles. We proceed to write these linear perturbations in terms of a two-form potential -- a Kalb--Ramond field, in the high-energy physics terminology. This phrases linear sound as a gauge theory and thus allows the use of standard techniques to probe the infrared structure of acoustics. We show how the memory effect relates to asymptotic symmetries in this dual formulation, and comment on how these notions can be connected to soft theorems. This exhibits the first example of an infrared triangle in a condensed matter system and provides new pathways to the experimental detection of memory effects."}

The core of this protocol involves continuous-variable Bell measurements performed by an untrusted third party. However, in high-speed systems, spectrum broadening causes Bell measurements to deviate from the ideal single-mode scenario, resulting in mode mismatches, reduced performance, and compromised security. Here, we introduce temporal modes (TMs) to analyze the performance of CV-MDI QKD under continuous-mode scenarios. The mismatch between Bob's transmitting mode and Bell measurement mode has a more significant effect on system performance compared to that on Alice's side. When the Bell receiver is close to Bob and the mismatch is set to just 5%, the transmission distance drastically decreases from 87.96 km to 18.50 km. In comparison, the same mismatch for Alice reduces the distance to 86.83 km. This greater degradation on Bob's side can be attributed to the asymmetry in the data modification step. Furthermore, the mismatch in TM characteristics leads to a significant reduction in the secret key rate by 83% when the transmission distance is set to 15 km, which severely limits the practical usability of the protocol over specific distances. These results indicate that in scenarios involving continuous-mode interference, such as large-scale MDI network setups, careful consideration of each user's TM characteristics is crucial. Rigorous pre-calibration of these modes is essential to ensure the system's reliability and efficiency."}

We uncover a diverse landscape of phases driven by dipolar correlations. Under strong dipole fluctuations, a quadrupolar superfluid emerges.

In this work, we extend such framework to higher-form symmetries and compute entanglement asymmetry in theories with spontaneously-broken continuous zero- and higher-form symmetries. One of our central results is an entropic Coleman--Mermin--Wagner theorem, for $0$- and $p$-form symmetries, valid also on subregions, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous $p$-form symmetries in spacetime dimensions $d\\leq p+2$. Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields."}

It underpins fundamental processes ranging from nuclear fusion and photosynthesis to the operation of superconducting qubits. Yet the underlying dynamics of particle motion during tunnelling remain subtle and are still the subject of active debate. Here, by analyzing the temporal evolution of the tunnelling process, we show that the particle velocity inside the barrier continuously relaxes from a large initial value toward a smaller one, and may even approach zero in the evanescent regime. Meanwhile, the probability density within the barrier gradually builds up before reaching its stationary profile, in contrast to existing inherently. In addition, starting from the steady-state equations, we derive an explicit relation between the particle velocity and the barrier width, and show that the velocity in evanescent states approaches zero when the barrier is sufficiently wide. These findings resolve the apparent paradox of a vanishing steady-state velocity coexisting with a finite particle density. We point out that defining an effective speed from the probability density, rather than from the probability current, can lead to spuriously nonzero \"stationary speed,\" as appears to be the case in Ref. [Nature 643, 67 (2025)]. Our work establishes a clear dynamical picture for the formation of tunnelling flow and provides a theoretical foundation for testing time-resolved tunnelling phenomena."}

While it fully reproduces conventional quantum mechanics, this approach provides an alternative framework that enables the study of dynamical quantities not easily defined within the standard formulation. In the present work, stochastic quantization is employed to investigate tunneling-time statistics for bound states in double-well potentials. Using first-passage time theory within the stochastic quantization framework, both the mean tunneling time, $\\barτ$, and the full probability distribution, $p(τ)$, are computed, and the theoretical predictions are validated through extensive numerical simulations of stochastic trajectories for the two potentials considered as representative cases. For the square double-well potential, analytical expressions for $\\barτ$ are derived and show excellent agreement with simulations. In the high-barrier limit, the results reveal a direct relation between the stochastic-mechanical and quantum-mechanical tunneling times, expressed as $τ_{\\mathrm{QM}} = (π/2)\\barτ$, where $τ_{\\mathrm{QM}}$ corresponds to half the oscillation period of the probability of finding the particle in either well. This relation is further confirmed for generic double-well systems through a WKB analysis. As a concrete application, the inversion dynamics of the ammonia molecule is analyzed, yielding an inversion frequency of approximately $24$ GHz, in close agreement with experimental observations. These results highlight the potential of stochastic quantization as a powerful and physically insightful framework for analyzing tunneling phenomena in quantum systems."}

Despite this, we show that a subset of such observables can be consistently regarded as local to the bulk, in a manner that respects microcausality and leaves locality properties of uncharged observables untouched. A sufficient condition for this is to impose kinematically non-local boundary conditions on the large gauge sector of the theory, and to invoke a relational notion of localisation for observables. This reveals a relatively underappreciated link between boundary conditions, and different notions of microcausality and locality. We develop this point through a detailed case study in scalar QED, describing non-local boundary conditions that allow a large family of observables on a codimension-1 bulk surface to be viewed as local to that surface, despite being dressed by asymptotic Wilson lines. We show that this property continues to hold within a perturbative quantisation of the theory, and we argue that this leads to a consistent local net of algebras that includes these charged observables in bulk algebras. We explain how this setup may be understood in terms of a preferred dynamical reference frame for small gauge transformations appearing in the boundary conditions. Many features of the theory (such as microcausality, the vacuum state, and the net of algebras of observables) depend on the choice of this frame, and we briefly discuss some repercussions of this for algebraic formulations of QFT. While our analysis is performed in QED, we expect our results to carry over qualitatively to more complicated theories including gravity."}

Across all classes of theories examined, we find that the null energy condition, thermodynamic stability, and a constraint on an effective spatial dimensionality are jointly sufficient to guarantee monotonicity of the timelike c-function along the RG flow. Moreover, we identify a geometric upper bound on the rate of change of the timelike c-function, which constrains how rapidly effective degrees of freedom can be coarse-grained along the RG flow whenever a timelike c-theorem applies. The applicability of holographic c-theorems is thus extended to highly nontrivial RG flows and points toward a new information-theoretic diagnostic of holographic RG dynamics."}

This raises concerns of self-consistency as the same data are used to, first, extract nuclear parameters, and second, check the consistency with BSM models. We combine the two steps and self-consistently extract the nuclear and BSM parameters. We show that the data are consistent with vanishing BSM coupling and extract robust exclusion bounds.

We show that this rate is optimal. The analysis is entirely finite-dimensional and relies on a precise decomposition of entropy into classical and internal components, together with sharp relative entropy inequalities. As an application, we study finite additive operators whose spectral decomposition induces natural block constraints. In this setting, the stability theorem yields quantitative non-concentration bounds for induced spectral measures. The framework is abstract and independent of arithmetic input. It provides a general stability principle for entropy minimizers under linear spectral constraints."}

This particle production acts as a source of thermal friction on the field that can make it difficult to distinguish whether dark energy is due to a radiating field rolling down a steep potential, a purely self-interacting field moving down a flatter potential, or a cosmological constant. By reducing the acceleration of the scalar field, thermal friction increases the amount of accelerated expansion and can cause a sizable bump in the quintessence equation of state. We take special interest in the case where a steep potential rapidly changes from positive to negative as the field evolves, resulting in the end of cosmic expansion and the beginning of contraction. Even in this case, we find that thermal friction lengthens the period of accelerated expansion and consequently delays the end of cosmic expansion, making it challenging to detect the impending transition to contraction using conventional cosmological tests. However, particle production can also provide alternative avenues for detection by generating a background of thermal dark radiation, partly comprised of neutrinos or other particles, whose energy density exceeds the remnant photon energy density."}

These hybrid quasiparticles manifest as new optical resonances in cryogenic reflectance spectra of a charge-tunable WSe$_2$ monolayer, appearing concurrently with previously identified exciton umklapp transitions. In contrast to the latter, the energies of Wigner crystal polarons are governed not only by the electronic lattice constant but also by their hybridization with attractive exciton-polarons, whose strength is controlled by electronic interactions.

Static phases have been fruitfully studied via \"symmetry topological field theory\" (SymTFT), wherein the universal features of $G$-symmetric systems are elucidated by placing them on the boundary of a topological order of one dimension higher. In this work, we provide a SymTFT approach to classifying $G$-symmetric Floquet MBL phases in 1D, for $G$ a finite Abelian group with on-site unitary action. In the SymTFT, these 1D systems correspond to the boundaries of the quantum double associated to $G$, and the classification naturally arises from considering the Lagrangian subgroups and boundary excitations of the quantum double. The classification covers all known Floquet phases while uncovering others previously unexplored, along with bulk features of phases thought to have only boundary signatures. We refer to the latter phases as \"dual\" time crystals. For static phases, we show how anyons of the quantum double and (string) order parameters provide a natural and simple interpretation of known classification schemes. By extending our framework to the boundaries of twisted quantum doubles, we uncover a new time-crystalline phase with non-onsite symmetry, which cannot be obtained through local, symmetric Hamiltonian drives. We numerically demonstrate evidence for the absolute stability of this phase, and observe that for open boundary conditions it has greater stability to symmetric perturbations. We finally discuss perspectives on using programmable quantum devices to realise and probe the phases we discuss.

The squeezing field is implemented in cavities rather than continuous waveguides, thereby limiting its scalability for applications in quantum simulation. Giant atoms, which couple to waveguides at multiple points, provide a promising route to mitigate dissipation via engineered interference, enabling decoherence-free interactions. We extend the squeezing-amplified interaction to a novel quantum platform combining giant atoms with traveling-wave parametric waveguides based on $χ^{(2)}$ nonlinearity. By exploiting destructive interference between different coupling points, the interaction between giant atoms is not only significantly enhanced but also becomes immune to squeezed noise. Unlike conventional waveguide quantum electrodynamics without a squeezing pump, the giant emitters exhibit both exchange and pairing interactions, making this platform particularly suitable for simulating many-body quantum physics. More intriguingly, the strengths of these interactions can be smoothly tuned by adjusting the squeezing and coupling parameters. Our architecture thus provides a versatile and scalable platform for quantum simulation of strongly correlated physics and paves the way toward robust quantum control in many-body regimes."}

Remarkably, the post-measurement state factorizes into a product of Bell pairs, establishing maximal interlayer entanglement entirely independent of the initial Gaussian state. We derive this post-measurement state exactly for general particle-number-conserving fermionic Gaussian states, establishing both the validity and universality of the mechanism, with numerical simulations serving as consistency checks.

This discovery can be recast in the language of nonlocal games: every $n$-qubit stabilizer state defines a specific \"stabilizer-testing\" $n$-player nonlocal game, which quantum players can win with probability one. If quantum players can moreover outperform all possible classical players, then the state is contextual. However, the classical values of stabilizer-testing games are largely unknown for scalable examples beyond the $n$-qubit GHZ state. We introduce several new methods for upper-bounding the classical values of these games. We first prove a general coding-theory bound for all stabilizer-testing games: if the classical value $p_{\\mathrm{cl}}^* < 1$, then $p_{\\mathrm{cl}}^* \\leq 7/8$, i.e., there is no classical strategy that can perform as well as the optimal quantum strategy even in an asymptotic sense. We then show how to tighten this bound for the most common scalable examples, namely GHZ, toric-code and cyclic cluster states. In particular, we establish an asymptotically tight upper bound for cyclic cluster states using transfer-matrix methods. This leads to the striking conclusion that measuring an exponentially small fidelity to the cyclic cluster state will suffice to witness its contextuality."}

The proximity of $Γ$ to the horizon is controlled by the dimensionless parameter ${K}{Λ^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}$. We provide an exhaustive analysis of linearised gravitational perturbations for the setup. This is performed both for a $Γ$ encasing a portion of the static patch that ends just before the cosmological horizon (pole patch), as well as a $Γ$ containing only the region near the cosmological horizon (cosmic patch). In the pole patch, we uncover a layered hierarchy of modes: ordinary normal modes, a novel type of boundary gapless mode, and boundary soft modes of frequency $ω\\approx \\pm 2πi T_{\\text{dS}}$, with $T_{\\text{dS}}$ the horizon temperature. Minkowskian behaviour is recovered only for angular momenta $l \\gtrsim {K}{Λ^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}$ which can be made parametrically large, thus attenuating previously found growing modes.

It is responsible for quantum computational speedups in both magic-state-injection-based and measurement-based models of computation, and can be directly probed in a many-body setting by multiplayer nonlocal quantum games. Here, we discuss a family of games that can be won with certainty when performing single-site Pauli measurements on a state that is a codeword of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting quantum code. We show that these games require deterministic computation of a code-dependent Boolean function, and that the classical probability of success is upper bounded by a generalized notion of nonlinearity/nonquadraticity. This success probability quantifies the state's contextuality, and is computed via the function's (generalized) Walsh-Hadamard spectrum. To calculate this, we introduce an efficient, many-body-physics-inspired method that involves identifying the symmetries of an auxiliary hypergraph state. We compute the classical probability of success for several paradigmatic CSS codes and relate it to both classical statistical mechanics models and to strange correlators of symmetry-protected topological states. We also consider CSS submeasurement games, which can only be won with certainty by sharing the appropriate codeword up to local isometries. These games therefore enable self-testing, which we illustrate explicitly for the 2D toric code. We also discuss how submeasurement games enable an extensive notion of contextuality in many-body states."}

Often, however, it is not clear a priori whether a pair of monolayers twisted at a small angle will exhibit correlated or interaction-driven phenomena. The computational cost to make accurate predictions of the single particle states is significant, as small twists require very large unit cells, easily encompassing 10,000 atoms, and therefore implementing a high throughput prediction has been out of reach. Here we show a path to overcome this challenge by introducing a machine learning (ML) based methodology that efficiently estimates the twisted interlayer tunneling at arbitrarily low twist angles through the local-configuration based approach that enables interpolating the local stacking for a range of twist angles using a random forest regression algorithm. We leverage the kernel polynomial method to compute the density of states (DOS) on large real space graphs by reconstructing a lattice model of the twisted bilayer with the ML fitted hoppings. For twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), we show the ability of the method to resolve the magic angle DOS at a substantial improvement in computational time. We use this new technique to scan through the database of stable 2D monolayers (MC2D) and reveal new twistable candidates across the five possible points groups in two-dimensions with a large DOS near the Fermi energy, with potentially exciting interacting physics to be probed in future experiments."}

Despite this, we show that a subset of such observables can be consistently regarded as local to the bulk, in a manner that respects microcausality and leaves locality properties of uncharged observables untouched. A sufficient condition for this is to impose kinematically non-local boundary conditions on the large gauge sector of the theory, and to invoke a relational notion of localisation for observables. This reveals a relatively underappreciated link between boundary conditions, and different notions of microcausality and locality. We develop this point through a detailed case study in scalar QED, describing non-local boundary conditions that allow a large family of observables on a codimension-1 bulk surface to be viewed as local to that surface, despite being dressed by asymptotic Wilson lines. We show that this property continues to hold within a perturbative quantisation of the theory, and we argue that this leads to a consistent local net of algebras that includes these charged observables in bulk algebras. We explain how this setup may be understood in terms of a preferred dynamical reference frame for small gauge transformations appearing in the boundary conditions. Many features of the theory (such as microcausality, the vacuum state, and the net of algebras of observables) depend on the choice of this frame, and we briefly discuss some repercussions of this for algebraic formulations of QFT.

First, assuming the field to be initially in a zero-mean Gaussian Hadamard state in a globally hyperbolic spacetime, we evaluate the field's two-point function in second-order perturbation theory by techniques of covariant curved spacetime quantum field theory, which allow a full control of the time and space localisation of the interaction, and do not rely on field mode decompositions or non-local particle countings. The detector's two-point function splits into a deterministic and a fluctuating part, and we show that this split is maintained in the back-action.\n  We then specialise to a two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector, prepared in an energy eigenstate, for which the back-action is fully fluctuating. We compute the renormalised stress-energy tensor for a massless scalar field in $(3+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime for a general detector trajectory, using the manifestly causal two-point function. We present explicit analytic and numerical results for an inertial detector and a uniformly linearly accelerated detector, switched on in the asymptotic past. The energy flux into and out of the accelerated detector accounts exactly for the energy gained and lost by the detector in its transitions due to the Unruh effect. The same holds for the outward flux associated with de-excitations of the inertial detector, which has a vanishing excitation rate and no inward flux. A novelty with the accelerated detector is two regions of negative energy density when the detector is initially prepared in its ground state, one near the Rindler horizon that bounds the causal future of the trajectory, the other in the far future of the trajectory."}

It underpins fundamental processes ranging from nuclear fusion and photosynthesis to the operation of superconducting qubits. Yet the underlying dynamics of particle motion during tunnelling remain subtle and are still the subject of active debate. Here, by analyzing the temporal evolution of the tunnelling process, we show that the particle velocity inside the barrier continuously relaxes from a large initial value toward a smaller one, and may even approach zero in the evanescent regime. Meanwhile, the probability density within the barrier gradually builds up before reaching its stationary profile, in contrast to existing inherently. In addition, starting from the steady-state equations, we derive an explicit relation between the particle velocity and the barrier width, and show that the velocity in evanescent states approaches zero when the barrier is sufficiently wide. These findings resolve the apparent paradox of a vanishing steady-state velocity coexisting with a finite particle density. We point out that defining an effective speed from the probability density, rather than from the probability current, can lead to spuriously nonzero \"stationary speed,\" as appears to be the case in Ref. [Nature 643, 67 (2025)]. Our work establishes a clear dynamical picture for the formation of tunnelling flow and provides a theoretical foundation for testing time-resolved tunnelling phenomena."}

We focus on perturbations of $d$-dimensional Tangherlini black holes and recast the TTM problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem by utilizing the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. The results show that TTMs are generically spectrally unstable, with sensitivity increasing for higher overtones, in close analogy with quasinormal modes.

We prove that this multivaluedness originates from two non-degenerate critical points in the temperature function $T(r_+)$, where $r_+$ is the horizon radius, which fold the parameter space into a three-sheeted covering structure. As a direct application, we propose that a black hole undergoes a first-order phase transition if and only if its $T(r_+)$ curve has two extrema. Accordingly, we establish a classification scheme, denoted $A1$, $A2$, and $B$ for black holes.

Particularly, quantum mechanics is in agreement with such experiments as free fall and quantum interference induced by gravity. However, quantum mechanics is a low-energy approximation to quantum field theory. The latter is successful by the description of high-energy experiments. Gravity is embedded in quantum field theory through the general-covariance principle. This framework is known in the literature as quantum field theory in curved spacetime, where the concept of a quantum particle is, though, ambiguous. In this article, we study in this framework how a Hawking particle moves in the far-horizon region of Schwarzschild spacetime by computing its propagator. We find this propagator differs from that which follows from the path-integral formalism -- the formalism which adequately describes both free fall and quantum interference induced by gravity."}

The dynamics is universally characterized, and is largely independent of the specific details of the Hamiltonians defining the individual partitions. By considering the two-sided chord states of the double-scaled SYK model, we find an approximate realization of this framework. We analytically study the revival dynamics, finding rigid motion for wavepackets localized on the spectrum of a single SYK copy. These findings are tested numerically for systems of finite size, showing excellent agreement with the analytical predictions."}

Yet such transitions also arise in more general settings, including quantum-jump processes with non-Hermitian jump operators, and under inefficient detection. A theoretical framework for treating these broader scenarios has been missing. Here we develop a comprehensive replica Keldysh field theory for general quantum-jump processes in both bosonic and fermionic systems. Our formalism provides a unified description of pure-state quantum trajectories under efficient detection and mixed-state dynamics emerging from inefficient monitoring, with deterministic Lindbladian evolution appearing as a limiting case. It thus establishes a direct connection between phase transitions in nonequilibrium steady states of driven open quantum matter and in measurement-induced dynamics. As an application, we study imbalanced and inefficient fermion counting in a one-dimensional lattice system: monitored gain and loss of fermions occurring at different rates, with a fraction of gain and loss jumps undetected. For imbalanced but efficient counting, we recover the qualitative picture of the balanced case: entanglement obeys an area law for any nonzero jump rate, with an extended quantum-critical regime emerging between two parametrically separated length scales. Inefficient detection introduces a finite correlation length beyond which entanglement, as quantified by the fermionic logarithmic negativity, obeys an area law, while the subsystem entropy shows volume-law scaling. Numerical simulations support our analytical findings. Our results offer a general and versatile theoretical foundation for studying measurement-induced phenomena across a wide class of monitored and open quantum systems."}

This challenge arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of the operational meaning of v within the Bohmian ontological framework. We demonstrate that v quantifies the spatial gradient of the wavefunctions amplitude, a geometric property of the guiding field, not the kinematical velocity of point-like particles. The experiment therefore does not challenge but rather illustrates the clean ontological separation between the wave and particle aspects inherent to Bohmian mechanics."}

Exciting trapped ions to high-lying electronic Rydberg states provides a promising route to overcome these limitations by enabling strong, long-range dipole-dipole interactions that support much faster multi-qubit operations. Here, we introduce the first scheme for implementing a native controlled-controlled-Z gate with microwave-dressed Rydberg ions by optimizing a single-pulse protocol that accounts for the finite Rydberg-state lifetime. The resulting gate outperforms standard decompositions into one- and two-qubit gates by achieving fidelities above 97% under realistic conditions, with execution times of about 2 microseconds at cryogenic temperatures. To explore the potential of trapped Rydberg ions for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, and to illustrate the utility of three-qubit Rydberg-ion gates in this context, we develop and analyze a proposal for fault-tolerant, measurement-free quantum error correction using the nine-qubit Bacon-Shor code. Our simulations confirm that quantum error correction can be performed in a fully fault-tolerant manner on a linear Rydberg-ion chain despite its limited qubit connectivity. These results establish native multiqubit Rydberg-ion gates as a valuable resource for fast, high-fidelity quantum computing and highlight their potential for fault-tolerant quantum error correction."}

This discovery can be recast in the language of nonlocal games: every $n$-qubit stabilizer state defines a specific \"stabilizer-testing\" $n$-player nonlocal game, which quantum players can win with probability one. If quantum players can moreover outperform all possible classical players, then the state is contextual. However, the classical values of stabilizer-testing games are largely unknown for scalable examples beyond the $n$-qubit GHZ state. We introduce several new methods for upper-bounding the classical values of these games. We first prove a general coding-theory bound for all stabilizer-testing games: if the classical value $p_{\\mathrm{cl}}^* < 1$, then $p_{\\mathrm{cl}}^* \\leq 7/8$, i.e., there is no classical strategy that can perform as well as the optimal quantum strategy even in an asymptotic sense. We then show how to tighten this bound for the most common scalable examples, namely GHZ, toric-code and cyclic cluster states. In particular, we establish an asymptotically tight upper bound for cyclic cluster states using transfer-matrix methods. This leads to the striking conclusion that measuring an exponentially small fidelity to the cyclic cluster state will suffice to witness its contextuality."}

Yet, while the relation between entanglement and topology is well established, little is known about the role of nonstabilizerness (or magic), a pivotal concept in fault-tolerant quantum computation, in topological phases. We introduce the concept of topological magic response, the ability of a state to spread over stabilizer space when perturbed by finite-depth non-Clifford circuits. Unlike a topological invariant or order parameter, this response function probes how a phase reacts to non-Clifford perturbations, revealing the presence of non-local quantum correlations. In Ising-type spin chains, we show that symmetry-broken and paramagnetic phases lack such a response, whereas symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases always display it. To capture this, we utilize a combination of stabilizer Rényi entropies that, in analogy with topological entanglement entropy, isolates non-locally stored information. Using exact analytic computations and matrix product states simulations based on an algorithmic technique we introduce, we show that SPT phases doped with $T$ gates support robust topological magic response, while trivial phases remain featureless."}

With the right ansatz design, this approach can be extended to system sizes beyond the reach of classical simulation, enabling scalable training for larger quantum systems. This also enables a form of classical pre-training through gradient-based optimization prior to deployment on quantum hardware.

However, nonlocality is a statement about static correlations only. It does not take into account dynamics, i.e. time evolution of those correlations. Consider a dynamic situation where the correlations remain local for all times. Then at each moment in time there exists a local hidden-variable (LHV) model reproducing the momentary correlations. Can the time evolution of the correlations then be captured by evolving the hidden variables? In this light, we define dynamical LHV models and motivate and discuss potential additional physical and mathematical assumptions. Based on a simple counter example we conjecture that such LHV dynamics does not always exist. This is further substantiated by a rigorous no-go theorem. Our results suggest a new type of nonlocality that can be deduced from the observed time evolution of measurement statistics and which generically occurs in interacting quantum systems."}

We present QuantumSavory, an open-source toolkit built to make such end-to-end studies practical by cleanly separating a symbolic computer-algebra frontend from interchangeable numerical simulation backends. States, operations, measurements, and protocol logic are expressed in a backend-agnostic symbolic language; the same model can be executed across multiple backends (e.g., stabilizer, wavefunction, phase-space), enabling rapid exploration of accuracy-performance tradeoffs without rewriting the model. Furthermore, new custom backends can be added via a small, well-defined interface that immediately reuses existing models and protocols.\n  QuantumSavory also addresses the classical-quantum interaction inherent to LOCC protocols via discrete-event execution and a tag/query system for coordination. Tags attach structured classical metadata to quantum registers and message buffers, and queries retrieve, filter, or wait on matching metadata by wildcards or arbitrary predicates. This yields a data-driven control plane where protocol components coordinate by publishing and consuming semantic facts (e.g., resource availability, pairing relationships, protocol outcomes) rather than by maintaining rigid object graphs or bespoke message plumbing, improving composability and reuse as models grow. Our toolkit is also not limited to qubits and Bell pairs; rather, any networking dynamics of any quantum system under any type of multipartite entanglement can be tackled. Lastly, QuantumSavory ships reusable libraries of standard states, circuits, and protocol building blocks with consistent interfaces, enabling full-stack examples to be assembled, modified, and compared with minimal glue code."}

Assuming that the resulting indistinguishable-particle space (i) admits an ordered basis compatible with how an observer may label the accessible modes, (ii) is invariant under unitary transformations of those modes, and (iii) supports particle counting as a mode-wise local operation, we derive a new class of creation-annihilation algebras.

We prove that genuinely multi-qubit magic distillation protocols are strictly more powerful than all single-qubit schemes by showing that the Triangle Criterion is not stable under tensor products, in sharp contrast to the PPT criterion. Moreover, we show that, with overwhelming probability, multi-qubit magic states with relatively low rank cannot be distilled by any single-qubit distillation protocol. We derive an upper bound on the minimal purity of magic states, which is conjectured to be tight with both numerical and constructive evidences.

It is responsible for quantum computational speedups in both magic-state-injection-based and measurement-based models of computation, and can be directly probed in a many-body setting by multiplayer nonlocal quantum games. Here, we discuss a family of games that can be won with certainty when performing single-site Pauli measurements on a state that is a codeword of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting quantum code. We show that these games require deterministic computation of a code-dependent Boolean function, and that the classical probability of success is upper bounded by a generalized notion of nonlinearity/nonquadraticity. This success probability quantifies the state's contextuality, and is computed via the function's (generalized) Walsh-Hadamard spectrum. To calculate this, we introduce an efficient, many-body-physics-inspired method that involves identifying the symmetries of an auxiliary hypergraph state. We compute the classical probability of success for several paradigmatic CSS codes and relate it to both classical statistical mechanics models and to strange correlators of symmetry-protected topological states. We also consider CSS submeasurement games, which can only be won with certainty by sharing the appropriate codeword up to local isometries. These games therefore enable self-testing, which we illustrate explicitly for the 2D toric code. We also discuss how submeasurement games enable an extensive notion of contextuality in many-body states."}

The hopping variation is controlled by a grading exponent, $α$, which serves as the tuning parameter of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, the ground state becomes localized as $|α| \\to 0$, signaling the presence of a critical point characterized by a diverging localization length. Using exact diagonalization, we perform finite-size scaling analysis and extract the associated critical exponent governing this divergence, revealing a universality class distinct from well-known Anderson, Aubry-Andre, and Stark localization. To further characterize the critical behavior, we analyze the inverse participation ratio, the energy gap between the ground and first excited states, and the fidelity susceptibility. We also investigate nonequilibrium dynamics by linearly ramping the hopping profile at various rates and tracking the evolution of the localization length and the inverse participation ratio. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism successfully captures the resulting dynamics using the critical exponents obtained from the static scaling analysis. Our results demonstrate a clean, disorder-free route to localization and provide a tunable platform relevant to photonic lattices and ultracold atom arrays with engineered hopping profiles."}

While several types of Floquet phases have been classified, a unified picture of Floquet MBL is still emerging. Static phases have been fruitfully studied via \"symmetry topological field theory\" (SymTFT), wherein the universal features of $G$-symmetric systems are elucidated by placing them on the boundary of a topological order of one dimension higher. In this work, we provide a SymTFT approach to classifying $G$-symmetric Floquet MBL phases in 1D, for $G$ a finite Abelian group with on-site unitary action. In the SymTFT, these 1D systems correspond to the boundaries of the quantum double associated to $G$, and the classification naturally arises from considering the Lagrangian subgroups and boundary excitations of the quantum double. The classification covers all known Floquet phases while uncovering others previously unexplored, along with bulk features of phases thought to have only boundary signatures. We refer to the latter phases as \"dual\" time crystals. For static phases, we show how anyons of the quantum double and (string) order parameters provide a natural and simple interpretation of known classification schemes. By extending our framework to the boundaries of twisted quantum doubles, we uncover a new time-crystalline phase with non-onsite symmetry, which cannot be obtained through local, symmetric Hamiltonian drives. We numerically demonstrate evidence for the absolute stability of this phase, and observe that for open boundary conditions it has greater stability to symmetric perturbations. We finally discuss perspectives on using programmable quantum devices to realise and probe the phases we discuss. Our results show that SymTFT provides a powerful approach to unifying phases and features of Floquet systems."}

Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields."}

By applying the method to an aspherical lens, and using a liquid-crystal spatial light modulator (SLM), we increase the aberration-free field of view from 50 to 500 $μ$m, only limited by the largest diffraction angles accessible to the SLM. This opens new perspectives for the generation of large arrays of optical tweezers, especially for neutral atom based quantum processors and simulators."}

The latter emulates the so-called semi-classical initial conditions and the associated gradient catastrophe scenario facilitating the emergence of a high-density, doubly localized waveform. The ensuing multi-orbital variant of the Peregrine soliton features notable deviations from its mean-field sibling, including a reduced peak amplitude, wider core, absence of the side density dips, and earlier formation times. Moreover, Peregrine soliton generation yields coherence losses, while experiencing two-body bunching within each of its sides which show anti-bunching between each other. Controllable seeding of the Peregrine soliton is also demonstrated by tuning the atom number or the box length, while reducing the latter favors the generation of the time-periodic Kuznetsov-Ma breather. Our results highlight that correlations reshape the morphology of rogue-waves in the genuinely quantum, non-integrable realm, while setting the stage for the emergent field of quantum dispersive hydrodynamics."}

Coincident measurement of three-dimensional photoion and photoelectron momenta provides real-time access to both the instantaneous internuclear separation and the accompanying reorganization of the electronic structure, allowing us to determine the timescale of bond breaking. We find that electronic rearrangement concludes well before the nuclei reach the bond-breaking distance, revealing a hierarchy imposed by electron-nuclear coupling.

The model identifies key scaling relationships: surface acceleration scales as $τ^{-2}$ with pulse duration, while acoustic diffraction sets fundamental limits on optimal spot size $w \\gtrsim \\sqrt{vτd}$. Material figures of merit combine thermal expansion and optical absorption properties, suggesting alternatives to traditional aluminum substrates. The framework validates well against experimental data and demonstrates that compact laser systems with sub-nanosecond pulse durations can achieve performance competitive with existing laboratory-scale implementations despite orders-of-magnitude lower pulse energies.

Gravity is embedded in quantum field theory through the general-covariance principle. This framework is known in the literature as quantum field theory in curved spacetime, where the concept of a quantum particle is, though, ambiguous.

These devices are a widely used tool for high-bandwidth random-access scanning applications, such as optical tweezers in quantum technology. A single AOD can generate multiple optical tweezers by multitone rf input in one dimension. Two-dimensional (2D) patterns can be realized with two perpendicularly oriented AODs. As the acousto-optical response depends nonlinearly on the applied frequency components, phases, and amplitudes, and in addition experiences dimensional coupling in 2D setups, intensity regulation becomes a unique challenge. Guided by coupled-wave theory and experimental observations, we derive a compute-efficient model which we implement on a graphics processing unit. Only one-time sampling of single-tone laser-power calibration is needed for model parameter determination, allowing for straight-forward integration into optical instruments. We implement and experimentally validate an open-loop diffraction efficiency control system that enables programmable 2D multibeam trajectories with intensity control applied at every time step during digital signal generation, overcoming the limited flexibility, pattern-size constraints, and bandwidth limitations of methods using precalculation and precalibration of a predefined pattern set or closed-loop feedback.

Despite this, we show that a subset of such observables can be consistently regarded as local to the bulk, in a manner that respects microcausality and leaves locality properties of uncharged observables untouched. A sufficient condition for this is to impose kinematically non-local boundary conditions on the large gauge sector of the theory, and to invoke a relational notion of localisation for observables. This reveals a relatively underappreciated link between boundary conditions, and different notions of microcausality and locality. We develop this point through a detailed case study in scalar QED, describing non-local boundary conditions that allow a large family of observables on a codimension-1 bulk surface to be viewed as local to that surface, despite being dressed by asymptotic Wilson lines. We show that this property continues to hold within a perturbative quantisation of the theory, and we argue that this leads to a consistent local net of algebras that includes these charged observables in bulk algebras. We explain how this setup may be understood in terms of a preferred dynamical reference frame for small gauge transformations appearing in the boundary conditions. Many features of the theory (such as microcausality, the vacuum state, and the net of algebras of observables) depend on the choice of this frame, and we briefly discuss some repercussions of this for algebraic formulations of QFT. While our analysis is performed in QED, we expect our results to carry over qualitatively to more complicated theories including gravity."}
