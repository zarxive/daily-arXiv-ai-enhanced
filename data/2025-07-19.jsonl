In particular, we show that low index contrast enables more\nclosely aligned PBGs for transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM)\npolarizations, allowing for broadband superposition of TE and TM Bloch Surface\nWaves (BSWs). As a demonstration of this functionality, we use this approach to\ndesign 1DPCs capable of generating planar superchiral fields for enhanced\ncircular dichroism spectroscopy.

The pronounced time-dependence of light\nabsorption during aging renders the precise estimation of their impact on\nglobal warming difficult. Single particle studies of such aerosols would be\nvery useful to better understand their aging in the atmosphere through\nprocesses such as photochemistry. However previously proposed optical traps\ncannot continuously trap particles whose absorption state changes from strongly\nabsorbing to non-absorbing or vice versa. Some of the traps presented can\nisolate absorbing and non-absorbing particles, but require mechanical alignment\nof the trap depending on the strength of particle absorption. However,\nmechanical realignment is not compatible with continuous trapping and\nobservation. Here, we introduce a flexible optical universal trap which does\nnot require mechanical realignment. The versatility of the trap relies on four\ntrapping beams - either vortex Laguerre- Gaussian (LG) or fundamental Gaussian\nbeams - which are modulated with a spatial light modulator (SLM), The\nperformance of the trap is demonstrated by trapping different types of\nabsorbing and non-absorbing particles. We also show that the trap can be used\nto observe the photochemical reaction of aqueous droplets containing fulvic\nacid, a common component of BrC. Digital holography measurements demonstrate\nthat the confinement of the particles in the trap can be controlled by changing\nthe orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the LG beams.

Central to these proposals is the assumption that any mediator\ncapable of generating entanglement must itself be nonclassical. However,\nprevious arguments for this have modelled classical mediators as finite,\ndiscrete systems such as bits, which excludes physically relevant continuous\nand infinite-dimensional systems such as those of classical mechanics and field\ntheory. In this work, we close this gap by modelling classical systems as\ncommutative unital C*-algebras, arguably encompassing all potentially\nphysically relevant classical systems. We show that these systems cannot\nmediate entanglement between two quantum systems A and B, even if A and B are\nthemselves infinite-dimensional or described by arbitrary unital C*-algebras\n(as in Quantum Field Theory), composed with an arbitrary C*-tensor product.\nThis result reinforces the conclusion that the observation of gravity-induced\nentanglement would require the gravitational field to possess inherently\nnon-classical features."}

However,\nprevious arguments for this have modelled classical mediators as finite,\ndiscrete systems such as bits, which excludes physically relevant continuous\nand infinite-dimensional systems such as those of classical mechanics and field\ntheory. In this work, we close this gap by modelling classical systems as\ncommutative unital C*-algebras, arguably encompassing all potentially\nphysically relevant classical systems. We show that these systems cannot\nmediate entanglement between two quantum systems A and B, even if A and B are\nthemselves infinite-dimensional or described by arbitrary unital C*-algebras\n(as in Quantum Field Theory), composed with an arbitrary C*-tensor product.\nThis result reinforces the conclusion that the observation of gravity-induced\nentanglement would require the gravitational field to possess inherently\nnon-classical features."}
