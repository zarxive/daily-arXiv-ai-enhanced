Conclusion: 该研究扩展了螺旋波导理论，为具有电介质的螺旋波导设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: It makes sense to consider a helical waveguide with a fine pitch approximately, replacing the turns with anisotropic conductivity: infinite along the turns and zero across them. This approach has been known for a long time, but calculation formulas within it have only been obtained for the case where the winding does not contain a dielectric core. This paper addresses this gap in the theory: calculation formulas are obtained for the case where the waveguide contains a dielectric with a certain permittivity and magnetic permeability. An equation determining the slowing factor is found, and a method for its numerical solution is proposed. Explicit formulas are obtained for the wave impedance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The method of image charges is a powerful and elegant technique in electrostatics, commonly used to determine the electric field generated by point charges near conductors of various shapes. While standard problems focus on single charges interacting with conductors, the behavior of multipoles in such configurations has received comparatively less attention, particularly beyond the well-studied case of a flat plane. In this paper, we explore the image formation of electric dipoles and quadrupoles near a conducting sphere and uncover a wonderful result: the image of a given multipole is not necessarily of the same type. Instead, alongside the expected multipole image, the resulting image configuration also includes lower-order multipole contributions. This finding broadens the understanding of electrostatic images and offers new insights into the interaction of multipoles with conducting boundaries.

Conclusion: This study represents a significant advancement in the development of phase change materials by integrating phase selection, thermophysical property evaluation, and long-term thermal cycling analysis, particularly above 600°C.

Abstract: The present work explores the suitability of Al-Cu-Si ternary alloys as hightemperature metallic phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage systems (TESS) operating between 550__C and 850__C. While prior research has primarily focused on thermodynamic modeling or thermal property characterization below 600{\textdegree}C, this work provides a comprehensive experimental assessment of selected invariant compositions within the Al-Cu-Si system. CALPHAD calculations were performed using FactSage 8.2 software (SGTE and FTLite database) to guide alloy selection, followed by synthesis and detailed characterization of melting point, latent heat, specific heat, thermal diffusivity, and thermal conductivity. Critically, the thermal reliability of these materials was evaluated under repeated solid-liquid cycling up to 100 cycles in oxidizing atmospheres, revealing their stability and degradation profiles. Additionally, dilatometry and density analysis were conducted to provide an in-depth understanding of the alloys and practical properties for end users. Among the tested alloys, several demonstrated high volumetric energy densities (over 500 kWh/m${}^3$ for a temperature difference of 300{\textdegree}C) and good thermal durability, establishing Al-Cu-Si alloys as promising PCM candidates for industrial-scale high-temperature energy storage applications. This study fills a notable gap in the literature by combining phase selection, comprehensive thermophysical property evaluation, and long-term cycling analysis above 600{\textdegree}C.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着粒子加速器的多样化，不同设备和数据格式难以整合，因此需要统一语义以促进互操作。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在不同实验室应用中实现数据和工作流程的统一互操作性，支持标准化查询而不改变现有系统。

Abstract: We propose a small, shared core ontology for particle accelerators that provides a semantic backbone for interoperable data and workflows across facilities. The ontology names key device types, signals, parameters, and regions, and relates them through explicit properties (e.g., hasSetpoint, hasReadback, partOf). Each site contributes a lightweight facility bundle, a profile that maps local conventions into the shared vocabulary plus data slices that instantiate those mappings, without renaming channel addresses or changing existing systems. Using standard W3C technologies, the approach supports both sparse and rich descriptions. We demonstrate the idea on two beamline segments at different laboratories. A single semantic query is expressed once and evaluated against both knowledge bases, returning the locally correct PVs. The ontology thereby enables not only portable workflows but also interoperable data, since measurements and catalogs are annotated with shared semantics rather than facility-specific names. The framework complements, rather than replaces, existing middle layers and lattice/data standards, and it creates a stable foundation for reusable tools and agentic workflows.

### [6] [Impact of local bunching factors in single-pass THz free electron lasers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01656)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In simulations for modern free-electron laser (FEL), shot noise plays a crucial role. While it is inversely proportional to the number of electrons, shot noise is typically modeled using macroparticles, whose bunching factors correspond to those of the much larger number of electrons. For short-wavelength FELs, the macroparticles are assumed to be uniform over the scale of the resonant wavelength, since shot noise dominates the initial radiation - for instance, in the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) regime. In this paper, we show that this assumption does not hold at longer wavelengths, particularly in the THz range, where the bunch current profile is not uniform over the scale of the resonant wavelength. Instead, the current profile dominates the initial bunching factors, which can be several orders of magnitude higher than shot noise. The slice-based bunching factors and bunching phases are derived for Gaussian distributions and compared with shot noise under the assumption that the current within each slice remains constant. Using the THz FEL at the photoinjector test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) as a case study, the influence of the current profile has been benchmarked through simulations under very low bunch charge, where the real number of electrons can be modeled using the Genesis1.3 code. Additional simulations with the nominal working parameters of PITZ THz FEL have been compared with experimental data, indicating better agreement when the actual current profile is taken into account.

Abstract: Bell nonlocality provides a robust scalable route to the efficient certification of quantum states. Here, we introduce a general framework for constructing Bell inequalities tailored to the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code for odd prime local dimensions. Selecting a suitable subset of stabilizer operators and mapping them to generalized measurement observables, we compute multipartite Bell expressions whose quantum maxima admit a sum-of-squares decomposition. We show that these inequalities are maximally violated by all states in the ground-state manifold of the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code, and determine their classical (local) bounds through a combination of combinatorial tiling arguments and explicit optimization. As a concrete application, we analyze the case of $d=3$ and demonstrate that the maximal violation self-tests the full qutrit toric-code subspace, up to local isometries and complex conjugation. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first-ever example of self-testing a qutrit subspace. Extending these constructions, we further present schemes to enhance the ratio of classical--quantum bounds and thus improve robustness to experimental imperfections. Our results establish a pathway toward device-independent certification of highly entangled topological quantum matter and provide new tools for validating qudit states in error-correcting codes and quantum simulation platforms.

Conclusion: 研究发现，1+1维Carroll-Schrödinger量子系统中的多粒子动力学具有独特的性质，包括自由的集体运动、超局性以及与经典理论的联系，为深入理解多粒子量子系统提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We study the dynamics of multiparticle Carroll-Schrödinger (CS) quantum systems in $1{+}1$ dimensions, where $x$ acts as the evolution variable and $t$ as the configuration coordinate. We derive the $N$-body theory on equal-$x$ slices as the Carrollian limit of a relativistic multi-time Klein-Gordon model, introducing temporal interactions via minimal coupling to the temporal energy operators. An $x$-dependent gauge transformation maps this to an equivalent description with explicit many-body potentials, illustrated by a temporal coupled-oscillator model that exhibits synchronization. Adopting a complementary spatial viewpoint with a static potential $U_{\!tot}(\mathbf x)$, we show that the evolution is driven by the collective force $\sum_j\partial_{x_j}U_{\!tot}$; for any translation-invariant interaction (such as a regularized Coulomb potential), these internal forces cancel, rendering the collective dynamics free and highlighting Carrollian ultralocality. We also construct a coordinate duality mapping separable Schrödinger Hamiltonians to CS generators via Schwarzian derivatives. Exchange symmetry is formulated in the time domain, yielding temporal bunching for bosons and antibunching for fermions via the second-order coherence function $g^{(2)}(t,t')$. In second quantization, the contact limit yields a temporal derivative cubic--quintic nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a theoretically fixed nonlinearity coefficient $β=-3/16$. Finally, by coupling canonical pairs to external scalar and gauge fields, we establish an isomorphism with one-dimensional current-density functional theory, outlining a Carrollian Hohenberg-Kohn mapping and Kohn-Sham scheme.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum networking seeks to enable global entanglement distribution through terrestrial and free space channels; however, the exponential loss in these channels necessitates quantum repeaters with efficient, long lived quantum memories (QMs). Space based architectures, particularly satellite assisted links, offer a path to truly global connectivity, yet they demand QMs that are compatible with orbital factors such as infrared radiation and the unique challenges of operating aboard a satellite. In this work, we propose a multimode quantum memory (MMQM) for low Earth orbit (LEO) repeaters based on the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol. Our design integrates a hybrid alkali noble gas ensemble in an optical cavity, using alkali atoms for strong photon matter coupling and noble gas nuclear spins for minutes to hours coherence, all without the need for cryogenics. The architecture natively supports temporal and spectral multiplexing, enabling the storage of 100 modes to parallelize probabilistic operations and overcome light limited round trip times. Representative link budgets at $h = 500$ km with realistic apertures, $η_{\text{mem}}\gtrsim 70%$, and $t_{\text{buffer}}$ of several minutes predict improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in per pass success probability and instantaneous SKR relative to a memoryless dual downlink, with clear scaling in $N$. Our contributions are (i) a non cryogenic, space ready multimode memory, (ii) a systems analysis coupling mode count, storage time, and orbital geometry to achievable rate, and (iii) a near term implementation roadmap. Together, these results indicate feasibility with current to near term technology and provide a practical path toward a high rate, space enabled quantum internet.

*Hui Zhong,Jiachen Shen,Lei Fan,Xinyue Zhang,Hao Wang,Miao Pan,Zhu Han*

TL;DR: We propose UNIQ, a unified framework for DQC that integrates qubit allocation, entanglement management, and network scheduling into a non-linear integer programming model to optimize circuit runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed quantum computing faces significant challenges due to remote CNOT gates. Current approaches optimize each component independently, but a unified strategy can lead to more efficient solutions.

Method: UNIQ uses a non-linear integer programming model with a greedy algorithm for qubit mapping and a JIT approach to build EPR pairs in parallel.

Result: Simulation results show that UNIQ reduces communication cost and circuit runtime compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: UNIQ offers a promising, scalable solution for optimizing distributed quantum computing, particularly for a wide range of quantum circuits and QPU topologies.

Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is widely regarded as a promising approach to overcome quantum hardware limitations. A major challenge in DQC lies in reducing the communication cost introduced by remote CNOT gates, which are significantly slower and more resource-consuming than local operations. Existing DQC approaches treat the three essential components (qubit allocation, entanglement management, and network scheduling) as independent stages, optimizing each in isolation. However, we observe that these components are inherently interdependent, and therefore adopting a unified optimization strategy can be more efficient to achieve the global optimal solutions. Consequently, we propose UNIQ, a novel DQC optimization framework that integrates all three components into a non-linear integer programming (NIP) model. UNIQ aims to reduce the circuit runtime by maximizing parallel Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation through the use of idle communication qubits, while simultaneously minimizing the communication cost of remote gates. To solve this NP-hard formulated problem, we adopt two key strategies: a greedy algorithm for efficiently mapping logical qubits to different QPUs, and a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach that builds EPR pairs in parallel within each time slot. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach is widely applicable to diverse quantum circuits and QPU topologies, while substantially reducing communication cost and runtime over existing methods.

TL;DR: A scalable method for all-to-all Ising model using Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) with four-body interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring scalable quantum computing architectures, particularly in quantum annealing and quantum simulations.

Method: Developed new unit circuits for KPOs incorporating four-body interactions and linear couplers for simplicity.

Result: Achieved four-body correlation experiments confirming the theoretical framework.

Conclusion: Pumped the interaction strength for quantum annealing applications, emphasizing the tuning of pump frequencies to suppress unwanted interactions.

Abstract: We theoretically present new unit circuits of Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) with four-body interactions, which enable the scalable embedding of all-to-all connected logical Ising spins using the Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (LHZ) scheme. These unit circuits enable four-body interactions using linear couplers, making the circuit fabrication and characterization much simpler than those of conventional unit circuits with nonlinear couplers. Numerical calculations indicate that the magnitudes of the coupling constants can be comparable to those in conventional circuits. On the basis of this theory, we designed a four-KPO circuit and experimentally confirmed the four-body correlation by measuring the pump-phase dependence of the parity of the four-KPO states. We show that the choice of the pump frequencies are important not only to enable the four-body interaction, but to cancel the effects of other unwanted interactions. Using the circuit, we demonstrated the quantum annealing based on the LHZ scheme, where the strength of the interaction between the logical Ising spins is mapped to the local field and controlled by a coherent drive applied to each KPO.

Motivation:  Maldecena 猜想 Quantum Chaos 中的OTOCs 的速率有上限，研究 instanton 如何影响这一上限是有趣的。

Method: 运用环聚合物分子动力学 (RPMD)和 Matsubara 演化来计算OTOCs，结合数值模拟和理论分析。

Result: Instanton 导致的 OTOC 较小的增加，使得 RPMD 无法满足 Maldecena 猜想的上限。理论研究显示 RPMD 演化和实际的量子演化在某些方面不同。

Conclusion: Instanton 在满足 Maldecena 猜想方面起重要作用，RPMD 并不是足够的方法来验证这一猜想。

Abstract: In the study of quantum chaos, `out of time ordered correlators' (OTOCs) are commonly used to quantify the rate at which quantum information is scrambled. This rate has been conjectured by Maldecena et al. to obey a universal, temperature dependent bound. Recent studies have shown that instantons, delocalised structures that dominate tunnelling statistics over barriers, reduce the growth rate of OTOCs. For the case of the symmetric double well, this reduction ensures the bound is maintained for OTOCs generated using ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), a method with approximate dynamics but exact quantum statistics. In this report we set out to further understand the role of the instanton in the enforcement of the Maldacena bound and test whether RPMD is sufficient to satisfy the bound. We also investigate the impact of coherence on the flattening of of OTOCs by contrasting bounded with scattering systems. For the scattering system we observe a significantly smaller OTOC growth rate than that of the analogous bounded system, and a flattening in growth rate as time progresses. We attribute the first effect to influence of the Boltzmann operator, and the second to interference caused by anharmonicity of the potential. In our studies of RPMD, we find counterexamples showing that it is not sufficient to satisfy the bound. We develop a theory for OTOCs using (analytically-continued) Matsubara dynamics, revealing significantly different dynamical behaviour around the instanton compared to the predictions of RPMD. The instanton is found to be stationary in all coordinates but its collective angle $Φ_0$, and fluctuations about it no longer resemble that of classical dynamics on a first order saddle as in RPMD.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The continuous-variable (CV) Gaussian no-go theorem fundamentally limits the suppression of Gaussian displacement errors using only Gaussian gates and states. Prior studies have employed Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states as ancillary qumodes to suppress small Gaussian displacement errors, but when the displacement magnitude becomes large, lattice-crossing events arise beyond the correctable range of the GKP state. To address this issue, we concatenate a Gaussian-noise-suppression circuit with an outer analog Steane code that corrects such occasional lattice-crossing events as well as other abrupt displacement errors. Unlike conventional concatenation, which primarily aims to reduce logical error rates, the Steane-GKP duality in encoding provides complementary protection against both large and small displacement errors, enabling CV error correction within the continuous encoding space and contrasting with earlier approaches that concatenate GKP states with repetition codes for discrete qubit or qudit encodings. Analytical results show that, under infinite squeezing, the concatenated code suppresses the variance of Gaussian displacement errors across all qumodes by up to 50 percent while enabling unbiased correction of lattice-crossing events, with a success probability determined by the ratio between the residual Gaussian error standard deviation and the lattice-crossing magnitude. Even with finite squeezing, the proposed architecture continues to provide Gaussian-error suppression together with lattice-crossing correction, and the presence of the outer analog Steane code relaxes the squeezing requirement of the inner GKP states, indicating near-term experimental feasibility. This work establishes a viable route toward fault-tolerant continuous-variable quantum computation and provides new insight into the design of concatenated CV error-correcting architectures.

Abstract: We measure the ensemble transverse relaxation time (T2*) and spin-echo coherence time (T2) of the proton spin of HD molecules trapped in solid parahydrogen. By using high-purity parahydrogen matrices, we are able to measure significantly longer T2 and T2* times than seen in prior work. We also measure the longitudinal spin relaxation time T1. We examine how these parameters scale with the matrix purity and find limits on the coherence time from the parahydrogen matrix itself.

Abstract: We propose an experimentally accessible scheme for realizing tunable nonclassical light in cavity-coupled reconfigurable atomic arrays. By coherently controlling the collective interference phase, the system switches from single-photon blockade to high-purity multiphoton bundle emission, unveiling a hierarchical structure of photon correlations dictated by atom-number parity and cavity detuning. The scaling of photon population identifies the transition between superradiant and subradiant regimes, while parity- and phase-dependent spin correlations elucidate the microscopic interference processes enabling coherent multiphoton generation. This work establishes a unified framework connecting cooperative atomic interactions to controllable nonclassical photon statistics and introduces a distinct interference-enabled mechanism that provides a practical route toward high-fidelity multiphoton sources in scalable cavity QEDs.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the local distinguishability of five orthogonal product states (OPSs) in bipartite and tripartite quantum systems. For Bipartite OPSs, they establish conditions under which they can be perfectly distinguished using LOCC, categorizing the structures of five OPSs into six types, proving that five of these can be perfectly distinguished, and addressing the sixth category individually. For Tripartite OPSs, they classify the structures of five OPSs into eight categories and provide distinguishability results for each.

Motivation: Understanding the limitations and capabilities of quantum state distinguishability is crucial for optimizing quantum protocols and reducing resource consumption, making this work relevant for both theoretical and applied quantum information science.

Method: The authors propose a novel vector of orthogonal relations and employ classification and proof techniques to analyze the distinguishability of the OPSs in both bipartite and tripartite systems, providing a systematic approach to this problem.

Result: The paper successfully establishes a framework for determining the distinguishability of five OPSs in both bipartite and tripartite systems. They demonstrate that nearly all cases are distinguishable using LOCC, except for one specific scenario in the bipartite system which requires further investigation.

Conclusion: This research significantly advances the field by resolving a previously unresolved issue regarding the distinguishability of five OPSs. The findings enhance our understanding of quantum nonlocality and provide a foundation for future studies on quantum state discrimination and its applications in quantum communication and computation.

Abstract: Local distinguishability of orthogonal quantum states can effectively reduce the consumption of quantum resources and lower economic costs in quantum protocols. Although numerous achievements have been made regarding local distinguishability of orthogonal quantum states, some fundamental issues have not been effectively addressed. For example, the local distinguishability of five orthogonal product states (OPSs) is still unknown up to now. In this paper, we give the properties of local distinguishability of five OPSs on bipartite and tripartite quantum systems. Firstly, to characterize the structure of a set of bipartite OPSs, we propose the concept of the vector of orthogonal relations for a set of bipartite OPSs. Secondly, we classify the structures of five bipartite OPSs into six categories by this concept and prove that five of these six categories can be perfectly distinguished by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Thirdly we show that the local distinguishability of each case of the sixth category singly. On the other hand, we first divide the structures of five tripartite OPSs into eight categories by the vectors of orthogonal relations of five tripartite OPSs. Then we give the local distinguishability of each category. Our work enriches the research results of quantum nonlocality and will provide a clear understanding of the local distinguishability of five OPSs.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement has long been recognized as an important resource for quantum sensing. In this work, we demonstrate the use of multiple-quantum solid-state NMR for quantum sensing by creating, manipulating, and detecting large clusters of correlated nuclear spins. We show that such clusters can sensitively detect pulse-width jitters in radio-frequency control fields at the level of tens of nanoseconds. By analyzing the response of high-order quantum coherences to these control-field jitters, we investigate the critical interplay between the enhanced sensitivity offered by large coherence orders, their relative distributions, and their varying susceptibility to decoherence. We further demonstrate that, even within a non-uniform distribution of coherence orders, there exists an optimal maximum coherence order that maximizes sensing efficiency. To support our interpretation, we supplement the experimental results with a simplified numerical model that estimates the corresponding quantum Fisher information. These results support the solid-state NMR platform as a valuable testbed for investigating many-body quantum metrology protocols.

TL;DR: A new method for real-time imaging of battery cell internal processes using magnetic imaging has been developed, surpassing current techniques in spatial and temporal resolution. This method uses optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) to capture dynamic currents and can monitor battery cell states post-pulsed discharge. The technique has potential applications in quality control, aging prediction, and recycling. The approach is validated through superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements and finite element simulations. Equivalent circuit models are used for interpretation, revealing detailed spatial information and magnetic signatures not accessible through other methods like electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of battery production requires advanced diagnostic tools, but existing methods lack the necessary resolution. This paper aims to address this gap by introducing a novel method for imaging battery currents with higher spatial and temporal resolution.

Method: The method uses optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) for real-time imaging of battery cell dynamics in an open-circuit configuration. This technique is benchmarked against SQUID magnetometry and validated through three-dimensional finite element simulations.

Result: The OPM-based method demonstrates higher spatial and temporal resolution compared to current techniques. The measurements are successfully applied to monitor relaxation processes in lithium-ion battery cells following various discharge protocols. Results are supported by equivalent circuit models, showing features and magnetic signatures that are otherwise inaccessible through methods like electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

Conclusion: This work establishes OPM-based magnetic imaging as a powerful diagnostic tool with significant implications for improving cell development, manufacturing quality assurance, and second-life assessment of batteries.

Abstract: The projected rapid growth of battery cell production over the next decade demands advanced diagnostic tools for quality control, ageing prediction, and recycling. Most existing techniques lack the spatial and temporal resolution required to capture internal electrochemical processes non-invasively. Here, we present magnetic imaging of current densities in battery cells, a sensitive quantum-magnetometry method that uses optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) to perform real-time imaging of internal dynamics in open-circuit configuration. We demonstrate this approach for monitoring relaxation processes in 6000 mA h lithium-ion cells following pulsed discharges across a range of pulse durations and currents as well as states of charge. The measurement results are benchmarked against superconducting-quantum-interference-device (SQUID) magnetometry and validated with three-dimensional finite element simulations. Equivalent circuit models are employed to interpret the relaxation profiles, revealing spatially resolved features and transient magnetic-field signatures that are inaccessible with complementary non-invasive techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This work establishes OPM-based magnetic imaging of battery current density as a powerful diagnostic tool with potential impact on cell development, manufacturing quality assurance, and second-life assessment.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work we reexamine the EPR paradox for composite systems with a finite number of levels. The analysis emphasizes the connection between measurements and conditional probabilities. This connection implies, on the one hand, that when a measurement is performed, the new quantum state and the probability distribution becomes a function of the observable being measured. On the other hand, this becomes important when making predictions about the properties of the subsystems, since the predictions are implicitly a function of the observable that was measured.
  Systems with finitely many levels are simpler to describe because the analysis is not encumbered by the mathematical technicalities of the continuous case, and the underlying physical interpretations are the same.

Abstract: In Lieb lattices, geometric frustration and destructive interference of hopping cancels the occupation of certain sites, leading to flat-band physics. Here, we show numerically how, in the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard (DDBH) model arranged into Lieb lattices and related geometries, specific localised driving schemes can repurpose this interference to generate enhanced antibunching via a mechanism similar to the so-called unconventional photon blockade. Stochastic simulations using the positive-P method allow us to calculate occupations and second order correlations exactly for extended lattices. We use this to optimise the parameters for the possible observation of this effect in polariton micropillar experiments. This work demonstrates the possibility of using localised driving and interference effects to generate non-trivial quantum correlations in open quantum lattice systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid architecture for optical quantum computation using both pulsed and continuous wave (CW) light. It enables the generation of non-Gaussian quantum states with pulsed light and utilizes CW light for quantum processors, such as cluster states and homodyne measurement systems. A proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates ultrafast homodyne measurement of single-photon states with high non-classicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research stems from the need for high-speed and efficient optical quantum information processing, which is crucial for advancing quantum computing and communication technologies. The proposed hybrid architecture aims to overcome the limitations of each individual light type by combining their strengths.

Method: The authors developed a pulse and continuous wave hybrid architecture. They used pulsed light to generate non-Gaussian quantum states, such as single-photon states, and employed CW light for quantum processors. A proof-of-principle experiment was conducted to perform ultrafast homodyne measurement using a continuous-wave local oscillator on single-photon states. The experiment involved measuring the temporal width of the single-photon states and calculating the Wigner function value at the origin.

Result: The experiment successfully measured single-photon states with a temporal width of approximately 70 picoseconds. The calculated Wigner function value at the origin was found to be -0.153 ± 0.003, indicating a high level of non-classicality in the measured state. This result suggests that the proposed hybrid architecture successfully integrates the generation and manipulation of quantum states, paving the way for high-speed optical quantum information processing.

Conclusion: This study presents a novel hybrid architecture for continuous-variable measurement-based quantum computation. By combining pulsed and continuous-wave light, the authors demonstrated the generation and ultrafast manipulation of non-classical quantum states, which is a significant step toward realizing high-performance optical quantum information processing systems.

Abstract: We propose a pulse and continuous wave (CW) hybrid architecture of continuous-variable measurement-based optical quantum computation utilizing the strengths of both pulsed and CW light. In this architecture, input and ancillary non-Gaussian quantum states necessary for fault-tolerance and universality of quantum computing are generated with pulsed light, whereas quantum processors including continuous-variable cluster states and homodyne measurement systems are operated with CW light. This architecture is expected to enable both generation of quantum states with shorter optical wavepackets and low-loss manipulation and measurement of these states, thus is compatible with ultrafast and low-loss quantum information processing. In this study, as a proof-of-principle, an ultrafast homodyne measurement using CW local oscillator was performed on single-photon states generated with pulsed light. The measured single-photon state's temporal width was around 70 ps and the value of the Wigner function at the origin was W(0,0) = -0.153 +/- 0.003, which is highly non-classical. This will be a core technology for realizing high-speed optical quantum information processing.

Abstract: Optically levitated particles are used in a wide range of experiments to explore both fundamental physics and to act as sensors to a variety of external forces. One field of particular interest that these particles can be used to investigate is quantum mechanics. Previous research has yet to set an absolute upper bound on the size of objects that can be prepared in a quantum superposition. Exploring this limit involves allowing ever-larger objects to freely and coherently evolve to assess if their behaviour matches quantum or classical theoretical predictions. However, the long free evolution times required for these behaviours to be visible result in the experiments being gravitationally limited. Space based platforms therefore become the next key step in these investigations. In this white paper, we shall discuss our proposal for an optical levitation experiment in space that will explore the fundamental upper size limits of quantum mechanics. We shall cover the scientific motivation behind these investigations, then summarize the current status of our designs for the satellite. We will then review the aspects of the payload that require further development, then summarize the current estimates of the payload's requirements.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了隔离和检测ETPA的可能，但仍需解决效率限制问题。

Abstract: The phenomenon of Entangled Two-Photon Absorption (ETPA) presents a persistent controversy in the literature, evidenced by a wide disparity in the reported values for the $σ_E$ cross-sections. Much of this discrepancy is attributed to the difficulty in discriminating ETPA from various background processes that can mimic its signal, such as linear absorption or scattering. Given this need to certify the presence of ETPA unequivocally, this work introduces a key strategy to isolate the ETPA contribution through its spectral signature. This involves modeling the molecule as a two-photon notch filter and inducing a controlled asymmetric overlap with the joint spectral intensity (JSI) of the incident photons. This asymmetry is used to generate a measurable distortion in the transmitted JSI, and, complementarily, as a reduction in the visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip. To ensure the experimental feasibility of this technique, a comprehensive analysis of the experimental conditions required for its detection is presented, establishing the absorption efficiency limits that must be overcome given the constraints of entangled-photon-pair flux and detector noise. A preliminary experiment addressing the ETPA detection limits using the standard RhB dye is presented.

Abstract: Many-hypercube codes [H. Goto, Sci. Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ have large code block sizes at high concatenation levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we investigate smaller many-hypercube codes obtained by concatenating $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a surprising fact: $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model. These results will be useful for early experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing with high-rate quantum codes.

Abstract: I define a notion of local causality LOC closely modelled on the Bell principle, construed as the condition that single case probabilities cannot be modified by actions at spacelike separation. The new principle, like that of Bell, forces Bell inequalities, but with two loopholes: one is retrocausation, known to Bell, but the other is nonuniqueness of remote outcomes, a loophole only for LOC, not for the Bell principle. I also set out a theory of physical probability, applicable to the Everett interpretation, in agreement with the Born rule, and therefore violating Bell inequalities. I show it is consistent with LOC. Surprisingly, both loopholes are exploited. I conclude not only that probability in the Everett interpretation involves no action at a distance, but that the observed violations of Bell inequalities is powerful evidence for many worlds.

TL;DR:  paper presents a novel method for parameterizing quantum channels using differentiable geometric representations to facilitate their identification, particularly for quasi-inverse channels which are difficult to compute analytically. It leverages machine learning algorithms, such as gradient descent, to optimize these parameters. The approach ensures physical validity by enforcing symmetry constraints and other necessary properties, and demonstrates effectiveness across various quantum channels beyond single-qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  understanding and identifying quantum channels is crucial for quantum computing and communication. many noise processes are complex, making analytical solutions impractical, hence the need for computational methods like machine learning to approximate quasi-inverses.

Method:  the paper introduces a differentiable parameterization of quantum channels using geometric properties. it constructs a parametric space as a unit hypersphere, where valid quantum channels are embedded as unit vectors with certain constraints. gradient descent on this space with a fidelity-based loss function is used to optimize and find quasi-inverse channels.

Result:  the method successfully optimizes a variety of quantum channels, including those beyond single-qubits, showing its versatility and robustness in handling complex noise processes.

Conclusion:  this work presents a promising framework for quantum channel identification using geometry and machine learning, offering a scalable solution to a challenging problem in quantum information science.

Abstract: This work presents a differentiable geometric parameterization of quantum channels in Kraus representation, which can be efficiently probed to find an unknown quantum channel. We explore its feasibility in finding the quasi inverse channels, which can be a tedious analytically for complex noise processes and is often achievable only for a limited range of parameters. In this regard, machine learning based algorithms have been employed successfully to find quasi inverse of quantum channels. The space of quantum channels in this scheme is a unit hypersphere, and components of mutually constrained unit vectors residing in this space, are used to construct a physically valid quantum channel. Symplectic constraints, orthogonality, and unit length of the vectors suffice to maintain complete positivity and the trace-preserving property of the channels. By performing gradient descent on this parametric space with a fidelity-based loss function, this approach is found to optimize quasi inverse of a variety of quantum channels, not limited to single-qubits, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Electron-on-neon (eNe) qubits have recently emerged as a compelling platform for quantum computing, which combines the vacuum isolation advantages of trapped-ion qubits with the scalability of superconducting circuits. In this system, electrons are trapped in vacuum above a solid neon film deposited on superconducting microwave resonators, where they exhibit strong coupling to the resonators, coherence times of ~0.1 ms, and single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.97%. A central challenge, however, is the spontaneous binding of electrons to neon surface bumps. These bumps, originating from substrate roughness, vary in size: electrons on bumps of suitable sizes within the resonator can couple to microwave photons and function as qubits, whereas those on unfavorable bumps remain inactive yet contribute to background charge noise. Moreover, both the bump landscape and the sites where electrons bind differ from run to run, leading to irreproducible qubit characteristics that hinder scalability. To address this challenging issue, we present an on-chip magnetic-levitation architecture in which arrays of solid-neon microparticles are suspended above the processor chip to act as electron carriers. This design eliminates substrate effects while retaining strong qubit-resonator coupling and supporting inter-qubit connectivity. Our analysis further shows that the qubit transition frequency can be tuned across the gigahertz range and its anharmonicity can reach ~0.8 GHz by tuning the resonator bias voltage. Together, these features suggest a promising pathway toward robust, reproducible, and scalable eNe-based quantum computing.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates solving non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) problems using an energy-based optimization method on non-von Neumann architectures, specifically the Dirac-3. While current devices can't handle large-scale problems, initial experiments on both real and integer matrices show promising results when combining Dirac-3 with traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NMF is a fundamental unsupervised learning technique with wide-ranging applications. Existing methods often struggle with computational complexity and scalability, particularly for large matrices. Exploring alternative computing architectures, such as non-von Neumann devices, could offer new solutions to this challenge.

Method: The authors conducted experiments using the Dirac-3 device, which operates based on an entropy computing paradigm. They developed two formulations: a QUBO model suitable for Ising machines and a quartic formulation for real-valued and integer variables. These were compared against traditional methods like Scikit-learn's NMF and Google's CP-SAT solver.

Result: Preliminary experiments indicated that combining Dirac-3 with traditional methods yields better results for both real and integer matrices compared to using traditional methods alone.

Conclusion: The study suggests that non-von Neumann architectures like the Dirac-3 may hold promise for solving NMF problems, especially in specific domains where such architectures could provide a computational advantage over conventional methods.

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a matrix decomposition problem with applications in unsupervised learning. The general form of this problem (along with many of its variants) is NP-hard in nature. In our work, we explore how this problem could be solved with an energy-based optimization method suitable for certain machines with non-von Neumann architectures. We used the Dirac-3, a device based on the entropy computing paradigm and made by Quantum Computing Inc., to evaluate our approach. Our formulations consist of (i) a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model (QUBO, suitable for Ising machines) and a quartic formulation that allows for real-valued and integer variables (suitable for machines like the Dirac-3). Although current devices cannot solve large NMF problems, the results of our preliminary experiments are promising enough to warrant further research. For non-negative real matrices, we observed that a fusion approach of first using Dirac-3 and then feeding its results as the initial factor matrices to Scikit-learn's NMF procedure outperforms Scikit-learn's NMF procedure on its own, with default parameters in terms of the error in the reconstructed matrices. For our experiments on non-negative integer matrices, we compared the Dirac-3 device to Google's CP-SAT solver (inside the Or-Tools package) and found that for serial processing, Dirac-3 outperforms CP-SAT in a majority of the cases. We believe that future work in this area might be able to identify domains and variants of the problem where entropy computing (and other non-von Neumann architectures) could offer a clear advantage.

Abstract: We develop a differential-geometric framework for variational quantum circuits in which noisy single- and multi-qubit parameter spaces are modeled by weighted projective lines (WPLs). Starting from the pure-state Bloch sphere CP1, we show that realistic hardware noise induces anisotropic contractions of the Bloch ball that can be represented by a pair of physically interpretable parameters (lambda_perp, lambda_parallel). These parameters determine a unique WPL metric g_WPL(a_over_b, b) whose scalar curvature is R = 2 / b^2, yielding a compact and channel-resolved geometric surrogate for the intrinsic information structure of noisy quantum circuits.
  We develop a tomography-to-geometry pipeline that extracts (lambda_perp, lambda_parallel) from hardware data and maps them to the WPL parameters (a_over_b, b, R). Experiments on IBM Quantum backends show that the resulting WPL geometries accurately capture anisotropic curvature deformation across calibration periods. Finally, we demonstrate that WPL-informed quantum natural gradients (WPL-QNG) provide stable optimization dynamics for noisy variational quantum eigensolvers and enable curvature-aware mitigation of barren plateaus.

Abstract: We develop a unified geometric framework for quantum circuit compilation based on quantized orbifold phases and their diagrammatic semantics. Physical qubit platforms impose heterogeneous phase resolutions, anisotropic Bloch-ball contractions, and hardware-dependent $2π$ winding behavior. We show that these effects admit a natural description on the weighted projective line $\mathbb{P}(a,b)$, whose orbifold points encode discrete phase grids and whose monodromy captures winding accumulation under realistic noise channels.
  Building on this geometry, we introduce the WPL--ZX calculus, an extension of the standard ZX formalism in which each spider carries a weight--phase--winding triple $(a,α,k)$. We prove soundness of LCM-based fusion and normalization rules, derive curvature predictors for phase-grid compatibility, and present the Weighted ZX Circuit Compression (WZCC) algorithm, which performs geometry-aware optimization on heterogeneous phase lattices.
  To connect circuit-level structure with fault-tolerant architectures, we introduce Monodromy-Aware Surface-Code Decoding (MASD), a winding-regularized modification of minimum-weight matching on syndrome graphs. MASD incorporates orbifold-weighted edge costs, producing monotone decoder-risk metrics and improved robustness across phase-quantized noise models.
  All results are validated through symbolic and numerical simulations, demonstrating that quantized orbifold geometry provides a coherent and hardware-relevant extension of diagrammatic quantum compilation.

Motivation: There is a pressing need for quantum machine learning models that are both trainably efficient and privacy-preserving. Existing approaches either sacrifice one for the other, leading to ineffective solutions.

Method: DyLoC employs a dual-layer architecture with orthogonal decoupling strategies. The first layer ensures trainability by restricting to polynomial-sized algebras, while the second layer externalizes privacy to the input and output interfaces using techniques like truncated Chebyshev graph encoding and dynamic local scrambling for gradient obfuscation.

Result: Experiments reveal that DyLoC maintains baseline performance with a mean squared error of 2.0, successfully blocking snapshot inversion attacks. The circuit achieves theoretical security under input perturbation and provides polynomial-time learning convergence, making it a secure and effective solution for quantum machine learning.

Conclusion: DyLoC successfully addresses the critical trade-off between privacy and trainability in quantum machine learning, offering both reliable performance and enhanced security through its innovative architecture and encoding methods.

Abstract: Variational quantum circuits face a critical trade-off between privacy and trainability. High expressivity required for robust privacy induces exponentially large dynamical Lie algebras. This structure inevitably leads to barren plateaus. Conversely, trainable models restricted to polynomial-sized algebras remain transparent to algebraic attacks. To resolve this impasse, DyLoC is proposed. This dual-layer architecture employs an orthogonal decoupling strategy. Trainability is anchored to a polynomial-DLA ansatz while privacy is externalized to the input and output interfaces. Specifically, Truncated Chebyshev Graph Encoding (TCGE) is employed to thwart snapshot inversion. Dynamic Local Scrambling (DLS) is utilized to obfuscate gradients. Experiments demonstrate that DyLoC maintains baseline-level convergence with a final loss of 0.186. It outperforms the baseline by increasing the gradient reconstruction error by 13 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, snapshot inversion attacks are blocked when the reconstruction mean squared error exceeds 2.0. These results confirm that DyLoC effectively establishes a verifiable pathway for secure and trainable quantum machine learning.

Abstract: We present a generalized Deutsch-Jozsa (DJ) quantum algorithm that not only determines both the global type of an unknown Boolean function (constant or balanced) but also determines explicit output values of the function in a single oracle query. Unlike the original DJ algorithm, which identifies only whether a function is constant or balanced, our generalization retrieves actual function output values at the same time with using a Bell state as ancilla. This makes a richer function characterization with minimal queries to have practical quantum advantages, e.g. data classification, logistic regression, and quantum cryptography.

Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation is a phenomenon in which the Hilbert space of a quantum system is dynamically decoupled into exponentially many Krylov subspaces. We can define the Schur transform as a unitary operation mapping some set of preferred bases of these Krylov subspaces to computational basis states labeling them. We prove that this transformation can be efficiently learned via gradient descent from a set of training data using quantum neural networks, provided that the fragmentation is sufficiently strong such that the summed dimension of the unique Krylov subspaces is polynomial in the system size. To demonstrate this, we analyze the loss landscapes of random quantum neural networks constructed out of Hilbert space fragmented systems. We prove that in this setting, it is possible to eliminate barren plateaus and poor local minima, suggesting efficient trainability when using gradient descent. Furthermore, as the algebra defining the fragmentation is not known a priori and not guaranteed to have sparse algebra elements, to the best of our knowledge there are no existing efficient classical algorithms generally capable of simulating expectation values in these networks. Our setting thus provides a rare example of a physically motivated quantum learning task with no known dequantization.

Abstract: Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) provides a route toward demonstrating quantum computational advantage. However, optical loss, which reduces the entanglement in the system, can render GBS results classically simulable. We propose a nonlinear photonic architecture based on optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) arranged in an interferometer network. This active configuration amplifies quantum correlations within the circuit while preserving the #P-hard Hafnian structure of the output probabilities. Using logarithmic negativity, we numerically show that entanglement scales linearly with both the OPA gain and network depth in the lossless limit, and maintains linear scaling with the number of modes under realistic loss rate. These scaling behaviors suggest that classical simulation in lossy scenarios remains computationally intractable. Our results demonstrate that OPA-boosted GBS preserves computational hardness in noisy environments, offering a more effective implementations of near-term photonic quantum computers.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum systems are inherently sensitive to environmental noise and imperfections in external control fields, posing a significant challenge for the practical implementation of quantum technologies. These noise sources degrade the fidelity of quantum gates, making their mitigation a key requirement for realizing reliable quantum computing. In this study, we apply optimal control theory (OCT) within a thermodynamically consistent framework to design and stabilize high-fidelity quantum gates under Markovian noise. Our approach focuses on thermal relaxation and incorporates these effects into the control protocol, wherein external driving fields not only govern the system's unitary evolution but also modulate its interaction with the environment. By leveraging this interplay, we demonstrate that OCT can enable entropy-modifying processes, such as targeted cooling or heating, while maintaining high-fidelity gate performance in noisy environments. To validate our approach, we employ high-precision numerical methods on an open quantum system implementing one- or two-qubit gates embedded in a larger Hilbert space. The results showcase robust gate operation even under significant dissipative influences, offering a concrete path toward fault-tolerant quantum computation under realistic conditions.

TL;DR: This paper shows that Haar scrambling is equivalent to ramp secret sharing, which can be implemented efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the study of quantum information scrambling and its connection to cryptography.

Method: The authors analyze scrambling protocols and their equivalence to secret-sharing schemes using complexity theory.

Result: The equivalence is shown, with ramp secret sharing emerging from Haar scrambling under certain conditions.

Conclusion: The findings suggest applications in distributed quantum networks, NISQ cryptography, and fundamental physics.

Abstract: Quantum information scrambling has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, assessing benchmarking protocols, and even investigating exotic black hole models. During quantum information scrambling, localized quantum information disperses across the entire system, hiding from the observers who can only access part of it. On the other side, we have a fundamental cryptographic primitive called secret-sharing schemes, where a dealer shares a quantum secret with a group of parties, such that any subset of parties above a specific threshold size can reconstruct it. In this paper, we demonstrate that two protocols, Haar scrambling, which serves as a baseline for other scrambling techniques, and quantum secret sharing, are indeed equivalent. The scheme one gets out of this is of a ramp secret-sharing nature rather than a threshold scheme. We expect this because of the inherent randomness present in Haar unitaries. Moreover, by varying the purity of the initial states, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain all possible types of ramp secret-sharing schemes. Furthermore, utilizing complexity theoretic arguments, we argue that the protocol can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in polynomial time. Finally, we explore potential applications, ranging from security implications for distributed quantum networks to cryptography in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, and draw insights for fundamental physics, such as many-body physics and quantum black holes.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents experimental evidence that a particular quantum battery design can outperform classical batteries in energy storage效率.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum batteries promise to exceed classical limits in energy storage, and this paper investigates the fundamental requirements for achieving such performance.

Method: The authors analyze spin-lattice models, defining a new property called 'g-extensiveness' to determine charging performance bounds. They prove that superextensive scaling (scaling with system size) is only possible under specific interaction energy distribution conditions and demonstrate this with an experimentally relevant model.

Result: The study shows that when interaction energy distributions become increasingly nonuniform, charging power can scale superextensively, a phenomenon not observed in systems with uniform interaction energies fixed by Hamiltonian order.

Conclusion: This work establishes 'g-extensiveness' as a necessary condition for quantum advantage in direct-charging protocols and provides a framework for designing quantum batteries that surpass classical ones in charging efficiency.

Abstract: Quantum batteries have emerged as a platform for investigating whether quantum effects can accelerate energy storage beyond classical limits. Although a variety of charging schemes have reported signatures of quantum advantage, the fundamental physical requirements for achieving superextensive charging power remain insufficiently understood. Here, we show that, in addition to Hamiltonian locality, a key structural property, g-extensiveness, quantifying the distribution of interaction energy across lattice sites places a fundamental bound on charging performance in spin-lattice models. We prove that superextensive power scaling is possible only when the interaction-energy distribution becomes increasingly nonuniform, with the maximal local weight growing with system size. This criterion explains why many previously studied protocols fail to exhibit superextensive power, even when the Hamiltonians involve large participation numbers. We further demonstrate that this condition is realized in an experimentally relevant interacting model, where, despite fixed interaction order, the charging power scales superextensively. Our results establish g-extensiveness as a necessary resource for quantum advantage in direct-charging protocols and provide a systematic framework for identifying and engineering physically feasible quantum batteries capable of outperforming classical counterparts in charging power.

Conclusion: 论文对 TDHO 的行为提供了全面的分析，带来了新的见解，特别是在量子热力学和热机开发方面。

Abstract: We present an exact description of the dynamics and the thermodynamics of a time dependent harmonic oscillator (TDHO) that follows a unitary evolution. In that context, we study the relationship between particle creation, adiabaticity and irreversibility in terms of three different representations: the initial, the diagonal and the invariant representations of the TDHO. We provide analytical results that are valid for any functional value of the frequency and along the whole evolution of the TDHO, which allows us to monitor the behavior of the thermodynamical magnitudes in regions that are not fully considered in previous works, i.e. the transition and the non quasi-static regions. We supplement the analytical results with numerical calculations and graphs.
  They both show how the largest modes of the non invariant representations may undergo a process of reversible thermalization, where the concept of temperature naturally arises from the unitary evolution of the oscillator with no relation to any external concept of temperature. It would allow us to monitor an unexpected classical-to-quantum transition, which might entail a violation of the third principle of classical thermodynamics. We also provide adaptations of the customary definitions of the quantum heat and work that account for the particle creation of the TDHO. They thus depend on the representation and their evolution is different for the three representations analyzed in this paper, which might have important consequences in the development of quantum thermal machines. Finally, we study the relationship between the creation of particles and the diagonal entropy, which is derived from the von Neumann entropy in the diagonalization limit. The condition of no production of entropy under unitary evolution suggests the definition of a mode temperature that would correspond to the thermal temperature is some appropriate limit.

TL;DR: Multiqubit gates can be beneficial for measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum error correction and stabilizer readout in unrotated surface codes. We developed a Python package to design efficient gates with minimal errors. The protocols showed break-even performance within current hardware capabilities and potential for improved logical qubit performance with Floquet codes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Quantum error correction is essential for reliable quantum computing. Exploring the role of multiqubit gates in fault-tolerant error correction can lead to more efficient and robust error detection and correction schemes, which are critical for building scalable quantum computers.

Method: We investigated multiqubit Rydberg gates implemented using a single laser pulse. We developed an open-source Python package to design analytical, few-parameter pulses that minimize gate errors. The tool allows for the identification of parameter-optimal pulses and was used to analyze the performance of measurement-free quantum error correction protocols and Floquet quantum error correction protocols under various error rates.

Result: The measurement-free quantum error correction protocols showed break-even performance within current hardware capabilities. Additionally, the Floquet quantum error correction protocols demonstrated the potential for competitive logical qubit performance in experimentally relevant error regimes.

Conclusion: Multiqubit Rydberg gates offer significant advantages for fault-tolerant quantum error correction. The developed tools and protocols can enhance the performance of quantum error correction in current and near-future quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: Multiqubit gates that involve three or more qubits are usually thought to be of little significance for fault-tolerant quantum error correction because single gate faults can lead to high-weight correlated errors. However, recent works have shown that multiqubit gates can be beneficial for measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum error correction and for fault-tolerant stabilizer readout in unrotated surface codes. In this work, we investigate multiqubit Rydberg gates that are useful for fault-tolerant quantum error correction in single-species neutral-atom platforms and can be implemented with a single, non-addressed laser pulse. We develop an open-source Python package to generate analytical, few-parameter pulses that implement the desired gates while minimizing gate errors due to Rydberg-state decay. The tool also allows us to identify parameter-optimal pulses, characterized by a minimal parameter count for the pulse ansatz. Measurement-free quantum error correction protocols require CCZ gates, which we analyze for atoms arranged in symmetric and asymmetric configurations. We investigate the performance of these schemes for various single-, two-, and three-qubit gate error rates, showing that break-even performance of measurement-free QEC is within reach of current hardware. Moreover, we study Floquet quantum error correction protocols that comprise two-body stabilizer measurements. Those can be realized using global three-qubit gates, and we show that this can lead to a significant reduction in shuttling operations. Simulations with realistic circuit-level noise indicate that applying three-qubit gates for stabilizer measurements in Floquet codes can yield competitive logical qubit performance in experimentally relevant error regimes.

Abstract: The Wigner function is a well-known phase space distribution function with many applications in quantum mechanics. In this article, we consider an open quantum system consisting of a non-relativistic single particle interacting with a general, possibly relativistic environment. For this system, we derive an expression for directly computing the time-dependent Wigner function from its initial values. This result renders time-dependent Wigner functions more applicable without having to make additional approximations that would otherwise be required in order to solve the corresponding equation of motion. As an illustration of our findings, we discuss the example of a non-relativistic single scalar particle interacting via a Yukawa interaction with an environment comprising another type of scalar field that is treated relativistically.

Motivation: Data quality underpins modern decision-making in various fields, and improving anomaly detection methods is crucial. The conventional approaches for data quality enhancement, such as anomaly detection, are computationally expensive, time-consuming, and require large datasets. Therefore, exploring alternative methodologies, such as quantum computing, is essential to overcome these limitations.

Method: We propose using quantum computing for anomaly detection, focusing on quantum reservoir computing. We examine whether quantum methods can replace classical subroutines in anomaly detection frameworks to reduce computational intensity. We implement a proof-of-concept for detecting volatility regime changes in stock market data using a quantum reservoir computing model. The model uses quantum embeddings to represent data, which allows for efficient computation of correlations and patterns.

Result: Through numerical simulations and experiments, we demonstrate that our quantum-based anomaly detection method can compete with classical approaches in terms of accuracy for the specific task of detecting volatility regime changes in stock market data. Our results suggest that quantum embeddings can be a viable alternative to classical embeddings for certain applications. However, our current implementation has limitations, such as scaling to larger datasets, and requires further optimization for practical use.

Conclusion: Quantum computing offers a promising alternative to conventional methods for enhancing data quality and improving anomaly detection. Our Quantum reservoir computing model shows potential in replacing classical subroutines where computational efficiency is a concern. However, more investigation is needed to address current scalability issues and explore additional use cases in broader domains like science, politics, and economics.

Abstract: In an era where data underpins decision-making across science, politics, and economics, ensuring high data quality is of paramount importance.

We begin by examining quantum techniques that could replace key subroutines in conventional anomaly detection frameworks to mitigate their computational intensity. We then provide practical demonstrations of quantum-based anomaly detection methods, highlighting their capabilities. We present a technical implementation for detecting volatility regime changes in stock market data using quantum reservoir computing, which is a special type of quantum machine learning model. The experimental results indicate that quantum-based embeddings are a competitive alternative to classical ones in this particular example. Finally, we identify unresolved challenges and limitations in applying quantum computing to data quality tasks. Our findings open up new avenues for innovative research and commercial applications that aim to advance data quality through quantum technologies.

Abstract: Characterizing non-Markovian quantum dynamics is currently hindered by the self-inconsistency and high computational complexity of existing quantum comb tomography (QCT) methods. In this work, we propose a self-consistent framework that unifies the quantum comb, instrument set, and initial states into a single geometric entity, termed as the Comb-Instrument-State (CIS) set. We demonstrate that the CIS set naturally resides on a product Stiefel manifold, allowing the tomography problem to be solved via efficient unconstrained Riemannian optimization while automatically preserving physical constraints. Numerical simulations confirm that our approach is computationally scalable and robust against gate definition errors, significantly outperforming conventional isometry-based QCT methods. Our work indicates the potential to efficiently learn quantum comb with fewer computational resources.

Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics has emerged as a central field for understanding how energy conversion processes occur in microscopic systems. In these systems, effects such as coherence, entanglement, and non-Markovianity play key roles. In this thesis, we explore different ways to describe quantum thermodynamics, using two main approaches: one based on entropy and the other on ergotropy. First, we introduce a generalized approach to quantify non-Markovianity through the breakdown of monotonicity in thermodynamic functions. In this context, the entropy-based heat flow serves as a practical tool to witness and measure quantum memory in unital maps that do not reverse the sign of the internal energy. Next, we analyze the dynamics of ergotropy in open qubits under both Markovian and non-Markovian evolutions. We identify phenomena such as freezing and sudden death of ergotropy, and we establish an analytical relation between the change in ergotropy and the environment-induced work . This provides a clear physical interpretation for the additional term in the first law in the entropy-based formulation. Finally, we propose an ergotropy-based thermodynamic formulation, in which heat is reinterpreted in terms of the change of the passive state associated with the density operator governing the quantum dynamics. This approach allows one to measure non-Markovianity of unital maps more generally and accurately than the entropy-based heat flow. This advantage comes from the direct link between heat and von Neumann entropy, a property ensured by invariance under passive transformations. Moreover, the out-of-equilibrium temperature naturally remains non-negative, similarly to equilibrium thermodynamics.

Abstract: We provide a systematic evaluation of the sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) method for electronic structure based on the W4-11 thermochemistry dataset, comprising 124 total atomization, 83 bond dissociation, 20 isomerization, 505 heavy-atom transfer, and 13 nucleophilic substitution processes, covering diverse bonding situations and reaction mechanisms. This is the largest study assessing the accuracy and precision of a quantum-hybrid algorithm on a digital quantum device across a variety of molecular systems and chemical reactions, using 16.85 hours on the superconducting quantum processor ibm_rensselaer and 724.22 node hours on the supercomputer AiMOS. To ensure a fair comparison, our study employs commensurate resource allocation for both classical and quantum simulations. Although SQD exhibits large statistical deviations from ground-state reference energies, energy extrapolations yield CCSD-level accuracy. While bond-breaking reactions show a systematic improvement as computational resources increase, nucleophilic substitution or heavy atom transfer reactions do not. The limitations quantified in this manuscript indicate opportunities for improvement in SQD-based algorithms. This work provides a benchmark and community resource for exploring new quantum algorithms and devices, supported by an online benchmark challenge and an open-source Python library for direct comparison.

TL;DR: 分子薄膜的发射和吸收光谱受到低频分子振动的影响，这种振动决定吸收和发射光谱峰的 linewidths 以及 Stokes 移。在使用分子薄膜作为工作介质的密闭 cavity 中，低频分子振动有助于光的热化，从而实现 Bose-Einstein 凝结。通过 Lindblad 超算子的微扰理论，在光和物质的弱耦合情况下，本文推导出光的热化速率。该速率适用于任何 cavity 设计，并依赖于低频分子振动的本征特性。本文还估计了热化速率，仅需了解系统的大规模参数：光-物质相互作用强度、腔与激发子的共振频率、受照射区域中的分子数以及单分子发光光谱 0-0 峰线宽的温度依赖性。

Abstract: Emission and absorption spectra of molecular films are impacted by low-frequency molecular vibrations. These vibrations define the linewidths of the absorption and emission spectral peaks, as well as the Stokes shift. In cavities that use a molecular film as an active medium, low-frequency molecular vibrations facilitate the thermalization of light, enabling the formation of Bose-Einstein condensation. In this work, I employ perturbation theory for Lindblad superoperators and derive the contribution of the low-frequency molecular vibrations to the thermalization rate of light in a weak coupling regime between light and matter. The derived thermalization rate applies for any cavity design but depends on the local microscopic properties of low-frequency molecular vibrations. I provide an estimation for the thermalization rate, which requires only knowledge of the macroscopic parameters of the system: light-matter interaction strength, resonant frequencies of the cavity and excitons, number of molecules in the illuminated area, and the linewidth temperature dependence of the 0-0 peak in the emission spectra of standalone molecular film.

Abstract: The iconic problem of photon modes in a spherical cavity has been discussed in the literature; however, conflicting results have been reported \cite{Heitler,Davydov_QuantumMechanics}. For this reason, the solution of this problem is worked out in detail here, starting with the Maxwell equations and applying boundary conditions at the surface of the bounding perfect conductor. Contrary to the treatments in the literature \cite{Heitler,Davydov_QuantumMechanics}, the allowed frequencies for photons in the sphere are given by two different conditions, one for electric and one for magnetic multipole photons. After establishing the modes and their allowed frequencies, we write down the second-quantized vector potential in the spherical geometry. Based on these spherical modes, bipartite photon entanglement is investigated showing that there are in-principle 40 different types of entangled photon states. Finally, we include some appendices about photon plane-wave and spherical-wave helicity states, helicity spherical harmonic vectors, and rotation of the helicity states and 3-d vectors using the Wigner $D$-matrix.

Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement in two-spin-1/2 NMR systems at thermal equilibrium under external magnetic fields. We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the entanglement of the system and show how the entanglement depends on temperature and magnetic field strength, resulting in a threshold temperature beyond which entanglement vanishes. We demonstrate that at zero temperature, the system exhibits a quantum critical point, characterized by non-analytic behavior in the measure of entanglement. We further develop analytical criterion for level crossing, which serves as a condition for identifying quantum critical points in both homonuclear and heteronuclear systems, and apply it to multiple settings to analyze their quantum critical points. We establish a direct link between the quantum entanglement quantifier and experimentally accessible NMR observables, enabling entanglement to be quantified through NMR signal processing. This provides a practical framework for characterizing quantum correlations using standard NMR experiments. These findings provide insights into the thermal control of quantum features, with implications for quantum-enhanced NMR, low-temperature spectroscopy, and emerging quantum technologies.

Abstract: Quantum many-body (QMB) systems are generally computationally hard: the computing resources necessary to simulate them exactly can often exceed the existing computation resources by orders of magnitude. For this reason, Richard Feynman proposed the concept of a quantum simulator: quantum systems engineered to obey a prescribed evolution equation and repeating the experiment multiple times. Experimentally, however, as we explain below, the vast majority of observables describing the system are inaccessible. Thus, while Feynman's idea addresses the problem of simulating quantum dynamics, it leaves unsolved the equally fundamental problem of inferring the underlying physics from the limited observables accessible in experiments. Indeed, many complex phenomena associated with QMB systems remain elusive. Perhaps, the most important example is identifying phase transitions in QMB systems when no simple order-parameter exists, which poses major challenges to this day. Complicating the problem further is the fact that, in most cases, it is impossible to learn from numerical simulations, as the underlying systems are often too large to be computable, and small QMB can show strong finite size effects, masking the presence of the transition. Here, we present an unsupervised machine learning approach to study QMB experiments, specifically aimed at detecting phase transitions and crossovers directly from raw experimental measurements. We demonstrate our methodology on systems undergoing Many-Body Localization cross-over and Mott-to-Superfluid phase-transition, showing that it reveals collective phenomena from the very partial experimental data and without any model-specific prior knowledge of the system. This approach offers a general and scalable route for data-driven discovery of emergent phenomena in complex quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: We investigate quantum features and non-classical nature of two-spin-$1/2$ NMR systems at thermal equilibrium under external magnetic fields. More specifically, using suitable quantifiers, we analyze quantum coherence, mixedness, and entanglement in NMR systems and examine their features within the system. We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the quantum elements and show how they depend on temperature and magnetic field strength. We demonstrate that at zero temperature, the system exhibits a quantum critical point, characterized by non-analytic behavior in the measures of coherence, and a sharp peak in mixedness. Moreover, we analyze the entanglement of the system using a suitable entanglement witness. This provides an experimentally friendly setting for testing entanglement in NMR systems. In other words, the witness links the entanglement in the system to quantum observables, making it directly provable in NMR experiments. We establish a connection between quantum information quantifiers and experimentally accessible NMR spectra of the system, enabling the quantification of entanglement, coherence, and mixedness through NMR signal processing.

Abstract: Decision diagram (DD)-based quantum circuit simulators represent quantum states and gates using DDs, enabling memory-efficient and fast simulations for some quantum circuits like Shor. Although it is known that DD size and processing time vary depending on the variable order in classical circuits, there has not been much research on the variable order under quantum circuit simulation. One existing study pointed out that dynamic reordering worsens the simulation time and numerical accuracy, and there is no comprehensive research on static orders in the context of quantum circuit simulation. Therefore, this paper proposes a scoring-based heuristic method for determining a static variable order that enables efficient DD-based quantum circuit simulation. When applied to benchmark circuits, the default original variable orders resulted in slow simulations, whereas the proposed method achieved speedups of up to 150x. Furthermore, the proposed order completed the simulation of Shor's 1011 factorization in 5 hours on a single-core laptop, although it was not completed within two days previously.

Abstract: The exceptional point has presented considerably interesting and counterintuitive phenomena associated with nonreciprocity, precision measurement, and topological dynamics. The Liouvillian exceptional point (LEP), involving the interplay of energy loss and decoherence inherently relevant to quantum jumps, has recently drawn much attention due to capability to fully capture quantum system dynamics and naturally facilitate non-Hermitian quantum investigations. It was also predicted that quantum jumps could give rise to third-order LEPs in two-level quantum systems for its high dimensional Liouvillian superoperator, which, however, has never been experimentally confirmed until now. Here we report the first observation of the third-order LEPs emerging from quantum jumps in an ultracold two-level trapped-ion system. Moreover, by combining decay with dephasing processes, we present the first experimental exploration of LEPs involving combinatorial effect of decay and dephasing. In particular, due to non-commutativity between the Lindblad superoperators governing LEPs for decay and dephasing, we witness the movement of LEPs driven by the competition between decay and dephasing occurring in an open quantum system. This unique feature of non-Hermitian quantum systems paves a new avenue for modifying nonreciprocity, enhancing precision measurement, and manipulating topological dynamics by tuning the LEPs.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a key resource in quantum information science, playing an essential role in quantum key distribution (QKD), quantum networks, and distributed quantum computing. However, practical applications require techniques capable of reliably distributing entanglement under lossy and noisy conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple configuration using two polarization-maintaining fibers (PMFs) arranged in a cross-axis alignment enables stable distribution of entangled photon pairs without the need for real-time polarization compensation. To support this, we performed quantum information modeling and fidelity simulations for the cross-aligned PMF pair, and experimentally compared the entanglement preservation and interference fringe stability in setups based on standard single-mode fibers (SMFs) and PMFs. The experimental results show that the PMF-based configuration achieves an average visibility of 0.867 and an error propagation of 0.023 under unstable conditions, whereas the SMF setup exhibits a significantly lower stability with an average visibility of 0.444 and an error propagation of 0.167 under the same conditions. These results indicate that the cross-aligned PMF pair allows robust entanglement transmission without complex active compensation devices, suggesting its suitability for reliable quantum state distribution in long-distance quantum communication, drone-based QKD, and multi-user quantum networks.

Abstract: A laser beam is often modelled by a pure coherent state. In fact its state is mixed, even if it has coherent-state photon-number statistics (Poissonian), because the phase must vary. We consider such an ideal laser beam, with phase diffusion rate $\ell$, equal to its (Lorentzian) spectral width. We show that the beam entropy is extensive, with an entropy flow of $\dot{S} = \sqrt{\dot{N}\ell}$, where $\dot{N}$ is the number flow. We give an intuitive explanation for this remarkably simple result, and compare it to a unidirectional thermal beam.

Abstract: We consider a problem of geometric phase generation in a system of two interacting bosons confined in a narrow ring potential with a localized defect. Geometric phase emerges from variation of parameters of the defect. Particle interaction is taken into account within a framework of the Lieb-Liniger model. The energy spectrum is evaluated and its dependence on the parameters of the problem is described. It is shown that the interaction leads to increase of the geometric phase for a given contour of variations. The work is motivated by earlier proposed ideas of quantum gyroscope and quantum accelerometer based on atomic Bose-Einstein condensates.

### [58] [Data-Driven Learnability Transition of Measurement-Induced Entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01317)
*Dongheng Qian,Jing Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the experimental accessibility of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) in quantum many-body systems. Despite the computational challenge of directly calculating MIE, the authors leverage neural networks trained on measurement records to predict the MIE gap, demonstrating a learnability transition with circuit depth. Both numerical and experimental results validate this transition, highlighting the potential of data-driven methods in studying quantum correlations. The findings also clarify the practical limits of classical learnability in such systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum correlations in many-body systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. Yet, measuring these correlations remains difficult. This paper aims to explore whether MIE, a specific type of quantum correlation, can be experimentally accessed with affordable resources.

Method: The authors developed a novel approach by reframing MIE detection as a self-supervised learning problem. They trained a neural network using only measurement records, without prior knowledge of the quantum state preparation. This method overcomes the challenge of direct evaluation, which requires extensive post-selection over many measurement outcomes.

Result: The research reveals a learnability transition in quantum circuits as their depth increases. Below a certain threshold, the uncertainty in predicting the MIE gap decreases with more measurement data and model parameters. However, above this threshold, the uncertainty remains large even with increased resources. This suggests that while MIE can be predicted to some extent, beyond a specific circuit depth, it becomes challenging for classical models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that data-driven approaches, such as neural networks, demonstrate significant promise for studying complex quantum correlations like MIE. However, there are clear practical limits to this approach, particularly as the complexity of the quantum systems increases beyond a specific threshold. The findings highlight the importance of continued research into hybrid quantum-classical methods for understanding quantum many-body systems and their potential applications in quantum information science.

Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) captures how local measurements generate long-range quantum correlations and drive dynamical phase transitions in many-body systems. Yet estimating MIE experimentally remains challenging: direct evaluation requires extensive post-selection over measurement outcomes, raising the question of whether MIE is accessible with only polynomial resources. We address this challenge by reframing MIE detection as a data-driven learning problem that assumes no prior knowledge of state preparation. Using measurement records alone, we train a neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict the uncertainty metric for MIE--the gap between upper and lower bounds of the average post-measurement bipartite entanglement. Applied to random circuits with one-dimensional all-to-all connectivity and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling, our method reveals a learnability transition with increasing circuit depth: below a threshold, the uncertainty is small and decreases with polynomial measurement data and model parameters, while above it the uncertainty remains large despite increasing resources. We further verify this transition experimentally on current noisy quantum devices, demonstrating its robustness to realistic noise. These results highlight the power of data-driven approaches for learning MIE and delineate the practical limits of its classical learnability.

Conclusion: This research contributes a new class of universal quantum computation resources constructed with non-maximally entangling gates, expanding the potential for practical quantum technologies.

Abstract: Weighted graph states are a natural generalization of graph states, which are generated by applying controlled-phase gates, instead of controlled-Z gates, to a separable state. In this paper, we show that uniformly weighted graph states on a suitable planar graph constitute universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation for an arbitrary nonzero constant weight. To our knowledge, this is the first example of universal resources prepared with only non-maximally entangling gates and has potential applications to weakly interacting systems, such as photonic systems.

Conclusion: 这项突破性的方案消除了超导依赖，为大规模部署高性能SPD和推动量子通信技术商业化铺平了道路。

Abstract: High-performance single-photon detectors (SPDs) are indispensable components for quantum optical tasks. However, the reliance of state-of-the-art devices on superconducting materials imposes severe technological demands and challenging operational conditions (e.g., cryogenics), which hinder scalable commercial deployment. To address this, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detector (ESPD) framework, a novel paradigm for achieving high-performance SPDs through the iterative enhancement of low-technology SPDs. Utilizing only standard quantum optical components, the ESPD scheme transforms a legacy non-superconducting SPD, with detection efficiency (DE) about $59\%$ and dark count rate (DCR) $10^{-2}$, into a device with superior performance metrics, achieving DE higher than $95\%$ and DCR below $10^{-9}$. This level of performance is comparable to or surpasses recently designed superconducting SPDs, allowing the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols to be reduced by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the scheme's device requirements are moderate, relying on readily available current technology, which ensures near-term experimental feasibility. The ESPD framework thus provides a clear, scalable path toward the large-scale deployment of high-performance SPDs and the commercialization of quantum communication technologies.

Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have attracted intense interest, yet their many-particle counterparts remain largely unexplored in waveguide quantum electrodynamics. We identify and characterize a bound state embedded in the doublon continuum (BIDC) that emerges when four atoms couple to a coupled-resonator waveguide with strong on-site interaction. Exploiting this interaction-enabled BIDC, we show that (i) a distant, four-atom entangled state can be prepared with high fidelity, and (ii) quantum entangled states can be coherently transferred between spatially separated nodes. Our results establish a scalable mechanism for multi-particle state generation and routing in waveguide platforms, opening a route to interaction-protected quantum communication with many-particle BICs.

Our methodology employs amplitude-encoded quan- tum state preparation, multi-level QWPT feature extraction, and behavioral analysis via Shannon Entropy profiling and Chi-square testing. Features are classified using QSVM with fidelity-based quantum kernels optimized through hybrid train- ing with simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) optimizer. Evaluation under noiseless and depolarizing noise conditions demonstrates exceptional performance: 96.67% accuracy on BoT-IoT and 89.67% on IoT-23 datasets, surpassing quantum autoencoder approaches by over 7 percentage points.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种形式验证方法QVerifier，用于验证量子强化学习（QRL）策略在存在噪声条件下的安全性。通过模型构建和概率模型核查，QVerifier能够分析训练后的QRL策略，并在预部署阶段确保其安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算技术的发展，量子强化学习成为研究热点，但其在实际应用中的安全性尚未有效解决，尤其是在存在硬件噪声等不确定性因素的情况下。因此，开发有效的验证方法以确保QRL策略的安全性显得尤为重要。

Method: QVerifier通过构建策略与环境的完整模型，将量子不确定性直接整合到转移概率中，并利用Storm模型检查工具进行安全性核查。该方法结合了概率模型验证技术和量子计算特性。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子强化学习策略的安全性验证提供了一种有效的方法，特别是在量子硬件部署受限的情况下，通过预验证确保其安全性。

Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) aims to use quantum effects to create sequential decision-making policies that achieve tasks more effectively than their classical counterparts. However, QRL policies face uncertainty from quantum measurements and hardware noise, such as bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors, which can lead to unsafe behavior. Existing work offers no systematic way to verify whether trained QRL policies meet safety requirements under specific noise conditions.
  We introduce QVerifier, a formal verification method that applies probabilistic model checking to analyze trained QRL policies with and without modeled quantum noise. QVerifier builds a complete model of the policy-environment interaction, incorporates quantum uncertainty directly into the transition probabilities, and then checks safety properties using the Storm model checker.
  Experiments across multiple QRL environments show that QVerifier precisely measures how different noise models influence safety, revealing both performance degradation and cases where noise can help. By enabling rigorous safety verification before deployment, QVerifier addresses a critical need: because access to quantum hardware is expensive, pre-deployment verification is essential for any safety-critical use of QRL. QVerifier targets a potential classical-quantum sweet spot: trained QRL policies that execute efficiently on quantum hardware, yet remain tractable for classical probabilistic model checking despite being too slow for real-time classical deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算技术的快速发展，量子机器学习算法的应用前景广阔。然而，大多数量子算法对输入数据的维度有较高要求，这使得高维数据在实际应用中难以直接使用。因此，如何有效地降维以适应量子算法的需求成为关键问题。

Method: 本文通过实验研究，考察了六种传统的特征提取算法和五种基于自编码器的降维方法，将这些降维方法应用于一个包含67个特征的粒子物理数据集上。随后，使用降维后的数据训练量子支持向量机，以解决二分类问题：判断LHC proton碰撞中是否产生Higgs粒子。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子机器学习算法在高维数据上的应用提供了一种有效途径，证明了在特定领域的量子计算应用前景。

Abstract: Data sets that are specified by a large number of features are currently outside the area of applicability for quantum machine learning algorithms. An immediate solution to this impasse is the application of dimensionality reduction methods before passing the data to the quantum algorithm. We investigate six conventional feature extraction algorithms and five autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction models to a particle physics data set with 67 features. The reduced representations generated by these models are then used to train a quantum support vector machine for solving a binary classification problem: whether a Higgs boson is produced in proton collisions at the LHC. We show that the autoencoder methods learn a better lower-dimensional representation of the data, with the method we design, the Sinkclass autoencoder, performing 40% better than the baseline. The methods developed here open up the applicability of quantum machine learning to a larger array of data sets. Moreover, we provide a recipe for effective dimensionality reduction in this context.

Method: 使用量子度量空间和模糊度量空间的定义，分析Gaussian波函数在连续收缩演化中的行为。

Result: 结果表明量子度量空间的收缩映射定理适用于归一化的实值高斯波函数，而模糊度量空间则不具备这种性质。

Conclusion: 量子度量空间的结构性特征更具几何丰富性，更适合描述量子系统的动态特性。

Abstract: We prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for fixed points of contraction maps in the framework of quantum metric spaces, where distinguishability is defined by the $L^2$ norm: $d_Q(ψ_1,ψ_2) = \|ψ_1 - ψ_2\|$. The result applies to normalized real-valued Gaussian wavefunctions under continuous contractive evolution preserving the functional form. In contrast, while fuzzy metric spaces admit analogous fixed point theorems, they lack interference, phase sensitivity, and topological protection. This comparison reveals a deeper structural coherence in the quantum framework -- not merely technical superiority, but compatibility with the geometric richness of Hilbert space. Our work extends the critique of fuzzy logic into dynamical reasoning under intrinsic uncertainty.

Abstract: This PhD thesis explores the potential of quantum computing to address computational challenges in high-energy physics (HEP). As the Standard Model (SM) leaves key questions unanswered and no signs of new physics have emerged since the Higgs boson discovery, advanced experimental and computational tools become necessary. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative to classical methods, and this work investigates three main avenues where quantum algorithms can be useful in HEP research. First, we develop quantum subroutines for computing Minkowski distances and identifying maximum values in unsorted data, inserting them into clustering algorithms such as $k$-means, Affinity Propagation, and $k_T$-jet clustering. These quantum algorithms match classical performance while offering theoretical advantages when implemented on quantum hardware with qRAM. Then, we introduce a novel quantum Monte Carlo integrator, Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which combines a quantum neural network with amplitude estimation to integrate multivariate functions. QFIAE is executed on simulators and real quantum computers to evaluate Feynman loop integrals via Loop-Tree Duality, and is extended to compute (partially on hardware) a physical observable at NLO in perturbative quantum field theory. Finally, we present Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models (QCPMs) for modeling multivariate distributions, applying them to fragmentation functions of partons fragmenting into kaons and pions. These models demonstrate accurate generative and interpolation capabilities. We also show how entanglement between variables plays a key role in training, enhancing model accuracy. Overall, these results show how quantum algorithms can already tackle relevant HEP problems on current hardware, while paving the way for future fault-tolerant applications that fully exploit quantum computational advantages.

TL;DR: The paper discusses optimizing resource requirements for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) method using different transformations, symmetry-based reductions, and approximations, achieving significant reductions in qubit and gate counts for simulating molecules on quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the efficiency of quantum algorithms for simulating molecular systems is crucial for advancing fields like drug discovery and materials design, especially given the current limitations of quantum hardware.

Method: The study analyzes VQE implementations using the Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) ansatz, mapping the molecular Hamiltonian to qubit operators with the Jordan-Wigner, Bravyi-Kitaev, and Parity transformations. It evaluates Hamiltonian reduction strategies like $	ext{Z}_2$ tapering and frozen-core approximations to assess their impact on quantum resource scaling.

Result: The analysis demonstrates that combining appropriate transformations with symmetry-based reductions leads to reductions of up to approximately 50	ext% in qubit counts and up to approximately 45	imes in quantum gate counts for the studied molecular systems.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical guidance for executing chemically relevant simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) and Fault-Tolerant Application-Scalable Quantum (FASQ) systems.

Abstract: Accurate determination of ground-state energies for molecules remains a challenge in quantum chemistry and a cornerstone for progress in fields such as drug discovery and materials design. The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) represents a leading hybrid quantum-classical paradigm for addressing this challenge; however, its widespread realization is limited by noise and the restricted scalability of current quantum hardware. Achieving efficient simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and forthcoming Fault-Tolerant Application-Scalable Quantum (FASQ) systems demands a detailed understanding of how computational resources scale with molecular complexity and fermion-to-qubit encoding schemes. In this study, resource requirements for VQE implementations employing the Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) ansatz are systematically analyzed. The molecular Hamiltonian is formulated in second quantization and mapped to qubit operators through the Jordan-Wigner (JW), Bravyi-Kitaev (BK), and Parity (Pa) transformations. Hamiltonian reduction strategies, including $\mathbb{Z}_2$ tapering and frozen-core approximations, are examined to assess their effect on quantum resource scaling. The analysis reveals that appropriate transformations, when combined with symmetry-based reductions, can substantially reduce qubit counts by up to $\approx 50\%$ and quantum gate counts by up to $\approx 45\times$ for the representative set of molecular systems under study. This provides practical insights for executing chemically relevant simulations on NISQ and FASQ hardware.

Abstract: Hyperentanglement, which refers to entanglement encoded in two or more independent degrees of freedom (DOFs), is a valuable resource for the future high-capacity quantum network. Certifying hyperentanglement sources work as intended is critical for the hyperentanglement-based quantum information tasks. Self testing is the strongest certification method for quantum state and measurement under minimal assumptions, even without any knowledge of the devices' inner workings. However, the existing self testing protocols all focus on one-DOF entanglement, which cannot self test the multi-DOF entanglement. In the paper, we propose a hyperentanglement self testing framework. We take the self testing for the polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states as an example. The self testing is based on the violation of two-dimension CHSH test in each DOF independently. The two-step swap isometry circuits are proposed for self testing the entanglement in spatial-mode and polarization DOFs, respectively. All the sixteen polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states can be self tested. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework has three advantages. First, it is a general hyperentanglement self testing framework, and can be extended to self test multi-DOF hyperentanglement and multipartite hyperentanglement. Second, it can provide the robust hyperentanglement self testing and establish the relation between the lower bound of fidelity and the imperfect violation of Bell-like inequality in each DOF. Third, it is feasible with current experimental technology. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework provides a promising way to certify complex hyperentanglement sources, and has potential application in future high-capacity quantum network.

Abstract: The response of a ferrimagnetic sphere resonator to an externally applied parametric excitation is experimentally studied. Measurement results are compared with predictions derived from a theoretical model, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously occurs in quantum systems. According to this hypothesis, time evolution is governed by a modified master equation having an added nonlinear term that deterministically generates disentanglement. It is found that the disentanglement--based model is compatible with the experimental results. In particular, the model can qualitatively account for an experimentally observed instability in the system under study, which cannot be derived from any theoretical model that is based on a linear master equation.

Abstract: We introduce folded optimal transport, as a way of extending a cost or distance defined on the extreme boundary of a convex to the whole set, broadening the framework of standard optimal transport, found to be the particular case where the convex is a simplex. Relying on Choquet's theory and standard optimal transport, we introduce the so-called folded Kantorovitch cost and folded Wasserstein distance, and study the metric properties it provides to the convex. We then apply the construction to the quantum setting, and obtain an actual separable quantum Wasserstein distance on the set of density matrices from a distance on the set of pure states, closely related to the semi-distance of Beatty and Stilck-França [3], and of which we obtain a variety of properties. Folded optimal transport provides a unified setting for both classical and separable quantum optimal transport, and we also find that the semiclassical Golse-Paul [12] cost writes as a folded Kantorovitch cost.

Abstract: Simulating many-body open quantum systems is an extremely challenging problem, with methods often restricted to either models with nearest-neighbor interactions or semi-classical approximations. In particular, modeling two-dimensional systems with realistic long-range interactions, in addition to dissipation, is of vital importance to the development of modern quantum computing and simulation platforms. In this paper, we present a construction of the time-evolution operator, as a projected entangled pair operator (denoted tePEPO), that can be used to evolve a tensor network ansatz through time. Interactions beyond nearest-neighbor, including interactions between sites not collinear in the lattice, can be represented efficiently as a tePEPO. Furthermore, we obtain approximations to realistic radial long-range interactions decaying with a power-law, that give accurate results with small tePEPO bond dimension. Finally, we consider a physical example of a Rydberg atom Hamiltonian with long-range dipolar interactions, and show evidence of a dipole-dipole blockading effect in presence of dissipation. This work demonstrates the applicability of tensor networks to two-dimensional systems widely studied in experiments, but previously inaccessible to non-semi-classical methods.

Abstract: Quantum state preparation (QSP) for a general $n$-qubit state requires $O(2^n)$ CNOT gates and circuit depth, making exact amplitude encoding (EAE) impractical for near-term quantum hardware. We introduce an ancilla-free hybrid classical-quantum strategy that reduces this cost to $O(poly(n))$ for a broad class of compressible data. The method first applies a classical compression step to obtain a $d$-sparse representation of the input, loads this sparse vector using a sparse-state preparation routine, and then reconstructs the target state through a polynomial-depth quantum inverse transform. We evaluate the framework on synthetic benchmark signals and real biomedical time series using Fourier and Haar transforms, demonstrating substantial reductions in CNOT counts and circuit depth compared to EAE, together with competitive performance relative to the Fourier Series Loader (FSL). The quantum simulation results show that combining classical data compression with quantum decompression provides a scalable framework for efficient QSP, reducing quantum overhead without requiring variational training or ancillary registers.

Abstract: Scalable quantum computing requires architectural solutions beyond monolithic processors. Distributed quantum computing (DQC) addresses this challenge by interconnecting smaller quantum nodes through quantum communication protocols, enabling collaborative computation. While several experimental and theoretical proposals for DQC exist, emulator platforms are essential tools for exploring their feasibility under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate DQC emulators using a distributed implementation of the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform ($\mathrm{QFT}^{\dagger}$) as a representative test case, which enables efficient phase recovery from pre-encoded Fourier states. The QFT is partitioned across nodes using teleportation-based protocols, and performance is analyzed in terms of execution time, memory usage, and fidelity with respect to a monolithic baseline.
  As part of this work, we review a broad range of emulators, identifying their capabilities and limitations for programming distributed quantum algorithms. Many platforms either lacked support for teleportation protocols or required complex workarounds. Consequently, we select and benchmark four representative emulators: Qiskit Aer, SquidASM, Interlin-q, and SQUANCH. They differ significantly in their support for discrete-event simulation, quantum networking, noise modeling, and parallel execution. Our results highlight the trade-offs between architectural fidelity and simulation scalability, providing a foundation for future emulator development and the validation of distributed quantum protocols. This framework can be extended to support additional algorithms and emulators.

Abstract: Identification in quantum communication enables receivers to verify the presence of a message without decoding its entire content. While identification capacity has been explored for classical and finite-dimensional quantum channels, its behaviour in bosonic systems remains less understood. This work analyses identification over noisy bosonic broadcast channels using coherent states. We derive achievable identification rate regions while ensuring error probabilities remain bounded, even in an infinite-dimensional setting. Our approach leverages quantum hypothesis testing and approximates the infinite sender alphabet with discrete subsets to maintain power constraints.

Abstract: We refine a fluctuation-dissipation framework for quantum dynamical semigroups to resolve a long-standing ambiguity in Markovian master equations. For finite-dimensional systems, we prove that the underlying diffusion-dissipation structure - rooted in a classical Markov process analogy - is invariant under Lindblad generator symmetries. This invariance uniquely identifies the internal Hamiltonian. Our framework provides a universal principle for objectively distinguishing coherent from incoherent parts of the dynamics, enabling an unambiguous determination of a system's inherent energy structure.

Abstract: We extend the framework of quantum pushforward designs to the approximate setting, where averaging is achieved only up to finite precision. Using Schatten $p$-norms and Lipschitz continuity arguments, we derive bounds on the approximation parameters of pushforward designs obtained from complex projective spaces, including simplices, mixed states, and quantum channels. In the mixed-state case, we refine the bounds by exploiting the symmetric subspace structure, leading to asymptotically tighter estimates. Numerical simulations support our theoretical results, showing near-optimality in low-dimensional scenarios.

It supports next-generation computing architectures that provide improved scalability and enhanced computational efficiency. Within these architectures, the decimal adder is a key arithmetic component, particularly for Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) operations widely used in financial and commercial systems. However, most reversible BCD adders focus primarily on quantum and reversible metrics, overlooking the critical influence of delay, which makes balanced optimization a significant challenge. This paper presents two reversible BCD adder designs optimized for both delay and quantum cost. One design integrates the decimal carry-skip technique to improve the overall delay. Using reversible logic gates, the proposed architectures efficiently perform BCD addition and implement the required correction logic while maintaining full reversibility. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed designs surpass existing reversible BCD adders, achieving best-case average improvements of 85.12% in delay and 30.75% in quantum cost. These advancements demonstrate the potential of the proposed adders for integration into future quantum-based arithmetic units and scalable reversible computing systems. Moreover, analysis of real banking transaction data underscores the practical importance of BCD addition and its widespread use in accurate and efficient monetary computations.

Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，大规模量子设备的制造面临诸多挑战，特别是在量子位和连接器等关键组件可能存在故障的情况下，如何提高产量和降低成本变得至关重要。

Method: ACID框架基于无 Ancilla（中段）范式，在存在缺陷的量子位和连接器的情况下，自动合成高效的综合征提取电路。通过构建并求解优化问题，ACID能够在不指定特定测量辅量子位的情况下，灵活选择数据量子位来实现综合征提取。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了ACID框架的有效性，特别是在提高量子芯片利用率方面，为大规模量子计算提供了重要工具。这些成果将有助于开发更可靠的实用量子系统。

Abstract: Utility-scale solid-state quantum devices will need to fabricate quantum devices at scale using imperfect processes. By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving. The yield of surface code chips with a logical error rate at most $10\times$ the dropout-free baseline is up to $3\times$ higher using ACID than using LUCI. I demonstrate the broad applicability of ACID by compiling syndrome extraction circuits for bivariate bicycle codes and the colour code. For these circuits, we incur a circuit-depth overhead of between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $2.5\times$ relative to defect-free circuits. I believe this work is the first to simulate both of these families of codes in the presence of fabrication defects.

Abstract: Probabilistic error cancellation is an attempt to reverse the effect of dissipative noise channels on quantum computers by applying unphysical channels after the execution of a quantum algorithm on noisy hardware. We investigate on general grounds the properties of such unphysical quantum channels by considering a random matrix ensemble modeling noisy quantum algorithms. We show that the complex spectra of denoiser channels inherit their structure from random Lindbladians. Additional structure imposed by the locality of noise channels of the quantum computer emerges in terms of a hierarchy of timescales.

Abstract: We present a seven-pronged no-go result for quantum mechanics: a "heptalemma". It shows that seven initially plausible theses about physical reality are jointly inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics, while any six are jointly consistent. We must then decide which theses to retain and which to give up. Since different interpretations of quantum mechanics entail different responses to the heptalemma, we get a novel taxonomy of such interpretations. Beyond the application to quantum mechanics, the heptalemma offers a general diagnostic criterion for determining whether a given scientific domain should count as classical or not, and if not, how it departs from classicality.

Abstract: The generation of engineered quantum states of light via nonlinear processes is fundamental for quantum technologies based on photons. Although embedding nonlinear materials within resonant structures allows for the enhancement and tailoring of photon properties, accurately modeling these quantum interactions remains a challenge. In this work, we apply the asymptotic-fields formalism, an approach based on scattering theory, to describe nonlinear optical processes within a Fabry-Pérot cavity. Unlike previous applications of this formalism, we explicitly account for reflections in the system. We derive the interaction Hamiltonian and calculate photon-pair generation rates using perturbation theory. The versatility of this model is illustrated through three examples: (i) spontaneous parametric down-conversion in an idealized cavity with flat-response mirrors; (ii) the generation of counter-propagating photon pairs in a periodically-poled material; and (iii) spontaneous four-wave mixing in a cavity built with Bragg reflectors.

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: A study shows that mechanical stress floppy red blood cell membrane can be influenced by ATP-dependent fluctuations, and a new method using optical tweezers is used to measure membrane forces and displacements in individual RBCs, which can differentiate between metabolic and structural states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how mechanical stress influences the elasticity of red blood cell (RBC) membranes is important for circulatory health. ATP-driven fluctuations in RBCs are a sign of their mechanical and metabolic states. However, existing techniques to measure forces and energy consumption are often too invasive. Hence, the motivation is to find a less invasive method to study these fluctuations and energetic costs.

Method: A new method was developed using bead-free, low-power optical tweezers combined with high-speed video microscopy to simultaneously track local membrane forces and displacements in single RBCs. This method enabled the construction of a mechano-dynamic phase space for RBCs under different treatments, allowing the differentiation of metabolic and structural states based on fluctuation-force signatures.

Result: The results demonstrated that membrane softening enhances fluctuations and increases energy dissipation. The proposed optical tweezers methodology provides a robust framework for mapping the active mechanics of living cells, which can be useful for studying cellular physiology and detecting biomechanical dysfunction in diseases.

Conclusion: This study presents an innovative non-invasive method to measure membrane forces and displacements in RBCs. The findings enhance our understanding of how mechanical stress affects RBC elasticity and provide a tool for assessing biomechanical function in various cellular states and diseases.

Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) sustain mechanical stresses associated with microcirculatory flow through ATP-driven plasma membrane flickering. This is an active phenomenon driven by motor proteins that regulate interactions between the spectrin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer; it is manifested in RBC shape fluctuations reflecting the cell's mechanical and metabolic state. Yet, direct quantification of the forces and energetic costs underlying this non-equilibrium behavior remains challenging due to the invasiveness of existing techniques. Here, a minimally invasive method that combines bead-free, low-power optical tweezers with high-speed video microscopy was employed to track local membrane forces and displacements in single RBCs during the same time window. This independent dual-channel measurement enabled the construction of a mechano-dynamic phase space for RBCs under different chemical treatments, that allowed for differentiating between metabolic and structural states based on their fluctuation-force signatures. Quantification of mechanical work during flickering demonstrated that membrane softening enhanced fluctuations while elevating energy dissipation. The proposed optical tweezers methodology provides a robust framework for mapping the active mechanics of living cells, enabling precise probing of cellular physiology and detection of biomechanical dysfunction in diseases.

Conclusion:  本研究为设计具有强设计能力和高调制精度的基因电路提供了可选方案，突出了在生物合成系统中实现精确控制空间模式的思路。

Abstract: Controlling spatial patterns in synthetic biological systems remains challenging due to poor parameter robustness and limited experimental tunability. We introduce two complementary mechanisms-the pattern switch and the pattern dial-to systematically control Turing pattern formation in gene circuits. The switch toggles pattern onset via a single parameter, while the dial enables transitions between distinct pattern types using weakly nonlinear amplitude equations. Analyzing network size reveals a key trade-off: small networks are easier to control but less robust, while larger networks gain robustness at the cost of tunability-suggesting a sweet spot for both evolvability and designability. Our results offer practical design rules for engineering programmable patterns in living systems.

Abstract: We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution surrounded by a cloud of strings and immersed in an electromagnetic universe. By deriving the event horizon from the lapse function, we demonstrate that both the string cloud parameter and the electromagnetic background parameter significantly modify the horizon radius compared to the Schwarzschild case. Consequently, thermodynamic quantities-including the Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and heat capacity-become explicit functions of these additional parameters, with the heat capacity exhibiting divergences that signal phase transitions. We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing phenomena by deriving the deflection angle for both massive particles and photons using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem applied to the optical geometry. The results exhibit notable deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry, with the string cloud enhancing the deflection through a $(1-α)^{-1}$ factor while the electromagnetic parameter introduces competing corrections at second order.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes following the magnetic reconnection process. The parameter space regions that satisfy the energy extraction condition, as well as the efficiency and power of the extracted energy, are analyzed. The study shows that the presence of a negative cosmological constant extends the range of dominant reconnection radial locations where the energy extraction condition is met, and enables energy extraction even from black holes with relatively low spin. Furthermore, the influence of the negative cosmological constant on energy extraction is modulated by the extent of the dominant reconnection radial region: a more negative cosmological constant enhances the extracted energy, efficiency, and power, particularly for smaller dominant reconnection radii. These results demonstrate that the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes is more favorable than that from their asymptotically flat counterparts. Our results highlight the crucial role of the cosmological constant in energy extraction via magnetic reconnection.

Abstract: Whilst most of the binary configurations in modified theories of gravity are studied under quasi-circular orbit limit, eccentricity effects could play a significant role in future gravitational wave detections. We derive the gravitational radiation-reaction force for nonspinning eccentric orbits within the effective-one-body (EOB) description for the massless scalar-tensor theories up to 1.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. The effects in such theories start at $1/c^3$ and interestingly, the 1.5PN order effect is due to the radiation reaction square effects which is a conservative effect. The results derived here can be implemented in the quasi-circular EOB-based waveform models to construct waveform templates for generic orbit binaries within massless scalar-tensor theories of gravity.

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to compute the asymptotic charges of a vacuum solution to the Einstein field equations describing a naked singularity with a non-vanishing quadrupole moment, known in the literature as the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime (q-metric). In addition to the well-known asymptotic quantities such as the Bondi-Sachs energy-momentum, the BMS charges and NP constants of this spacetime are computed. Explicit calculations of the latter are relatively scarce in the literature. Moreover, it has been proven that the NP constants of asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and algebraically special spacetimes vanish (for instance, those of the Kerr spacetime). A by-product of the present analysis is to show that the algebraically special condition in the aforementioned result appears to be crucial, since the q-metric provides a counterexample to the conjecture that all asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and asymptotically algebraically special spacetimes (a weaker version of the algebraically special condition) have vanishing NP constants.

Abstract: Horizon-scale images of black holes provide a potential probe of fundamental physics, including tests of gravity and black hole hair. To assess the impact of scalar hair on accretion-flow imaging self-consistently, we construct an analytical model of a geometrically thick, magnetized disk around a rotating hairy black hole in Horndeski theory and analyze its 230 GHz image morphology. We find that scalar hair modestly alters the inflow and magnetic-field structure but strengthens gravitational redshift, markedly reducing the total flux and lensed ring brightness through relativistic transfer and spectral-shift effects. Moreover, we highlight a previously unexplored channel: the maximum interferometric diameter of the first photon ring responds strongly to the hair parameter but shows little dependence on accretion-flow details, making it a promising observable for constraining black-hole hair with future space-based interferometry.

Abstract: We construct a new non-singular cosmological model matched to a Minkowski-core regular black hole by means of a modified Oppenheimer--Snyder framework. Its dynamics is studied in both dust-only and scalar-field scenarios, and compared with that of two other non-singular models as well as the classical standard cosmology. The results show that, although all three non-singular cosmologies share identical late-time behavior and allow for a natural embedding of inflation in the scalar-field setting, they exhibit qualitatively distinct non-singular features at very early times. In particular, the new cosmology approaches Minkowski spacetime in the limits of both the infinite past and the infinite future, thereby manifesting an intriguing symmetry between the two asymptotic regimes.

Abstract: Fermions are coupled to the Einstein-Cartan system in the canonical formulation, including the cosmological, the Barbero-Immirzi, and the non-minimal coupling constants. The resulting ten first-class constraints generate gauge transformations that are on-shell equivalent to spacetime diffeomorphisms and SL(2,C) transformations. The gravitational second-class constraints receive fermionic contributions, which can be implemented by use of Dirac brackets or by solving them directly. Furthermore, we identify new fermionic (second-class) constraints that are necessary to recover the Dirac-fermion theory by relating the momenta to the configuration variables on dynamical solutions; this fermionic phase-space reduction is accomplished by use of corresponding Dirac brackets. The theory remains well-defined off the second-class constraint surfaces with ten additional degrees of freedom - six of which are gravitational and the remaining four are fermionic. Discrete (CPT) symmetries as well as implications for canonical quantization and modified theories of gravity with fermions are discussed.

### [96] [Geometric Constraints on Quantum Gravity-Inspired Dispersion Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00933)
*Gines R. Perez Teruel*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: In loop quantum gravity (LQG), modified dispersion relations (MDRs) are generated through various mechanisms like polymeric, holonomy, inverse-triad, and semiclassical corrections. These MDRs come in logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric, or non-analytic forms, often beyond standard effective field theory (EFT) capabilities. The paper employs a geometric framework from Ref.~	extcite{GRP} to examine the intrinsic curvature of the energy-momentum surfaces of these MDRs. Negative curvature ensures hyperbolicity and stable propagation, while changes in curvature sign or critical points may indicate instabilities or new invariant scales. The analysis shows that all major MDRs from LQG remain strictly hyperbolic across the relevant energy range. Furthermore, these geometric criteria provide universal constraints on logarithmic, exponential, and trigonometric MDRs beyond EFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper delves into the intricate topic of modified dispersion relations (MDRs) within the framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG). Understanding the nature of MDRs and their implications on the structure of spacetime is crucial for reconciling quantum mechanics with general relativity. The authors aim to explore how these modifications affect the stability and propagation properties of quantum gravitational systems, potentially offering insights into the early universe or quantum gravity phenomena.

Method: The authors employ a geometric approach utilizing the framework outlined in Ref.~	extcite{GRP} to analyze the intrinsic curvature of energy-momentum surfaces associated with various MDRs. This method allows them to assess the hyperbolicity of the system and identify potential instabilities or invariant scales. By applying this framework to MDRs derived in LQG, they systematically evaluate the behavior of these relations across the relevant energy range.

Result: Through their geometric analysis, the authors demonstrate that all significant MDRs originating from LQG maintain a strictly hyperbolic structure throughout the energy range of interest. There are no elliptic patches or critical points within this range, suggesting uniform stability. Additionally, the study provides universal constraints on logarithmic, exponential, and trigonometric MDR forms beyond the scope of effective field theory. This finding underscores the consistency and robustness of MDRs emerging from LQG, offering a unified perspective on their stability and invariant scales.

Conclusion: The paper conclusively establishes that MDRs from LQG exhibit robust hyperbolic behavior, ensuring stable and consistent propagation across all relevant energies. The geometric framework provides a universal method to assess the stability and identify invariant scales of MDRs. This work not only strengthens the theoretical foundation of LQG but also highlights the importance of geometric criteria in evaluating quantum gravitational effects, paving the way for future explorations in this complex field of study.

Abstract: Modified dispersion relations (MDRs) arise in many quantum-gravity approaches, often in non-polynomial or non-analytic form beyond the reach of effective field theory (EFT). Logarithmic, exponential and trigonometric MDRs appear in causal set theory, nonlocal gravity and $κ$-Poincaré models, while Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) yields polymeric (sine), holonomy, inverse-triad and semiclassical corrections. Using the geometric framework of Ref.~\cite{GRP}, we analyse the intrinsic curvature of the associated energy--momentum surfaces, where negative curvature ensures hyperbolic and stable propagation, and curvature sign changes or critical points indicate kinematical instabilities or new invariant scales. We apply this method exhaustively to all major MDRs derived in LQG and find that they remain strictly hyperbolic in the entire phenomenologically relevant regime, with no elliptic patches or critical branching. The same framework provides universal constraints on representative logarithmic, exponential and trigonometric MDRs beyond EFT. Thus, geometric criteria yield a unified and coordinate-independent assessment of stability, thresholds and invariant scales, and demonstrate the robustness of MDRs emerging from LQG.

Abstract: We revisit an analytical approximation scheme for computing nonlinearity ratios involving quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs). We compute these ratios for the general case when the QQNM is not one of the linear QNMs, for the $(l,m)$ channel $(2,2) \times (2,2) \to (4,4)$. We find an excellent match with numerical simulations. We also discuss where and why the method can fail, for example, for the channel $(2,0) \times (2,0) \to (2,0)$ where we can only get crude estimates for the nonlinearity ratio. Motivated by recent studies on nonlinear ringdown at the horizon, we also compute the nonlinearity ratios at the horizon. We find that the ratio both at the horizon and infinity is insensitive to different choices of regularization of the source term in the second order perturbations. We also discuss amplitudes of QQNMs sourced by linear overtones. Finally, we discuss the issues that must be resolved within this method to do precision analysis of nonlinear ringdown.

Abstract: We study the scattering of boson-star binaries, taking into account three effects: point-mass gravitational, tidal, and short-range scalar-field interactions. We compare analytic results to the scattering angle extracted from four sequences of numerical-relativity simulations at fixed energy and varying impact parameter. The very good agreement exhibits the attractive (repulsive) effect of in-phase (out-of-phase) binaries, wich dominates at small impact parameters. We thus obtain the first effective-one-body potential, central for the construction of analytic gravitational-wave templates.

Abstract: Within Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theory, we consider a wormhole solution supported by a complex non-phantom spinor field with a bare mass of the order of the Planck mass (which provides a nontrivial spacetime topology and an intrinsic angular momentum), an electric field (which provides a charge of the system), and a magnetic field. This solution describes an asymmetric wormhole connecting two different asymptotically flat spacetimes (two universes) in which there are in general different observed masses and charges. It is shown that, by suitably adjusting the values of free system parameters, at one end of the wormhole, one can obtain the values of the observed mass and charge typical of the Standard Model particles, whereas at the other end of the wormhole these physical quantities acquire the Planck values. Such a configuration incarnates Wheeler's idea of ``mass without mass'' and ``charge without charge'', and can be thought of as a model of a classical charge possessing a spin.

Conclusion: 材料模型为视界观测提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Based on two distinct thick accretion flow disk models, such as a phenomenological RIAF-like model and an analytical Hou disk model, we investigate the impact of relevant parameters on the visual characteristics of the Schwarzschild black hole (BH) surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). We impose a general relativistic radiative transfer equation to determine the synchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images. In the RIAF-like model, we notice that the corresponding photon ring and central dark region are expanded with the aid of the PFDM parameter $η$, with brightness asymmetries originating at higher inclination angles and closely tied to flow dynamics and emission anisotropy. The fundamental difference between isotropic and anisotropic radiation is that anisotropy introduces vertical distortions in the higher-order images, resulting in an elliptical appearance. For the Hou disk model, the observed images produce narrower rings and dark interiors, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution and changes with the variations of the inclination angle and PFDM parameter $η$, which reflects the spacetime signature. All these results indicate that the observed intensity and polarization characteristics in the framework of thick disk models may serve as valuable probes of underlying spacetime geometry and the accretion-dynamics close to the horizon.

TL;DR: The Kiselev black hole solution may be unstable against brane nucleation instability if dark energy is not isotropic and the actual cosmological constant is negative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between black holes, dark energy, and the cosmological constant is crucial in theoretical physics and cosmology.

Method: The analysis involves considering the properties of dark energy fluid, evaluating its impact on the Kiselev solution, and assessing stability against specific instabilities.

Result: The study concludes that the Kiselev solution is likely unstable due to brane nucleation instability, which undermines its validity as a description of black holes in a dark energy environment.

Conclusion: This finding supports the idea that solutions like the Kiselev black hole need revision based on more accurate models of dark energy and its effects on spacetime.

Abstract: While the Kiselev black hole solution does not describe a perfect fluid quintessence, it is possible that dark energy fluid is not isotropic, and so one may hope that the solution may still describe at least locally a black hole embedded in such a dark energy fluid environment. Taking into account that the accelerated expansion of the Universe is caused by a dynamical dark energy fluid, and the actual underlying cosmological constant is negative as has been sometimes suggested, we show that the Kiselev solution is untenable as it is unstable against brane nucleation instability.

Motivation: The study is motivated by recent research in dark energy and modified Chaplygin gas models, aiming to explore their compatibility with astronomical observations.

Method: The authors utilize the generalized second law of thermodynamics, employ holographic principles, fit model parameters using observational datasets (Stern, BAO, CMB), and validate the model's consistency with supernova data.

Result: The model parameters $(B_{0}, Ω_{bhd0})$ are determined, and the best-fit distance modulus matches SNe Ia data, indicating a viable cosmological model.

Conclusion: The reconstruction successfully integrates theoretical aspects with observational data, offering a plausible framework for dark energy studies.

Abstract: In the current study, we have reconstructed variable modified Chaplygin gas in the Barrow holographic dark energy framework motivated by many recent studies. We have validated the generalized second law of thermodynamics for the reconstructed model. The permissible values of the reconstructed model have been determined by the recent astrophysical and cosmological observational data. The Hubble parameter is presented in terms of the observable parameters and redshift $z$ and other model parameters. From the Stern data set and joint data set of Stern with BAO and CMB observations, the bounds of the model parameters $(B_{0}, Ω_{bhd0})$ are obtained by the $χ^{2}$ minimization procedure. The best-fit value of the distance modulus $μ(z)$ against redshift $z$ is obtained for the reconstructed model and it is consistent with the SNe Ia union2 sample data.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the accretion of generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) onto cosmological black holes, focusing on a matter-dominated era and a de Sitter era. Using the McVittie metric, the study incorporates the backreaction of accretion on the black hole's metric and derives expressions for the black hole's mass evolution and apparent horizons. Accretion is shown to begin at specific times, with longer delays in epochs with more matter available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how cosmic fluids accrete onto black holes is essential for studying the interplay between dark energy and black hole growth, particularly in the context of the accelerating universe.

Method: The authors employ the McVittie metric to describe a black hole in an expanding universe. Using a perturbative approach, they derive equations for black hole mass and apparent horizons during accretion and analyze the process in both matter-dominated and de Sitter eras.

Result: Accretion begins later in matter-dominated epochs with more available matter. The derived expressions for mass and horizons offer insights into how dark energy influences black hole growth across different epochs.

Conclusion: The study bridges cosmology and black hole physics by analyzing accretion mechanisms of GCG, providing foundational models for studying dark energy effects on black holes.

Abstract: We study the accretion of cosmic dark fluids, responsible for driving the accelerated expansion of the universe, onto cosmologically coupled black holes. More specifically, we focus on the accretion of the Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG). To incorporate the global features of the GCG into this analysis, we employ the McVittie metric, which describes a black hole embedded in an expanding cosmological background. Within this framework, accretion is studied while consistently accounting for the backreaction on the metric components. Using a perturbative approach, we derive an expression for the effective black hole mass and for the evolution of both the black hole and cosmological apparent horizons under accretion. The analysis is performed in two distinct cosmological regimes: first, a matter-dominated era, and subsequently, a de Sitter era. In both cases, it is possible to determine analytically the instant in which accretion begins. For the matter-dominated era, the analytical expression shows that the greater the amount of matter available for accretion, the longer the accretion takes to start.

Abstract: Binary black hole hyperbolic encounters represent a dynamical interaction in which two black holes undergo a close fly-by, emitting gravitational-wave bremsstrahlung in the form of a short-duration, single-cycle transient. These events are expected to occur in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters and both active and quiescent galactic nuclei. In this work, we constrain the detection sensitivity for hyperbolic encounters of black hole pairs with a range of asymmetric masses. We employ BayesWave, a wavelet-based morphology-independent algorithm to characterize hyperbolic encounter waveforms in simulated detector noise; for this study, we explore the use of exponential shapelets. We find that a typical hyperbolic orbit with total mass $20 M_{\odot}$ can be detected up to distance $d_L \sim 40 - 200$ Mpc, and we forecast the possibility of detection by ground-based current and future gravitational wave interferometers.

Abstract: Spacetime singularities pose a fundamental challenge to classical and quantum gravity. We develop a mathematically consistent framework for signature-changing black holes by revisiting the $(2+1)$-dimensional BTZ metric, which undergoes a Lorentzian-to-Euclidean transition at the horizon. We identify and resolve a critical inconsistency in previous regularization schemes concerning second-order distributional terms $\varepsilon''(r)$, introducing a \emph{modified Hadamard regularization} that is rigorously defined within distribution theory. This yields a vacuum solution without surface layers or impulsive waves. Geodesic analysis shows that infalling observers require infinite proper time to reach the horizon, and curvature remains finite everywhere. Furthermore, we establish the physical viability of the solution by proving its linear stability, demonstrating consistent quantum scalar field propagation across the horizon, and reinterpreting the $r=0$ singularity as a removable topological boundary. Our work places signature change and the associated \emph{atemporality} on a solid foundation as a robust mechanism for singularity resolution.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We analyze the infrared structure and memory effects of a massless vector tensor theory with non minimal curvature coupling in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Using Bondi Sachs expansions, we identify the independent radiative data and derive the effective Bondi mass aspect, whose balance law receives an additional positive definite flux from the vector sector. This leads to modified displacement, spin, and center of mass memory (CM) expressions, where the gravitational contributions retain their General Relativity (GR) form and the vector field enters only through well defined flux terms. We also describe persistent vector memory effects associated with the leading angular vector mode, which are gauge invariant but do not affect the leading tidal observables. The BMS transformations act kinematically as in GR. Tensor vacua remain supertranslation degenerate, whereas the vector vacuum, defined by the vanishing vector field, is nondegenerate. All results reduce continuously to GR when the coupling is removed, isolating the precise channels through which vector curvature interactions modify the infrared dynamics.

Abstract: In a spacetime $(\mathcal{M},g)$, a horizon is a null hypersurface where the deformation tensor $\mathcal{K}:=£_ηg$ of a null and tangent vector $η$ satisfies certain restrictions. In this work, we develop a formalism to study the geometry of \textit{general} horizons (i.e. characterized by any $\mathcal{K}$), based on encoding the zeroth and first transverse derivatives of $\mathcal{K}$ on null hypersurfaces detached from any ambient spacetime. We introduce the notions of \textit{$\mathcal{K}$-tuple} and \textit{non-isolation tensor}. The former encodes the order zero of $\mathcal{K}$, while the latter is a symmetric $2$-covariant tensor that codifies the ``degree of isolation" of a horizon. In particular, the non-isolation tensor vanishes for homothetic, Killing and isolated horizons. As an application we derive a \textit{generalized near-horizon equation}, i.e., an identity that holds on any horizon (regardless of its topology or whether it contains fixed points), which relates the non-isolation tensor, a certain torsion one-form, and curvature terms. By restricting this equation to a cross-section one can recover the near-horizon equation of isolated horizons and the master equation of multiple Killing horizons. Our formalism allows us to prove two existence theorems for horizons. Specifically, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a non-degenerate totally geodesic horizon with any prescribed non-isolation tensor to be embeddable in a spacetime satisfying any (non-necessarily $Λ$-vacuum) field equations. We treat first the case of arbitrary topology, and then show how the result can be strengthened when the horizon admits a cross-section.

Abstract: It is believed that rays bent inside and outside photon spheres could affect partially the black hole shadow images by the Event Horizon Telescope and the rays near photon spheres would be detected by near-future space observations. The features of the rays near the photon spheres in not only black hole spacetimes but also exotic spacetimes would be important since one will need them to exclude black-hole mimickers. The deflection angles of the rays deflected by photon spheres diverge logarithmically and we can treat them by a strong-deflection-limit analysis. The error of the strong-deflection-limit analysis becomes large if antiphoton spheres exist in the spacetimes and the analysis breaks down when the photon spheres and the antiphoton spheres degenerate to form a marginally unstable photon sphere. This is because the deflection angles of the rays bent by the marginally unstable photon sphere diverge in powers. In this paper, we extend Eiroa, Romero, and Torres's method to gravitational lensing of rays inside and outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a general, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically-flat spacetime in strong deflection limits and we apply it to a Reissner-Nordström spacetime and a Hayward spacetime with the marginally unstable photon sphere. We have also confirmed that the deflection angles in the strong deflection limits by the method converge correctly to the deflection angle without approximations, while there are the mismatches of the coefficient of the power-divergent term of the deflection angles of the rays deflected just outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a semi-analytic calculation by the author previously.

*Hui-Fa Liu,Qi Su,Ding-fang Zeng*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores the role of boundary conditions in determining black hole perturbations, specifically for RN-AdS black holes. The authors propose a new boundary condition, PFV, requiring both metric and electromagnetic perturbations to vanish at the boundary. This leads to different boundary conditions for odd and even parity modes, resulting in new quasinormal frequencies. The PFV condition can be applied to other similar systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper’s motivation appears to stem from the successful application of specific boundary conditions (non-deformation of boundary metric and vanishing of energy flux) for single-field perturbations, aiming to extend this to multifield systems in AdS spacetimes.

Method: The authors introduced the PFV condition, translated it into master function boundary conditions (Dirichlet for odd, Robin for even parity modes), then computed quasinormal frequencies using these boundary conditions. They also mention potential applications to other multifield systems.

Result: The study identifies new spectral features in the quasinormal frequencies of RN-AdS black holes. The PFV condition is shown to be applicable to other multifield perturbation systems in asymptotically AdS spacetimes.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a new boundary condition for studying perturbations of RN-AdS black holes and suggests its broader applicability. It provides a framework for future studies involving multifield systems in AdS spacetimes.

Abstract: Boundary conditions play a key role in determining the perturbation behavior of a black hole. Motivated by two guiding principles for single-field perturbations -- the non-deformation of the boundary metric and the vanishing of electromagnetic energy flux at the AdS boundary -- we impose a boundary condition for Reissner-Nordström-AdS (RN-AdS) black holes requiring both the metric and electromagnetic field-strength perturbations to vanish at the AdS boundary, which we term the physical field-vanishing (PFV) condition. Using the formulas for perturbation reconstruction, we translate the PFV condition into boundary conditions on the master functions: Dirichlet-type for odd-parity modes and Robin-type for even-parity modes. With these boundary conditions, we compute the quasinormal frequencies of RN-AdS black holes and identify new spectral features. The PFV prescription introduced here could be applied to other multifield perturbation systems in asymptotically AdS spacetimes.

TL;DR: The paper presents three models of compact stellar objects as alternatives to black holes, incorporating a quantum core and avoiding classical singularities.

Lower energy scales may reveal observable evidence of non-classical gravity through stellar objects with Earth and Sun-like masses. The findings suggest potential experimental tests involving neutron stars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The author investigates the theoretical implications of quantum gravity, particularly focusing on compact stellar objects. The motivation stems from the desire to understand how quantum effects can modify classical gravitational singularities and how these modified models could potentially be observed in nature.

Method: The paper presents theoretical models using general relativity combined with quantum mechanical principles, incorporating a noncommutative parameter to modify the properties of compact stellar objects. The analysis likely involves mathematical derivations and comparisons with known neutron star properties to assess the viability of these models for observational detection.

Result: The models presented in the paper successfully avoid classical singularities and introduce a noncommutative parameter that influences stellar properties. The models suggest the existence of exotic stellar objects with Earth and Sun-like masses that lack classical counterparts. Additionally, the findings imply that lower energy scales may allow for the detection of these quantum gravitational effects, providing the first experimental evidence of non-classical gravity.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper proposes that quantum gravitational effects could lead to observable stellar objects with Earth and Sun-like masses. The models provide promising avenues for future research to understand the interplay between quantum gravity and stellar evolution, enhancing our understanding of the universe's fundamental properties.

Abstract: This paper explores the theoretical implications of quantum gravity by analyzing compact stellar objects, presenting three distinct models that serve as alternatives to traditional black holes. These models are characterized by their extreme compactness and incorporation of a quantum core, successfully avoiding the curvature singularities typically associated with classical general relativity. Central to these models is the noncommutative parameter, which plays a crucial role in determining stellar properties and enables the exploration of various astrophysical regimes. While pure Planckian effects pose significant challenges for observational detection, our findings suggest that lower energy scales may reveal exotic stellar objects with Earth and Sun-like masses that lack classical counterparts, potentially providing the first experimental evidence of non-classical gravity. We propose that the metrics derived in this study can be tested against known neutron stars, offering promising avenues for future research aimed at understanding the interplay between quantum effects in gravity and stellar evolution, ultimately enhancing our comprehension of the universe's fundamental properties.

Abstract: We present a dedicated search for gravitational-wave backgrounds with nontrivial peak structures using data from the first three and the initial part of the fourth observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. The analysis is motivated by a variety of early-Universe models characterized by signals with multiple peaks. We introduce a model independent parameterization of double-peaked spectra based on the superposition of two normalized broken power laws and perform a Bayesian inference study using the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA isotropic cross-correlation data. While no statistically significant evidence for a multi-peak background is found, the analysis provides constraints on the inter-peak slopes in correlation with the signal amplitude. These results exhibit LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's ability to probe signals beyond a single peak structure and establish a foundation for future targeted searches for nontrivial gravitational waves background spectral shapes in future observing runs and the advanced detector era.

Abstract: We take a fresh look at the viability of physically realistic extremal black holes within our (non-supersymmetric) low energy physics. By incorporating prefactors and volume effects, we show that Schwinger discharge in charge neutral environments is far more efficient than commonly assumed. Using ionization estimates for neutral hydrogen, we obtain a new and robust lower bound on the mass of an extremal electrically charged black hole, exceeding $10^{14} M_\odot$. For magnetic black holes, we compute the Lee-Nair-Weinberg instability and revisit early universe pair creation rates, including singular instantons that substantially enhance production, to demonstrate that the extreme charges required for stability are cosmologically implausible. Finally, we suggest that an extremal Kerr black hole could shed angular momentum via superradiant scattering from the stochastic gravitational wave background. Taken together, our results provide a unified picture that extremal black holes of any type are unlikely to persist in our universe.

Abstract: In extended black hole thermodynamics, the cosmological constant and other couplings are treated as thermodynamic variables, yielding a first law $\tildeδM=T\tildeδS+Ω\tildeδJ+\mathcal{V}\tildeδP+\cdots$, where $P\equiv -\fracΛ{8π}$. A long-standing conceptual gap in this framework is that, unlike $M$, $T$, $S$, $Ω$, and $J$, the thermodynamic volume $\mathcal{V}$ lacks a first-principles definition and can only be deduced from other thermodynamic quantities. This deficiency indicates that the underlying origin of $\mathcal{V}$ has remained poorly understood. In this work, we resolve this issue and provide an explicit universal formula for $\mathcal{V}$. We demonstrate that it universally decomposes into two contributions, one arising from the explicit dependence of the action on the couplings and the other from the response of the fundamental dynamical fields.

### [117] [No Love for black holes: tightest constraints on tidal Love numbers of black holes from GW250114](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01918)
*M. Andrés-Carcasona,G. Caneva Santoro*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Kerr black holes in classical GR have vanishing tidal Love numbers, but deviations are predicted in alternative theories or with exotic matter. GW250114 data supports this, capping their tidal deformability at ~35, which implies matter around them is limited and some boson star models are ruled out. This provides the strongest constraints on black hole tidal deformability so far.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to test the predictions of black hole physics in alternative theories using gravitational wave observations. By analyzing the GW250114 event, researchers aim to verify whether Kerr black holes have vanishing tidal Love numbers in classical GR.

Method: The analysis involved advanced gravitational wave data analysis techniques to extract the tidal deformability parameters from the GW250114 signal. Statistical methods were used to set a 90% upper confidence limit on the tidal deformability.

Result: The primary result is the placing of a stringent upper limit on the effective tidal deformability of ~34.8, supporting the Kerr black hole prediction of vanishing tidal Love numbers in classical GR. This suggests that any deviation must come from exotic matter or alternative theories of gravity.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the GW250114 data strongly supports the classical GR prediction for Kerr black holes, indicating that their tidal Love numbers are effectively zero. The constraints provide a robust limit on possible modifications to black hole physics and exclude certain models of boson stars.

Abstract: Tidal Love numbers of black holes, zero in classical general relativity for Kerr black holes in vacuum, become non-vanishing in the presence of exotic matter or in alternative theories of gravity, making them a powerful probe of fundamental physics. The gravitational-wave event GW250114, observed with an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio, provides a unique opportunity to test this prediction. By analyzing this event, we conclude that the data is consistent with the binary black hole hypothesis, and we place a 90\% upper limit on the effective tidal deformability of $\tildeΛ < 34.8$. These bounds imply that any environment surrounding the black holes must contribute less than $\sim 7\times 10^{-3}$ of their mass, and they rule out some models of boson stars. Our findings provide the strongest observational constraints yet on black hole tidal deformability and show that the data remain fully consistent with the Kerr black hole prediction of vanishing tidal Love numbers.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum-to-classical transition of primordial perturbations within a two-field inflationary framework where an adiabatic mode interacts with an entropic environment. In the case of a massive entropic environment, the attractor Bunch--Davies vacuum plays a special role: it is the only state that can undergo full recoherence, whereas all excited initial states exhibit persistent loss of purity. To characterize this behavior, we parameterize excited Gaussian initial states by their Bogoliubov coefficients and compute the purity and Rényi-2 entropy of the reduced adiabatic state as information-theoretic indicators of decoherence dynamics. We find that excited states display \emph{purity-freezing} at a non-zero plateau, where residual quantum correlations persist indefinitely, a qualitative departure from the complete recoherence observed for the Bunch--Davies vacuum. This sensitivity to initial conditions highlights the non-generic nature of full recoherence in the quantum-to-classical transition of inflationary perturbations.

Abstract: We use micromagnetic simulations to demonstrate neuron functionality of two-dimensional (2D) chiral magnonic resonators. Our design exploits nonlinear resonant scattering of spin waves propagating in a YIG medium from an edge mode of a permalloy nano-element. The reduced frequency and volume of the edge mode facilitate matching it to the YIG modes and give rise to their wide-angle scattering. As the amplitudes of the incident spin waves increase, the edge mode exhibits a positive nonlinear frequency shift. This shift leads to a complex frequency-dependent nonlinear variation of the amplitude and phase of spin waves scattered in different directions. We show that the scattered waves are strong enough to activate secondary neurons. This provides the connectivity required for combining our proposed neurons into 2D magnonic neural networks.

TL;DR: Erbium-based materials face challenges in telecommunications. We overcome these through synthesis of 2D single crystal ErOCl, achieving a record optical gain and compact Er-based lasers with potential applications in sensing and communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses significant challenges in telecommunications using Erbium-based materials, aiming to develop advanced optical communication solutions.

Method: We synthesized 2D single crystal ErOCl with high Er density (1.75*1022 cm-3) to reduce density-related quenching effects, enabling record-breaking optical gains. By integrating this material with a photonic crystal microcavity, we achieved compact Er-based lasers with low-light emission threshold.

Result: The synthesis of ErOCl with high Er density led to record optical gain (over 1500 dB/cm) and room-temperature continuous-wave lasing. The lasers achieved a record-low threshold of 7 μW and the smallest size, making them suitable for on-chip sensing and optical communication.

Conclusion: This breakthrough in Erbium-based materials offers new possibilities for compact, efficient, and high-power optical communication systems.

Abstract: Erbium-based materials have long been recognized for their important telecom-band applications, yet their widespread adoption in integrated optoelectronics has been hindered by two fundamental limitations: the difficulty in achieving high erbium density without concentration quenching which leads to small optical gain in doped materials, and the difficulty in fabricating a practical device with single crystal nanowires that demonstrated high optical gain previously1,2. Here, we overcome these limitations by synthesizing 2D single crystal ErOCl that has an Er density of 1.75*1022 cm-3. The high-quality single crystal material significantly reduces the density-related quenching effect that dominates in randomly doped materials with high Er concentration. This results in a record optical gain coefficient over 1500 dB/cm at 1536 nm band, at least larger by an order of magnitude than the previous gain record in Er materials. Leveraging this exceptional gain medium, we demonstrate room-temperature continuous-wave lasing operation by integrating with a photonic crystal microcavity, achieving a record-low threshold of 7 μW with the most compact size of any Er-based lasers. Furthermore, the unique Stark splitting characteristics of ErOCl provide optical gain in three wavelength bands and lead to lasing in these wavelengths by engineering the cavity. This is the first time that optical gain has been shown in three different wavelength bands in Er materials, together with the smallest size of laser cavity, could have many important applications in on-chip sensing and optical communication.

Abstract: A rectenna (rectifying antenna) is usually applied to a microwave power transmission (MPT) system as a terminal, which receives microwave (MW) power and converts them into DC power. A 5.8 GHz aperture-coupled patch antenna array is developed with a gain of 19.5 dBi, which is a part of the rectenna. A novel Class-F rectifier with a series diode is proposed to achieve a high rectifying efficiency based on harmonic termination techniques. The input circuit of the proposed rectifier is taken into consideration to reach the Class-F condition, while mostly only the output circuit is involved in conventional Class-F designs. A low-pass filter based on defected ground structure is implemented, which not only blocks the harmonics produced in rectifying but also presents desired impedance at harmonics. The current and voltage waveforms on the diode are well enforced. The radiation feature of the rectifier is presented as well. It shows that an optimized cavity, which shields the parasite radiation, may achieve a 5% enhancement on the MW-to-DC conversion efficiency. A C-band rectifier based on HSMS-286 Schottky diode is fabricated and measured. A MPT simple demo system is constructed with the proposed rectifier and antenna. A measured maximum MW-to-DC conversion efficiency of 72% is achieved on the rectifier. The design method is extremely valuable in a high conversion efficiency rectenna design based on harmonic termination techniques.

Abstract: Woven shell structures are beneficial for applications requiring lightweight, damage resilience, and design tunability, such as in wearable devices, soft robotics, and aerospace systems. A fundamental component of woven structures is the woven column. While the mechanical properties of a woven column can be determined using sophisticated finite element (FE) simulations, these FE models are computationally expensive and do not explain the underlying mechanics behind scaling relationships. In this work, we derive purely analytical models for the buckling load and stiffness of woven columns, and discuss the criteria that lead to different buckling modes of the woven columns. The simulated results based on our models closely match experimental data across various weave design parameters. This work advances our understanding of the mechanics of woven systems and serves as a baseline for the design of next-generation hierarchical structures and materials.

Abstract: Acoustic helical dichroism (HD) arises from the interaction between vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) and chiral media, yet such chiral sound-matter interactions are typically weak. Here, we employ quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBICs) in acoustic meta-cavities composed of coupled Helmholtz resonators to enhance acoustic HD. We design both achiral and chiral meta-cavities that support QBICs in the form of vortex states with high Q-factors. Using full-wave numerical simulations, we show that the QBICs in the achiral meta-cavities cannot enhance acoustic HD due to the absence of a chiral wavefront. In contrast, the chiral meta-cavity exhibits a pronounced HD enhancement through the QBICs with a 3D helical wavefront, which can be excited by incident waves either with or without OAM. Our work identifies two essential requirements for enhancing acoustic HD effect via QBICs: a high Q-factor of the states and 3D chirality of the state fields, which usually compromise each other in conventional acoustic resonators. The findings open new avenues for achieving strong chiral sound-matter interactions, with potential applications in acoustic chiral sensing and acoustic OAM manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the fascinating complexity and adaptability of natural photonic structures in biological organisms, particularly wings, and seeks to replicated this complexity through localized processes without centralized control.

Method: The method uses local reaction-diffusion dynamics to automate the generation of freeform waveguides, producing robust spatially distributed structures that naturally exhibit photonic band gaps.

Result: The self-organized waveguides show superior performance in maintaining photonic band gaps and have higher transmission efficiency along complex paths compared to traditional periodic media.

Conclusion: This research opens new possibilities for designing advanced photonic devices that emulate the intrinsic adaptability and resilience of biological systems, potentially leading to breakthroughs in adaptive electromagnetic components without extensive tuning or optimization steps.

Abstract: Nature offers remarkable examples of complex photonic architectures such as those responsible for the iridescent colors of butterfly wings that emerge spontaneously during growth, well before any centralized control takes place. Arising from local rules, these structures exhibit advanced optical functionalities, such as photonic band gaps, without relying on in-situ optimization or top-down design. Inspired by biological morphogenesis, we introduce an optimization-free approach for the automated generation of self-organized freeform waveguides that adapt to complex propagation paths. Our method relies on local reaction-diffusion dynamics to produce robust, spatially distributed structures. In contrast to conventional waveguides based on periodic media, which impose strong geometric constraints and require extensive fine-tuning, the proposed structures support nontrivial geometries while maintaining photonic band gap behavior. We experimentally demonstrate that these self-organized waveguides achieve superior transmission efficiency along complex paths. This optimization-free strategy enables the automated design of advanced electromagnetic components with intrinsic adaptability and resilience.

Abstract: The dynamic interplay between light and electric field control of charge states lies at the heart of developing multifunctional optoelectronic devices. While persistent photoconductivity (PPC) and gate-voltage (VG)-induced electron trapping are well-known phenomena in oxide heterostructures, their mutual coupling remains poorly explored. Here, we report that the non-equilibrium state established by PPC can effectively modulate the efficacy of VG-induced electron trapping in a STO/Al heterostructure. The PPC, characterized by a slow relaxation (8.5 hours at 4 K) after sub-illumination, originates from the re-trapping of photoexcited carriers into deep-level states. In contrast, VG-induced trapping, governed by shallow states, exhibits much faster dynamics ({100 - 400 s). Crucially, we discover that the strength of VG-induced trapping is not constant but is dynamically modulated by the PPC relaxation process. The trapping amplitude is strongly amplified after illumination and recovers only after the deep-level states are substantially refilled, precisely following the PPC relaxation time constant. Furthermore, the electron trapping effect diminishes with increasing temperature and vanishes near the ferroelastic phase transition of STO (110 K), confirming that ferroelastic twin walls and associated oxygen vacancy clusters are the physical origin of the traps. Our findings reveal a novel optical gating mechanism for electron trapping, paving the way for designing non-volatile, optically programmable electronic devices.

Motivation: Magnetic field sensing with high temporal and spatial resolution for biological and complex systems.

Method: Ensemble of NV centers in diamond; raster-scanning with AOD; single photodetector readout; qCW-ODMR regime with short optical pulses and continuous microwave field.

Result: Sub-millisecond temporal resolution; dynamic field imaging; high sensitivity (nT·Hz⁻¹/²) for biological applications.

Conclusion: Simplifies experimental setup and enhances capabilities for weak dynamic magnetic fields.

Abstract: We present a technique based on an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond capable of imaging magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and with our diamond achieves nT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ per pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems.

Abstract: Deconvolution is the most widely used aberration correction technique in microscopy, however most techniques assume that the aberrations are the same for each point in the image, which is rarely true. Methods for tracking spatially varying aberrations require burdensome calibration or computation, or require symmetries in the aberration patterns. Here, we expand on existing modal deconvolution methods to demonstrate 3D fluorescence deconvolution in imaging systems that exhibit no simple symmetry. Our method is based on a space-variant generalization of Richardson-Lucy deconvolution that makes use of ZEMAX\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-derived point spread functions without the requirement of guide stars or calibration measurements. We validate the performance of our method by applying it to snapshot multiplane imaging of both bead samples and biological specimens, and show that modal decomposition is a practical solution for deconvolving spatially varying aberrations that do not display clear symmetries.

Abstract: There exists a significant scale gap between photonic neural network integrated chips and neural networks, which hinders the deployment and application of photonic neural network. Here, we propose hardware-aware lightweight spiking neural networks (SNNs) architecture tailored to our photonic neuromorphic chips, and conducts hardware-software collaborative computing for solving patter classification tasks. Here, we employed a simplified Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) mesh for performing linear computation, and 16-channel distributed feedback lasers with saturable absorber (DFB-SA) array for performing nonlinear spike activation. Both photonic neuromorphic chips based on the MZI mesh and DFB-SA array were designed, optimized and fabricated. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight spiking neural network (SNN) with discrete cosine transform to reduce input dimension and match the input/output ports number of the photonic neuromorphic chips. We demonstrated an end-to-end inference of an entire layer of the lightweight photonic SNN. The hardware-software collaborative inference accuracy is 90% and 80.5% for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively. The energy efficiency is 1.39 TOPS/W for the MZI mesh, and is 987.65 GOPS/W for the DFB-SA array. The lightweight architecture and experimental demonstration address the challenge of scale mismatch between the photonic chip and SNN, paving the way for the hardware deployment of photonic SNNs.

Abstract: Topological dislocations in otherwise periodic lattices represent global structural defects that, nevertheless, typically leave the lattice periodicity intact far from the dislocation. Such dislocations arise in diverse physical systems ranging from crystalline solids, acoustic and photonic lattices and crystals to matter waves in optical lattices. Dislocations drastically affect the evolution of wave excitations in their vicinity, enabling novel mechanisms for trapping on topological defects and controlling the energy flow. Moreover, when combined with nonlinearity, such systems give rise to new types of self-sustained states of topological origin that have never been observed to date. Here we demonstrate experimentally, for the first time at optical frequencies, the waveguiding at various types of topological edge dislocations, resulting in the formation of localized photonic eigenstates with distinct and tunable shapes. Using femtosecond laser-writing techniques, we fabricated waveguide arrays with precisely tailored dislocation parameters, enabling full control over the degree of localization and internal structure of the associated modes. We further demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that in the high-power regime, the families of thresholdless dislocation solitons bifurcate from such modes, which inherit shape diversity of their linear counterparts. Our results reveal a nontrivial interplay between nonlinearity and global lattice deformations and establish dislocation solitons as a new class of nonlinear topological states. They may stimulate the observation of new types of nonlinear states and interaction scenarios for excitations in nonlinear physical systems, where lattices with controllable global deformations can be created.

Abstract: Microwave photonics (MWP) serves as a powerful bridge between the radio-frequency and optical worlds, unlocking unprecedented bandwidth and speed for critical information systems. Recently, MWP-based radar jamming has demonstrated significant potential in overcoming electronic bottlenecks; however, existing solutions rely heavily on bulky discrete components and generate deterministic symmetric waveforms that are vulnerable to advanced counter-countermeasures. Here, we break this status quo by demonstrating the first monolithic photonic chip-based reconfigurable radar compound jamming signal generator. Implemented on a compact 25 mm2 silicon photonic footprint, our system features high integration and electrical reconfigurability, supporting agile switching among four distinct jamming modes. Crucially, we introduce a composite jamming mechanism that exploits time-frequency coupling to break the inherent symmetry of traditional deceptive jamming, generating controllable asymmetric false-target clusters. The on-chip system exhibits an operating bandwidth exceeding 20 GHz and is capable of generating over 20 high-fidelity false targets simultaneously. This work establishes a fully functional platform combining broad bandwidth, multi-mode flexibility, and asymmetric deception, paving the way for miniaturized, intelligent photonic solutions in next-generation electronic warfare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of optical systems with freeform surfaces necessitates better tools for analyzing aberrations.

Method: The method involves segmenting the optical path, using ray sets to calculate surface contributions, and dividing these contributions into intrinsic, induced, and transfer components. The wavefront errors are expanded into Zernike polynomials.

Result: The method accurately calculates additive surface Zernike contributions without constraints on system geometry or aperture shape, specifically for near-circular apertures.

Conclusion: This approach provides a robust way to analyze aberration sources at each surface, aiding in the design of optical systems with freeform surfaces.

Abstract: The increasing use of freeform optical surfaces raises the demand for optical design tools developed for generalized systems. In the design process surface-by-surface aberration contributions are of special interest. The expansion of the wave aberration function into field and pupil dependent coefficients is an analytical method used for that purpose. An alternative numerical approach utilizing data from the trace of multiple ray sets is proposed. The optical system is divided into segments of the optical path measured along the chief ray. Each segment covers one surface and the distance to the subsequent surface. Surface contributions represent the change of the wavefront that occurs due to propagation through individual segments. Further, the surface contributions are divided with respect to their phenomenological origin into intrinsic, induced and transfer components. Each component is determined from a separate set of rays. The proposed method does not place any constraints on the system geometry or the aperture shape. However, here we concentrate on near-circular apertures and specify the resulting wavefront error maps using an expansion into Zernike polynomials. Hence, for the first time additive surface Zernike contributions are obtained.

Abstract: We present a new holographic approach for generating large scale, polarization resolved optical tweezer arrays. By analyzing the ideal Jones fields that realize a target pattern, we identify that the fundamental degrees of freedom are the relative phases of the individual tweezers, rather than the full spatial phase profile. Leveraging this insight, we formulate a reverse projection optimization that adjusts only a small set of phase parameters to approximate the ideal operator within the physical constraints of a metasurface. This produces significantly higher fidelity and robustness than Gerchberg_Saxton type algorithms. Experimentally, we demonstrate H, V, L, and R polarized tweezer arrays using a single layer metasurface. A key advantage of our method is its phase stability, yielding strong resistance to optical aberrations and enabling coherent global phase modulation such as forming vortex tweezer lattice, without degrading trap quality. This framework provides a conceptually clear and experimentally powerful route for scalable optical field synthesis.

*Marc Brunel,Gilles Demange,Renaud Patte,Maxim Yurkin*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The interferometric Particle Imaging (IPI) technique is used to study small ice crystals, extending its application from larger to smaller particles. A method combining rigorous modeling of particle shapes with Phase Field Modelling and the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) is developed. The Fourier transform of the interferometric image relates to the particle shape's autocorrelation across various angles, confirming the measurement principle but complicating sensor interpretation due to wide viewing angles. IPI is effective for characterizing small ice particles, while DDA provides versatile simulation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As aerosol particles play a significant role in climate and health, understanding small ice crystals is crucial for atmospheric studies. Validate IPI's applicability at smaller scales and improve measurement techniques are key motivations.

Method: The method combines rigorous modeling, Phase Field Modelling, and the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) to characterize ice crystals down to a few micrometers.

Result: IPI successfully demonstrates its application to smaller ice crystals, and DDA enhances the generation of datasets for inversion methods, advancing atmospheric particle characterization.

Conclusion: This work extends IPI's capabilities to study small ice crystals, contributing to atmospheric research while DDA serves as a valuable simulation tool.

Abstract: Interferometric Particle Imaging (IPI) is a powerful technique to characterize aerosol particles, which so far has been applied only to particles larger than about 100 wavelengths. We extend its applicability to smaller ice crystals, combining rigorous modelling of particle shapes with the Phase Field Modelling and light-scattering simulations with the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA). Even for particles with the largest dimension of 11.5 wavelengths (and the smallest one comparable to the wavelength), the 2D Fourier transform of the interferometric image remains linked to the 2D autocorrelation of the particle shape at various viewing angles, validating the general measurement principle. However, the sensor must necessarily have wide viewing angle, which complicates interpretation of apparent particle shape, when such particles are observed from the edge. IPI is, thus, shown to be a powerful optical technology for characterizing ice particles down to a few micrometers in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, DDA is a versatile method for such synthetic experiments and can further supply large datasets for development of various inversion methods.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) wave manipulation based on laser filaments-plasma channels formed by femtosecond laser-induced air ionization-has emerged as a promising platform for free-space THz applications. However, in-situ characterization of the spatially confined THz modes within filaments faces significant challenges due to the plasma's ultra-high intensity, which not only hinders direct near-field probing but also limits reliance on indirect far-field reconstruction. Here, we introduce a non-invasive near-field modulation scheme where a metal plate approaches the filament at submillimeter distances (comparable to THz wavelengths), perturbing the dielectric environment to convert the symmetric annular THz mode into an asymmetric state. This controlled transition enables far-field detection of broadband calculus behaviors (first- and second-order differentiation/integration) on time-domain THz waveforms and characteristic spectral transfer functions with 1/f, 1/f^2, f or f^2 dependency (where f is the THz frequency), thereby diagnosing the near-field THz mode confinement. Hence, the proposed approach synergizes near-field modulation efficiency with far-field detection robustness, advancing fundamental understanding of plasma-THz interactions and enabling novel all-optical signal processing for filament-based THz technologies.

Abstract: The ability to switch and program molecular transitions via deterministically located plasmonic nanoantennae presents opportunities for wide spectrum of applications from biosensors to quantum computing. Due to its topology, toroidal nanoantenna (TNA) focuses immense amount of three-dimensional (3D) local electric field by toroidal moment while allowing pre and post positioning around quantum emitters (QEs). Here, we report complete switching of molecular transition energies of quantum objects (QOs) with modulation depth of 99.9% over 2840-fold radiative enhancement. At optimized TNA geometries, Fano interference between the broadband plasmonic continuum and narrow quantum transitions of QOs suppresses both radiative and non-radiative decay channels near 850 nm, yielding an observable full switching that traps energy within the hybrid mode instead of re-emitting it. To show the promises of the concept, we further demonstrate systems with multiple QOs where spectral degeneracy enhances the transparency bandwidth, while detuning generates distinct minima, enabling individually addressable spectral responses. These results establish plasmonic TNA as a promising architecture for spectral detection of single or multi-molecule configurations with high sensitivity and empowers the user for the implementation of quantum mode switches to be used in photonic processing.

Abstract: Lanthanide-based emitters are attracting increasing interest for their potential in high-performance OLEDs due to their narrow emission bands, high photostability, and functional versatility. However, their low radiative rates and poor charge transport properties remain key challenges for efficient device integration. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of dual-emissive Eu3+ - Yb3+ coordination compounds that exhibit temperature-dependent luminescence intensity ratios (LIR) between the visible and near-infrared regions. These materials enable simultaneous optical thermometry and electroluminescence, with LIR values showing excellent agreement with external thermocouple measurements over a broad temperature range. OLED devices incorporating these complexes demonstrate stable operation, and their luminescence properties are further enhanced by integration with engineered plasmonic metasurfaces. This integration leads to a significant increase in emission directionality and a reduction of the excited-state lifetime via Purcell enhancement, without compromising spectral integrity. Our findings highlight the promise of lanthanide-based coordination compounds as multifunctional emitters for next-generation optoelectronic devices and suggest new pathways toward intelligent OLED architectures with integrated sensing and directional control.

Abstract: Recently, the size-dependence of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in quantum dots has been investigated experimentally. In particular, for longer driving wavelengths and QDs smaller than 3\,nm, HHG was strongly suppressed, however, there is no computational model capable of describing the strong-field response of such systems. In this work, we introduce a computationally efficient three-dimensional real-space tight-binding model specifically designed for the simulation of HHG in confined systems. The model parameters are meticulously derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the semiconductor bulk, followed by a process of Wannierization. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed model accurately captures the observed dependency of the HHG yield on the quantum dot size. Additionally, we simulate the HHG yield for elliptically polarized pulses for different QD-sizes and driving wavelengths up to $5\,μ{\mathrm{m}}$. The herein proposed model fills the theoretical void in simulating HHG within medium-sized nanostructures, which cannot be described by methods applied for periodic solids or small molecules or atoms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-volatile color displays depend on ITO thin films and phase-change materials (PCMs), and understanding the color properties of these films is crucial for optimizing display performance.

Method: The researchers used X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry measurements to systematically study the properties of ITO films under varying annealing conditions.

Result: The study reveals a comprehensive colormap of ITO thin films as a function of annealing temperature and film thickness, showing strong color changes for thicker films under high annealing temperatures.

Conclusion: The results emphasize the importance of considering intrinsic color changes in ITO functional thin-film layers when designing reconfigurable color devices using PCM-based materials.

Abstract: Indium-tin oxide (ITO) has been leveraged as a crucial functional layer in the optoelectronic frameworks, such as non-volatile color display thin films based on the ITO/phase-change material (PCM)/ITO/reflective metal multilayer structures on a silicon substrate. In addition to non-volatile color tuning by PCMs, phase transition of ITO may pose a substantial impact on display performances. Yet, a comprehensive colormap of ITO thin films as functions of annealing temperature and film thickness is missing. In this work, we systematically investigate properties of ITO films based on X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry measurements. We provide a colormap of the ITO/platinum/silicon structure in terms of the annealing temperature (150-350 °C) and thickness (5-100 nm) for the non-volatile color display, and we observe strong color changes under 250 °C annealing treatment for the 50-nm and 100-nm-thick ITO films. We suggest that the intrinsic change in colors of the ITO functional thin-film layers should also be taken into account, when the PCM-based reconfigurable color devices are used in practice.

Abstract: Controlling the flow of electricity in metallic circuits with light is a key goal for future optoelectronics. In this work, we demonstrate all-optical generation and directional control of non-thermal drift photocurrents in a plasmonic gold wire. We attribute this phenomenon to the Inverse Faraday Effect and show that the current's direction can be precisely reversed at a subwavelength scale by tailoring the incident light's polarization or laser beam position. A bespoke polarization modulation technique is employed to unambiguously separate ultrafast drift currents from the ubiquitous photothermal background. We further reveal a collaborative mechanism where macroscopic thermal gradients, acting as a driving force, are used to extract and remotely detect the locally-generated nanoscale photocurrents. This robust control and detection scheme paves the way for reconfigurable, all-optical nanocircuitry capable of ultrafast on-chip processing.

The system employs periodic all-dielectric AlGaAs gratings to induce polarization-dependent SH emission, enabling pixel by pixel direct retrieval of the full Stokes vector from an input intensity distribution in the near-infrared range. By engineering the geometry and orientation of the polarimetric units, sensitivity to linear and circular polarization components is achieved.

Abstract: Mid-InfraRed spectroscopy is a promising label-free technique that can offer insights into morphological and pathological alterations in biological tissues at the molecular level. Owing to the development of the Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometer, combined with scanning devices, FTIR images can be produced by simultaneously acquiring spectral data from multiple spatial points, generating comprehensive chemical maps. In the data pre-processing, the identification of the sample pixels, with the background pixels excluded, is important for further effective feature extraction in FTIR images. Here, we present three algorithms realized in unsupervised and supervised approaches for the identification of the sample pixels. The algorithms demonstrate accurate prediction results of the sample and background pixels, and the supervised method further enables the automatic detection. These findings highlight thorough and robust solutions to the sample pixels detection problem in FTIR images, contributing to the FTIR signal processing and future research with FTIR images.

Abstract: Light can carry a spin angular momentum, an intrinsic and extrinsic orbital angular momentum, associated with a circular polarization, optical vortex beams, and varying beam trajectories, respectively. The interplay between these momenta yields the spin-orbit interaction of light, in which the spin (circular polarization) controls the spatial (orbital) degrees of freedom of light: either the extrinsic (trajectory) or the intrinsic orbital angular momentum (vortex). While the well-known spin-orbit interaction of light plays a crucial role in nano-optics by providing spin-controlled light manipulation, the interaction between the intrinsic and the extrinsic orbital angular momentum - the orbit-orbit interaction of light - has remained elusive. In this interplay, the helical phase fronts of optical vortices control the spatial trajectory of light, giving rise to vortex-dependent shifts of optical beams. We report the orbit-orbit interaction of light in a plasmonic ellipse cavity, whose unique geometry facilitates the interplay when a vortex is considered in one of the foci of the ellipse. In this configuration, the orbit-orbit interaction is achieved by the interplay between the vortex of the source and the ellipse-induced transverse shift of the source beam, positioned at one of the focal points - thus inducing transverse vortex-dependent shifts at the second focal point. Strikingly, the orbit-orbit interaction of light significantly enhances the toolbox available for controlling light by leveraging the manifold orbital angular momentum states for vortex-controlled light manipulation - in contrast to light manipulation based on the spin-orbit interaction, which exploits the binary polarization helicity.

Abstract: The formation of permanent laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on solid surfaces under impulsive laser irradiation above the damage threshold has been subject of extensive research. We demonstrate the formation of transient surface displacement patterns under femtosecond laser irradiation at fluences well below this threshold. Time-resolved extreme ultraviolet scattering measurements reveal distinct reciprocal-space features similar to those observed for permanent LIPSS but dissipating on the hundreds-of-picoseconds time scale. We show that the transient surface displacement patterns responsible for these features are produced via thermal expansion by the spatial modulation of absorbed laser intensity caused by scattering of the laser radiation by surface roughness and present a model accounting for the experimental observations. We suggest that our experiment revealed a universal phenomenon that will be observed on any strongly absorbing material under ultrafast laser irradiation.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Potentially, potassium offers a solution to reducing plasmonic losses in photoonic devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract identifies a critical issue in plasmonics: large ohmic losses. To address this, it explores alternative materials and successfully demonstrates potassium as a viable solution.

Method: Methodologically, potassium films were fabricated using a rapid crystallization method. The research measures the optical damping rate and imaginary permittivity across the visible to near-infrared spectrum. Near-field measurements provide further insight into mode confinement.

Result: The findings are quite remarkable. Potassium exhibits extremely low optical damping (3.7 meV) and maintains low imaginary permittivity (approximately 0.1) over a broad spectrum (400-2000 nm). Additionally, subwavelength confinements of optical modes were observed.

Conclusion: The research not only enhances understanding of factors influencing plasmonic performance but also opened doors for exploring advanced light-matter interactions in plasmonic systems.

Abstract: Plasmonics enables the miniaturization of photonic devices beyond the optical diffraction limit,yet its potential is hindered by inherently large ohmic losses. Hence, it is prudent to explore low loss alternatives to the current mainstay of plasmonics-the noble metals. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of potassium as a plasmonic material with intrinsically low losses in the optical region. The ultraflat, high quality potassium film, fabricated via a rapid slipping-assisted oxide-free crystallization process, achieves an experimentally observed optical damping rate of 3.7 meV,with a measured imaginary permittivity of approximately 0.1 across the entire visible to near-infrared range (400-2000 nm). Near field optical spectroscopic measurements further confirmed the reduced losses by revealing deeply subwavelength confinement of optical modes. This result enhances our understanding of the factors governing plasmonic materials and devices and establishes a new platform for exploring extreme light-matter interactions in a variety of plasmonic systems.

Abstract: The interpretation of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids typically relies on phenomenological dephasing times far shorter than what is expected from microscopic scattering processes. Here we show that zero-point fluctuations associated with optical phonons naturally suppress long-range electronic coherences and generate clean harmonic spectra without introducing ad-hoc decoherence parameters. Using a 1D semiconductor composed of two distinct sites per unit cell and realistic phonon amplitudes, we demonstrate that random per-site optical-phonon jitter reproduces the spectral sharpening typically attributed to ultrafast $T_2$ dephasing. In contrast, acoustic phonons and local strain, whose distortions are correlated over nanometer scales, produce negligible spectral cleaning. We further show that such long-range site coherence leads to carrier-envelope-phase-dependent effects in the HHG spectrum driven by long pulses, but these effects collapse once optical-phonon-induced decoherence is included. Our results (i) identify optical zero-point motion as a key mechanism governing coherence in solid-state HHG, (ii) demonstrate that it can be qualitatively modeled in periodic solids through site-distance-dependent dephasing, and (iii) suggest that CEP-resolved measurements can probe electronic coherence lengths and atomic fluctuations in crystalline materials.

*Sebastian Golat,Nathaniel Levy,Francisco J. Rodríguez-Fortuño*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper re-derives the recoil force on an electromagnetic dipole using first principles, showing that it originates from finite light speed effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to better understand the physical origins of recoil forces in electromagnetic dipoles and their underlying mechanisms.

Method: The authors re-derived the recoil force using first principles, considering the total Lorentz force on a system of charges forming simultaneous electric and magnetic dipoles.

Result: The derived recoil force matches the standard momentum-based derivation and is shown to result from retardation effects due to the finite speed of light.

Conclusion: This work provides fundamental insight into the recoil mechanism, aiding future studies of light-induced forces in both theory and experiment.

Abstract: The recoil optical force and torque acting on an electromagnetic dipole are typically derived by computing the imbalance in radiated linear and angular electromagnetic momentum coming from the source, using Maxwell stress tensor integration. This quantifies the recoil's outcome without revealing its physical origin or the underlying forces that produce it. The recoil force and torque exist even in the absence of external illumination, such that an isolated dipole emitter can experience them. In contrast to the other terms, the recoil terms are odd under time reversal. To clarify their nature and properties, we re-derive the recoil force from first principles using the total Lorentz force on a system of charges that form a simultaneous electric and magnetic dipole. The results agree with the standard momentum-based derivation and reveal their ultimate origin from retardation effects -- arising from the finite speed of light -- in the mutual interactions between charges. This result provides fundamental insight into the recoil mechanism, offering a clearer conceptual foundation for future theoretical and experimental studies of light-induced forces.

Abstract: Space-time varying media enable unprecedented control over electromagnetic waves, yet most existing studies assume idealized, nondispersive materials and thus fail to capture the intrinsic frequency dispersion of realistic platforms. Here, we develop a general framework for dispersive space-time varying systems that rigorously identifies the physically allowed frequency transitions of waves scattered at uniformly moving interfaces. Unlike previous approaches, our method is valid for arbitrary dispersion profiles, including resonances, and does not rely on the commonly used frame hopping approach, allowing treatment of multiple-velocity and accelerated systems. Applying this framework to canonical Drude and Lorentz media, we uncover a family of dispersion-mediated space-time states that arise from the multiple frequency transitions permitted by material dispersion. These states extend beyond conventional nondispersive scattering, revealing qualitatively new regimes of space-time scattering regimes. Our results establish a rigorous foundation for the design of realistic space-time metamaterials, with immediate relevance to emerging experiments in epsilon-near-zero optical platforms and open pathways for dispersion-engineered wave manipulation.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Graphene plasmons under terahertz frequencies in magnetic fields enable electrically tunable, frequency-selective photodetectors, serving as a platform for fundamental studies and high-sensitivity photonics but were previously challenging to implement. The study reveals that in monolayer graphene, the Dirac nature of carriers leads to a non-monotonic frequency dependence due to interplay of plasma and cyclotron effects. In bilayer graphene, conventional Schrödinger-type magnetoplasmons are recovered, establishing graphene TeraFETs as effective platforms for resonant magnetoplasmonics with potential applications in magnetically programmable, frequency-selective photodetectors with enhanced sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the need for terahertz photonics applications, such as high-sensitivity photodetectors and nonreciprocal devices, which require precise control over photon frequencies. The use of graphene and magnetic fields offers promising avenues for achieving such control, making this an important area of investigation in modern photonics.

Method: Gate-dependent terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy combined with a perpendicular magnetic field was used to probe the behavior of resonant magnetoplasmons in graphene-based devices. The method allowed the researchers to measure and analyze the evolution of the plasmons' properties under varying conditions.

Result: The study found that in monolayer graphene, the magnetoplasmon dispersion exhibits a non-monotonic density dependence, influenced by both plasma resonance and cyclotron motion, with an inflection point at maximal coupling. In contrast, bilayer graphene showed conventional Schrödinger-type magnetoplasmons, indicating that bilayer graphene supports more conventional electronic behaviors compared to monolayer graphene.

Conclusion: This work establishes graphene tunneling FETs (TeraFETs) as a reliable platform for resonant magnetoplasmonics at terahertz frequencies, enabling the development of magnetically programmable, frequency-selective photonics devices with potential applications in highly sensitive photodetectors and other advanced optical systems.

Abstract: Graphene plasmons confine incident terahertz fields far below the diffraction limit and, when hosted by a gate-defined Fabry-Perot cavity, enable electrically tunable, frequency-selective photodetectors. In a magnetic field, these plasmons hybridize with the cyclotron motion to form magnetoplasmons, offering a platform for fundamental studies and for nonreciprocal, spectrally selective, ultrasensitive terahertz photonics. However, implementing magnetoplasmon-assisted resonant transistors at terahertz frequencies has remained challenging so far. Here we use gate-dependent, on-chip terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy combined with a perpendicular magnetic field to resolve and probe the evolution of resonant magnetoplasmons in antenna-coupled monolayer and bilayer graphene TeraFETs. In monolayer graphene the dispersion reflects the Dirac nature of the carriers, exhibiting a non-monotonic density dependence due to the interplay of plasma resonance and cyclotron motion, with an inflection point at maximal plasmon-cyclotron coupling. In contrast, in bilayer graphene we recover and map a magnetoplasmon dispersion consistent with the conventional Schrödinger-type picture. These results establish graphene TeraFET devices as a robust on-chip platform for resonant magnetoplasmonics at terahertz frequencies, enabling magnetically programmable, frequency-selective photonics and opening avenues toward photodetectors with enhanced sensitivity.

### [155] [Classification of coherent peaks in two-terminal quantum devices into normal and anomalous Kondo peaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00330)
*Jongbae Hong*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper distinguishes normal and anomalous Kondo peaks in quantum dots and quantum point contacts based on their spin dynamics. Zero-bias peaks in QPCs and certain QDSETs are normal Kondo peaks, formed by spin exchange, with a scaling temperature at half the FWHM. In contrast, other peaks, including those in the odd sector of QDSETs, are anomalous Kondo peaks without spin exchange, and their scaling temperatures don't align with the FWHM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the nature of Kondo peaks is critical for advancing quantum dot and quantum point contact research, as it informs device functionality and applications in quantum computing and nanotechnology.

Method: The authors analyze the conductance data of QDSETs and QPCs, categorizing peaks based on spin exchange dynamics. They support their classification by simulating and reproducing experimental line shapes.

Result: The paper successfully classifies Kondo peaks into normal and anomalous types, providing a clearer understanding of their origins and implications for future research.

Conclusion: This classification offers a refined framework for analyzing Kondo phenomena in quantum systems, aiding in theoretical models and experimental design for quantum devices.

Abstract: Coherent peaks arising in the differential conductance of quantum dot (QD) and quantum point contact (QPC) devices are classified into two categories, normal and anomalous Kondo peaks, according to the underlying spin dynamics and the form of the scaling function to which the scaled temperature-dependent linear conductance collapses. The zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) observed in QPCs and in the triplet state of the even sector of quantum dot single-electron transistors (QDSETs) are identified as normal Kondo peaks, formed by spin dynamics involving spin exchange, a symbolic characteristic of the Kondo effect. For these ZBPs, the scaling temperature coincides with half the full width at half maximum (FWHM). In contrast, the ZBP observed in the odd sector of QDSETs and all finite-bias coherent peaks, including the coherent side peaks of QPCs and the split ZBP in the singlet state of the QDSET even sector, are identified as anomalous Kondo peaks, because they arise from spin dynamics without spin exchange, and their scaling temperature does not coincide with half the FWHM. To support these findings, we reproduce gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance line shapes measured in the odd sector of a QDSET, demonstrating that its ZBP originates from a combination of two coherent side peaks explicitly observed in QPCs.

### [156] [Band inversion transition in HgTe nanowire grown along the [001] direction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00334)
*Rui Li*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper discusses the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of a cylindrical HgTe nanowire grown along the [001] direction, considering both anisotropic and bulk inversion asymmetry terms in the Kane model. Despite the anisotropic term converting an E1-H1 subband crossing into an anticrossing at kzR=0, a gap-closing-and-reopening transition occurs at kzR≈±0.24 for a critical nanowire radius of approximately 3.45 nm. Interestingly, the bulk inversion asymmetry does not lead to spin splitting in the E1, H1, and H2 subbands for a [001]-oriented nanowire.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the electronic properties of HgTe nanowires is crucial for advancing research in topological insulators and potential spintronic applications. The effective Hamiltonian provides a simplified yet insightful model to study subband structure and electronic transitions in these materials.

Method: The authors use perturbation theory to construct the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of a cylindrical HgTe nanowire. They consider the anisotropic term and the bulk inversion asymmetry term of the Kane model.

Result: Key findings include the observation that while the anisotropic term modifies the subband crossings, a gap-closing-and-reopening transition still occurs at specific wave vectors when the nanowire radius reaches a critical value. Additionally, the bulk inversion asymmetry does not result in spin splitting in the E1, H1, and H2 subbands for a [001]-oriented nanowire.

Conclusion: The study reveals the interplay between the anisotropic and inversion asymmetry terms in shaping the subband structure of cylindrical HgTe nanowires and highlights the absence of spin splitting due to inversion asymmetry in this specific orientation.

Abstract: The low-energy effective Hamiltonian of a cylindrical HgTe nanowire grown along the [001] crystallographic direction is constructed by using the perturbation theory. Both the anisotropic term and the bulk inversion asymmetry term of the Kane model are taken into account. Although the anisotropic term has converted the crossing between the $E_{1}$ and $H_{1}$ subbands into an anticrossing at $k_{z}R\!=\!0$, the gap-closing-and-reopening transition in the subband structure can still occur at the wave vectors $k_{z}R\!\approx\!\pm0.24$ for critical nanowire radius $R\!\approx\!3.45$ nm. The bulk inversion asymmetry does not contribute to the low-energy effective Hamiltonian, i.e., there is no spin splitting in the $E_{1}$, $H_{1}$, and $H_{2}$ subbands for a [001] oriented cylindrical nanowire.

Abstract: Quantized transport not only exist in gapped topological states but also in metallic states. Recently, Kane proposed a quantized nonlinear conductance in ballistic metals whose value is determined by the Euler characteristic of the Fermi sea [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 076801 (2022)]. In this paper, we consider two-dimensional noninteracting fermionic systems whose Fermi surface has nonvanishing Berry curvature. We find that the Berry curvature at the Fermi surface does not affect the quantized nonlinear transport for translationally invariant systems. When spatial inhomogeneity is introduced, such quantization breaks down due to the combined effect of Berry curvature and the gradient of local potential. Such breakdown of quantization can be observed in trapped ultracold atoms with topological bands.

Abstract: Producing large-area single-crystalline graphene is key to realizing its full potential in advanced applications, including twistronics. Yet, controlling graphene growth kinetics to avoid grain boundaries or multilayer growth remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate single-crystalline graphene free from multilayer domains via one-step delamination of epitaxial graphene from silicon carbide (SiC). This is enabled by a specific surface reconstruction of 4H-SiC(0001) achieved in our growth conditions. High crystalline quality is confirmed by the observation of the half-integer quantum Hall effect -- the hallmark of monolayer graphene -- in near cm-sized crystals. The scalability of our process, explored with 4''-wafers, represents an advance toward large-scale integration of high-performance graphene applications.

Abstract: We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research focuses on comparing different methods for characterizing topology at non-zero temperatures in one-dimensional inversion-symmetric fermionic chains, specifically examining the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor hopping. The motivation stems from the challenge of using the ensemble geometric phase, a mixed-state generalization of the Zak phase, at finite temperatures due to the modulus of its corresponding expectation value approaching zero in the thermodynamic limit. This limitation leads to the introduction of novel diagnostic tools: local density operators and a generalized local chiral marker for mixed Gaussian states. These methods rely on measuring a small number of local expectation values, making them more practical for identifying topological phases in large systems, even when next-nearest-neighbor hopping is involved. The research also modifies the chiral marker to work with mixed Gaussian states, emphasizing the importance of a non-zero purity gap in enabling the marker to function as a topological invariant in real space.

Method: The methodology includes several key components:

1. **Comparison of Topological Characterization Methods**: The study evaluates the ensemble geometric phase, a mixed-state generalization of the Zak phase, at non-zero temperatures. Despite theoretical well-definedness, the modulus of its expectation value vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, limiting its practical utility. Therefore, the study focuses on developing alternative methods.

2. **Introduction of Local Density Operators**: The proposed diagnostic tool uses local density operators acting on neighboring sites. By comparing the expectation values of these operators, the researchers can identify topological phases by measuring just two local expectation values at non-zero temperature, with an additional nonlocal expectation value required when next-nearest-neighbor hopping is included.

3. **Generalization of the Local Chiral Marker**: The chiral marker is generalized to mixed Gaussian states, entirely determined by the single-particle correlation matrix. A non-zero purity gap in the effective single-particle Hamiltonian ensures that the correlation matrix can be adiabatically flattened into an effective projector. Evaluating the chiral marker with respect to the band-flattened correlation matrix yields a real space topological invariant equivalent to the winding number in the zero-temperature limit。

4. **Complementary Diagnostic Schemes**: The paper highlights that the ensemble geometric phase, local density operators, and local chiral marker provide complementary means for identifying and measuring topological phases of the SSH model beyond pure states.

Result: The study achieves the following results:

1. **Enumeration of Topological Phases at Non-Zero Temperature**: The researchers successfully identify and distinguish various topological phases of the SSH model at non-zero temperatures using the introduced local density operators and generalized chiral marker。

2. **Practicality of Diagnostic Tools**: The proposed methods require the measurement of only two local expectation values and one nonlocal expectation value, making them practical and feasible for large systems. This overcomes the limitation of the ensemble geometric phase, which becomes impractical due to its modulus approaching zero at finite temperatures。

3. **Robustness of the Topological Invariants**: The local density operators and the generalized chiral marker prove robust, even in the presence of varying system sizes and different hopping parameters, demonstrating their reliability as diagnostic tools for topological characterization at non-zero temperatures.

4. **Generalization to Mixed Gaussian States**: The extension of the chiral marker to mixed Gaussian states ensures its applicability beyond pure states, broadening its utility in real-world scenarios where mixed states are common.

5. **Equivalence of Topological Invariants**: The use of band-flattened correlation matrices confirms that the local chiral marker remains a topological invariant capable of capturing changes in the SSH model's topology, aligning its zero-temperature behavior with real-space measurements.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the study addresses the challenges in characterizing topology at non-zero temperatures in one-dimensional inversion-symmetric fermionic chains. By introducing local density operators and a generalized local chiral marker for mixed Gaussian states, the research provides practical and robust diagnostic tools that complement existing methods like the ensemble geometric phase. These tools enable the identification and measurement of topological phases in large systems, even when next-nearest-neighbor hopping is present. The equivalence of the local chiral marker to the winding number in the zero-temperature limit is a significant finding, establishing the real space nature of the topological invariant. The methodology presented in this paper offers a versatile framework for advancing the study of topological phases in realistic systems beyond pure states.

Abstract: We compare different methods for characterizing topology at nonzero temperatures, as applied to one-dimensional inversion-symmetric fermionic chains and focusing on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hopping. Whilst the ensemble geometric phase, a mixed-state generalization of the Zak phase remains well defined at nonzero temperature, the modulus of the corresponding expectation value vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, limiting its practical use. To develop a diagnostic that is suitable also for very large systems, we introduce local density operators acting on neighboring sites, which distinguish topological phases by comparing their expectation values. The topological phase is identified from the relative magnitude of these expectation values, which only requires measuring two local expectation values at nonzero temperature, together with one additional nonlocal expectation value when next-nearest-neighbor hopping is included. In addition, we generalize the local chiral marker to mixed Gaussian states, fully determined by its single-particle correlation matrix, with a nonzero purity gap in their effective single-particle Hamiltonian. The presence of a purity gap ensures that the correlation matrix can be adiabatically flattened to an effective projector. Evaluating the chiral marker with respect to the band-flattened correlation matrix yields a real space topological invariant that coincides with the winding number in the zero temperature limit. The ensemble geometric phase, the local density operators, and the local chiral marker, provide complementary schemes to identify and measure topological phases of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain beyond pure states.

Abstract: We study the impact of electrical contact barriers in hybrid WSe$_2$-LiNbO$_3$-based acoustoelectric and acousto-photoelectric devices using a combination of scanning photocurrent and acousto-electric current spectroscopy. Static scanning photocurrent measurements provide a qualitative measure of the band-bending and spatial distribution of the Schottky barrier between semiconducting WSe$_2$ and gold electrodes whereas the surface acoustic wave-induced acousto-electric current reveals the height of the tunnelling barrier created by the van der Waals gap between the multilayered WSe$_2$ flake and the gold electrodes in addition to the Schottky barrier. The combination of both techniques shows a ten-fold increase in the photocurrent by the acoustic wave. Moreover, the observed spatial redistribution of the current is attributed to the interplay between the contact properties at the source and drain electrodes and the charge carrier dynamics induced by the surface acoustic wave. The ratio of acoustic wavelength to the electrical channel length is found to impact the SAW-induced charge carrier transport. For a channel length shorter than one acoustic wavelength, carriers undergo a seesaw-like motion which changes to charge conveyance for channel lengths comparable or exceeding the acoustic wavelength.

Abstract: Semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) qubits coupled via superconducting microwave resonators provide a powerful means of long-range manipulation of the qubits' spin and charge degrees of freedom. Quantum gates can be implemented by parametrically driving the qubits while their transition frequencies are detuned from the resonator frequency. Long-range two-qubit controlled-Z (CZ) gates have been proposed for the DQD spin qubit within the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). Rapid gates demand strong coupling, but RWA breaks down when coupling strengths become significant relative to system frequencies. Therefore, understanding the errors arising from approximations used is critical for high-fidelity operation. Here, we go beyond RWA to study CZ gate fidelity for both DQD spin and charge qubits. We propose a novel parametric drive on the charge qubit that produces smaller errors and show that the fidelity of the CZ gate outperforms its spin counterpart, resulting in a much smaller fidelity loss of $0.05\%$ compared to $0.80\%$ for the spin qubit, and greater robustness against qubit dephasing and photon loss. We find that drive amplitude -- a parameter dropped in RWA -- is critical for optimizing fidelity, with the charge qubit exhibiting better tolerance to drive amplitude variations. Our results demonstrate the necessity of going beyond RWA in understanding how long-range gates can be realized in DQD qubits, with charge qubits offering considerable advantages in high-fidelity operation.

Abstract: We experimentally confirm the ν= 0 quantum Hall ferromagnetic (QHF) state, accompanied by helical edge states, in the layered organic Dirac-fermion system α-(ET)2I3 by demonstrating helical edge transport in multilayers. The saturation of interlayer magnetoresistance (MR) in the high-magnetic-field quantum limit does not scale with the sample cross-sectional area and appears when the magnetic field is oriented along the side surface. The in-plane MR exhibits a similar angle dependence, whereas this feature disappears in the Corbino geometry where no edge channels are present. These results are consistent with helical edge transport in the multilayer QHF state. They also rule out the possibility that the observed angle-dependent MR arises from the chiral magnetic effect expected for a 3D Dirac or Weyl semimetal.

Abstract: We study topological effects in an one-dimensional plasmonic crystal formed by the screened acoustic plasmons emerging in a periodically modulated graphene sheet, placed on top of a metallic substrate. To this end, we develop the theory of quantization of screened plasmons, as appropriate for lossless graphene described by a Drude conductivity. By analyzing the resulting band structure, we show that the crystal sustains nontrivial topological bands, with quantized geometric phase. We further show that in a finite, open system, edge states appear within the band gap, which undergo a topological phase transition and merge with bulk states as the modulation increases. Our work provides a robust theoretical framework for the study of band structure and topology of layered media, and extends the possibilities for engineering two-dimensional materials with external modulation.

Abstract: We investigate the interaction between quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phases hosted by two atomically thin hexagonal lattices and demonstrate the emergence of topological phases with large Chern numbers. Interlayer coupling between two graphene-like lattices produces band crossings, while relative sliding preserves gapless Dirac points located at generic, low-symmetry $\mathbf{k}$ points. The introduction of Haldane-type complex next-nearest-neighbor hoppings gaps these Dirac points, breaks time-reversal symmetry, and generates a sequence of quantum anomalous Hall phases. Depending on the phase angles $φ_1$ and $φ_2$ associated with the two layers, the system exhibits QAH states with Chern numbers $|C|>2$. The nontrivial bulk topology is verified by the presence of the corresponding number of chiral edge modes in ribbon geometries. These high-Chern-number phases originate from the enhanced twisting of the valence-band manifold induced by interlayer stacking.

Abstract: The quantum metric -- which quantifies the distance between quantum states -- is a fundamental component of the quantum geometric tensor, playing a crucial role in a wide range of physical phenomena. Its direct detection and control remains a challenge, requiring suitable material candidates. In this work, we present the emergence of a tunable quantum metric in a versatile two-dimensional material platform, namely, few-layer phosphorene. Using ab-initio-derived models, we show how electric fields can be used to substantially enhance the quantum metric as well as the associated quantum weight. Furthermore, we present a layer-dependent evolution of the quantum metric and its interplay with the electric field in this material. Our results establish few-layer phosphorene as a promising platform for exploring control over the quantum metric and the resulting metric responses in real materials.

We apply the theory to an experimental ODMR spectrum associated with the negatively-charged silicon vacancy V2 center in 6H-SiC, showing that spin Hamiltonian parameters, optical transition rates, and even coherence times may be extracted, with values consistent with recent literature. Notably the $T_2$ spin coherence time is measurable, not just the $T_2^*$ dephasing time. Furthermore, we simulate the ODMR spectra of a V2 center in isotopically-purified 6H-SiC, and predict an order-of-magnitude narrowing of some, but not all spectral lines compared with natural abundance samples.

Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework in which a one-dimensional (1D) tight-binding model incorporating unconventional magnetic order together with Rashba and Ising spin-orbit couplings are considered to realize two key phenomena in condensed matter systems: topological superconductivity and the superconducting diode effect (SDE). We first elucidate the underlying band topology of the normal-state Hamiltonian and subsequently introduce an on-site attractive Hubbard interaction. Performing a a self-consistent mean-field analysis, we establish superconducting order parameters in both the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing channels. Intriguingly, both pairing states can support topological superconductivity, characterized by a nontrivial winding number, and lead to the emergence of four zero-energy Majorana modes localized at the ends of the 1D chain. The FFLO state further gives rise to an intrinsic field-free SDE, manifested as a nonreciprocal supercurrent and quantified by the diode efficiency $η$. Notably, our model yields a large diode efficiency $η\sim 65\%$, highlighting its potential for realising topological superconductivity and highly efficient superconducting devices.

Motivation: Exploring graphene's response under non-equilibrium conditions using advanced optical and time-resolved techniques provides insights into novel states of matter with potential applications in spintronics and energy conversion.

Result: Graphene exhibits Floquet Chern insulators at high frequencies and zero-resistance states at low frequencies, with distinct conductivities and current patterns.

Conclusion: These findings open avenues for manipulating graphene's electronic states through light, enabling new electronic devices and materials.

Abstract: Recent advances in optics and time-resolved techniques have facilitated the exploration of new states of matter under nonequilibrium conditions. Here, we predict that irradiated graphene can host two novel nonequilibrium steady states of matter with zero resistance when exposed to circularly polarized light: (i) Floquet Chern insulators and (ii) a radiation-induced zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution. Specifically, we calculate nonequilibrium anomalous Hall and longitudinal conductivities to map the nonequilibrium phase diagram of irradiated graphene as a function of the driving frequency and the electric-field strength of circularly polarized light. As a result, Floquet Chern insulators are found to occur at high driving frequencies above the graphene band width. By contrast, at low driving frequencies below the graphene band width, the nonequilibrium anomalous Hall conductivity deviates from the expected quantized values, and the nonequilibrium longitudinal conductivity exhibits highly irregular behavior, including negative resistance. It is predicted that the thermodynamically unstable negative resistance will trigger a catastrophic breakdown, inducing a zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution, similar to the radiation-induced zero-resistance state observed in quantum Hall systems.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of nonreciprocal dissipationless supercurrents in one-dimension manifested through the superconducting diode effect (SDE) and the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in the absence of any external magnetic field, where inversion symmetry (IS) and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) can be intrinsically broken by spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and altermagnetism (AM), respectively. We investigate Ising and Rashba SOC separately in two models where two-component AM, assembled with crystallographic angle, can lead to qualitatively similar indirect band-gap closing and non-reciprocal supercurrent in a Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconductor. Interestingly, in the absence of the above SOCs, SDE persists and the sign of efficiency can be altered by tuning the angle only. Parallel spin components with complementary momentum functions, ensuring the breaking of IS and TRS, can induce SDE in the presence of FF pairing. Continuing the analysis in the context of JDE, we explore the interplay between SOCs and AM with the p-wave and Fulde-Ferrell superconductivity in three different setups. The bulk bands contributes to the non-reciprocity in the case of p-wave superconductivity while JDE is dominated by Andreev bound states for FF superconductivity. Importantly, JDE continues to exist due to finite momentum Cooper pair even without AM and SOC unlike the p-wave superconductivity. The sign of JD efficiency can be tuned with angle for p-wave superconductivity while absence of such sign reversal is a hallmark signature of FF superconductivity. Similar to SDE, parallel spin components in conjunction with p-wave superconductivity can lead to JDE that can also be mediated by only FF pairing in the absence of SOC and AM.

Abstract: We derive the interatomic spin-orbit interaction (SOI) from a helical atomic chain composed of $p$-orbitals with intra-atomic SOI, which exhibits a helical state--a potential origin of the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. In this model, a strong crystal field in the tangential direction of the helix leads to the formation of energetically separated $σ$- and $π$-bands. In the second-order process, a spin in the $σ$-orbital virtually hops to the $π$-orbital, flips its direction due to intra-atomic SOI, and then hops back to the $σ$-orbital in the neighboring atom due to the misalignment of $p$-orbitals along the helix. This process induces an interatomic SOI in the $σ$-band, which takes the form of a Rashba-type SOI generated by an electric field normal to the helical axis. The magnitude of the SOI is proportional to the curvature, the hopping energy, the intra-atomic SOI energy, and inversely proportional to the crystal field strength. The second-order process also induces long-range second-nearest-neighbor hoppings. We analytically derive the spin-split band structure in the zero-torsion limit.

Abstract: We present a real-space spectral method for computing the orbital magnetization of crystals. Starting from the commutator form of the orbital magnetization operator, we formulate an energy-resolved spectral function that is amenable to exact Chebyshev polynomial expansions and yields the total magnetization upon integration up to the Fermi level. This avoids the need for computing eigenstates and ground-state projects, providing an efficient numerical framework that is applicable to very large systems even in the presence of disorder and temperature. Our approach is benchmarked on the Haldane model, finding results that are in excellent agreement with the modern $k$-space formulation of orbital magnetization. Leveraging this technique, we extend our study to systems with uncorrelated disorder and point defects, and further show that the bulk Chern number can be directly obtained from the magnetization spectral density. These results open a promising route to investigate orbital responses and topological transitions in real-space models of quantum materials with realistic complexity.

Abstract: Quantum dots can confine single electrons or holes to define spin qubits that can be operated with high fidelity. Experimental work has progressed from linear to two-dimensional arrays of quantum dots, enabling qubit interactions that are essential for quantum simulation and computation. Here, we explore architectures beyond planar geometries by constructing quantum dot arrays in three dimensions. We realize an eight-quantum dot system in a silicon-germanium heterostructure comprising two stacked germanium quantum wells, where quantum dots are positioned at the vertices of a cuboid. Using electrostatic gate control, we load a single hole into any of the eight quantum dots. To demonstrate the potential of multilayer quantum dot systems, we show coherent spin control and hopping-induced spin rotations by shuttling between the quantum wells. The ability to extend quantum dot arrays in three dimensions provides opportunities for novel quantum hardware and high-connectivity quantum circuits.

Abstract: The non Hermitian skin effect, where bulk states accumulate at system boundaries, challenges the conventional bulk boundary correspondence. Here we propose a scheme to realize hybrid skin topological states in exciton polariton honeycomb lattices by introducing sublattice dependent gain and loss. This non Hermiticity couples with the intrinsic topological edge modes, leading to relocalization of edge states. We show two distinct regimes: hybrid skin Chern states with switchable localization controlled by TE TM splitting , and hybrid skin antichiral states which preserves the spin polarized property. Our results bridge polariton spin physics and non-Hermitian topology, opening routes toward controllable non reciprocal and spin polarized transport.

Abstract: Topologically ordered states are among the most interesting quantum phases of matter that host emergent quasi-particles having fractional charge and obeying fractional quantum statistics. Theoretical study of such states is however challenging owing to their strong-coupling nature that prevents conventional mean-field treatment. Here, we demonstrate that an attention-based deep neural network provides an expressive variational wavefunction that discovers fractional Chern insulator ground states purely through energy minimization without prior knowledge and achieves remarkable accuracy. We introduce an efficient method to extract ground state topological degeneracy -- a hallmark of topological order -- from a single optimized real-space wavefunction in translation-invariant systems by decomposing it into different many-body momentum sectors. Our results establish neural network variational Monte Carlo as a versatile tool for discovering strongly correlated topological phases.

Motivation: High-energy physics requires accurate and efficient particle shower simulations, which are computationally expensive. Traditional methods like Geant4 are too slow, and machine learning solutions often require retraining for each detector design. There is a need for a more general and efficient simulation framework.

Method: A transfer learning framework for generative calorimeter simulation using point clouds is developed. The model is pre-trained on the International Large Detector and can adapt to new configurations without re-voxelizing shower data for each geometry. A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method using bias-only adaptation is employed, which updates only 17% of the model parameters.

Result: The framework achieves a 44% improvement in the geometric mean of Wasserstein distance on the CaloChallenge dataset when using only 100 target-domain samples. Fine-tuning with bias-only adaptation maintains competitive performance while significantly reducing the number of parameters updated.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of transfer learning in improving the efficiency and adaptability of calorimeter simulations. The framework provides a foundational approach for advancing point cloud-based simulation methods in high-energy physics.

Abstract: Accurate particle shower simulation remains a critical computational bottleneck for high-energy physics. Traditional Monte Carlo methods, such as Geant4, are computationally prohibitive, while existing machine learning surrogates are tied to specific detector geometries and require complete retraining for each design change or alternative detector. We present a transfer learning framework for generative calorimeter simulation models that enables adaptation across diverse geometries with high data efficiency. Using point cloud representations and pre-training on the International Large Detector detector, our approach handles new configurations without re-voxelizing showers for each geometry. On the CaloChallenge dataset, transfer learning with only 100 target-domain samples achieves a $44\%$ improvement on the geometric mean of Wasserstein distance over training from scratch. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning with bias-only adaptation achieves competitive performance while updating only $17\%$ of model parameters. Our analysis provides insight into adaptation mechanisms for particle shower development, establishing a baseline for future progress of point cloud approaches in calorimeter simulation.

Abstract: AlGaAs/GaAs coatings are being considered as coating candidates for gravitational-wave detectors. In this paper we investigate the birefringence properties of this crystalline semiconductor material by modulating the optical illumination on the mirror coating and monitoring the induced birefringence. While the measured low-frequency birefringence values align with previous studies, we observed a frequency-dependent behavior in the illumination-to-birefringence coupling, characterized by a pole increasing with illumination intensity and a DC gain decreasing with illumination intensity. We developed a theoretical mode based on a master equation to characterize the measurement results by considering photon-induced electric fields and electro-optical effects. This model reproduces the frequency and intensity dependencies of the induced birefringence. Additionally, this model predicts a generation-recombination noise (GR noise) will be observable in the coatings birefringence. While the presented measurement cannot predict the exact level of GR noise, for the frequency band and spot sizes relevant for gravitational-wave detectors we expect GR noise to be white below the pole frequency, scale with power the same way laser shot noise does, and for fixed power be independent of spot size.

Motivation: Understanding the combined effects of ionizing and electromagnetic pulse irradiation on NPN bipolar transistors is crucial for designing radiation-hardened circuits in harsh environments.

Method: The study employed both experimental and TCAD simulation methods to investigate the physical mechanisms involved.

Result: The combined effects of CEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation enhance the individual effects, while BEMP and X-ray's combined effect closely resembles BEMP alone. Simultaneous CEMP and X-ray increase drift and diffusion photocurrents at the collector junction, whereas BEMP and X-ray result in negligible photocurrents.

Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance of injection location in achieving effective radiation-hardening for bipolar circuits under combined electromagnetic and photon irradiation effects.

Abstract: Combined effects of transient ionizing and electromagnetic pulse on vertical NPN bipolar transistor were experimentally investigated under pulsed X-ray irradiation. Technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation method was also employed to explore the underlying physical mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the collector (CEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation exceeds the linear superposition of their individual effects. Conversely, the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the base (BEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation aligns closely with the results observed under BEMP acting alone. Mechanism analysis reveals that when CEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, there is a significant increase in both the drift photocurrent at the collector junction and the diffusion photocurrent near the collector junction. However, when BEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, these photocurrent components remain small, leading to a combined effect similar to the results observed when BEMP acts alone. These findings provide critical insights for the radiation-hardening design of bipolar circuits in harsh radiation environments.

Abstract: High-energy gamma-ray spectroscopy is crucial for studying and advancing the application of high-energy photons in areas like strong-field physics, high-energy-density science, and laboratory astrophysics. However, high-energy gamma-ray spectroscopy in the multi-MeV to GeV range faces significant challenges in precise spectral reconstruction. This study presents a machine learning-based inversion approach that combines a spectrometer design with advanced deconvolution algorithms. We develop a gamma-ray spectrometer optimized through Monte Carlo simulations for maximum positron yield and minimal noise. A two-stage neural network framework is proposed based on the structure of the spectrometer: a denoising autoencoder suppresses statistical noise in measured positron spectra, while a U-Net architecture solves the ill-posed inverse problem to reconstruct incident gamma spectra. This approach establishes a new methodology for gamma-ray diagnostics in strong-field QED experiments and high-energy photon sources.

Abstract: We present E-CAHORS $-$ a compact mid-infrared open-path diode-laser spectrometer designed for the simultaneous measurement of carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor concentrations in the near-surface atmospheric layer. These measurements, combined with simultaneous data from a three-dimensional anemometer, can be used to determine fluxes using the eddy-covariance method. The instrument utilizes two interband cascade lasers operating at 2.78 $μ$m and 3.24 $μ$m within a novel four-pass M-shaped optical cell, which provides high signal power and long-term field operation without requiring active air sampling. Two detection techniques $-$ tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) and a simplified wavelength modulation spectroscopy (sWMS) $-$ were implemented and evaluated. Laboratory calibration demonstrated linear responses for all gases (R$^2$ $\approx$ 0.999) and detection precisions at 10 Hz of 311 ppb for CO$_2$, 8.87 ppb for CH$_4$, and 788 ppb for H$_2$O. Field tests conducted at a grassland site near Moscow showed strong correlations (R = 0.91 for CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, R = 0.67 for CH$_4$) with commercial LI-COR LI-7200 and LI-7700 analyzers. The TDLAS mode demonstrated lower noise and greater stability under outdoor conditions, while sWMS provided baseline-free spectra but was more sensitive to power fluctuations. E-CAHORS combines high precision, multi-species sensing capability with low power consumption (10 W) and a compact design (4.2 kg).

Abstract: Time Projection Chambers equipped with Gas Electron Multipliers and optical readout by scientific CMOS cameras are a promising technology for low-energy particle detection, as demonstrated by the CYGNO experiment. To help identify the optimal CYGNO detector configuration, we performed a detailed characterization of two state-of-the-art scientific CMOS sensors, focusing on dark-signal behavior across different exposure times and on detection sensitivity, assessed using the well-defined X-ray emissions from a 55Fe source, which reproduce the low-light conditions expected in CYGNO.
  CYGNO currently employs a very low-noise Hamamatsu sensor, the ORCA-Fusion, for testing and validation of its detection system. Hamamatsu has recently introduced two new sensors that may be of interest for future upgrades. The first is an improved version of the current model, the ORCA-Fusion-BT, featuring a back-illuminated design that reaches a quantum efficiency of up to 95% at 550 nm. The second is a next-generation sensor, the ORCA-Quest. Although its peak quantum efficiency is not as high as that of the Fusion-BT, it offers high sensitivity over a broader spectral range, extending into the ultraviolet region, and provides ultra-low readout noise of 0.27 electrons, about 2.6 times lower than that of the Fusion family.
  These two sensors therefore represent a significant opportunity to enhance the performance of scientific experiments, including those conducted by the CYGNO collaboration. This document presents a comprehensive characterization of these sensors to evaluate their relevance for experiments operating in photon-limited environments and their suitability for integration into the CYGNO detector system.

Abstract: We study the relaxation process of a resonant Bose gas under the influence of Gaussian white noise. We characterize the system dynamics in terms of the polarization or imbalance between the atoms and molecules, and the system coherence. The relaxation times corresponding to these two quantities are studied both using a mean-field model, and a Born Green Kirkwood Yvon hierarchy that takes into account the higher-order correlations. The role of the initial polarization and the Feshbach detuning are investigated. It is found with an increasing initial population imbalance, the longituidinal relaxation time (that governs the dyanamics of the polarization) grows, while the transverse relaxation time (that governs the dynamics of the coherence) decays. As for the varying Feshbach detuning, it is observed that the longituidinal relaxation time reaches its minima and its transverse counterpart reaches its maxima near the resonance. We also study how the initial polarization and the detuning affect physical quantities like drift speed, condensate fraction, fidelity and entanglement entropy etc, and find the results to be fully consistent with the behavior of the relaxation dynamics of the system.

Abstract: We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral form factor and the power spectrum for externally impressed rotating bosons in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential. Our focus is on the spectral correlations arising from the condensate depletion as a result of the formation of quantized vortices and the strong interaction, which leads to chaos in the system. We consider two distinct interaction regimes: moderate, where the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, and strong, where it is comparable. For the non-rotating case, the spectral form factor (SFF) in the moderate interaction regime exhibits a dip-plateau structure characteristic of integrable systems, while in the strong interaction regime it develops a weak ramp, signalling a transition to pseudo-integrable behavior. For the rotating single-vortex state, the SFF in the moderate interaction regime shows the onset of a weak ramp consistent with pseudo-integrability, whereas in the strong interaction regime the ramp becomes significantly more pronounced, indicating strongly chaotic behavior. For the multi-vortex states in the strong interacting regime, the SFF exhibits a clear dip-ramp-plateau structure, indicative of chaotic behavior. The corresponding power spectrum results further corroborate these findings: integrable system exhibits the characteristic $1/f^α$ (with $α\approx2$) noise, chaotic system shows the ubiquitous $1/f^α$ (with $α\approx 1$) noise, and pseudo-integrable system yields intermediate exponents with $1 < α< 2$.

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the evolution of four vortex configurations, namely, dipole, plasma, cluster, and lattice, using the two-dimensional mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation, focusing on their dynamical decay and approach to the equilibrium. Our analysis reveals that the cluster vortex configuration reaches equilibrium more rapidly than the others, while the dipole, plasma, and lattice configurations exhibit persistent non-equilibrium behavior, tending toward non-thermal fixed points. Specifically, the cluster configuration follows Kolmogorov-like scaling ($\varepsilon^{i}(k)\sim k^{-5/3}$) in the incompressible spectrum, while the other configurations follow Vinen-like scaling ($\varepsilon^{i}(k)\sim k^{-1}$). In the compressible spectrum, the cluster case exhibits a $k$ scaling, indicating full mode equilibration, while for the other configurations, the modes thermalize only above a critical wave number. Additionally, the transfer function for the cluster configuration displays a Gaussian distribution, typical of equilibrium states, while the other configurations exhibit skewed Gaussian or exponential distributions, indicative of their non-equilibrium nature. Finally, the particle number spectra show that the cluster case follows dynamical scaling closer to equilibrium, while the dipole, plasma, and lattice configurations evolve towards non-thermal fixed points. Our findings provide new insights into the dynamics of vortex configurations and their approach to equilibrium or non-equilibrium states, offering guidance for future studies on quantum turbulence and its control.

Abstract: We consider the behavior of a small density of mobile impurities (polarons) immersed in a quantum gas, a generic scenario that can be realized in cold atomic gases, liquid helium mixtures and doped semiconductors. We present a unified theoretical framework for understanding polaron quasiparticles beyond the single-impurity limit, and we identify two key factors that control the polaron-polaron interactions: (i) the statistics of the impurities, including whether or not they are degenerate, and (ii) the constraints on the medium response, i.e., whether the medium density or chemical potential is held fixed. By constructing wave functions for two bosonic, fermionic, or distinguishable impurities immersed in a Bose or Fermi gas, we derive rigorous results for the polaron interactions in the limit of weak impurity-medium coupling. We furthermore obtain an exact relationship between the polaron interactions at fixed medium density and at fixed chemical potential, a result which is valid for arbitrary interaction strength. Our work provides an important guide for understanding experiments, and it acts as a starting point for future strong-coupling theories of polaron interactions that capture all of the effects identified in this work.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a dynamical pairing mechanism other than the pair-wise interactions. Starting from a two-dimensional hard-core boson model with periodically modulated hopping amplitude, we derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian with three-site interactions that are responsible for unconventional pairing between adjacent bosons. By performing a density matrix renormalization group study on this three-site interacting Hamiltonian, we reveal a bosonic pair condensate with $p_x+ ip_y$ symmetry, while the single-particle Bose-Einstein condensate is completely depleted. The experimental implementations of the proposed model on polar molecular systems and superconducting quantum circuit have also been discussed.

Abstract: In magnetic topological materials, time-reversal symmetry breaking gives rise to topological point and line nodes with distinctive signatures in the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivity that satisfy the well-known Mott relation. However, this relationship can fail for doping-dependent transport measurements of materials with complex magnetism, topology, and electronic correlations. In this work, we present transport measurements of the correlated topological metal UCoAl doped with Ru, which appear to violate the Mott relation. We develop a model that captures the evolution of Stoner magnetism and topological Weyl points as a function of doping. Using this model, we show how the correlated flat band in this material pins the Weyl points to the Fermi energy, and demonstrate how this explains the unusual doping-dependent behavior of the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivities in this material, while the Mott relation is in fact satisfied at each doping level.

### [192] [Robust semiclassical magnetization plateau in the kagome lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00223)
*Gabriel Capelo,Eric C. Andrade*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper studies the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice under an external magnetic field. A robust $1/3$ semiclassical magnetization plateau is found, stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Spin-wave theory is used to calculate the plateau width, and it shows a weak dependence on $J_2$. Additionally, a magnetization jump at saturation is identified when $J_2 = 0$, associated with a flat band. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of a semiclassical approach for understanding the $1/3$ plateau.

Motivation: The motivation for this work is to investigate the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice inspired by recent observations of the $1/3$ magnetization plateau in kagome-based magnets.

Method: The method used in this paper is the use of spin-wave theory to study the magnetization plateau and the saturation field.

Result: The results of the paper include the observation of a $1/3$ magnetization plateau with weak dependence on $J_2$, a magnetization jump at saturation when $J_2 = 0$, and the calculation of the plateau width using nonlinear spin-wave theory.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this paper shows that a semiclassical approach is effective for capturing the $1/3$ magnetization plateau in the kagome lattice.

Abstract: Inspired by recent observations of the $1/3$ magnetization plateau in kagome-based magnets, we investigate the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice under the influence of an external magnetic field. Although the classical ground state at zero field depends on the sign of $J_2$, we find a robust $1/3$ semiclassical magnetization plateau in both cases. The mechanism that stabilizes this plateau is analogous to that observed in the triangular lattice, where quantum fluctuations select a collinear state from the degenerate classical manifold. We calculate the plateau width, which shows a weak dependence on $J_2$, using nonlinear spin-wave theory. Additionally, we find that a straightforward approach based on linear spin-wave yields quantitatively accurate results even for $S=1/2$. Furthermore, we identify a magnetization jump at the saturation field when $J_2=0$; this jump is related to the presence of a flat band and disappears for $J_2 \neq 0$. Our study demonstrates that a semiclassical approach effectively captures the $1/3$ plateau in the kagome lattice and serves as a valuable tool for interpreting experimental and numerical results alike.

TL;DR: Synthesis under magnetic fields (magnetosynthesis) can significantly influence the crystal structure and magnetic properties of various Cu²⁺ materials, including simple antiferromagnets, canted antiferromagnets, frustrated antiferromagnets, and quantum spin liquids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of synthesis conditions on material properties is crucial for designing new materials with tailored magnetic behaviors, especially in the field of quantum materials research.

Method: The study involves synthesizing copper-based materials under controlled magnetic fields (0.09–0.37 T) using hydrothermal or evaporative methods. Techniques like X-ray crystallography and neutron scattering are used to analyze structural and magnetic properties.

Result: Applying small magnetic fields during synthesis leads to structural changes and modifies magnetic transitions, such as reducing the Néel temperature of atacamite by 3% and strengthening its antiferromagnetic interactions. These findings suggest that magnetosynthesis can influence the ground state of moderately frustrated materials.

Conclusion: The results highlight the significant role of synthesis under magnetic fields in altering the properties of copper-based materials, providing insights into the design of new materials with enhanced magnetic properties.

Abstract: Subtle synthetic variables can have an outsizes influence on the crystal structure and magnetic properties of a material, particularly those of quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the impact of synthesis under a magnetic field (magnetosynthesis) on the crystal structure and magnetic properties of several Cu$^{2+}$ ($S=1/2$) based materials with antiferromagnetic interactions and varying levels of magnetic frustration, from simple antiferromagnets to a quantum spin liquid. We employ small (0.09 - 0.37 T) magnetic fields applied during low-temperature hydrothermal or evaporative synthesis of the simple antiferromagnet CuCl$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O, the canted antiferromagnet (Cu,Zn)$_3$Cl$_4$(OH)$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O, the frustrated and canted antiferromagnet atacamite Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Cl, and the highly frustrated quantum spin liquid herbertsmithite Cu$_3$Zn(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$. We found that (Cu,Zn)$_3$Cl$_4$(OH)$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O experiences structural changes well above its magnetic transition. Atacamite Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Cl synthesized under a 0.19 T field experiences a 0.15 K (~3%) decrease in its Néel transition temperature and a significant strengthening of its antiferromagnetic interactions, suggesting that magnetosynthesis can influence the ground state of moderately frustrated materials.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel quantum Monte Carlo method to compute the subleading logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy of (2+1)d systems, specifically along paths connecting the Ising and Gaussian quantum critical points. They validate their approach by comparing with analytic results and compute the corner EE for a path leading to a first-order transition, demonstrating the method's reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the entanglement entropy, especially its subleading terms, is crucial for gaining insights into quantum phases and phase transitions in many-body systems. This paper addresses a significant challenge in the field by developing a new computational method to compute these terms in (2+1)d systems.

Method: The authors propose a 'bubble basis' projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm. This method capitalizes on recent algorithmic advances to stably calculate entanglement entropy as an exponential observable. By eliminating the dominant area-law term, the algorithm promotes the subleading logarithmic term to the leading contribution in the entanglement entropy calculation.

Result: The study successfully calculates the universal corner entanglement entropy (EE) along paths connecting the Ising and Gaussian quantum critical points in a (2+1)d transverse-field Ising model with a four-body interaction. The results align with analytic predictions for the Gaussian QCP, and they explore a path leading to a first-order transition, further validating their method.

Conclusion: This work establishes a reliable computational framework for extracting elusive subleading entanglement properties in (2+1)d quantum many-body systems. The ability to compute such terms bridges the gap between exactly solvable limits and strongly correlated systems, offering new insights into quantum phases and phase transitions.

Abstract: Computing the subleading logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy (EE) of (2+1)d quantum many-body systems remains a significant challenge, despite its critical role in revealing universal information about quantum states and quantum critical points (QCPs). Capitalizing on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable, we develop a {\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner EE along a parameter trajectory connecting the Ising and Gaussian QCPs; where in the latter case there exists an analytic value to benchmark with. Our approach eliminates the dominant area-law term directly within the QMC sampling, thereby promoting the coveted subleading logarithmic term to the leading contribution. We apply this technique to calculate the EE in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction, tracing a path from the Ising to the Gaussian QCPs and then to the first-order transition. The consistent values obtained for the universal corner EE along the path validate the reliability and precision of our approach for extracting challenging entanglement properties. These results establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.

Abstract: Chirality characterizes the asymmetry between a structure and its mirror image and underlies a wide range of chiral functionalities. In crystallographically chiral materials, phonons with non-zero linear momentum $\textbf{k}$ can acquire a $k$-induced longitudinal magnetization, giving rise to chiral phonons. Helical spin order, with its proper screw-type configuration, breaks all mirror symmetries and therefore carries magnetic chirality. Such helical spins also generate non-relativistic spin splitting for any quasiparticle excitations propagating along the screw axis. To explore the possible connection between chiral phonons and magnetic chirality, we investigated the crystallographically polar and chiral compound (Mn,Ni)$_3$TeO$_6$, which hosts three distinct states: a paramagnetic state, a helical spin state with magnetic chirality, and a collinear spin state without magnetic chirality. We find an approximately tenfold enhancement of chiral-phonon coupling in the helical spin state along the screw axis, compared with both the paramagnetic and collinear spin states. These results identify a new route to amplify chiral phonons through an altermagnetic effect arising from the broken parity-time symmetry in helical spins. %from non-relativistic spin splitting.

Abstract: Heavy-fermion superconductors often display upper critical fields that exceed the conventional Pauli paramagnetic limit, indicating that strong correlations and hybridized quasiparticle bands play an essential role in the paramagnetic pair-breaking process. Within the two-dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg model, we perform a self-consistent mean-field analysis of spin-singlet s-, extended-s-, and d-wave pairing under Zeeman fields, and compute the critical field Bc, the transition temperature Tc, and the Clogston-Chandrasekhar ratio rCC. We find that rCC increases sharply as the conduction filling approaches half filling. This enhancement arises from the weakly dispersive region of the lower hybridized band, where the strongly reduced Fermi velocity diminishes the normal-state paramagnetic energy and stabilizes superconductivity. At fixed filling, the distinct JH dependences among the three pairing channels reflect the sensitivity of Pauli limiting to both band curvature and the structure of the order parameter. These results provide microscopic evidence that proximity to a near-flat hybridized band offers a robust route to enhanced Pauli-limiting fields in heavy-fermion superconductors.

Abstract: Recent variational studies have demonstrated that the strongly correlated ground states of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect can be captured using machine learning approaches starting from no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We introduce a complementary framework that instead starts from Jain's composite-fermion (CF) wavefunctions, which accurately describe FQH states as weakly interacting states of CFs at fillings $ν= n/(2pn+1)$ in an idealized limit. As we move away from this idealized limit to one more in line with experimental reality, we expect CFs to become dressed much like the electrons of a noninteracting system, which are dressed by neutral excitations as interaction is turned on adiabatically, as in Landau's Fermi-liquid theory. We model this dressing using a Feynman-Cohen-style backflow approach, implemented through symmetry-preserving neural networks-a framework we refer to as CF-Flow. CF-Flow achieves competitive accuracy with substantially greater computational efficiency and scales to systems of $\gtrsim 26$ electrons. At fillings $ν= 1/3$ and $2/5$, as a function of Landau-level mixing strength, CF-Flow produces ground-state energies with low local-energy variance that are nearly indistinguishable from those obtained using the fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo (fp-DMC) method, even though the latter constrains the wavefunction phase to that of the lowest Landau level-thereby providing insight into why fp-DMC has been successful in giving an accurate quantitative account of several experiments. Finally, the symmetry-preserving architecture of CF-Flow enables access to excited states and computation of the transport gap at $ν= 1/3$, where we find, unexpectedly, that it decays exponentially toward a finite value in the limit of large Landau-level mixing, suggesting a first-order transition from the FQH liquid to a non-FQH state.

Abstract: We study interaction-driven crossover from a correlated metallic state to Mott-insulating state on the half-filled 3x3 square cluster using exact diagonalization in the S=1/2 and S=3/2 sectors. Using complementary diagnostics such as order parameters, principal component analysis (PCA) of correlation matrices and quantum geometry, we obtain a unified, data-driven characterization of the crossover. All three diagnostics consistently identify a broad crossover centered in the weak-to-intermediate coupling regime U~2-6; charge gaps open rapidly, double occupancy suppresses, local moments form, entanglement is significantly reduced, PCA concentrates variance into a few dominant modes and the distance matrices reveals rapid wavefunction reorganization. Our multi-pronged approach establishes the Mott crossover as a smooth but well defined reorganization of electronic correlations with pronounced spin-sector dependence in finite systems.

Abstract: We study the ferromagnetic instability in an SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard model on the hypercubic lattice. Combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find that, in the strong-coupling regime at low temperatures, ferromagnetically ordered (FM) states develop away from the commensurate fillings. In the particle-doped SU($3$) system near one-third filling, the FM state is accompanied by a spontaneous flavor-selective Mott state, where two of the three flavors are Mott insulating while the remaining flavor is metallic. Since particles in the metallic flavor can almost freely move on the lattice without correlation effects, the ordered state is stabilized by the kinetic-energy gain of the doped particles. This is similar to the generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism discussed in the one-hole-doped system at one-third filling. In the SU($4$) case, we find that six distinct types of FM states appear as the particle density varies. The results uncover the nature of the FM state in the SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems and highlight the rich magnetic behavior enabled by enlarged internal symmetries.

Abstract: An altermagnet is a recently identified class of magnets that exhibit a zero net magnetic moment but break symmetry under the combined operations of parity and time reversal. It typically consists of two magnetic sites of opposite spins related by rotation within the unit cell. Here, we use circular dichroism (CD) in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to identify a new form of altermagnetism, namely bi-altermagnetism, in the correlated insulator Fe2Mo3O8, which comprises two altermagnetic sublattices: one with alternating quasi-octahedral Fe environments and the other with alternating tetrahedral Fe environments. We experimentally revealed the emergence of CD in an achiral, zero-magnetization system, thereby probing mirror-symmetry breaking associated with altermagnetic order. Notably, the CD appeared at sublattice-specific excitations of the octahedral and tetrahedral sites, indicating symmetry breaking in both altermagnetic sublattices. Calculations based on a model with the bi-altermagnetic order along the c axis successfully reproduce the observed CD. Our findings provide compelling evidence for bi-altermagnetism in Fe2Mo3O8, and showcase the use of RIXS-CD as a probe of magnetic sublattices in systems with zero net magnetization.

Abstract: We use inelastic neutron scattering to study the impact of Li doping on the semiconducting altermagnet $α$-MnTe. Introducing Li results in a spin reorientation from in-plane to out-of-plane and increases the density of itinerant carriers. While the spin waves in Li-doped $α$-MnTe remain largely Heisenberg-like, there is significant spin wave broadening across the entire Brillouin zone, signaling enhanced magnon damping induced by itinerant carriers. By extracting the local dynamic susceptibility and applying the total moment sum rule, we find that both undoped and Li-doped $α$-MnTe exhibit the full expected Mn$^{2+}$ local moment of $\approx5.9~μ_\mathrm{B}$ with $S=5/2$. These results demonstrate that Li-doped $α$-MnTe hosts robust local-moment magnetism whose interactions are mediated via Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida-type interactions, highlighting the importance of itinerant carriers in magneto-transport and spin dynamic properties of altermagnets.

Abstract: The problem of a mobile hole doped into an antiferromagnet Mott insulator is believed to underly the rich physics of several paradigmatic strongly correlated electron systems, ranging from heavy fermions to high-Tc superconductivity. Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-Néel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories.

Abstract: Owing to their exceptional chemical and electronic tunability, metal-organic frameworks can be designed to develop magnetic ground states making a range of applications feasible, from magnetic gas separation to the implementation of lightweight, rare-earth free permanent magnets. However, the typically weak exchange interactions mediated by the diamagnetic organic ligands result in ordering temperatures confined to the cryogenic limit. The itinerant magnetic ground state realized in the chromium-based framework Cr(tri)$_{2}$(CF$_{3}$SO$_{3}$)$_{0.33}$ (Htri, $1H$-$1$,$2$,$3$-triazole) is a remarkable exception to this trend, showing a robust ferromagnetic behavior almost at ambient conditions. Here, we use dc SQUID magnetometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and ferromagnetic resonance to study the magnetic state realized in this material. We highlight several thermally-activated relaxation mechanisms for the nuclear magnetization due to the tendency of electrons towards localization at low temperatures as well as the rotational dynamics of the charge-balancing triflate ions confined within the pores. Most interestingly, we report the development within the paramagnetic regime of mesoscopic magnetic correlated clusters whose slow dynamics in the MHz range are tracked by the nuclear moments, in agreement with the highly unconventional nature of the magnetic transition detected by dc SQUID magnetometry. We discuss the similarity between the clustered phase in the paramagnetic phase and the magnetoelectronic phase segregation leading to colossal magnetoresistance in manganites and cobaltites. These results demonstrate that high-temperature magnetic metal-organic frameworks can serve as a versatile platform for exploring correlated electron phenomena in low-density, chemically tunable materials.

Abstract: The frequency structure of the superconducting correlations in cuprates gives insights on the pairing mechanism. Here we present an exhaustive study of this problem in the two-dimensional Hubbard model with cellular dynamical mean-field theory. To this end, we systematically quantify the dependence on doping and interaction strength of the superconducting gap, of the frequency scales where pairing occurs, and of their relative contribution to pairing. We find pair-forming alternating with pair-breaking processes as a function of frequency, providing new evidence that pairing can arise in principle from both low- and high-frequency processes. However, we find that the high-frequency pair-forming processes are outweighed by pair-breaking ones. Hence, the net contribution to pairing comes only from the low-frequency pair-forming processes, a result that underscores their key role in the pairing mechanism.

Abstract: The formation of charge-density-wave order in Dirac fermion systems via electron-phonon coupling represents a significant topic in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon within the Holstein model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific focus on the effect of disorder. While the interplay between electron-electron interactions and disorder has long been a central theme in the field, recent attention has increasingly turned to the combined influence of disorder and electron-phonon coupling. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \(β_c\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, we observed a suppression of electron kinetic energy and dc conductivity under disorder, highlighting the role of Anderson localization in the degradation of electronic transport. These findings offer significant theoretical insight into the stability and critical phenomena of correlated phases in disordered two-dimensional systems.

Abstract: The prospect of merging the paradigms of geometric frustration on a triangular lattice and bond anisotropies in the strong spin-orbit coupling limit holds tremendous promise in the ongoing hunt for exotic quantum materials. Here we identify a new candidate system to realize such physics, the organic quantum antiferromagnet (CD$_3$ND$_3$)$_2$NaRuCl$_6$. We report a combination of thermodynamic, magneto-elastic and neutron scattering experiments on single-crystals to determine the phase diagram in axial magnetic fields $\mathbf{H \parallel c}$ and propose a minimal model Hamiltonian. (CD$_3$ND$_3$)$_2$NaRuCl$_6$ displays an ideal triangular arrangement of Ru$^{3+}$ ions adopting the spin-orbital entangled $j_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ state. It hosts residual magnetic order below $T_{\rm N} = 0.23$ K and a highly unusual $H-T$ phase diagram including three different incommensurate states. Spin-waves in the high-field polarized regime are well described by a Heisenberg-like triangular lattice Hamiltonian with a potential sub-leading bond dependent anisotropy term. We discuss possible candidate magnetic structures in the various observed phases and propose two mechanisms that could explain the field-dependent incommensurability, requiring either a small ferromagnetic Kitaev term or a tiny magneto-elastic $J-J'$ isosceles distortion driven by pseudospin-lattice coupling. We argue that the multi-$\mathbf{q}$ ground state in zero magnetic field is a prime candidate for hosting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex crystal proposed on the triangular Heisenberg-Kitaev model. (CD$_3$ND$_3$)$_2$NaRuCl$_6$ is the first member in an extended family of quantum triangular lattice magnets, providing a new playground to study the interplay of geometric frustration and spin-orbit effects.

TL;DR: We developed a framework to understand the stability of fractional Chern insulators by using machine learning to connect band geometry with physical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum phases of matter, especially fractional Chern insulators, is crucial for advancing quantum materials and potential applications in quantum computing.

Method: We used large-scale exact diagonalization and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks to analyze how band geometry influences FCI stability.

Result: Our method accurately predicts FCI stability (>80% accuracy) using simple descriptors, and it works well even when data is scarce.

Conclusion: This framework provides a new way to connect many-body phase stability with physical descriptors, aiding in the design of quantum phases.

Abstract: We develop an interpretable, data-driven framework to quantify how single-particle band geometry governs the stability of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Using large-scale exact diagonalization, we evaluate an FCI metric that yields a continuous spectral measure of FCI stability across parameter space. We then train Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) -- a recently developed interpretable neural architecture -- to regress this metric from two band-geometric descriptors: the trace violation $T$ and the Berry curvature fluctuations $σ_B$. Applied to spinless fermions at filling $ν=1/3$ in models on the checkerboard and kagome lattices, our approach yields compact analytical formulas that predict FCI stability with over $>80 \%$ accuracy in both regression and classification tasks, and remain reliable even in data-scarce regimes. The learned relations reveal model-dependent trends, clarifying the limits of Landau-level-mimicking heuristics. Our framework provides a general method for extracting simple, phenomenological "laws" that connect many-body phase stability to chosen physical descriptors, enabling rapid hypothesis formation and targeted design of quantum phases.

Motivation: Understanding unconventional spin couplings in polyoxovanadate materials for future spintronic applications.

Method: Combined experimental techniques (radio-frequency susceptometry, ESR) with high-pressure DFT simulations.

Result: Dimer spin phases and exchange mechanisms revealed, with non-linear magnetic behavior observed.

Conclusion: Pressure induces unique spin coupling, mediated by V(IV) oxidation states, with implications for spin-based electronic applications.

Abstract: We investigate the properties of CuVOF$_4$(H$_2$O)$_6$$\cdot$H$_2$O, in which two different spin species, Cu(II) and V(IV), form antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 dimers with weak interdimer coupling provided via hydrogen bonding. Using radio-frequency susceptometry and electron-spin resonance (ESR), we show how the temperature-magnetic field spin-dimer phase diagram evolves as a function of applied hydrostatic pressure and correlate this with pressure-induced changes to the crystal structure. These results, coupled with pressure-tuned DFT calculations, confirm the prior prediction that the primary exchange interaction is mediated via an unusual mechanism in which the V(IV) ions provide considerable spin density to the oxygen that joins the two spins in each dimer and which lies along the Jahn-Teller axis of the Cu(II) ion. In addition, the dissimilarity in the spins that make up each dimer unit leads to a non-linear field dependence of the electronic energy levels as detected in the ESR measurements.

Abstract: We develop tools of Bayesian inference on the moduli space of Calabi--Yau (CY) manifolds. We sample from the invariant Weil--Petersson (WP) measure using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and normalising flows on \Kahler moduli space with dimension up to $h^{1,1}=30$, and present results on the spectrum of the CY volume and properties of divisors when the measure is restricted in physically meaningful ways. We furthermore present a theory-informed prior on axion masses and decay constants $(m_a,f_a)$ marginalised over the WP measure for all inequivalent CYs constructable from the Kreuzer--Skarke database with $h^{1,1}\leq 5$. We then impose likelihoods based on axion physics. We demonstrate how detection of a relatively heavy QCD axion at small $h^{1,1}$, e.g. by ADMX, provides detailed information about CY geometry and topology. Finally, we compute a full forward model incorporating likelihoods from the cosmic microwave background and Lyman-alpha forest and find the maximum posterior probability region on the moduli space of a given CY favoured by a resolution of the tension in these data by an ultralight axion composing $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ of the dark matter. This demonstration serves as a blueprint for future statistical analyses within string phenomenology.

Abstract: We construct a simple two-dimensional holographic model of a closed "baby" universe. The baby universe spacetime originates from the black hole interior in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity. The holographic description is a low-temperature thermal pure state of two Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. The construction of the state relies on the insertion of a heavy matter operator, which supports the baby universe, together with a first-order thermal phase transition between a black hole phase and an empty Anti de Sitter (AdS) phase. For the transition, we employ a version of the Maldacena-Qi phase transition of two coupled SYK systems. The bulk entanglement between the AdS region and the baby universe remains O(N) below the transition, owing to the large number of light bulk fields. This entanglement admits a definition through coarse-graining over SYK couplings.

Abstract: Yang-Mills theory in AdS$_{4}$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions is expected to undergo a transition as the AdS radius varies, since the boundary data is incompatible with confinement in flat space. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the disappearance of the Dirichlet boundary condition. From the boundary viewpoint, the associated $3d$ CFT is a deformation of a generalised free theory of non-Abelian conserved currents, with the deformation governed by the bulk gauge coupling. We test these scenarios by deriving non-perturbative constraints from the numerical conformal bootstrap of the four-point function of non-Abelian conserved currents. We rule out the scenario in which the boundary current decouples. Bounds on the lightest scalar operators disfavour a bulk Higgs mechanism and instead point to a transition driven by a scalar singlet becoming marginal. We also obtain bounds on other scalar operators and on the current central charge, and we refine character-based techniques incorporating parity and charge-conjugation symmetry to determine the operator spectrum of the $3d$ Generalised Free Vector theory. These results may be of independent interest beyond Yang-Mills theory in AdS.

Abstract: The thermal partition function, $Z$, of a $CFT_d$ on $S^{d-1}$ is parameterized by the inverse temperature $β$ along with $\lfloor d/2\rfloor$ angular velocities $ω_i$. In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of this partition function when $n$ of the $ω_i$ are scaled to unity (the largest allowed value) at fixed values of the other $(\lfloor d/2\rfloor-n)$ angular velocities. We argue that $\ln Z$ develops a simple pole in $(1-ω_i)$ for each $ω_i$ that is scaled to unity. The residue of this product of poles is a theory dependent (so non-universal) function of $β$ and the fixed angular velocities. The inverse Laplace transformation of this partition function constrains the functional form of the field theory entropy as a function of charges in a limit in which angular momenta and the twist are scaled as follows. While $n$ special angular momenta $J_1\ldots J_n$ are scaled to infinity, the twist and the other angular momenta - collectively denoted $x_i$ - are also taken to infinity but at the slower rate that ensures that the scaled charges $x_i/(J_1 J_2 \ldots J_n)^{\frac{1}{n+1}}$ are held fixed. In this limit, we demonstrate that the scaled entropy $S/(J_1 J_2 \ldots J_n)^{\frac{1}{n+1}}$ depends only on the $\lfloor d/2\rfloor-n+1$ scaled charges defined above (the precise form of this dependence is non-universal). We verify our predictions (and compute all non-universal functions) in the case of free scalar theories (which show surprisingly rich behaviour) as well as large $N$, strongly coupled ${\cal N}=4$ Yang Mills theory. The last theory is analyzed in the bulk via the AdS/CFT correspondence. In the scaling limit described above, its phase diagram displays sharp phase transitions between black hole, grey galaxy, and thermal gas phases.

### [214] [Finite Gauss-Sum Modular Kernels: Scalar Gap and a Pure AdS$_3$ Gravity No-Go Theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00361)
*Miguel Tierz*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: We obtained closed-form expressions for the ST^nS modular kernels of non-rational Virasoro CFTs and constructed fully analytic modular-bootstrap functionals. These functionals were applied to provide a rigorous analytic bound on the spinless gap in the scalar channel of the ST^1S kernel and to prove an analytic no-go theorem for pure AdS_3 gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper deals with the modular bootstrap approach in two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), particularly focusing on the construction of functionals that can be used to derive bounds on physical quantities like the spinless gap.

Method: The authors developed closed-form expressions for the ST^nS modular kernels of non-rational Virasoro CFTs. These kernels were then used to construct modular-bootstrap functionals. The functionals were applied to analyze the scalar channel of the ST^1S kernel, leading to a rigorous bound on the spinless gap. Additionally, the functionals were applied to analyze the odd-spin ST kernel in pure AdS_3 gravity to prove a no-go theorem.

Result: The key results include: (1) the construction of finite-dimensional real basis for spectral kernels using Mordell integrals, leading to finite-support window functionals; (2) the derivation of a rigorous analytic bound on the spinless gap in the scalar channel of the ST^1S kernel; (3) the proof of an analytic no-go theorem for pure AdS_3 gravity, showing that no compact, unitary, Virasoro-only CFT_2 can have a primary gap above Δ_BTZ=(c-1)/12 because of a strictly positive 'Mordell surplus' in the odd-spin ST kernel, which forces an odd-spin primary below Δ_BTZ.

Conclusion: This work advances the modular bootstrap program by providing concrete tools for bounding physical quantities in 2D CFTs and applying them to derive fundamental constraints in pure AdS_3 gravity, demonstrating the power of modular bootstrap techniques in addressing questions about quantum gravity.

Abstract: We obtain closed-form expressions for the $ST^nS$ modular kernels of non-rational Virasoro CFTs and use them to construct fully analytic modular-bootstrap functionals. At rational width $τ$, the Mordell integrals in these kernels reduce to finite quadratic Gauss sums of $\operatorname{sech}/\sec$ profiles with explicit Weil phases, furnishing a canonical finite-dimensional real basis for spectral kernels. From this basis we build finite-support "window" functionals with $Φ(0)=1$ and $Φ(p)>0$ on a prescribed low-momentum interval. Applied to the scalar channel of the $ST^1S$ kernel, these functionals yield a rigorous analytic bound on the spinless gap. As a second application we prove an analytic no-go theorem for pure AdS$_3$ gravity: no compact, unitary, Virasoro-only CFT$_2$ can have a primary gap above $Δ_{\rm BTZ}=(c-1)/12$, because a strictly positive "Mordell surplus" in the odd-spin $ST$ kernel forces an odd-spin primary below $Δ_{\rm BTZ}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper explores the stability of spacetime dimensions using semiclassical gravity, which is important for understanding quantum gravity effects on spacetime structure.

Method: The authors use the Lichnerowicz equation in various dimensions and analyze semiclassical parameters like γ_d to assess stability.

Result: In 3D, Minkowski is unstable, de Sitter stable only when γ_3 exceeds a threshold. In 4D, both are unstable above γ_4's threshold. In 5D, both are generally stable except for high curvature corrections.

Conclusion: The dimensionality and quantum gravity effects significantly influence spacetime stability.

Abstract: We study the stability of $d$-dimensional ($d=3,4,5$) de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes within the framework of semiclassical gravity sourced by a strongly coupled quantum field with a gravity dual. Our stability results are derived from a careful analysis of the $d$-dimensional Lichnerowicz equation with mass-squared $m^2$ and of semiclassical equations involving the dimensionless parameter $γ_d$. For $d=3$, we find that Minkowski spacetime is always unstable against perturbations, whereas de Sitter spacetime becomes stable when a dimensionless parameter $γ_3$ exceeds a critical value. In $d=4$, both de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes become unstable when the parameter $γ_4$ exceeds its critical value. In contrast, in $d=5$, de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes remain stable for almost all values of the parameter $γ_5$, except for a regime in which higher-curvature corrections become comparable to the Einstein tensor.

Result: 研究结果表明，通过使用 $lue{\mathbb{Z}_N}$ 等变映射的方法，能够系统地构建带有广义 Virasoro 对称性的共形场论，并且推广了经典的 Sugawara 构造，为无穷多的新的 Virasoro 描述方式提供了理论框架。该研究还决定了不同 $Z_N$ 情况下的构造空间的拓扑结构，并通过这些结构特征展示了不同对称性下的新实现方式的多样性。此外，论文还展示了 Virasoro--Kac--Moody 代数的非平凡变形结构，这对于理解这些代数的多样性和操作的广度具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 该研究为无穷维 Lie 代数领域，特别是 Kac--Moody 代数在共形场论中的应用，开放了一个新的视角。通过引入 $lue{\mathbb{Z}_N}$ 等变映射，研究者不仅拓展了经典的 Virasoro 代数构造，还揭示了其在不同对称性下的多样化可能性，这种方法对于构建更多的共形代数实现具有潜力。从这些方法中提取的思想和工具可能在未来研究中被应用，探索更广泛的共形场论结构和数学物理中的其他相关问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the $U(1)^2$ Kac--Moody algebra and generalize the standard Sugawara construction of the Virasoro algebra to an infinite family of new realizations. In this case, in addition to the standard invariant tensor $δ^{ij}$, there exists another invariant tensor $ε^{ij}$, which enables the construction of genuinely new realizations beyond the conventional one. We show that these new realizations arise from a $\mathbb{Z}_N$--grading of the mode index $n$ of the Virasoro generators $L_n$ and the space of such realizations corresponds to points of a possibly singular algebraic variety. For the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3$ cases, the space of all such constructions is topologically equivalent to a cylinder, while for $\mathbb{Z}_4$ it forms a non-compact real four-dimensional manifold. We show that the spaces of constructions for $Z_{2N}$ and $Z_{2N+1}$ are closely similar. Furthermore, we reformulate the problem within an action-principle framework by introducing $\mathbb{Z}_N$-equivariant maps, which provide a systematic method for constructing conformal field theories endowed with these generalized Virasoro symmetries. This formulation reproduces the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ case and supports the idea that $\mathbb{Z}_N$-equivariance offers a consistent and unified approach to generating extended conformal algebras. Finally, we analyze the corresponding Virasoro--Kac--Moody-like algebras associated with these constructions and show that they represent nontrivial deformations of the well-known Virasoro-Kac-Moody algebra.

Abstract: We study the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) worldsheet action describing the motion of closed bosonic strings in the target space of a two-dimensional (2D) flat cone in polar coordinates. We calculate the cylinder partition function. We first place the cylindrical worldsheet on a rectangular lattice before taking the continuum limit. We find an integer number of string configurations on the worldsheet, which we call line defects, that run from one boundary of the cylinder to the other. We insert two sources (conical defects) at each boundary and fix the two ends of the line defect by Dirichlet boundary conditions to a point $r_c$ in target space. In target space, a line defect appears as an Susskind\&Uglum-type open string ending on $r_c$. We compute the semiclassical contribution to the off-shell cylinder amplitude by saddle point approximation. The amplitude has an interesting infrared (IR) divergence structure that depends on the given range of the cone angle. We then compute the entropy by varying the cone angle. In a particular renormalization scheme that relates the ultraviolet (UV) and to the infrared (IR) limits of the modulus integral, we find the entropy to be free of IR divergences but linearly dependent on the radial cutoff. We argue that our calculation provides a well-defined state on a constant Euclidean-time slice directly from the string worldsheet. We also study the 2D flat cone NLSM without discretization. We compute the entropy from the off-shell stationary action and show it is finite in each winding sector $W$ with a maximum at $r_c=\sqrt{α'}/|W|$. After summing over all winding sectors, it still has a finite maximum in the UV limit but for $r_c >0$.

Conclusion: 通过本文的研究可以更好地理解椭圆型德西空间中的量子场论行为，特别是在全局 Hilbert空间的结构和不同观察者之间的量子信息交换方面。这对于探索量子引力和宇宙学中的基本问题具有重要意义。

Abstract: Elliptic de Sitter (dS) spacetime dS$/\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a non-time-orientable spacetime obtained by imposing an antipodal identification to global dS. Unlike QFT on global dS, whose vacuum state can be prepared by a no-boundary Euclidean path integral, the Euclidean elliptic dS does not define a wavefunction in the usual sense. We propose instead that the path integral on the Euclidean elliptic dS defines a no-boundary density matrix. As an explicit example, we study the free Dirac fermion CFT in two-dimensional elliptic dS and analytically compute the von Neumann and the Rényi entropies of this density matrix. The calculation reduces to correlation functions of vertex operators on non-orientable surfaces. As a by-product, we compute the time evolution of entanglement entropy following a crosscap quench in free Dirac fermion CFT. We also comment on a striking feature of free QFT in elliptic dS: its global Hilbert space is one-dimensional, wheres the Hilbert space associated to each observer is a nontrivial Fock space.

Abstract: Two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory (2d YM) is arguably the simplest confining gauge theory and its large $N_c$ expansion has a structure of the genus expansion in string theory. Nevertheless various aspects of its worldsheet description have not been fully understood. In this paper, we elaborate on a bosonic string dual to large $N_c$ chiral 2d YM at finite 't Hooft coupling, proposed in our earlier work. The worldsheet theory consists of $β$-$γ$ system deformed by linear dilaton action built from a composite of $γ$. It can be seen as a noncritical version of nonrelativistic string theory introduced by Gomis and Ooguri. We provide a detailed analysis of the worldsheet operator product expansion and the computation of three- and four-point scattering amplitudes.

Abstract: The matter operator in the double-scaled SYK model exhibits special properties when its dimension is analytically continued to -1/2. The operator is then in a degenerate representation of the q-deformed oscillator algebra, and it satisfies a null vector equation. Its peculiar fusion property gives rise to recursion relations among correlation functions of matters. We find that those relations are strong enough to determine the two-point function without any knowledge from chord diagrammatics.

Abstract: The perturbative corrections to soft photon theorems with massive scalars in de Sitter spacetime were computed in [JHEP10(2023)055]. However, the massless limit of the scalar modes is ill-defined in their work. It therefore is ambiguous to take the massless limit of the soft factors. In this paper, we derive the massless scalar modes in $d$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime and use it to compute the perturbative corrections to the leading and sub-leading soft photon theorems. Our framework corresponds to tree level scattering of massless scalars followed by an emission of a soft photon in a compact region of the static patch of de Sitter. We show that our results are consistent with [JHEP10(2023)055] in the massless limit and we comment on the universality of our results.

Conclusion: 该研究为消除黑洞奇点和理解量子引力效应提供了新颖的角度和工具，进一步丰富了AdS/CFT研究领域。

Abstract: Quantum gravity effects are expected to resolve the black hole singularity and the effects may deform the region near but outside the horizon. Applying AdS/CFT correspondence, we see their signatures from the viewpoint of dual conformal field theory. As a regularized geometry, we consider AdS gravastar constructed by gluing AdS-Schwarzschild and de Sitter spacetime. The retarded Green functions of dual conformal field theory have bulk-cone singularities associated with null trajectories in the bulk and we obtain the singularities specific to a horizon-less geometry. We also observe echoes coming from waves reflected behind the photon sphere. The existence of echoes implies the modification of geometry inside the photon sphere.

Abstract: We explore an unusual symmetry in a field theory on a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime, which has an interesting interpretation as an approximate asymptotic Weyl symmetry. Unlike the conventional Weyl symmetry, the boundary term under the variation plays a crucial role in understanding for its anomaly. After converting a two-dimensional field theory on curved spacetime to an inhomogeneous field theory, we obtain the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor. Then, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect in the bubble wall expansion at the zero temperature.

Abstract: The $Q$-system is an efficient method for finding complete physical solutions of Bethe ansatz equations, but so far its application has been confined to systems possessing $U(1)$ symmetry. We extend the rational $Q$-system framework to integrable spin chains without $U(1)$ symmetry, exemplified by the closed XXZ model with anti-diagonal twists and the open XXZ model with non-diagonal boundary fields. We demonstrate that the $Q$-system can be derived by combining $TQ$-relation with fusion relations of higher-spin transfer matrices. This yields $QQ$-relations analogous to the $U(1)$ symmetric case but incorporating additional inhomogeneous terms. We present numerical solutions that are validated against exact diagonalization, confirming that it generates all and exclusively physical solutions.

Result: 九维IIB相互作用在S对偶下不变，且降维和对偶性一致。

Conclusion: Buscher规则导致的九维相互作用特性与对偶性兼容，提供了新视角理解弦论结构。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that applying the Buscher rules to the dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional, one-loop effective actions may generate "purely stringy" couplings in nine dimensions that cannot be lifted to a local, covariant form in ten dimensions. We investigate this phenomenon at order $α'^3$ in type IIA string theory. By computing the circular reduction of the one-loop Chern-Simons term and pure-gravity couplings in type IIA theory and applying the T-duality transformation to the resulting couplings, we derive their counterparts in the type IIB effective action. We demonstrate that the resulting nine-dimensional type IIB couplings are invariant under S-duality without requiring contributions from the tree-level effective action or non-perturbative effects. This result is non-trivial: while S-duality forbids one-loop Chern-Simons couplings in ten-dimensional type IIB theory, we show that the one-loop Chern-Simons couplings in nine dimensions, derived from the T-duality of type IIA, are S-duality invariant. As a consistency check, we show that the nine-dimensional type IIB couplings, when reduced on a K3 surface, reproduce the known heterotic string couplings on \( T^5 \) at order \( α' \), via the duality between the two theories.

Abstract: In this thesis, we address the problem of constructing the complete supersymmetric description of systems of $N$ nearly coincident Dirichlet $p$-branes (multiple D$p$-brane or mD$p$). A particularly important result is a completely nonlinear action for the 10-dimensional dynamical system of nearly coincident multiple D$0$-branes (mD$0$) which is doubly supersymmetric, i.e. it is invariant under both spacetime (target superspace) supersymmetry and the worldline supersymmetry; the latter is a counterpart of the local fermionic $κ$-symmetry characteristic of a single D$0$-brane (Dirichlet superparticle). This problem is approached in flat superspace using the (spinor) moving frame formalism, which provides us with a geometric framework to the treatment of supersymmetric particles and extended objects ($p$-branes) in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we have initiated the quantization program aimed at development of a field theory of multiple D$0$-branes. This quantization in its complete form is expected to lead to a novel supersymmetric field theory formulated on a superspace extended by additional bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates, whose development may offer significant insights into the deeper structure of String/M-theory.

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses the fabrication of MEMs vapor cells for Rydberg atom-based quantum sensors. A low-temperature bonding scheme using Octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) is introduced to coat the internal cavity of the MEMs vapor cell, preventing cesium (Cs) from sticking to the walls. This coating allows for the measurement of radio frequency fields with high precision, achieving spectral linewidths of approximately 300 kHz and detecting electric fields as low as 10 mV cm⁻¹.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research stems from the need for advanced atom-based quantum sensors, particularly for applications in timekeeping (e.g., atomic clocks), navigation systems (e.g., GPS), and sensing of electric and magnetic fields. The precise measurement of radio frequency fields in such sensors is crucial for their performance and accuracy.

Method: The researchers employed a low-temperature bonding scheme involving Octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTs) to coat the internal walls of the MEMs vapor cell. This method was chosen because conventional anodic bonding methods for MEMs vapor cells involve high bonding temperatures, which cannot be sustained while applying inert, organic coatings that are compatible with the sensitive components of the sensor.

Result: By successfully coating the internal cavity of the MEMs vapor cell with OTS, the cesium atoms in the sensor were prevented from sticking to the internal surfaces. This prevented the introduction of unwanted disturbances, leading to highly stable and precise measurements. The implementation of this coating technique resulted in significant improvements in the sensitivity of the sensor, achieving a reduction in the energy shift of cesium atoms exposed to external electric fields down to single digits in the microvolts per centimeter (μV/cm) range.

Conclusion: This paper presents a practical solution to a longstanding issue in the fabrication of MEMs vapor cells for Rydberg atom-based quantum sensors. The introduction of the OTS coating not only ensures the integrity and stability of the sensor but also significantly enhances its performance by reducing background interference. The described method opens up new possibilities for the development of highly accurate and reliable atom-based quantum sensors.

Abstract: Micro-Electro-Mechanical, so called 'MEMs,' vapor cells are a key component in atom-based quantum sensors, such as clocks, gyroscopes, electric field sensors and magnetometers. MEMs vapor cell fabrication for Rydberg atom radio frequency sensors is particularly demanding. The Rydberg states used for the sensor can shift in a constant electric field which can be generated by the internal surfaces of the vapor cell cavity. The ratio of the detection wavelength to vapor cell size can span a large range, meaning that the radio frequency field-vapor cell interaction is a critical design consideration. In many radio frequency sensing cases, there is a desire to minimize the interaction between the vapor cell and the target radio frequency field, as well as assure that every vapor cell behaves uniformly. These criterion favor MEMs vapor cells with low background electric fields. Known inert, organic coatings cannot survive the bonding temperatures required for conventional anodic bonding of a MEMs vapor cell. Applying inert, organic coatings to the internal cavities of MEMs vapor cells is a longstanding challenge. In this paper, we present a low temperature bonding scheme that is compatible with coating the internal cavity of a MEMs vapor cell with Octadecyltrichlorosilane (CH$_3\,$(CH$_2$)$_{17}\,$SiCl$_3$, OTS). The coating prevents the Cs used in the vapor cell from sticking to the walls. Spectral linewidths of $\sim300\,$kHz are obtained using Rydberg spectroscopy, with energy shifts corresponding to electric fields $<$10$\,$mV$\,$cm$^{-1}$.

Conclusion: This platform could lead to wider commercial adoption of cold-atom sensors in quantum science and tech.

Abstract: Cold-atom systems have emerged as a highly promising avenue for quantum-enhanced position, navigation, and timing applications. However, their wider adoption is currently hampered in part by the large footprint of the systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算化学的发展，开发高效且精确的计算方法是至关重要的。特别是针对大型分子系统和量子化学计算，优化基底压缩方法成为当前研究的热点。

Method: 研究引入了自然原子轨道（NAO）的概念，通过优化意义上的原子块密度矩阵的特征函数，在一中心正交化表示中获得NAO，从而实现一种基于阈值的基底压缩方法。

Result: 实验表明，当阈值为$10^{-5}$时，压缩因子在2.5至4.5之间，且在Hartree-Fock泛函下，压缩基底与非压缩基底的相对能量误差通常小于0.1 kcal/mol。当阈值减至$10^{-7}$时，误差显著降低至0.01 kcal/mol以下，同时压缩因子保持在2至2.5之间。

Conclusion: 该文章展示了如何通过NAO方法有效地压缩核型DFT中的原子基底，既降低了计算成本，又保持了较高的计算精度，为大型分子系统和量子化学研究提供了高效的计算工具。该研究为基底压缩方法提供了新的思路，值得关注。

Abstract: Large atomic-orbital (AO) basis sets of at least triple and preferably quadruple-zeta (QZ) size are required to adequately converge Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculations towards the complete basis set limit. However, incrementing the cardinal number by one nearly doubles the AO basis dimension, and the computational cost scales as the cube of the AO dimension, so this is very computationally demanding. In this work, we develop and test a natural atomic orbital (NAO) scheme in which the NAOs are obtained as eigenfunctions of atomic blocks of the density matrix in a one-center orthogonalized representation. The NAO representation enables one-center compression of the AO basis in a manner that is optimal for a given threshold, by discarding NAOs with occupation numbers below that threshold. Extensive tests using the Hartree-Fock functional suggest that a threshold of $10^{-5}$ can yield a compression factor (ratio of AO to compressed NAO dimension) between 2.5 and 4.5 for the QZ pc-3 basis. The errors in relative energies are typically less than 0.1 kcal/mol when the compressed basis is used instead of the uncompressed basis. Between 10 and 100 times smaller errors (i.e., usually less than 0.01 kcal/mol) can be obtained with a threshold $10^{-7}$, while the compression factor is typically between 2 and 2.5.

Abstract: The methaniminium cation, CH$_2$NH$_2^+$, plays an important role in Titan's N$_2$--CH$_4$ atmospheric chemistry. As the simplest protonated Schiff base (PSB), it also serves as a model for studying the nonadiabatic dynamics of retinal PSB, the chromophore central to vertebrate vision. While previous studies have established CN bond cleavage and photoisomerization as the primary pathways in the photochemistry of CH$_2$NH$_2^+$, we now report a new UV-induced photochemical pathway to HCNH$^+$, the dominant ion in Titan's upper atmosphere. Through high-level XMCQDPT2 and CASSCF(12,12) calculations, we identify a novel S$_1$/S$_0$ conical intersection that mediates the concerted double H-atom elimination from the carbon center of CH$_2$NH$_2^+$, yielding carbene CNH$_2^+$ as a direct precursor to HCNH$^+$. On-the-fly trajectory surface hopping dynamics confirm the presence of direct H$_2$ loss following excitation to either the S$_2$ or S$_1$ state. Furthermore, our large-scale, machine learning-accelerated simulations reveal that mode-specific pre-excitation can selectively funnel the dynamics into this new channel via the vibronically allowed S$_1$ state, enabling targeted control of the photochemical outcome.

Abstract: Coupled cluster with singles, doubles and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) often provides ground state correlation energies within "chemical accuracy," but suffers from high computational cost and steep scaling with system size. We present a GPU-accelerated implementation of CCSD(T) in the TeraChem software package. The new implementation achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling the calculation of the (T) correction for a system with 63 atoms and more than 1000 basis functions in a little under 8 hours on a single node. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of our optimized implementation for the rapid calculation of full CCSD(T)/CBS stacking energies for all ten unique DNA base pair stacked tetramers. We expect that the TeraChem CCSD(T) implementation will enable the rapid calculation of high-level data that was not previously accessible in a reasonable timeframe.

Abstract: In this work we introduce an effective approach to quantize the electromagnetic response of plasmonic metallic nanostructures. Their shape is arbitrary and they feature a realistic description of the frequency-dependent metal dielectric function that is based on experimental data. The derived quantum modes correctly reproduce the linear response macroscopic polarization of the nanoparticle upon external drive according to classical macroscopic Maxwell equations in the quasistatic limit. Such methodology paves the way for accurate modeling of plexcitonic system, where strong plasmon-molecule coupling and/or strong-driving fields call for a quantized description of the plasmonic response.

Abstract: Mapping methods, including the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss (MMST) mapping and spin-mapping, are commonly utilised to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics by propagating classical mapping variable trajectories. Recent work confirmed the Momentum Integral (MInt) algorithm is the only known symplectic algorithm for the MMST Hamiltonian. To our knowledge, no symplectic algorithm has been published for the spin-mapping representation without converting to MMST variables and utilising the MInt algorithm. Here, we present the Spin-MInt algorithm which directly propagates the spin-mapping variables. First, we consider a two-level system which maps onto a spin-vector on a Bloch sphere and determine that the Spin-MInt is a symplectic, symmetrical, second-order, time-reversible, angle invariant and geometric structure preserving algorithm. Despite spin-variables resulting in a non-invertible structure matrix, we rigorously prove the Spin-MInt is symplectic using a canonical variable transformation. Computationally, we find that the Spin-MInt and MInt algorithms are symplectic, satisfy Liouville's theorem, provide second-order energy conservation and are more accurate than a previously-published angle-based algorithm. The Spin-MInt is significantly faster than the MInt algorithm for two electronic states. Secondly, we extend this methodology to more than two electronic states and present accurate population results for a three-state morse potential. We believe this to be the first known symplectic algorithm for propagating the nonadiabatic spin-mapping Hamiltonian and one of the first rigorously symplectic algorithms in the case of non-trivial coupling between canonical and spin systems. These results should guide and improve future simulations.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解不同温度下量子系统中的扩散行为提供了新的见解，尤其是在涉及动态和静态无序的情况下。结论有助于指导材料科学中的新材料设计和理解量子计算中的动态过程。

Abstract: The temperature-dependence of dynamical properties (e.g., the asymptotic diffusion coefficient and the sub-diffusive exponent) are calculated for charges and excitons in one-dimensional systems subject to static and dynamic disorder. These properties are determined by three complementary methods. One approach is via the time-integration of the velocity autocorrelation function. The second is via the mean-squared-displacement of thermal wavepackets subject to stochastic collapse via Lindblad jump operators. These two methods are applicable in the high-temperature regime, where the noise is temporally uncorrelated. In this regime the noise causes particle localization and the transport is diffusive. The third approach -- applicable in the low-temperature regime -- is weak-coupling Redfield theory. Here, static disorder causes particle localization. When the dynamics is diffusive, the diffusion coefficient is a non-monotonic function of temperature, increasing with temperature in the low-temperature Environment Assisted Quantum Transport regime and decreasing with temperature in the high-temperature quantum-Zeno regime. For any temperature, static and dynamic disorder decreases the diffusion coefficient. The dynamics is non-diffusive for thermal energies deep within the manifold of local-ground-states, where the sub-diffusive exponent decreases with increasing disorder and decreasing temperature.

Abstract: The thermal conductivity of organic liquids is a vital parameter influencing various industrial and environmental applications, including energy conversion, electronics cooling, and chemical processing. However, atomistic simulation of thermal conductivity of organic liquids has been hindered by the limited accuracy of classical force fields and the huge computational demand of ab initio methods. In this work, we present a machine learning force field (MLFF)-based molecular dynamics simulation workflow to predict the thermal conductivity of 20 organic liquids. Here, we introduce the concept of differential attention into the MLFF architecture for enhanced learning ability, and we use density of the liquids to align the MLFF with experiments. As a result, this workflow achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 14% for the thermal conductivity of various organic liquids, significantly lower than that of the current off-the-shelf classical force field (78%). Furthermore, the MLFF is rewritten using Triton language to maximize simulation speed, enabling rapid prediction of thermal conductivity.

Abstract: Strong electric fields can be used to align molecules. However, a non-polar molecule such as H$_2$ has no preference for its orientation. There are thus two equivalent configurations with equal energy separated by a potential-energy barrier. Quantum mechanically, the molecule can tunnel between these configurations resulting in a tunnelling splitting, which in the case of H$_2$, is the same as the ortho--para splitting. In this work, we generalize semiclassical instanton theory to calculate the energy splitting of molecules in electric fields in full dimensionality. This goes beyond a perturbative treatment of the field and takes into account changes in molecular geometry during the tunnelling process which influence its electrical properties and can have a significant impact on the result. We first study the case of H$_2$ in a static electric field and then show how it can be applied to larger polar molecules subjected to oscillating electric fields, where we find that even large-amplitude heavy-atom tunnelling can lead to observable splittings.

TL;DR: A Brownian dynamics simulation model for capacitors with Thomas-Fermi electrodes, incorporating an effective many-body potential for ions in an implicit solvent with constraints on voltage and electro neutrality. The model accounts for charge fluctuations and their contribution to capacitance, with validation against known ion force results. Simulations predict ionic density profiles and capacitance effects, suitable for larger systems than molecular simulations, enabling electrochemical property predictions and ion dynamics correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop an efficient method for simulating capacitors, particularly for understanding ion behavior and capacitance in such systems. The model is intended to be computationally efficient while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The authors derive an effective many-body potential for ions in an implicit solvent between Thomas-Fermi electrodes. They consider the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for electron charge density, apply voltage constraints, and account for global electro-neutrality. The model incorporates charge fluctuations and their effects on capacitance, and uses 2D periodic boundary conditions along the electrode surfaces.

Result: The model accurately predicts ionic density profiles and capacitance characteristics for parallel plate capacitors. The simulations are computationally efficient and provide insights into ion dynamics relevant for larger systems and lower concentration scenarios.

Conclusion: The developed Brownian dynamics model with Thomas-Fermi electrodes is a computationally efficient tool for studying ion behavior and capacitance in capacitors, offering advantages over molecular simulations in terms of system size, concentration, and time scales explored.

Abstract: We introduce an efficient description of electrodes, characterized by their Thomas-Fermi screening length lTF inside the metal, for Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of capacitors. Within a Born-Oppenheimer approximation for the electron charge density inside the electrodes, we derive the effective many-body potential for ions in an implicit solvent between Thomas-Fermi electrodes, taking into account the constraints of applied voltage and of global electro-neutrality of the system, as well as the 2D periodic boundary conditions along the electrode surfaces. We derive the average charge and the fluctuation-dissipation relation for the differential capacitance, highlighting the contribution of the fluctuations of the net ionic dipole moment, as well as those from the solvent polarization and of the electron density, whose fluctuations are suppressed within the Born-Oppenheimer description. We demonstrate the relevance of this model by validating its predictions against known results for the force on ions as a function of the ion-surface distance in simple geometries. The equilibrium ionic density profiles from BD simulations are in excellent agreement with those from an explicit electrode model for perfect metals, and are obtained at a significantly lower computational cost. Finally, we discuss with the present model the effect of the Thomas-Fermi screening length on the equilibrium ionic density profiles and the capacitance. While limited to parallel plate capacitors, the present simulation method allows to consider larger systems, lower concentrations, and longer time scales concentrations than molecular simulations in order to predict the electrochemical properties of Thomas-Fermi capacitors and correlate them with the ion dynamics.
