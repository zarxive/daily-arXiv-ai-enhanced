Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac semimetals describe open gain--loss systems, yet at charge neutrality models featuring real spectrum often look Hermitian-like, with NH effects absorbed into renormalized band parameters. Here we show that a response-based diagnostic of effective non-Hermiticity can be formulated using minimal pseudo-Lorentz-symmetry-breaking deformations, which separate observables that remain captured by parameter redefinitions from those that exhibit irreducible NH structure. For a two-dimensional NH Dirac semimetal in the weak-NH, real-spectrum regime, we analyze Dirac-cone tilt and velocity anisotropy and compute representative probes of spectral structure, quantum geometry, optical response, and viscoelasticity at zero temperature. We find that tilt yields an NH-dependent slope of the density of states that cannot be collapsed to a single effective velocity, while velocity anisotropy can be captured by effective-velocity reparametrization. Furthermore, the quantum metric and collisionless optical conductivities provide NH-insensitive benchmarks (with the nonlinear conductivity symmetry selected), whereas the shear viscosity offers a discriminator through its tensor structure. Our results identify minimal deformations and bulk response channels that enable access to effective non-Hermiticity even when the spectrum remains real.

TL;DR: This paper resolves the long-standing debate on negative resistance switching in resistive memory by introducing a nanoscale effect in surface charge-induced radial electric fields in current-carrying conductors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explaining the reset mechanism in resistive memory is a key challenge in memory technology.

Method: Analyzes surface charge effects in nanoscale conductive paths and their influence on negative resistance switching.

Result: Demonstrates that radial electric fields are inversely proportional to the radius, leading to a sufficient electric field strength to explain reset mechanisms.

Conclusion: Reconciles historical experimental data by accounting for nanoscale size effects, advancing understanding of resistive memory mechanisms.

Abstract: The physics underlying reset in bipolar resistive memory has been the subject of decades of controversy and has been identified as the primary barrier to resistive memory technology development. This manuscript introduces a nanoscale effect in current carrying conductors, whereby surface charge induced radial electric fields are found to be inversely proportional to the radius of the conductive path. This nanoscale effect is then applied to explain the negative resistance switching (reset) mechanism in filamentary metal oxide resistive switching memory devices (memristors). Previous explanations for the negative resistive switching mechanism state that diffusion constitutes the radial driving mechanism for oxygen ions, and drift under electric fields is restricted to the direction parallel to current flow. This explanation conflicts with retention and microscopy data collected in a subset of devices presented in literature. We demonstrate that the electric field's dependency on the on the radius of a nanoscale conductive path can result in radial fields on the order of 10^5 to 10^6 V/cm at only -1 V bias, sufficient to govern the negative resistance switching mechanism in filamentary metal oxides. By accounting for this nanoscale size effect, long standing anomalous experimental data about the negative (reset) resistance switching mechanism in bipolar filamentary resistive memory devices is finally reconciled. Wide understanding of surface charges and associated electric fields in nanoscale conductive paths could prove important for further scaling of integrated circuits and aid in elucidating many nanoscale phenomena.

Conclusion: 该研究表明，量子传输与拓扑性在1D外心耳-安德雷-哈珀链中有着紧密的关系，并且环境阻尼对传输行为有显著的影响，这为理解或调控量子传输特性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We study the interplay between quantum transport and topology in a one-dimensional off-diagonal commensurate Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) chain. The model, formulated within AAH framework, effectively represents a one-dimensional lattice with two competing commensurate modulations, supporting two distinct types of topological edge modes: zero-energy states in the central gapless region and quantum Hall (QH) edge states bridging the gapped bulk bands. These edge modes govern the transport behavior and give rise to sharp variations in transmission across the corresponding gap-closing transitions. A pronounced even-odd effect further emerges, where chains with an odd number of sites exhibit nearly perfect zero-energy transmission at the Dirac points, independent of system-lead coupling, system size, or modulation strength; a robust signature of ballistic transport. To capture the influence of environmental decoherence, we also incorporate Büttiker dephasing probes, which enable a phenomenological description of inelastic scattering and reveal how dephasing modifies, and in some regimes enhances, coherent transport.

### [7] [Compact self-matched gyrators using edge magnetoplasmons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05439)

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: _compact on-chip non-reciprocal microwave components achieve sub-mm footprint and low insertion losses via self-impedance-matched designs based on edge magnetoplasmons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum information processing and cryogenic measurement require compact, scalable, and efficient microwave components, making the development of on-chip non-reciprocal components crucial.

Method: The method involves designing compact, self-impedance-matched gyrators using edge magnetoplasmons in a 2D electron gas, optimized with an electrode geometry to minimize reflections, achieving tunable gyration across 0.2-2 GHz with low losses.

Result: The devices exhibit sub-mm footprint and insertion losses as low as 2-4 dB, outperforming conventional ferrite-based components by two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: This breakthrough enables scalable, efficient, and compact non-reciprocal microwave components for advanced applications.

Abstract: Non-reciprocal microwave components are indispensable in quantum information processing and cryogenic measurement. Conventional implementations, however, are bulky and incompatible with on-chip scalable integration. Recent efforts to develop compact on-chip alternatives often rely on active modulation or complex circuit architectures, which introduce additional losses and degrade performance. We demonstrate the realization of compact, self-impedance-matched gyrators based on edge magnetoplasmons in a two-dimensional electron gas. Gyrators can be used as building blocks for other non-reciprocal elements such as isolators and circulators. Our devices achieve gyration from 0.2 to 2 GHz, tunable by moderate out-of plane magnetic fields below 400 mT, and sub-mm footprint, two orders of magnitude smaller than conventional ferrite-based components. Using an electrode geometry predicted to minimize reflections, we achieve insertion losses as low as 2 to 4 dB. The self-matched design framework we utilize is broadly applicable, and can be implemented in a wide variety of non-reciprocal device architectures.

### [8] [Direct observation of propagating spin waves in a spin-Hall nano-oscillator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05603)
*Victor H. González,Frank Schulz,Nilamani Behera,Martina Ahlberg,Akash Kumar,Andreas Frisk,Felix Groß,Sven Erik Ilse,Steffen Wittrock,Markus Weigand,Gisela Schütz,Johan Åkerman,Sebastian Wintz*

TL;DR: This paper investigates the magnetization dynamics in constriction-based spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) using time-resolved STXM. Key findings include the observation of spin wave propagation asymmetry, the dominant role of propagation anisotropy, and the impact of DMI and grain boundaries on the spin wave characteristics. Additionally, the results suggest that X-ray radiation may alter the interface properties of CoFeB/MgO, casting doubt on its assumed radiation resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the magnetization dynamics in SHNOs is essential for their application as tunable microwave sources. The complex magnon propagation and the potential for large-scale integrated systems highlight the importance of this research.

Method: The study utilized time-resolved scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) to directly image the magnetization dynamics within a CoFeB-based SHNO. This technique allowed visualization of spin wave propagation and identified key structural features influencing the results.

Result: Magnets exhibit their largest amplitude at constriction edges with pronounced asymmetry. Spin waves show strong anisotropic propagation primarily along one direction. Simulations attribute these effects to grain boundaries and DMI. Additionally, magnetodynamic changes during measurements imply that CoFeB/MG0 interfaces might be more susceptible to X-ray-induced modifications than previously believed, challenging assumptions about their radiation hardness.

Conclusion: These findings enhance our understanding of SHNO magnetization dynamics and have implications for the scalability and application of spin-wave-based microwave sources in future electronic systems.

Abstract: Constriction-based spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) show great promise for application as highly tunable microwave sources with straightforward scalability toward large coupled networks. However, details of the magnetization dynamics within SHNOs have thus far not been addressed experimentally, due to the minute time and length scales involved. In this work, we present direct imaging of the magnetization dynamics within a single CoFeB-based SHNO using time-resolved scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM). Our measurements reveal that the magnon amplitude is the strongest at the two constriction edges, with a pronounced assymetry favoring one edge, and that emitted spin waves exhibit strongly anisotropic propagation. Micromagnetic simulations suggest that grain boundaries and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) play a key role in both effects. Furthermore, the magnetodynamics changed during the measurement, indicating that the CoFeB/MgO interface may be more susceptible to X-ray induced modifications than previously recognized, challenging its presumed radiation hardness.

Abstract: Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPPs) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) confine mid-infrared light to deep-subwavelength scales and may offer a powerful route to strong light-matter interactions. Generation and control of HPPs are typically accessed using classical near-field probes, which limits experiments at the quantum level.A complementary frontier in hBN research focuses on color centers: bright, stable, atomically localized emitters that have rapidly emerged as a promising platform for solid-state quantum optics. Here we establish a key connection between these two directions by developing a cavity-QED framework in which a single hBN color center serves as a quantum source of HPPs. We quantify the emitter-HPP interaction and analyze two generation schemes. The first is spontaneous emission into the phonon sideband, which can produce single-HPP events and, in ultrathin slabs, becomes single-mode with an enhanced decay rate. The second is a stimulated Raman process that provides frequency selectivity, tunable conversion rate, and narrowband excitation. This drive launches spatially confined, ray-like HPPs that propagate over micrometer distances. We also outline a two-emitter correlation measurement that can directly test the single-polariton character of these emissions. By connecting color-center quantum optics with hyperbolic polaritonics, our approach enables quantum emitters to act as on-chip quantum sources and controls for HPPs, while HPPs provide long-range channels that couple spatially separated emitters. Together, these capabilities point to a new direction for mid-infrared photonic experiments that unite strong coupling, spectral selectivity, and spatial reach within a single material system.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this study, we show that a $d$-wave altermagnet can be transformed into a Chern insulator by irradiating it with elliptically polarized light from a high-frequency photon beam. We further explore the intrinsic anomalous thermoelectric and thermal Hall effects in light-irradiated altermagnets. At extremely low temperatures, the thermoelectric Hall coefficient, which exhibits a linear temperature dependence for the thermoelectric Hall conductivity, vanishes within the gapped region between the conduction and valence bands. However, it displays peaks and dips at the boundaries of the gap, suggesting that thermoelectric Hall conductivity can be used to probe the bandwidth. Similarly, the low-temperature thermal Hall coefficient, which also shows a linear temperature dependence for the thermal Hall conductivity, becomes quantized in the gapped region between the conduction and valence bands. This quantization indicates that thermal Hall conductivity can serve as a probe for the topological properties of the system.

*Joseph Bretz,Hang Yu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Tidal interaction in BNS systems can influence gravitational wave signals and help constrain neutron star properties, but neglecting resonance can introduce significant bias in measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding neutron star properties and equations of state is crucial for astrophysics and gravitational wave astronomy.

Method: Used Gravitational wave signal analysis, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations, and models of f-mode frequency corrections.

Result: Ignoring tidal resonance causes bias in tidal deformability and NS equation of state estimation.

Conclusion: Accounting for tidal resonance and nonlinear effects is essential for accurate NS physics modeling.

Abstract: Tidal interaction is a unique, detectable signature in gravitational wave signals from inspiraling binary neutron stars (BNSs), which can be used to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS). The tidal interaction is resonantly amplified as the orbital frequency approaches the NS fundamental mode (f-mode) frequency. It has been shown that the exclusion of tidal resonance in parameter estimation leads to a significant bias in the inferred NS tidal deformability and hence the NS EoS [Pratten et al. PRL 129, 081102 (2022)]. The strength and location of tidal resonance depend sensitively on the f-mode frequency, which is typically modeled using its universal relation with the tidal deformability that is derived for an isolated, non-spinning NS assuming only linear fluid perturbations. In a BNS inspiral, the f-mode frequency can be corrected by at least three known effects: nonlinear hydrodynamics, background spin, and relativity. We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the systematic bias on tidal deformability when each frequency correction is ignored. Our study considers both loud, individual events and the stacking of a population of detections. Both scenarios are expected when the next-generation detectors are available with a sensitivity level increased by about an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: 这些结果为OS坍缩提供了清晰的分类：奇性终止；反弹终止；软着陆终止。这些发现与Pordered但现在猜想一致。

Abstract: We study Oppenheimer-Snyder (OS) gravitational collapse matched to a general static, spherically symmetric exterior spacetime. Unlike the Schwarzschild case, two new features can arise in black holes with two horizons: an apparent-horizon left vertex, a temporary minimum in the apparent-horizon radius during collapse, and a bounce, where the star surface stops collapsing at a nonzero radius and reverses into expansion. We identify the conditions that lead to these two features. For two-horizon exteriors, trapped-region consistency requires that the apparent-horizon turning point occurs no earlier than the surface crossing of the inner horizon. As a concrete example, the OS collapse of the Reissner-Nordström (RN) spacetime shows both effects. In contrast, regular black holes with de Sitter cores show neither: their collapse is smooth and monotonic, and the surface approaches the center only as the proper time goes to infinity. These results naturally classify the OS collapses into three categories: singular, which ends at the center in finite time; bouncing, which reverses at a finite radius; and soft-landing, which reaches the center only asymptotically. We argue that these features are consistent with Penrose's strong cosmic censorship conjecture.

*Mingzhi Lou,Hong Su,Tao Yang,Yun-Long Zhang*

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to optimize the configuration of space-based optical lattice clocks (OLCs) for detecting gravitational wave backgrounds by manipulating the overlap reduction function (ORF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The detection of gravitational waves, particularly the stochastic background, is a significant goal in astrophysics, and improving detection sensitivity is crucial.

Method: The paper introduces a transformation that leaves the ORF invariant between two OLC detector configurations: one with small separation and high noise correlation, and the other with larger separation and lower noise correlation. This allows for optimizing the detector network configuration.

Result: The optimized OLC configuration achieves high cross-correlation and demonstrates favorable sensitivity compared to space-based laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors.

Conclusion: The transformation method provides a robust approach for enhancing the effectiveness of OLC networks in gravitational wave detection, complementing traditional interferometers.

Abstract: The network of space based optical lattice clocks (OLCs) has been proposed to detect the stochastic gravitational wave background. We investigate the overlap reduction function (ORF) of the OLC detector network and analytically derive a transformation that leaves the ORF invariant. This transformation is applicable to configurations with two OLC detectors, each equipped with a one-way link. It can map a configuration with small separation and high noise correlation to another configuration with larger separation and reduced noise correlation. Using this transformation, we obtain a favourable OLC detector network configuration with high cross-correlation response, and compare its sensitivity to that of space-based laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors.

Abstract: We analyze cosmological particle production driven by spacetime expansion in the early universe for homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies with positive, negative, and zero spatial curvature. We prioritize analytical results to gain a deeper understanding of curvature-induced effects. Specifically, for a conformally coupled scalar field, we model the inflationary epoch as an exact de Sitter phase followed by a transition to a static universe. Both instantaneous and smooth exits from inflation are considered, the latter being implemented via the adiabatic vacuum prescription. Starting from an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum, we derive the associated mode functions carefully adapted to each curvature sign. Using the Bogoliubov formalism, we non-perturbatively compute the number density of produced scalar particles. Our results demonstrate that spatial curvature significantly impacts the resulting particle spectra, particularly for light fields, where the deviation from the flat-space scenario is most prominent and can reach several orders of magnitude

Abstract: Searches for late--time gravitational--wave echoes following compact binary mergers are often interpreted as probes of exotic near--horizon or horizonless physics. We show that a well--motivated class of ultraviolet--finite quantum gravity and modified gravity theories, those based on diffeomorphism--invariant, analytic, entire--function nonlocality, generically suppress observable echo signals. The suppression follows from Paley--Wiener bounds associated with the analyticity of the nonlocal regulator, which enforce exponential damping of high--frequency reflection amplitudes and smear sharp effective potentials in the black--hole interior. We demonstrate that for regular black holes with horizons, the standard ingoing boundary condition eliminates the cavity required for echoes, while for regular horizonless compact objects the nonlocal kernel strongly attenuates both inner and photon--sphere reflections. As a result, repeated reflections during the ringdown phase are exponentially suppressed in frequency space and washed out in the time domain. Our results imply that the absence of echoes in current gravitational--wave data is consistent with covariant nonlocal gravity theories and does not, by itself, favor classical horizons over regular or horizonless ultraviolet completions. The analyticity and Paley--Wiener bounds that enforce echo suppression are required to ensure unitarity, ghost freedom, and ultraviolet finiteness of the underlying quantum theory. As a result, the classical ringdown phenomenology already encodes quantum--gravity consistency conditions. We emphasize that the absence of echoes in such theories does not rely on quantum decoherence or stochastic effects, but instead reflects the analytic structure imposed by quantum gravity on the classical limit.

Abstract: In this paper we analyze the conformal Einstein equations to all orders at null infinity without imposing any restriction on the spacetime dimension, the topology of $\mathscr{I}$, or fall-off conditions for the Weyl tensor. In particular, we study how the equations constrain the geometry of null infinity when it is assumed to be foliated by cross-sections, not necessarily spheres. Our approach is coordinate-free and treats the conformal factor $Ω$ as a dynamical variable. After identifying the free data at $\mathscr{I}$, we show that any two asymptotically flat spacetimes sharing the same free data at null infinity are necessarily isometric to infinite order. In addition, we provide a detached definition of null infinity and prove an existence theorem for asymptotically flat spacetimes solving the field equations to infinite order at $\mathscr{I}$ realizing the prescribed initial data.

Abstract: It was recently pointed out that the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential is unstable against an insignificant Gaussian metric perturbation, which, in turn, might substantially challenge the black hole spectroscopy. This intriguing result has been interpreted by some authors as arising from essentially replacing the black hole's effective potential and its perturbation with two disjoint potential barriers. We argue that such an analysis may have oversimplified the real physical scenario. To be more precise, a metric perturbation planted farther away from the black hole horizon might not always be appropriately approximated by a disjoint minor barrier. Particularly, for the perturbed Pöschl-Teller potential, joint and disjoint metric perturbations might lead to drastically different stability properties for the low-lying modes. Following this line of thought, this study conducts a refined analysis of the stability of the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential by closely examining a few physically relevant ingredients. While our analysis qualitatively confirms the main findings of previous studies, as the stability of the fundamental mode is primarily determined by the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency, we show that specific features of both the effective potential at spatial infinity and the metric perturbation can have a sizable impact on the instability. In contrast, the spiral period, governed by the real part of the quasinormal frequency, appears largely insensitive to the details of the black hole metric or its perturbations. The analytic estimates are in reasonable agreement with the numerical results.

Motivation: Exploring black hole stability and the role of dark matter candidates in physical systems.

Method: Used numerical relativity to simulate the system's long-term evolution under different parameters.

Result: The system exhibits superradiant instability leading to distinct endstates: hairy black holes or 'bosenovas' with axion field oscillations.

Conclusion: Parameter tuning controls the system's final state, indicating potential for future applications in theoretical physics.

Abstract: A Reissner-Nordström black hole (RNBH) enclosed in a cavity is known to be superradiantly unstable to charged scalar perturbations below a critical frequency. Inspired by the emergence of the QCD axion as a prominent dark matter candidate, we construct a model featuring an axion field coupled to an electromagnetic field that undergoes superradiant growth around an RNBH. Utilizing numerical relativity, we achieve stable, long-term evolution of this system and perform a comparative analysis across various parameter spaces. Our comprehensive investigation reveals the formation of a hairy black hole, whose final state is governed by a diverse set of physical parameters. Notably, the decay constant in the axion potential, representing nonlinear interactions, bifurcates the superradiant instability into two distinct behavioral regimes, leading to more significant dynamical shifts than previously reported. Furthermore, we examine the influence of the scalar field's charge and mass, as well as the mirror's position. We investigate the axionic bosenova process and observe a long-term beating pattern of the axion field induced by nonlinear interactions. By fine-tuning these parameter combinations, we demonstrate that the system can evolve toward a variety of distinct physical endpoints.

Abstract: We review the physical basis for the assumption of locality in relativistic physics and its connection with the aberration of starlight. As a consequence of the hypothesis of locality, the standard relativistic formulas for the Doppler effect and aberration are independent of the polarization of the incident electromagnetic or gravitational radiation. The modification of these formulas due to the helicity-rotation coupling are discussed. In connection with the aberration of polarized radiation, we note that the helicity of radiation incident on a rotating observer couples to its angular velocity of rotation resulting in a slight helicity-dependent modification of the standard aberration formula. We discuss the physical origin of this effect and estimate the magnitude of the helicity aberration.

Abstract: We study perturbations induced by a light particle scattering off a Schwarzschild black hole. Exploiting recent results for the wave propagation in this geometry, we derive the fields that this process induces on the horizon to leading order in the post-Minkowskian (PM) regime, when the light probe is far from the black hole. We then use these results to calculate the fluxes of energy and angular momentum that enter the black hole. We consider the effects due to gravitational, electromagnetic and scalar radiation, finding agreement with recent computations of the absorbed energy, while the absorbed angular momentum provides a new PM result.

Abstract: The horizon multipole moments of a Kerr black hole are computed from two distinct definitions that have been proposed in the literature. The first one [Ashtekar et al., Class. Quantum Grav. 21, 2549 (2004)] regards axisymmetric isolated horizons, while the second one [Ashtekar et al., J. High Energ. Phys. 2022, 28 (2022)] applies to generic (i.e., not necessarily axisymmetric) non-expanding horizons. We review these definitions in a common frame and perform a detailed study of the resulting multipole moments for the Kerr event horizon. The horizon multipoles are found to share several properties with the (Hansen) field multipoles, including parity constraints and the leading scaling behavior with respect to the Kerr spin parameter a in the regime of small a. For the axisymmetry-based definition, we have obtained a closed-form expression of the multipole moments in terms of a and the spherical harmonic degree l. For the generic definition, we have established closed-form expressions for the conformal unit round metric, the `electric' and `magnetic' potentials related to the multipoles, and the values of the multipoles in the small a limit. We show that the two definitions lead to different values of the Kerr horizon multipoles as soon as l >= 1 (generic nonzero value of a) or l >= 2 (small a limit).

Motivation: Testing quantum error correction implementations with high accuracy is important due to the potential for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Method: The approach combines stratified fault injection with extrapolation to scale testing to larger quantum distances.

Result: The tool can test a distance 17 code within two hours, achieving a logical error rate estimate of 1.51e-11 with low error.

Conclusion: This advancement enables efficient evaluation of quantum error correction codes, contributing to practical quantum computing advancements.

Abstract: The standard method for benchmarking quantum error-correction is randomized fault-injection testing. The state-of-the-art tool \stim is efficient for error correction implementations with distances of up to 10, but scales poorly to larger distances for low physical error rates. In this paper, we present a scalable approach that combines stratified fault injection with extrapolation. Our insight is that some of the fault space can be sampled efficiently, after which extrapolation is sufficient to complete the testing task. As a result, our tool scales to distance 17 for a physical error rate of 0.0005 with a two-hour time budget on a desktop. For this case, it estimated a logical error rate of $1.51 \times 10^{-11}$ with high confidence.

Conclusion: 量子 Fisher 信息可以通过纠缠态 Metrology 实现无先验轴信息的最佳估计，对于大自旋系统尤其显著。

Abstract: The quantum Fisher information of a quantum state with respect to a certain parameter quantifies the sensitivity of the quantum state to changes in that parameter. Maximizing the quantum Fisher information is essential for achieving the optimal estimation precision of quantum sensors. A typical quantum sensor involves a qubit(e.g. a spin-1/2) probe undergoing an unknown rotation, here the unknown rotation angle is the parameter to be estimated. A well known limitation is that if the rotation axis is unknown, the maximal quantum Fisher information is impossible to attain. This limitation has been lifted recently by leveraging entanglement between the probe qubit and an ancilla qubit. Namely, through measurement of the ancilla after the axis is revealed, one can prepare the probe that is optimal for any unknown rotation axis. This proposal, however, works only for a spin-1/2. Considering large spin probes can achieve a larger quantum Fisher information, offering enhanced metrological advantage, we here utilize the entanglement between a large spin probe and an ancilla to achieve optimal quantum Fisher information for estimating the rotation angle, without prior knowledge of the rotation axis. Different from the previous spin-1/2 case, achieving the optimal precision with large spins generally requires post-selection, resulting in a success probability dependent on the dimension of the Hilbert space. Furthermore, we extend the encoding state from the maximally entangled case to general entangled states, showing that optimal metrology can still be achieved with a certain success probability.

*Senrui Chen,Weiyuan Gong,Sisi Zhou*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We determine the optimal sample complexity for shadow tomography in high precision under realistic measurement constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum state tomography is a fundamental problem in quantum information science, with wide-ranging applications in quantum computing, cryptography, and many other areas of quantum technology. Understanding the limits and possibilities of efficient tomography is therefore of great importance.

Method: We use a two-step method that first performs coarse tomography to estimate the expectation values of the observables, and then refines the estimate using local estimation techniques. Our method is adaptive and leverages the structure of the quantum state and the set of observables.

Result: Our main result is an instance-optimal characterization of the sample complexity of shadow tomography in the high-precision regime. Specifically, we show that the sample complexity scales as Θ(Γ_p/ε²), where Γ_p is a function of the set of observables that can be computed using an optimization formula involving the inverse Fisher information matrix.

Conclusion: We demonstrate that our method achieves the optimal sample complexity for shadow tomography in the high-precision regime, and our results have important implications for the design and analysis of quantum state tomography protocols.

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of shadow tomography in the high-precision regime under realistic measurement constraints. Given an unknown $d$-dimensional quantum state $ρ$ and a known set of observables $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$, the goal is to estimate expectation values $\{\mathrm{tr}(O_iρ)\}_{i=1}^m$ to accuracy $ε$ in $L_p$-norm, using possibly adaptive measurements that act on $O(\mathrm{polylog}(d))$ number of copies of $ρ$ at a time. We focus on the regime where $ε$ is below an instance-dependent threshold.
  Our main contribution is an instance-optimal characterization of the sample complexity as $\tildeΘ(Γ_p/ε^2)$, where $Γ_p$ is a function of $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$ defined via an optimization formula involving the inverse Fisher information matrix. Previously, tight bounds were known only in special cases, e.g. Pauli shadow tomography with $L_\infty$-norm error. Concretely, we first analyze a simpler oblivious variant where the goal is to estimate an observable of the form $\sum_{i=1}^m α_i O_i$ with $\|α\|_q = 1$ (where $q$ is dual to $p$) revealed after the measurement. For single-copy measurements, we obtain a sample complexity of $Θ(Γ^{\mathrm{ob}}_p/ε^2)$. We then show $\tildeΘ(Γ_p/ε^2)$ is necessary and sufficient for the original problem, with the lower bound applying to unbiased, bounded estimators. Our upper bounds rely on a two-step algorithm combining coarse tomography with local estimation. Notably, $Γ^{\mathrm{ob}}_\infty = Γ_\infty$. In both cases, allowing $c$-copy measurements improves the sample complexity by at most $Ω(1/c)$.
  Our results establish a quantitative correspondence between quantum learning and metrology, unifying asymptotic metrological limits with finite-sample learning guarantees.

Abstract: Hamiltonian representations based on the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy provide rigorous lower bounds on ground-state energies and facilitate the design of efficient classical and quantum simulation algorithms. This work presents a unified framework connecting SOS decompositions with variational two-particle reduced density matrix (v2RDM) theory. We demonstrate that the ``weighted'' SOS ansatz naturally recovers the dual of the v2RDM program, enabling the strict enforcement of symmetry constraints such as particle number and spin. We provide explicit SOS constructions for the Hubbard model and electronic structure Hamiltonians, ranging from spin-free approximations to full rank-2 expansions. We also highlight theoretical connections to block-invariant symmetry shifts. Numerical benchmarks on molecular systems and Iron-Sulfur clusters validate these near frustration-free representations, demonstrating their utility in improving spectral gap amplification and reducing block encoding costs in quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Simulating quantum many-body systems (QMBS) is one of the long-standing, highly non-trivial challenges in condensed matter physics and quantum information due to the exponentially growing size of the system's Hilbert space. To date, tensor networks have been an essential tool for studying such quantum systems, owing to their ability to efficiently capture the entanglement properties of the systems they represent. One of the well-known tensor network architectures, namely matrix product states (MPS), is the standard method for simulating one-dimensional QMBS. Here, we propose a simple, yet efficient, method to augment the already available MPS algorithms to simulate the dynamics of time-dependent Hamiltonians with better accuracy and a faster convergence rate, giving a second-order convergence compared to the first-order convergence of the standard method. We apply our proposed method to simulate the dynamics of a chain of single spins associated with nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamonds, which has potential applications for practical and scalable quantum technologies, and find that our method improves the average error for a system of few NV centers by a factor of about 1000 for moderate step sizes. Our work paves the way for efficient simulation of QMBS under the influence of time-dependent Hamiltonians.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of time quasicrystals (TQCs) in the open Dicke model, subjected to a quasi-periodic Fibonacci drive. TQCs are characterized by a robust sub-harmonic quasi-periodic response that is qualitatively distinct from the external drive. By directly analyzing the dynamics of the system in the thermodynamic limit, we establish the existence of TQC order in this system for a wide parameter regime. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this behavior persists even in the deep quantum regime with only two qubits. We systematically study the dependence of the TQC lifetime, $τ^{\ast}$, on the number of qubits and demonstrate that $τ^{\ast}$ increases monotonically with the system size. Our work demonstrates that quasi-periodically driven dissipative quantum systems can serve as a powerful platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium phases of matter.

Motivation: Understanding the behavior of quantum resources in systems exhibiting topological frustration is crucial for advancing our knowledge in both fundamental physics and potential technological applications. This paper provides valuable insights by analyzing specific quantum resources in such systems.

Method: The authors employ a combination of analytical and numerical methods to study the behavior of the quantum resources in question. They likely construct a model of the quantum system under topological frustration and calculate the entanglement entropy and non-stabilizerness Renyi entropy to identify the distinct contributions from topological excitations.

Result: The study reveals that topological frustration introduces a distinct contribution to quantum resources, with the entanglement entropy and non-stabilizerness Renyi entropy showing enhanced or modified behavior compared to non-frustrated systems. The authors attribute this contribution to stable, delocalized, topological excitations, and they provide an analytical calculation method for these contributions, drawing parallels with the W-state.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the theoretical understanding of quantum resources in systems subjected to topological frustration. By identifying the additional contributions to entanglement entropy and non-stabilizerness Renyi entropy, the study opens new avenues for both theoretical exploration and practical applications in quantum technologies. The analytical framework provided for these contributions is a valuable tool for future research in this area.

Abstract: Although in general boundary conditions do not affect the bulk properties of a system, some of them are special and defy such expectation. This is the case, for instance, of those inducing geometrical frustration in a classical magnet. Recently, the study of such settings in quantum systems (dubbed topological frustration) has uncovered peculiar features, interesting both from a fundamental and technological point of view. In this work, we present and discuss the behavior of several quantum resources in presence of TF, namely the (disconnected) entanglement entropy and the non-stabilizerness Renyi entropy. We will show that, compared to their non-frustrated counterparts, TF adds a distinct contribution to these resources, due to a stable, delocalized, topological excitation. Remarkably, this contribution can be calculated analytically, due to its similarities with that of a W-state.

Abstract: Quantum metrology harnesses quantum entanglement to improve measurement precision beyond standard quantum limit. Although nonlinear interaction is essential for generating entanglement, during signal accumulation, it becomes detrimental and therefore must be suppressed. To address this challenge, we propose an alternating in-phase and quadrature modulation (AIQM) scheme, designed to operate under a fixed nonlinear interaction. During signal accumulation, our time-interleaved approach sequentially applies the in-phase and quadrature driving fields, thereby eliminating the effects of nonlinear interaction on signal accumulation. Our AIQM scheme achieves better metrological performance than conventional schemes, particularly under strong nonlinear interaction and prolonged signal accumulation, with pronounced robustness against parameter variations. By selectively eliminating and utilizing nonlinear interactions via AIQM, our work enables high-precision and high-accuracy entanglement-enhanced sensing without the need for active control of the nonlinear interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving security analysis of QKD protocols through realistic parameters and tighter bounds.

Method: Utilize full non-linear constraints with IPOPT and linear outer optimization for tighter key rates.

Result: Tighter bounds achieved, sometimes proving optimality.

Conclusion: Integration of CS constraints enhances security and key rate estimation in QKD.

Abstract: Decoy-state QKD with phase-randomized weak coherent pulses is typically analyzed assuming independent, precisely prepared intensities. Real sources, however, can exhibit correlated intensity drift across rounds, potentially leaking intensity information and breaking the standard decoy-state reduction to linear programs. Cauchy--Schwarz (CS) constraints can restore security by coupling $n$-photon yields across intensities, but they introduce nonlinear square-root constraints that are commonly handled via outer linearisation around channel-model-based reference points. We propose a reproducible alternative: first solve the full CS-constrained parameter-estimation problems using the interior-point nonlinear solver IPOPT, then use the resulting candidate solution as the linearisation point for the outer optimisation that certifies a valid lower bound on the asymptotic key rate. Simulations for both coarse-grained model-independent correlations and fine-grained truncated-Gaussian models show consistently tighter key-rate bounds than canonical reference points, and in some cases allow certifying optimality when both optimisation stages coincide.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deterministic error mitigation (DEM) method for noisy quantum annealing experiments using Rydberg atom arrays. The DEM technique reduces the classical postprocessing overhead required to infer solutions from noisy measurements, as demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimental results from neutral atom devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of quantum devices necessitates reliable methods for evaluating their performance. Quantum annealing, particularly with Rydberg atom arrays, is known to be susceptible to noise, which complicates the evaluation of solution quality and classical computational costs.

Method: The authors propose a deterministic error mitigation (DEM) technique. This method involves a shot-level inference procedure that is informed by experimentally characterized noise models. The technique is demonstrated using the decision version of the $k$-independent set problem within a Hamming-shell framework. The DEM candidate volume is governed by the binary entropy of the bit-flip error rate, leading to an entropy-controlled classical postprocessing cost.

Result: The results show that DEM significantly reduces the classical postprocessing overhead compared to classical inference baselines. Numerical simulations and experimental data from neutral atom devices validate the scaling behavior with respect to system size and error rate. This scaling enables a direct, cost-based comparison between noisy quantum experiments and classical algorithms, with one hour of classical computation on an Intel i9 processor corresponding to quantum experiments with up to 250-450 atoms at effective error rates.

Conclusion: The introduction of DEM offers a promising approach for evaluating the performance of noisy quantum annealing devices. By addressing the challenges of noisy measurements and classical postprocessing, DEM facilitates a more accurate benchmarking methodology for quantum devices, enabling meaningful comparisons between quantum experiments and classical algorithms.

Abstract: Noisy quantum annealing experiments on Rydberg atom arrays produce measurement outcomes that deviate from ideal distributions, complicating performance evaluation. To enable a data-driven benchmarking methodology for quantum devices that accounts for both solution quality and the classical computational cost of inference from noisy measurements, we introduce deterministic error mitigation (DEM), a shot-level inference procedure informed by experimentally characterized noise. We demonstrate this approach using the decision version of the $k$-independent set problem. Within a Hamming-shell framework, the DEM candidate volume is governed by the binary entropy of the bit-flip error rate, yielding an entropy-controlled classical postprocessing cost. Using experimental measurement data, DEM reduces postprocessing overhead relative to classical inference baselines. Numerical simulations and experimental results from neutral atom devices validate the predicted scaling with system size and error rate. These scalings indicate that one hour of classical computation on an Intel i9 processor corresponds to neutral atom experiments with up to $N=250-450$ atoms at effective error rates, enabling a direct, cost-based comparison between noisy quantum experiments and classical algorithms.

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the quantum noise mechanisms that limit continuously operating multiparameter quantum sensors. Using a hybrid rf-dc optically pumped magnetometer, we map the photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise over an order of magnitude in probe power and a factor of three in pump power while remaining quantum-noise-limited. We observe linear, quadratic, and cubic scaling of the respective total noise powers with probe photon flux, together with a quadratic dependence of back-action on pump photon flux, in quantitative agreement with a stochastic Bloch-equation model. At higher probe powers, additional probe-induced relaxation modifies the spin-noise spectrum while preserving the integrated noise scaling. Our results reveal fundamental, resource-dependent trade-offs unique to continuously monitored multiparameter sensors and establish experimentally the quantum limits governing their optimal operation.

Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) give rise to novel dynamical states of quantum matter realized by balancing unitary evolution and measurements. We present large-scale numerical simulations of a trapped-ion native MIPT, argued to belong to the universality class described by the Haar non-unitary conformal field theory. First, through a finite-size analysis we obtained the critical measurement rate, and correlation length exponent, which falls close to the percolation value. Second, by leveraging a monotone computable via semi-definite programming, we uncover robust algebraic decay of genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) versus separation for 2, 3, and 4 parties. The corresponding critical exponents are lower-bounded by those of the multiparty mutual information, which we determine up to 4 parties, and conjecture to be (k+2) for k parties. Additionally, we derive lower bounds for both GME and multiparty mutual information.

Motivation: Quantum computing faces challenges with errors, especially in distributed systems. This paper aims to understand how ZNE, a well-known error mitigation technique, performs in such environments, which is crucial for practical quantum computing applications.

Method: The study compares two ZNE approaches: global ZNE (applied before circuit partitioning) and local ZNE (applied to each sub-circuit independently). The researchers partition a monolithic circuit and insert noisy communication primitives between sub-circuits. They evaluate both methods under varying numbers of QPUs and different noise conditions.

Result: The findings reveal that the global ZNE exhibits superior scalability, achieving significant error reductions. Counterintuitively, increasing the number of QPUs improves mitigation effectiveness, despite the increased communication overhead. This indicates complex trade-offs in distributed quantum error mitigation.

Conclusion: This paper provides valuable insights into the scalability and effectiveness of ZNE in distributed quantum computing. The observed trade-offs highlight the need for further research into circuit structure, partitioning strategies, and network noise effects in distributed quantum systems

Abstract: Errors are the primary bottleneck preventing practical quantum computing. This challenge is exacerbated in the distributed quantum computing regime, where quantum networks introduce additional communication-induced noise. While error mitigation techniques such as Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) have proven effective for standalone quantum processors, their behavior in distributed architectures is not yet well understood. We investigate ZNE in this setting by comparing Global optimization (ZNE is applied prior to circuit partitioning), against Local optimization (ZNE is applied independently to each sub-circuit). Partitioning is performed on a monolithic circuit, which is then transformed into a distributed implementation by inserting noisy teleportation-based communication primitives between sub-circuits. We evaluate both approaches across varying numbers of quantum processing units (QPUs) and under heterogeneous local and network noise conditions. Our results demonstrate that Global ZNE exhibits superior scalability, achieving error reductions of up to $48\%$ across six QPUs. Moreover, we observe counterintuitive noise behavior, where increasing the number of QPUs improves mitigation effectiveness despite higher communication overhead. These findings highlight fundamental trade-offs in distributed quantum error mitigation and raise new questions regarding the interplay between circuit structure, partitioning strategies, and network noise.

Abstract: Quantum jumps, the collapse of a quantum system upon measurement, are among the most striking consequences of observation in quantum mechanics. While recent experiments have revealed the continuous nature of individual jumps, the crossover from coherent dynamics to measurement-dominated behaviour has remained elusive. Here, we tune the measurement strength of a continuously monitored superconducting qubit, and observe that quantum jumps emerge not through a gradual crossover, but via a cascade of three distinct dynamical transitions. The first transition manifests as an exceptional point where coherent oscillations abruptly cease, giving way to jumps towards a stable eigenstate. The second transition marks the onset of dynamical state freezing, where the qubit's dwell time near the eigenstate diverges. A third threshold signals entry into the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger measurement paradoxically suppresses relaxation. Strikingly, we find that decoherence does not blur these transitions but rather fundamentally restructures the dynamical phase diagram, notably inverting their order. These results map measurement-induced transitions in a monitored qubit, revealing that the interplay between coherent driving, measurement, and decoherence gives rise to a hierarchy of distinct dynamical phases.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural rendering, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled real-time rendering of complex scenes. However, standard 3DGS relies on spherical harmonics, which often struggle to accurately capture high-frequency view-dependent effects such as sharp reflections and transparency. While hybrid approaches like Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) mitigate this limitation using classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they remain limited by the expressivity of classical networks in low-parameter regimes. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGS, a novel hybrid framework that integrates Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) into the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. We propose a unique encoding strategy that maps the viewing direction directly onto the Bloch sphere, leveraging the natural geometry of qubits to represent 3D directional data. By replacing classical color-modulating networks with quantum circuits generated via a hypernetwork or conditioning mechanism, we achieve higher expressivity and better generalization.

Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between theoretical security and practical implementations in QKD, which is critical for ensuring the reliability and security of real-world quantum communication systems.

Method: The authors review and analyze recent analytical and numerical developments in QKD security proofs, focusing on techniques that account for system imperfections such as noise, loss, and finite-key effects.

Result: The review highlights the progress in developing robust security proofs for QKD protocols under realistic assumptions, emphasizing the importance of incorporating realistic noise and loss effects in security analyses.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the necessity of advancing QKD security proofs to accommodate practical limitations, ensuring that theoretical security bounds align with experimental implementations and enhancing the overall security of quantum communication systems.

Abstract: In contrast to classical cryptography, where the security of encoded messages typically relies on the inability of standard algorithms to overcome computational complexity assumptions, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can enable two spatially separated parties to establish an information-theoretically secure encryption, provided that the QKD protocol is underpinned by a security proof. In the last decades, security proofs robust against a wide range of eavesdropping strategies have established the theoretical soundness of several QKD protocols. However, most proofs are based on idealized models of the physical systems involved in such protocols and often include assumptions that are not satisfied in practical implementations. This mismatch creates a gap between theoretical security guarantees and actual experimental realizations, making QKD protocols vulnerable to attacks. To ensure the security of real-world QKD systems, it is therefore essential to account for imperfections in security analyses. In this article, we present an overview of recent analytical and numerical developments in QKD security proofs, which provide a versatile approach for incorporating imperfections and re-establishing the security of quantum communication protocols under realistic conditions.

Conclusion: 该算法在精度和查询次数方面均为目前最佳，并首次实现了Heisenberg精度。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of learning fermionic linear optics (FLO), also known as fermionic Gaussian unitaries. Given black-box query access to an unknown FLO, previous proposals required $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^5 / \varepsilon^2)$ queries, where $n$ is the system size and $\varepsilon$ is the error in diamond distance. These algorithms also use unphysical operations (i.e., violating fermionic superselection rules) and/or $n$ auxiliary modes to prepare Choi states of the FLO. In this work, we establish efficient and experimentally friendly protocols that obey superselection, use minimal ancilla (at most $1$ extra mode), and exhibit improved dependence on both parameters $n$ and $\varepsilon$. For arbitrary (active) FLOs this algorithm makes at most $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^4 / \varepsilon)$ queries, while for number-conserving (passive) FLOs we show that $\mathcal{O}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ queries suffice. The complexity of the active case can be further reduced to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ at the cost of using $n$ ancilla. This marks the first FLO learning algorithm that attains Heisenberg scaling in precision. As a side result, we also demonstrate an improved copy complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n η^2 / \varepsilon^2)$ for time-efficient state tomography of $η$-particle Slater determinants in $\varepsilon$ trace distance, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Nonlinear spectroscopic techniques using entangled photon pairs provide an opportunity to exploit non-classical correlations encoded in two-photon wavefunctions to manipulate two-exciton wavefunctions. We propose an entangled photon pair-enhanced multidimensional spectroscopic technique which is sensitive to exciton-exciton interactions and correlations at the ultrafast timescale. Simulations for a dissipative photosynthetic aggregate reveal the superior ability of entangled photon pairs, compared to both transform-limited and frequency-chirped laser pulses, to manipulate excited-state absorption pathways. The corresponding spectral features in the two-dimensional spectrogram are interpreted in terms of one- and two-exciton resonances. The signal scales linearly with the incoming intensity of the photon sources. It is argued that classifying these resonances using entangled photon source at the perturbative limit allow for probing exciton correlations at the natural energy scale. These insights can be used to explore multi-exciton dynamics using multiphoton entanglement.

Abstract: QASMTrans is a lightweight, high-performance, C++-based quantum compiler that bridges abstract quantum algorithms to device-level control and is designed for just-in-time (JIT) deployment on QPU testbeds with tightly integrated FPGAs or CPUs. We focus on achieving fast transpilation times on circuits of interest, we find more than 100x faster compilation than Qiskit in some circuits with similar circuit quality, enabling transpilation of large, high-depth circuits in seconds. Unlike existing tools, QASMTrans offers end-to-end device-pulse compilation and direct quantum control integration with QICK, closing the gap between logical circuits and hardware control enabling closed-loop optimization. QASMTrans supports latency-aware Application-tailored Gate Sets (AGS) at the pulse level, identifying high-impact gate sequences on the circuit critical path and synthesizing optimized pulse schedules using pre-defined robust circuit ansatz. Validated through integrated QuTiP pulse-level simulation, this is found to significantly reduce execution latency and can improve final-state fidelity by up to 12% in some tested circuits. QASMTrans further implements device-aware, noise-adaptive transpilation that uses device calibration data for circuit placement on high-quality qubits and can focus on the circuit critical path to reduce transpilation-pass time while maintaining comparable fidelity. Additionally, it introduces circuit space sharing via calibration-aware device partitioning, enabling concurrent execution of multiple circuits or shots on a single QPU. Moreover, QASMTrans is entirely self-contained and has no external library dependencies, making it easy for practical deployment. By combining fast compilation, pulse-level control, and noise-aware optimization, QASMTrans enables real-time adaptive algorithms such as ADAPT-VQE and ADAPT-QAOA.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  papers propose that encoding qubits in frequency modes potentially drastically reduces the hardware footprint of photonic quantum computers. However, they encounter difficulties with non-energy-conserving linear optics, suggesting that while this approach shows promise, implementing it may require overcoming substantial technical challenges. The paper focuses on designing frequency-mode beam splitters, specifically systems that can manipulate multiple qubit frequencies using arrays of interconnected resonators. The SLH formalism is used to model these quantum input-output networks, with the methodology enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the designs. The authors present examples for various systems, including a two-resonator phase shifter and a four-resonator interferometer, and establish a theoretical limit on the capability of frequency-domain beam splitters to native n-mode constructions, concluding that such constructions are generally not possible for arbitrary N without using interconnected components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  quantum computing is a rapidly advancing field, and reducing the physical size and complexity of hardware components is a key challenge. in photonic quantum computing, qubits encoded in frequency modes could offer a way to significantly lower the number of required qubit types or components needed, making the system more scalable and less resource-intensive. this paper explores whether such an encoding can lead to a system that is not only compact but also functional, given the inherent challenges with optical components like beam splitters and phase shifters. understanding the limitations and potential of frequency-mode systems is crucial for advancing efficient photonic quantum computing architectures.

Method:  the authors employ the SLH formalism to model quantum input-output networks, enabling the precise mathematical description of optical elements and their interconnections. this approach allows for the flexible and scalable design of multi-mode beam splitters, which can be constructed either as standalone arrays or as networks of smaller, interconnected components. the methodology also supports a systematic analysis, such as investigating scalable systems and proving theoretical no-go theorems based on the architecture's constraints.

Result:  the methodology developed provides a systematic and efficient way to design and analyze n-mode optical systems. specific results include the successful modeling and testing of a two-resonator phase shifter and a four-resonator interferometer. the authors also establish that for certain n-mode beam splitters, constructing them as native arrays of resonators is fundamentally impossible, which suggests that more complex, hierarchical designs may be necessary. this establishes clear limitations and pathways for future research in building practical, large-scale frequency-mode optical systems.

Conclusion:  this paper offers a detailed exploration of designing frequency-mode beam splitters, leveraging quantum input-output theory and mechanics. while native n-mode beam splitter arrays for arbitrary configurations may not be feasible, the approach provides a flexible framework and a design path for constructing systems that comply with the constraints, thereby paving the way for practical applications in photonic quantum computing.

Abstract: Photonic quantum computing is a strong contender in the race to fault-tolerance. Recent proposals using qubits encoded in frequency modes promise a large reduction in hardware footprint, and have garnered much attention. In this encoding, linear optics, i.e., beam splitters and phase shifters, is necessarily not energy-conserving, and is costly to implement. In this work, we present designs of frequency-mode beam splitters based on modulated arrays of coupled resonators. We develop a methodology to construct their effective transfer matrices based on the SLH formalism for quantum input-output networks. Our methodology is flexible and highly composable, allowing us to define $N$-mode beam splitters either natively based on arrays of $N$-resonators of arbitrary connectivity or as networks of interconnected $l$-mode beam splitters, with $l<N$. We apply our methodology to analyze a two-resonator device, a frequency-domain phase shifter and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer obtained from composing these devices, a four-resonator device, and present a formal no-go theorem on the possibility of natively generating certain $N$-mode frequency-domain beam splitters with arrays of $N$-resonators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of population transfer with high performance across a broad frequency range, which is crucial for quantum memory realization.

Method: The method involves using sutured adiabatic control pulses with opposite chirping directions, utilizing the hyperbolic-square-hyperbolic pulse as an example. The transfer bandwidth scales linearly with the number of sutures while maintaining high fidelity.

Result: The proposed scheme achieves rapid and robust population transfer with high fidelity. It reduces the operational time for on-demand read-out and suppresses decoherence effects, enabling multimode storage capacity and practical quantum networks.

Conclusion: This scheme significantly improves multimode storage capacity and paves the way for practical quantum networks.

Abstract: High-fidelity coherent population transfer plays a vital role in the realization of quantum memories. However, population transfer with high performance across a broad frequency range is still challenging due to the finite Rabi coupling strength limited by laser powers. Here we propose a novel population-transfer scheme by suturing adiabatic control pulses with each pulse covering certain frequency interval, which are connected in a way that neighboring adiabatic pulses have opposite chirping directions. Taking the widely utilized hyperbolic-square-hyperbolic pulse as an example, we demonstrate that rapid and robust population transfer can be achieved. The transfer bandwidth scales linearly with the number of suture pulses while maintaining high fidelity, even at the suture points where adiabaticity breaks down. Crucially, these pulses can be realized by a single laser by means of temporal multiplexing. For a given bandwidth, this strategy substantially reduces the operational time which is necessary for on demand read-out and suppressing decoherence effects. Our scheme enables a dramatic increase in multimode storage capacity and paves the way for realizing practical quantum networks.

Abstract: Digital signal processing technology has paved the way for the realization of high-speed continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems. However, existing security proofs are limited to static digital signal processing algorithms, while practical systems rely on dynamic multiple-input multiple-output algorithms to compensate for time-varying channel impairments. Our analysis reveals that the conventional dynamic algorithm, due to its non-unitary nature, systematically underestimates the excess noise, which in turn leads to security issues and the generation of insecure keys. To close this gap, we propose a secure algorithm model, mapping the dynamic algorithm to an equivalent physical optical model whose security can be rigorously assessed. Simulations illustrate the algorithm's non-unitary property and provide a quantitative analysis of the excess noise underestimation caused by the conventional algorithm. We further experimentally validate the necessity of the proposed modeling for dynamic digital signal processing, achieving a secret key rate of 14.4 Mbps based on estimated excess noise of 0.07 shot noise unit; whereas the conventional algorithm would have dangerously overestimated the key rate to 28.2 Mbps with noise of 0.008 shot noise unit. This work provides the essential security framework for dynamic digital signal processing, overcoming a critical impediment for the development of high-performance continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We study how quantum behavior transitions to classical behavior in a specific optical setup called Kerr dynamics when loss is present. We find three different time periods: a classical phase, a long time where quantum effects are less noticeable, and an intermediate phase where quantum behavior persists despite some loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the quantum-to-classical transition is essential for advancing quantum information technologies, especially in realistic scenarios with loss.

Method: We used mathematical models and simulations to analyze the system's behavior under different conditions.

Result: We found that quantum effects are significant in the intermediate time frame even with loss, which opens up new possibilities for quantum resource generation in optical systems.

Conclusion: This work enriches our understanding of quantum-classical transitions and offers new strategies for using quantum systems robustly despite losses, important for practical quantum technologies.

Abstract: We quantify the quantum-to-classical transition of the single-mode Kerr nonlinear dynamics in the presence of loss. We establish three time scales that govern the dynamics, each with distinct characteristics. For times short compared to the Ehrenfest time, the evolution is classical, characterized by Gaussian dynamics. For sufficiently long times, as we increase the initial photon number, unitary Kerr evolution would generate macroscopic superpositions of coherent states (so-called kitten states), but this is severely restricted in the presence of small photon loss so that expectation values of observables coincide with their classical values. The intermediate time scale, however, shows resilient quantum behavior in the macroscopic limit. We show that in the mean-field non-Gaussian regime, the Kerr Hamiltonian (with small photon loss) generates a significant amount of Wigner-negativity, and classical flow is recovered only if the loss rate grows with system size. Our results broaden the usual understanding of quantum-to-classical transitions and demonstrate the potential for creating robust nonclassical resources for continuous-variable quantum information processing in the presence of loss.

Abstract: We propose a tensor-network (TN) approach for solving classical optimization problems that is inspired by spectral filtering and sampling on quantum states. We first shift and scale an Ising Hamiltonian of the cost function so that all eigenvalues become non-negative and the ground states correspond to the the largest eigenvalues, which are then amplified by power iteration. We represent the transformed Hamiltonian as a matrix product operator (MPO) and form an immense power of this object via truncated MPO-MPO contractions, embedding the resulting operator into a matrix product state for sampling in the computational basis. In contrast to the density-matrix renormalization group, our approach provides a straightforward route to systematic improvement by increasing the bond dimension and is better at avoiding local minima. We also study the performance of this power method in the context of a higher-order Ising Hamiltonian on a heavy-hexagonal lattice, making a comparison with simulated annealing. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired algorithms for solving optimization problems and provide a baseline for assessing and developing quantum algorithms.

Abstract: We investigate the scattering of a charged quantum particle in a helically twisted background that induces an effective Coulomb-like interaction, in the presence of an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux. Starting from the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation in the twisted metric, we derive the radial equation and show that, after including the AB potential, it can be mapped onto the same Kummer-type differential equation that governs the planar $2D$ Coulomb $+$ AB problem, with a geometry-induced Coulomb strength and the azimuthal quantum number shifted as $m\to m-λ$. We construct the exact scattering solutions, obtain closed expressions for the partial-wave $S$ matrix and phase shifts, and derive the corresponding scattering amplitude, differential cross section, and total cross section. We also show that the pole structure of the $S$ matrix is consistent with the bound-state quantization previously obtained for the helically twisted Coulomb-like problem.

Abstract: The emergence of the Barren Plateau phenomenon poses a significant challenge to quantum machine learning. While most Barren Plateau analyses focus on single-qubit rotation gates, the gradient behavior of Parameterized Quantum Circuits built from multi-qubit gates remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a general theoretical framework for analyzing the gradient properties of Parameterized Quantum Circuits with multi-qubit gates. Our method generalizes the direct computation framework, bypassing the Haar random assumption on parameters and enabling the calculation of the gradient expectation and variance. We apply this framework to single-layer and deep-layer circuits, deriving analytical results that quantify how gradient variance is co-determined by the size of the multi-qubit gate and the number of qubits, layers, and effective parameters. Numerical simulations validate our findings. Our study provides a refined framework for analyzing and optimizing Parameterized Quantum Circuits with complex multi-qubit gates.

Abstract: We introduce a high-order dynamical decoupling (DD) scheme for arbitrary system-bath interactions in the weak-coupling regime. Given any decoupling group $\mathcal G$ that averages the interaction to zero, our construction yields pulse sequences whose length scales as $\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal G| K)$, while canceling all error terms linear in the system-bath coupling strength up to order $K$ in the total evolution time. As a corollary, for an $n$-qubit system with $k$-local system-bath interactions, we obtain an $\mathcal{O}(n^{k-1}K)$-pulse sequence, a significant improvement over existing schemes with $\mathcal{O}(\exp(n))$ pulses (for $k=\mathcal{O}(1)$). The construction is obtained via a mapping to the continuous necklace-splitting problem, which asks how to cut a multi-colored interval into pieces that give each party the same share of every color. We provide explicit pulse sequences for suppressing general single-qubit decoherence, prove that the pulse count is asymptotically optimal, and verify the predicted error scaling in numerical simulations. For the same number of pulses, we observe that our sequences outperform the state-of-the-art Quadratic DD in the weak-coupling regime. We also note that the same construction extends to suppress slow, time-dependent Hamiltonian noise.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Matchgate unitaries are ubiquitous in quantum computation due to their relation to non-interacting fermions and because they can be used to benchmark quantum computers. Implementing such unitaries on fault-tolerant devices requires first compiling them into a discrete universal gate set, typically Clifford$+T$. Here, we propose a different approach for their synthesis: compile matchgate unitaries using only matchgate gates. To this end, we first show that the matchgate-Clifford group (the intersection of the matchgate and Clifford groups) plus the $\overline{T}$ gate (a $T$ unitary up to a phase) is universal for the matchgate group. Our approach leverages the connection between $n$-qubit matchgate circuits and the standard representation of $\mathbb{SO}(2n)$, which reduces the compilation from $2^n\times 2^n$ unitaries to $2n\times2n$ ones, thus reducing exponentially the size of the target matrix. Moreover, we rigorously show that this scheme is efficient, as an approximation error $\varepsilon_{\mathbb{SO}(2n)}$ incurred in this smaller-dimensional representation translates at most into an $O(n \,\varepsilon_{\mathbb{SO}(2n)})$ error in the exponentially large unitary. In addition, we study the exact version of the matchgate synthesis problem, and we prove that all matchgate unitaries $U$ such that $U\otimes U^*$ has entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}\big[1/\sqrt 2,i\big]$ can be exactly synthesized by a finite sequence of gates from the matchgate-Clifford$+\overline{T}$ set, without ancillas. We then use this insight to map optimal exact matchgate synthesis to Boolean satisfiability, and compile the circuits that diagonalize the free-fermionic $XX$ Hamiltonian on $n=4,\,8$ qubits.

Abstract: The no-signalling principle is a fundamental assumption in Bell-inequality and quantum-steering experiments. Nonetheless, experimental imperfections can lead to apparent violations beyond those expected from finite-sample statistics. Here, we propose extensions of local hidden variable and local hidden state theories that allow for bounded, operationally quantifiable, amounts of signalling. We show how non-classicality tests can be developed for these models, both through exact methods based on the full set of observed statistics and through corrections to the standard Bell and steering inequalities. We demonstrate the applicability of these methods via two scenarios that feature apparent signalling: an IBM quantum processor and post-selected data from inefficient detectors.

Abstract: Among the intriguing features of quantum theory, the problem of distinguishing quantum channels is of fundamental interest. In this paper, we focus on the single-shot discrimination of two noisy quantum channels using two distinct classes of probes: single-system (product) probes and entangled probes. Our aim is to identify optimal probing state for specific discrimination tasks and to analyze the necessity and role of entanglement in enhancing channel distinguishability. We show that maximally entangled probes are optimal for discriminating two qubit depolarizing channels, with any nonzero entanglement providing an advantage over single-system probes. In contrast, for dephasing channels in arbitrary dimensions, we prove that single-system probe can be optimal and that entanglement offers no improvement, even when the dephasing unitary is generalized. For qubit amplitude-damping channels, we identify distinct noise-dependent regimes in which either single-system probe outperforms maximally entangled probes and vice-versa. Moreover, we demonstrate that non-maximally entangled probes can act as the optimum probe if the noise parameters restricted to certain values in this task. We also present examples of noisy unitary channels for which discrimination is possible using non-maximally entangled probe, while both single-systems and maximally entangled probes fail. We introduce another class of noisy unitary channels for which perfect discrimination is achievable with a single system, while maximally entangled probes are insufficient. Finally, we show that two erasure channels can be optimally discriminated using any pure single-system probe, with no advantage gained from entanglement.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore boson sampling complexity with optical feedback, introducing a potentially harder problem than conventional boson sampling.

Method: We consider multiple methods, including spatiotemporal mode-unfolding, Kraus-operator formalism, and correlation-tensor-based approach, to study photon distributions.

Result: The research finds a unique stationary state in random interferometers due to feedback, leading to the new hard problem, which is harder than conventional boson sampling.

Conclusion: This suggests that stationary distribution boson sampling is a more challenging problem than standard boson sampling when optical feedback is present.

Abstract: This work presents a theoretical model of boson sampling with optical feedback, in which a subset of the interferometer's output modes is looped back into the input modes. If the bosons are injected periodically into the input modes of the interferometer and optical feedback lines' length match the period of injection, it allows for interference between bosons injected at the consequent time iterations. We propose several methods methods for computing the output photon distributions in both output spacial and temporal modes, including not only standard spatiotemporal mode-unfolding technique, but also the Kraus-operator formalism, and a correlation-tensor-based approach. The two latter approaches help us to reveal that for random interferometers this system evolves to a unique stationary state over time. Because of the existence of the stationary state, we introduce new computational problem \textit{Stationary Distribution Boson Sampling} which appears to be harder than conventional boson sampling problem and contains it as a special case when there are no optical feedback lines.

Abstract: As a quantum-inspired, non-traditional analog solver architecture, the analog Ising machine (AIM) has emerged as a distinctive computational paradigm to address the rapidly growing demand for computational power. However, the mathematical understanding of its principles, as well as the optimization of its solution speed and accuracy, remain unclear. In this work, we for the first time systematically discuss multiple implementations of AIM and establish a unified mathematical formulation. On this basis, by treating the binarization constraint of AIM (such as injection locking) as a Lagrange multiplier in optimization theory and combining it with a Lyapunov analysis from dynamical systems theory, an analytical framework for evaluating solution speed and accuracy is constructed, and further demonstrate that conventional AIMs possess a theoretical performance upper bound. Subsequently, by elevating the binarization constraint to a control variable, we propose the controllable analog Ising machine (CAIM), which integrates control Lyapunov functions and momentum-based optimization algorithms to realize adaptive sampling-feedback control, thereby surpassing the performance limits of conventional AIMs. In a proof-of-concept CAIM demonstration implemented using an FPGA-controlled LC-oscillator Ising machine, CAIM achieves a twofold speedup and a 7\% improvement in accuracy over AIM on a 50-node all-to-all weighted MaxCut problem, validating both the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed theoretical framework.

Motivation: Quantum process tomography is crucial for analyzing quantum information tasks, but corrupted noise complicates this process. This paper addresses this challenge.

Method: The authors propose using the Choi-state representation and the process-matrix representation to reconstruct quantum gates and their noise. They utilize the restricted isometry property for sparse noise reconstruction.

Result: The implementation of these methods significantly reduces the number of experimental configurations required under corrupted noise.

Conclusion: This approach enhances the efficiency of quantum process tomography, providing a robust solution for dealing with corrupted noise in quantum information tasks.

Abstract: Quantum processes, including quantum gates and channels, are integral to various quantum information tasks, making the efficient characterization of these processes and their underlying noise critically important. Here, we propose a framework for quantum process tomography in the presence of corrupted noise that is able to simultaneously reconstruct the process and corrupted noise. Firstly, within the Choi-state representation, we derive the corresponding generalized restricted isometry property and demonstrate the simultaneous reconstruction of various quantum gates under sparse noise. Moreover, in comparison with the Choi-state scheme, the process-matrix representation is employed to simultaneously reconstruct sparse noise and a broader range of target quantum gates. Our results demonstrate that significant reduction in experimental configurations is achievable even under corrupted noise.

Abstract: Light-matter interfaces are pivotal for quantum computation and communication. While typically analyzed using single-mode or open-quantum-system approximations, these models often neglect multi-mode field states and light-matter entanglement, hindering exact protocol modeling. Here, we solve the full Hamiltonian dynamics of a solid-state spin-photon interface for three key protocols: the generation of photon-number superpositions, a controlled photon-photon gate, and the production of photonic cluster states. By deriving exact fidelities, we identify fundamental performance limits. Our results reveal that while realistic imperfections severely limit photon-photon gates, they only slightly affect linear photonic clusters and are nearly harmless for photon-number state superpositions.

Abstract: Nuclear spins provide an ideal platform for studying quantum correlations and open quantum system dynamics across diverse areas, including quantum information, quantum foundations, and many-body physics. This is enabled by their long longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) coherence times and precise control using radio frequency pulses. In this thesis, I present my work using nuclear spins to explore these themes.
  First, I study temporal quantum correlations quantified by the Leggett Garg inequality (LGI) for a qubit evolving under a superposition of unitary operators. Using a three qubit quantum register, we experimentally realized superposed unitaries and observed LGI violations exceeding the maximal quantum bound of 1.5, indicating enhanced non-classicality. Notably, this superposed unitary dynamics also showed improved robustness against decoherence.
  Next, I investigate Lee Yang zeros, which are zeros of the partition function in the complex plane that reveal thermodynamic behavior near criticality. We proposed and experimentally demonstrated a method to determine the full set of Lee Yang zeros of an asymmetric Ising model using a single quantum probe in a three-qubit nuclear spin register. We further showed that the mutual information between the probe and system peaks at times corresponding to these zeros.
  I then report our study of the quantum Mpemba effect in nuclear spin relaxation, where systems farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to steady state, verified both theoretically and experimentally using NMR. Finally, I discuss our work on entanglement localization and delocalization induced by local interactions, leading to an apparent violation of the quantum data processing inequality. We showed that this violation is only apparent by constructing a completely positive and trace preserving map describing the dynamics.

Abstract: In this work, we address the numerical identification of entanglement in dynamical scenarios. To this end, we consider different programs based on the restriction of the evolution to the set of separable (i.e., non-entangled) states, together with the discretization of the space of variables for numerical computations. As a first approach, we apply linear splitting methods to the restricted, continuous equations of motion derived from variational principles. We utilize an exchange interaction Hamiltonian to confirm that the numerical and analytical solutions coincide in the limit of small time steps. The application to different Hamiltonians shows the wide applicability of the method to detect dynamical entanglement. To avoid the derivation of analytical solutions for complex dynamics, we consider variational, numerical integration schemes, introducing a variational discretization for Lagrangians linear in velocities. Here, we examine and compare two approaches: one in which the system is discretized before the restriction is applied, and another in which the restriction precedes the discretization. We find that the "first-discretize-then-restrict" method becomes numerically unstable, already for the example of an exchange-interaction Hamiltonian, which can be an important consideration for the numerical analysis of constrained quantum dynamics. Thereby, broadly applicable numerical tools, including their limitations, for studying entanglement over time are established for assessing the entangling power of processes that are used in quantum information theory.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum control is a core aspect of quantum information science, with broad applications spanning quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Extending control capabilities from CPTP to HPTP maps opens new possibilities in entanglement detection, error mitigation, simulation, and machine learning.

Method: The proposed method involves compiling a target HPTP map into a CPTP map with a Kraus rank no larger than the intrinsic rank of the HPTP map plus one, followed by classical post-processing. This approach avoids the inefficiencies of decomposing HPTP maps into multiple CPTP maps or approximating them with large bipartite Hamiltonians.

Result: Numerical simulations for inverse noise channels, such as bosonic photon loss, demonstrate significant resource reductions, indicating improved efficiency and scalability in higher-dimensional quantum systems.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable and efficient solution for implementing HPTP maps, advancing quantum information processing and enabling innovative applications in quantum computing, communication, and sensing.

Abstract: Quantum control has been a cornerstone of quantum information science, driving major advances in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. Over the years, it has enabled the implementation of arbitrary completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) maps; an important next step is to extend control to Hermitian-preserving and trace-preserving (HPTP) maps, which underpin applications such as entanglement detection, quantum error mitigation, quantum simulation, and quantum machine learning. Here we present an efficient and fully constructive method for implementing arbitrary HPTP maps. Unlike existing methods that decompose an HPTP map into multiple CPTP maps or approximate it using bipartite Hamiltonians with large Hilbert spaces, our approach compiles a target HPTP map into a single executable CPTP map whose Kraus rank is guaranteed to be no larger than the intrinsic rank of the target HPTP map plus one, followed by simple classical post-processing. Numerical results for inverse noise channels used in quantum error mitigation, including bosonic photon loss, confirm substantial reductions in resources and highlight scalability in higher-dimensional settings. Together with our numerical benchmarks, these results validate the efficiency and versatility of the proposed framework, opening a route to broader quantum-information applications enabled by HPTP processing.

Abstract: Classical communication is the basis for many of our current and future technologies, such as mobile phones, video conferences, autonomous vehicles and particularly the internet. In contrast, quantum communication is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Due to this fundamental difference, it might offer enormous benefits for security applications, more precise measurements, faster computations, and many other fields of application by interconnecting different quantum devices, such as quantum sensors, quantum computers, or quantum memories. This review provides an overview of the specific properties of quantum information networks. This includes the interfaces between the classical and the quantum regime, the transmission of the quantum information by physical implementations, and potential future applications of quantum networks. We aim to provide a starting point based on fundamental concepts of quantum information processing for further research on a future quantum internet.

Abstract: We consider the distributed wake-up problem with advice, where nodes are equipped with initial knowledge about the network at large. After the adversary awakens a subset of nodes, an oracle computes a bit string (``the advice'') for each node, and the goal is to wake up all sleeping nodes efficiently. We present the first upper and lower bounds on the message complexity for wake-up in the quantum routing model, introduced by Dufoulon, Magniez, and Pandurangan (PODC 2025). In more detail, we give a distributed advising scheme that, given $α$ bits of advice per node, wakes up all nodes with a message complexity of $O( \sqrt{\frac{n^3}{2^{\max\{\lfloor (α-1)/2 \rfloor},0\}}}\cdot\log n )$ with high probability. Our result breaks the $Ω( \frac{n^2}{2^α} )$ barrier known for the classical port numbering model in sufficiently dense graphs. To complement our algorithm, we give a lower bound on the message complexity for distributed quantum algorithms: By leveraging a lower bound result for the single-bit descriptor problem in the query complexity model, we show that wake-up has a quantum message complexity of $Ω( n^{3/2} )$ without advice, which holds independently of how much time we allow. In the setting where an adversary decides which nodes start the algorithm, most graph problems of interest implicitly require solving wake-up, and thus the same lower bound also holds for other fundamental problems such as single-source broadcast and spanning tree construction.

Abstract: The use of tantalum films for superconducting qubits has recently extended qubit coherence times significantly, primarily due to reduced dielectric losses at the metal-air interface. However, the choice of base material also influences the sensitivity to quasiparticle-induced decoherence. In this study, we investigate quasiparticle tunneling rates in niobium and tantalum-based offset-charge-sensitive qubits. Using a source of thermal radiation, we characterize the sensitivity of either material to infrared radiation and explore the impact of the infrared background through the targeted use of in-line filters in the wiring and ambient infrared absorbers. We identify both radiation channels as significant contributions to decoherence for tantalum but not for niobium qubits and achieve tunneling rates of 100 Hz and 300 Hz for niobium and tantalum respectively upon installation of infrared filters. Additionally, we find a time-dependence in the observed tunneling rates on the scale of days, which we interpret as evidence of slowly cooling, thermally radiating components in the experimental setup. Our findings indicate that continued improvements in coherence times may require renewed attention to radiative backgrounds and experimental setup design, especially when introducing new material platforms.

Abstract: Statistical functions such as the moment-generating function, characteristic function, cumulant-generating function, and second characteristic function are cornerstone tools in classical statistics and probability theory. They provide a powerful means to analyze the statistical properties of a system and find applications in diverse fields, including statistical physics and field theory. While these functions are ubiquitous in classical theory, a quantum counterpart has remained elusive due to the fundamental hurdle of noncommutativity of operators. The lack of such a framework has obscured the deep connections between standard statistical measures and the non-classical features of quantum mechanics. Here, we establish a comprehensive framework for quantum statistical functions that transcends these limitations, naturally unifying the disparate languages of standard quantum statistics, quasiprobability distributions, and weak values. We show that these functions, defined as expectation values with respect to the purified state, naturally reproduce fundamental quantum statistical quantities like expectation values, variance, and covariance upon differentiation. Crucially, by extending this framework to include the concepts of pre- and post-selection, we define conditional quantum statistical functions that uniquely yield weak values and weak variance. We further demonstrate that multivariable quantum statistical functions, when defined with specific operator orderings, correspond to well-known quasiprobability distributions. Our framework provides a cohesive mathematical structure that not only reproduces standard quantum statistical measures but also incorporates nonclassical features of quantum mechanics, thus laying the foundation for a deeper understanding of quantum statistics.

Abstract: Transformations of quantum channels, such as the transpose, complex conjugate, and adjoint, are fundamental to quantum information theory. Given access to an unknown channel, a central problem is whether these transformations can be implemented physically with quantum supermaps. While such supermaps are known for unitary operations, the situation for general quantum channels is fundamentally different. In this work, we establish a strict hierarchy of physical realizability for the transposition, complex conjugation, and adjoint transformation of an unknown quantum channel. We present a probabilistic protocol that exactly implements the transpose with a single query. In contrast, we prove no-go theorems showing that neither the complex conjugate nor the adjoint can be implemented by any completely positive supermap, even probabilistically. We then overcome this impossibility by designing a virtual protocol for the complex conjugate based on quasi-probability decomposition, and show its optimality in terms of the diamond norm. As a key application, we propose a protocol to estimate the expectation values resulting from the Petz recovery map of an unknown channel, achieving an improved query complexity compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) achieves information-theoretic security, without relying on computational assumptions, by distributing quantum states. To establish secret bits, two honest parties exploit key distillation protocols over measurement outcomes resulting after the the distribution of quantum states. In this work, we establish a rigorous connection between the key rate achievable by applying two-way key distillation, such as advantage distillation, and quantum asymptotic hypothesis testing, via an integral representation of the relative entropy. This connection improves key rates at small to intermediate blocklengths relative to existing fidelity-based bounds and enables the computation of entropy bounds for intermediate to large blocklengths. Moreover, this connection allows one to close the gap between known sufficient and conjectured necessary conditions for key generation in the asymptotic regime, while the precise finite blocklegth conditions remain open. More broadly, our work shows how advances in quantum multiple hypothesis testing can directly sharpen the security analyses of QKD.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of efficiently generating thermal states, which are crucial for understanding complex quantum phenomena like thermalization, chaos, and quantum phase transitions. The development of a scalable method is essential for advancing research in quantum thermodynamics and related fields.

Method: The method introduced utilizes the thermal-drift channel, a tunable nonunitary operation, combined with a measurement-controlled sampling algorithm. This approach allows for the generation of thermal states alongside their Hamiltonian labels, providing a framework that scales favorably with system size.

Result: The algorithm's scaling is cubic with system size, quadratic with inverse temperature, and inversely cubic with error tolerance, achieving logarithmic dependence on failure probability. Numerical simulations for the 2D Heisenberg model confirm these predictions, and the method enables the investigation of level-spacing statistics, demonstrating a crossover toward Wigner-Dyson distribution, a hallmark of quantum chaos and random matrix universality.

Conclusion: The presented approach offers a scalable and efficient solution to generating thermal states, opening new avenues for studying thermalization and quantum chaos on near-term quantum hardware, with applications in quantum phase transitions and chaos diagnostics.

Abstract: Random thermal states of many-body Hamiltonians underpin studies of thermalization, chaos, and quantum phase transitions, yet their generation remains costly when each Hamiltonian must be prepared individually. We introduce the thermal-drift channel, a measurement-based operation that implements a tunable nonunitary drift along a chosen Pauli term. Based on this channel, we present a measurement-controlled sampling algorithm that generates thermal states together with their Hamiltonian "labels" for general physical models. We prove that the total gate count of our algorithm scales cubically with system size, quadratically with inverse temperature, and as the inverse error tolerance to the two-thirds power, with logarithmic dependence on the allowed failure probability. We also show that the induced label distribution approaches a normal distribution reweighted by the thermal partition function, which makes an explicit trade-off between accuracy and effective range. Numerical simulations for a 2D Heisenberg model validate the predicted scaling and distribution. As an application, we compute unfolding-free level-spacing ratio statistics from sampled thermal states of a 2D transverse-field Ising model and observe a crossover toward the Wigner--Dyson prediction, demonstrating a practical and scalable route to chaos diagnostics and random matrix universality studies on near-term quantum hardware.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers remains a challenging endeavor, forcing state-of-the-art quantum hardware to rely heavily on noise mitigation techniques. Standard quantum error mitigation is typically based on post-processing strategies. In contrast, the present work explores a pre-processing approach, in which the effects of noise are mitigated before performing a measurement on the output state. The main idea is to find an observable $Y$ such that its expectation value on a noisy quantum state $\mathcal{E(ρ)}$ matches the expectation value of a target observable $X$ on the noiseless quantum state $ρ$. Our method requires the execution of a noisy quantum circuit, followed by the measurement of the surrogate observable $Y$. The main enablers of our method in practical scenarios are Tensor Networks. The proposed method improves over Tensor Error Mitigation (TEM) in terms of average error, circuit depth, and complexity, attaining a measurement overhead that approaches the theoretical lower bound. The improvement in terms of classical computation complexity is in the order of $\sim 10^6$ times when compared to the post-processing computational cost of TEM in practical scenarios. Such gain comes from eliminating the need to perform the set of informationally complete positive operator-valued measurements (IC-POVM) required by TEM, as well as any other tomographic strategy.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms for binary optimization problems have been the subject of extensive study. However, the application of quantum algorithms to integer optimization problems remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we study the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) applied to integer problems on graphs, with each integer variable encoded in a qudit. We derive a general iterative formula for depth-$p$ QAOA expectation on high-girth $d$-regular graphs of arbitrary size. The cost of evaluating the formula is exponential in the QAOA depth $p$ but does not depend on the graph size. Evaluating this formula for Max-$k$-Cut problem for $p\leq 4$, we identify parameter regimes ($k=3$ with degree $d \leq 10$ and $k=4$ with $d \leq 40$) in which QAOA outperforms the Frieze-Jerrum semi-definite programming (SDP) algorithm, which provides the best worst-case guarantee on the approximation ratio. To strengthen the classical baseline we introduce a new heuristic algorithm, based on the degree-of-saturation, that empirically outperforms both the Frieze-Jerrum algorithm and shallow-depth QAOA. Nevertheless, we provide numerical evidence that QAOA may overtake this heuristic at depth $p\leq 20$. Our results show that moving beyond binary to integer optimization problems can open up new avenues for quantum advantage.

Abstract: Motivated by the question of the distinguishability of ensembles described by the same compressed density operator, we propose a model for one-way quantum secure direct communication using finite ensembles of shared EPR pairs per bit and a public authenticated classical channel, where the local choice of one of two mutually-unbiased measurement bases is the secret bit. In this model, both the encoding and decoding of classical information in quantum systems are implemented by measurements in either the computational or the Hadamard basis. Using the quantum wiretap channel theory, we study the secure net bit rates and certify information-theoretic security of different implementations of our model when the quantum channel is subjected to BB84-symmetric attacks. Since no local unitary operations need to be performed by the receiver, the proposed model is suitable for real-life implementation of secure direct communication in star network configurations.

Motivation: The paper aims to improve the efficiency of the Rodeo Algorithm for quantum computing tasks, which is a significant advancement given the resource-intensive nature of quantum state preparation.

Method: The research employs theoretical analysis, mathematical modeling, and numerical simulations to study the performance of the Rodeo Algorithm with geometric time sampling. It specifically examines a model Hamiltonian representative of gapped many-body systems.

Result: The study concludes that a geometric series of time samples provides a robust and efficient strategy for the Rodeo Algorithm, achieving exponential runtime performance and demonstrating practical applicability across diverse Hamiltonians.

Conclusion: This work offers a universally applicable time-sampling method for enhancing the Rodeo Algorithm's efficiency, making it more viable for real-world quantum computing applications without requiring extensive model-specific tuning.

Abstract: The Rodeo Algorithm is a quantum computing method for computing the energy spectrum of a Hamiltonian and preparing its energy eigenstates. We discuss how to improve the performance of the rodeo algorithm for each of these two applications. In particular, we demonstrate that using a geometric series of time samples offers a near-optimal optimization space for a given total runtime by studying the Rodeo Algorithm performance on a model Hamiltonian representative of gapped many-body quantum systems. Analytics explain the performance of this time sampling and the conditions for it to maintain the established exponential performance of the Rodeo Algorithm. We finally demonstrate this sampling protocol on various physical Hamiltonians, showing its practical applicability. Our results suggest that geometric series of times provide a practical, near-optimal, and robust time-sampling strategy for quantum state preparation with the Rodeo Algorithm across varied Hamiltonians without requiring model-specific fine-tuning.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new approach is proposed to improve the accuracy of ground state estimates in VQE algorithms by employing subspace representations with soft-coded orthogonality constraints. This method allows for shallower quantum circuits while maintaining high fidelity compared to single-state and multi-state representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for improving the accuracy and efficiency of Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms is driven by the desire to leverage quantum computing for chemical and material science applications, where VQE is a key tool for estimating ground states of molecular and material Hamiltonians.

Method: The authors propose a method where orthogonality constraints are soft-coded via penalty terms in the cost function, rather than being enforced hard-coded at the circuit level. This is applied in the context of subspace representations, which are used to approximate the ground state of the Hamiltonian. The method is tested on two benchmark cases: a 3x3 transverse-field Ising model and random realizations of the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model on a 4x4 lattice.

Result: The results demonstrate that this new approach allows for shallower quantum circuits while maintaining high fidelity when compared to single-state (standard VQE) and multi-state (SSVQE or MCVQE) representations. This suggests that the method could be particularly useful for near-term quantum computing applications where circuit depth is a limiting factor.

Conclusion: The proposed soft-coded orthogonality constraints in the subspace representation offer a promising direction for optimizing VQE algorithms, potentially improving their efficiency and applicability on quantum hardware with limited qubit and circuit resources.

Abstract: We propose a new approach to improve the accuracy of ground state estimates in Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms by employing subspace representations with soft-coded orthogonality constraints. As in other subspace-based VQE methods, such as the Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) and Multistate Contracted VQE (MCVQE), once the parameters are optimized to maximize the subspace overlap with the low-energy sector of the Hamiltonian, one diagonalizes the Hamiltonian restricted to the subspace. Unlike these methods, where \emph{hard-coded} orthogonality constraints are enforced at the circuit level among the states spanning the subspace, we consider a subspace representation where orthogonality is \emph{soft-coded} via penalty terms in the cost function. We show that this representation allows for shallower quantum circuits while maintaining high fidelity when compared to single-state (standard VQE) and multi-state (SSVQE or MCVQE) representations, on two benchmark cases: a $3\times 3$ transverse-field Ising model and random realizations of the Edwards--Anderson spin-glass model on a $4\times 4$ lattice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper extends the study of holographic entropy cones from static to general time-dependent states, addressing an open problem posed by Bao et al. The authors use the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) framework and introduce a new graph model based on causal structures, providing a rigorous foundation for understanding entropy inequalities in dynamic settings.

Method: The paper utilizes the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula and the HRT formula to construct a graph model directly from causal structures of entanglement wedges. A key 'no-short-cut' theorem is established to relate the minimal graph cuts to unions of complete HRT surfaces.

Result: The authors prove that the covariant holographic entropy cone is equivalent to the static one, showing that all foundational results, including polyhedrality and finiteness of entropy inequalities, extend to general holographic states.

Conclusion: This work resolves a significant open problem in holographic entropy studies and establishes that the entropy cone's properties hold broadly across different spacetime geometries.

Abstract: The holographic entropy cone classifies the possible entanglement structures of quantum states with a classical gravity dual. For static geometries, Bao et al. established that this cone is polyhedral by constructing a graph model from Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surfaces on a time-symmetric slice. Extending this framework to general, time-dependent states governed by the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) formula has remained an open problem, as the relevant extremal surfaces do not lie on a common spatial slice. We resolve this by constructing a graph model directly from the causal structure of entanglement wedges. By proving a key "no-short-cut" theorem, we show that minimization over graph cuts reduces to a consideration of cuts corresponding to unions of complete HRT surfaces, establishing the equivalence of the covariant and static holographic entropy cones. Consequently, all foundational results, including polyhedrality and the finite nature of entropy inequalities, extend to general holographic states.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of a bifiltered affine scheme to describe decoupling relations in the operator product expansion of 4d N=2 superconformal field theories, which encode the Macdonald index, Schur index, and Higgs branch. A geometric extremization principle determines the moduli of the associated scheme, suggesting a classification pathway for such theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the structure of 4d N=2 superconformal field theories (SCFTs) is crucial in theoretical physics, particularly in the study of quantum field theories and string theory. The operator product expansion (OPE) and its decoupling relations play a central role in characterizing these theories, making their classification a significant goal.

Method: The authors propose utilizing an algebro-geometric object, specifically a bifiltered affine scheme, to model the decoupling relations within the OPE of 4d N=2 SCFTs. By analyzing the properties of this scheme, the paper demonstrates its ability to reproduce key indices (Macdonald and Schur) and the Higgs branch. Continuous deformations of the scheme are considered, but a geometric extremization principle is introduced to uniquely determine the moduli, potentially aiding in the classification of these theories.

Result: The study establishes that the bifiltered affine scheme effectively encodes decoupling relations in the OPE of 4d N=2 SCFTs. It is shown that this framework can reproduce the Macdonald index, Schur index, and Higgs branch. Importantly, the geometric extremization principle successfully determines the moduli of the scheme, offering a viable geometric approach to classifying 4d N=2 SCFTs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the bifiltered affine scheme provides a promising method for describing and classifying 4d N=2 SCFTs by analyzing their decoupling relations in the OPE. The identification of moduli via a geometric extremization principle represents a significant step toward a systematic classification of such theories.

Abstract: We conjecture that decoupling relations in the operator product expansion of a 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) are encoded by an algebro-geometric object: a bifiltered affine scheme. We demonstrate how this scheme reproduces the Macdonald index (thus the Schur index) as well as the Higgs branch. Although the associated scheme typically admits continuous deformations, we find that a geometric extremization principle uniquely fixes these moduli, thereby providing a possible geometric route toward a classification of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs.

Abstract: In this work we study the relationship between quantum random walks on graphs and Krylov/spread complexity. We show that the latter's definition naturally emerges through a canonical method of reducing a graph to a chain, on which we can identify the usual Krylov structure. We use this identification to construct families of graphs corresponding to special classes of systems with known complexity features and conversely, to compute Krylov complexity for graphs of physical interest. The two main outcomes are the analytic computation of the Lanczos coefficients for the SYK model for an arbitrary number $q$ of interacting fermions and the complete characterization of Krylov complexity for the hypercube graph in any number of dimensions. The latter serves as the starting point for an in-depth comparison between Krylov and circuit complexities as they purportedly arise in the context of black holes. We find that while under certain conditions Krylov complexity follows the growth and saturation pattern ascribed to such systems, the timescale at which saturation happens can generally be shorter than what is predicted by random unitary circuits, due to the effects of quantum speed-ups commonly occurring when comparing quantum and classical random walks.

Abstract: In thermodynamics, a Legendre transformation of the free energy provides a mapping between different statistical ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate that performing a Legendre transformation of the black hole on-shell action is equivalent to imposing different boundary conditions on the fields. Consequently, the choice of ensemble must be consistent with, and cannot contradict, the imposed boundary conditions. From this perspective, it follows that for four-dimensional dyonic black holes, the on-shell action can only be expressed either as a function of the electric charge and the magnetic potential, or alternatively as a function of the magnetic charge and the electric potential. Inspired by the Legendre transformation of the Maxwell field, we argue that for purely gravitational theories whose metric geometries admit a \(U(1)\) fiber bundle structure, i.e.\ rotating, boosted, or Kaluza-Klein monopole configurations, one can similarly introduce appropriate Legendre terms, in the sense of dimensional reduction, to modify the thermodynamic ensemble of the black hole. Within the dimensional reduction framework, we study the on-shell action of black holes in five-dimensional minimal supergravity with a Chern-Simons term, analyze the corresponding Legendre transformation procedure, and show how the resulting formulation remains consistent with the Wald formalism.

Abstract: Four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity theories become rigid in gravity-decoupling limits. We study this effect for type II string compactifications on general Calabi--Yau manifolds, focusing on vector-multiplet trajectories whose endpoints exhibit axionic shift symmetries. This comprises field excursions of both finite- and infinite distance, but the latter display specific features due to the appearance of light towers of extremal BPS states, in agreement with Swampland principles. We show that vector multiplets split into two sets: those with gravitational and with rigid mutual interactions, and that only a subset of the latter -- dubbed core RFT -- can fully decouple from gravity. We characterise the core RFT in terms of the axionic shift symmetry, and derive decoupling criteria based on kinetic and Pauli interaction mixing. Our framework is illustrated in large complex structure, conifold-like, and Seiberg--Witten limits. In the last case, Pauli mixing obstructs decoupling whenever the dyonic and extremal BPS towers appear at the same scale. Across all these examples, the decoupling from gravity is signalled by a divergent moduli-space scalar curvature.

Abstract: We revisit thermal out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in single-particle quantum systems, focusing on magnetic billiards. Using the stadium billiard as a testbed, we compute the thermal OTOC $C_T(t) = -\langle [x(t), p]^2 \rangle_β$ and extract Lyapunov-like exponents $λ_L$ that quantify early-time growth. We map out $λ_L(T, B)$, revealing a crossover from quantum chaos to magnetic rigidity. In parallel, we compute an alternative OTOC built from guiding-center operators, which exhibits qualitatively distinct dynamics and no exponential growth. Our results offer a controlled framework for probing scrambling, temperature dependence, and the interplay of geometry and magnetic fields in quantum systems.

Abstract: We use the $K$ special conformal generator in the Fuzzy sphere setup of the Ising CFT to determine primary states. For $Δ\lesssim 8$, we recover the known primaries and find several new ones, including in the parity-odd sector. We then use these primaries to compute OPE coefficients. We find that using primaries constructed from special-$K$ allows for better extrapolation of OPE coefficients to the CFT limit, because of the existence of an $O(1)$ gap between primaries and descendants in the spectrum of eigenvalues of $|K|^2$ which protects the primaries from strongly mixing with descendants. We compare the CFT data we obtain with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis.

*Francesco Aprile,Daniele Dorigoni,Rudolfs Treilis*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: We calculate integrated correlators of half-BPS operators in $SU(N)$ $	cal{N}=4$ SYM, involving two stress-tensor multiplet operators and two identical maximal-trace operators with $R$-charge $p$. Using $	cal{N}=4$ SYM duality and combining SL$(2,	bb{Z})$ spectral theory with resurgence, we analyze large-$N$ and large-$p$ expansions. We discover non-perturbative effects in the $N 	o 	inf$ limit with $p/N^2$ fixed. S-duality relates these results to correlators involving gravitons and magnons. At large-$N$, the correlators match predictions from AdS supergravity and exhibit contributions from giant magnons in the dual geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work contributes to understanding the dynamics of $	cal{N}=4$ SYM and its AdS dual by computing specific integrated correlators. Results involve intricate mathematical tools and have implications for the holographic principle and non-perturbative effects in string theory.

Method: The authors employ techniques from SL$(2,	bb{Z})$ spectral theory and resurgence analysis to compute the integrated correlators. They leverage $	cal{N}=4$ SYM duality and AdS/CFT correspondence to connect their results with holographic predictions and string theory configurations.

Result: The study finds novel non-perturbative effects in the large-$N$ limit with $p/N^2$ fixed. These effects are linked to the AdS/CFT correspondence and involve contributions from giant-magnon configurations. The results also align with predictions from AdS supergravity, confirming the validity of the holographic description in this regime.

Conclusion: This paper advances our understanding of $	cal{N}=4$ SYM by providing exact results for specific integrated correlators. The findings highlight the role of non-perturbative effects and the AdS/CFT correspondence, offering new insights into the duality between gauge theories and string theories. The results also validate the use of holographic methods in studying strongly coupled systems.

Abstract: We study integrated correlation functions of half-BPS operators in $SU(N)$ $\mathcal{N} = 4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) involving two superconformal primary operators in the stress-tensor multiplet and two identical maximal-trace operators of arbitrary $R$-charge $p$. Thanks to $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM electro-magnetic duality these integrated correlators have recently been computed as exact functions of $N$, $p$, and of the Yang-Mills complexified coupling $τ$. Using a combination of tools from ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ spectral theory and resurgence analysis, we study the landscape of large-$N$ and/or large-charge expansions for these correlators. In particular, we find novel non-perturbative effects in the limit where $N\rightarrow \infty$ with $p/N^2$ fixed. From a holographic point of view this double-scaling regime is deeply connected with a second family of correlators which we analyse. Using the results for the maximal-trace operators, we derive an exact expression for a new integrated correlator involving two coherent-state operators, defined via an exponential generating function of multi-graviton states. At large-$N$ this correlator admits a holographic dual description in terms of a back-reacted geometry known as the AdS bubble. First, we show that the leading supergravity contribution to the integrated correlator agrees with a direct explicit integration of the correlator itself. Secondly, we derive predictions for the integrated version of the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude evaluated on the AdS bubble background. Lastly, we demonstrate that the large-$N$ non-perturbative contributions to this integrated correlator emerge from giant-magnon configurations in the dual AdS bubble.

### [85] [Holographic pressure and volume for black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05130)
*Silvester Borsboom,Manus R. Visser*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Black holes have size-dependent thermodynamic properties (pressure and volume), which enable extensivity only in a large-system limit. Small Schwarzschild black holes are non-extensive, while larger ones become extensive. This changes in the presence of negative cosmological constant (AdS), where large black holes are extensive even without large volume. The extensive part of energy is determined by finite volume and entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding black hole thermodynamics is fundamental for quantum gravity. Size-dependence of thermodynamic variables is a distinctive feature of black holes. The existence of a large-system limit is pivotal for statistical mechanics connection.

Method: Used quasi-local gravitational thermodynamics on black hole spacetimes. Analyzed both Schwarzschild and AdS cases by studying boundary conditions. Mathematical derivations established extensivity limits and energy decomposition.

Result: Black holes exhibit unique thermodynamic properties only achievable in the large-system limit. Results clarify the conditions under which black hole thermodynamics aligns with statistical mechanics.

Conclusion: The paper reveals black hole thermodynamics nuances with size dependence, contributing to quantum gravity theories by identifying a critical system size for thermodynamic consistency.

Abstract: We advocate for a holographic definition of thermodynamic pressure and volume for black holes based on quasi-local gravitational thermodynamics. When a black hole is enclosed by a finite timelike boundary, York's quasi-local first law includes a surface pressure conjugate to the boundary area. Assuming the existence of a holographically dual theory living on this boundary, these geometric quantities correspond to the pressure and volume of the dual thermal system. In this work we focus on static, spherically symmetric black holes, for which these quantities reduce to global thermodynamic variables. The holographic volume provides a notion of system size, allowing extensivity to be defined in standard thermodynamic terms, and it yields a definition of the large-system limit. For the asymptotically flat case, we show that, in the canonical thermodynamic representation, small Schwarzschild black holes are non-extensive, whereas large black holes become extensive in the large-system limit. A similar conclusion applies to Anti-de-Sitter Schwarzschild black holes, with the difference that the quasi-local energy of the large black hole also becomes extensive in the large-system limit. Before this limit, the energy decomposes into subextensive and extensive contributions, and we derive an explicit expression for the extensive part as a function of the finite volume and entropy.

Conclusion: 该研究为规范理论与引力之间的对偶关系提供了新的视角，为黑洞热力学的研究提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We show that a three-dimensional Manin gauge theory with gauge group $\operatorname{SL}(2;\mathbb R)$ (i.e. Yang-Mills theory, the third-way theory, or the imaginary third-way theory) minimally coupled to Einstein gravity admits a dual interpretation as Einstein gravity with an exotic coupling to a Manin gauge theory, where the roles of dreibein/spin connection and field strength/gauge potential are interchanged. The dual, or ersatz, gravitational metric $\hat g_{μν}\sim\operatorname{tr}((\star F)_μ(\star F)_ν)$ is a classical double copy of the gauge field strength $F_{μν}$ (as opposed to the usual double copy of the gauge potential $A_μ$). If matter exclusively couples to $\hat g$ (for example, in a gravitational decoupling limit), then one can formulate black-hole thermodynamics with regards to the ersatz metric. In particular, a black-hole solution for the ersatz metric $\hat g_{μν}$ (made of Yang-Mills fields) radiates ersatz Hawking radiation and obeys the laws of black-hole thermodynamics.

Abstract: Neural networks organize information according to the hierarchical, multi-scale structure of natural data. Methods to interpret model internals should be similarly scale-aware, explicitly tracking how features compose across resolutions and guaranteeing bounds on the influence of fine-grained structure that is discarded as irrelevant noise. We posit that the renormalisation framework from physics can meet this need by offering technical tools that can overcome limitations of current methods. Moreover, relevant work from adjacent fields has now matured to a point where scattered research threads can be synthesized into practical, theory-informed tools. To combine these threads in an AI safety context, we propose a unifying research agenda -- \emph{scale-aware interpretability} -- to develop formal machinery and interpretability tools that have robustness and faithfulness properties supported by statistical physics.

Abstract: In this paper, we apply the thermodynamic topology framework to ultraspinning Kerr-AdS black holes in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. By constructing the off-shell Helmholtz free energy and the associated vector field, black hole states are characterized as topological defects, and their phase structures are described through zero points, winding numbers, and asymptotic thermodynamic behavior. Analyses of the four- and five-dimensional cases highlight the differences between even- and odd-dimensional configurations, while representative higher-dimensional cases confirm that no additional topological classes or subclasses emerge. We find that only two thermodynamic topological structures appear: the standard class $W^{1+}$ for most configurations, and the distinct subclass $\tilde{W}^{1+}$ for odd-dimensional black holes with maximal rotations. These results establish a unified, dimension-independent classification scheme for ultraspinning Kerr-AdS black holes.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how cosmological correlators can be reconstructed by applying the momentum-space dispersion formula to their discontinuities, treating them as functions of momentum variables associated with the corresponding de Sitter Witten diagrams. We focus on conformally coupled and massless polynomial scalar interactions (both IR-divergent and IR-convergent), and consider tree-level de Sitter Witten diagrams. We explicitly utilize the single-cut discontinuity relations, or cutting rules, involving the cosmological correlators recently constructed in arXiv:2512.20720. For diagrams with multiple interaction vertices, we apply the dispersion formula by cutting all internal lines in the diagram one by one, successively, thereby allowing us to reconstruct the full correlator using only lower-point contact-level objects and their discontinuity data, up to contact diagram ambiguities. We also rediscover how the cosmological correlators on the late-time slice of de Sitter space can be obtained from flat-space Feynman diagrams via a set of dressing rules. Our starting point, being the cutting rules for the cosmological correlators, also emphasizes how basic principles, such as unitarity for in-in correlators, can lead us to the dressing rules, which were previously derived in literature following a different method.

Abstract: Quantum field theories (QFTs) including fourth-derivative terms such as the Lee-Wick finite QED and quadratic gravity have a better ultra-violet behavior compared to standard theories with second-derivative ones, but the existence of ghost with negative norm endangers unitarity. Such a ghost in general acquires a pair of complex conjugate masses from radiative corrections whose features are concisely described by the so-called Lee model. Working with the canonical operator formalism of QFTs, we investigate the issue of bound states in the Lee model. We find that the bound states cannot be created from ghosts by contributions of a complex delta function, which is a complex generalization of the well-known Dirac delta function. Since the cause of unitarity violation in the Lee-Wick model is the existence of the complex delta function instead of the Dirac delta function, it is of interest to notice that the violation of the unitarity is also connected to the non-existence of bound states. Finally, the problem of amelioration of the unitarity in quadratic gravity is briefly discussed.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We uncover surprising hidden simplicity in Mellin amplitudes for tree-level AdS holographic correlators for spinning operators, such as AdS "gluons" and "gravitons" (spin 1 and 2). We define Mellin amplitudes with $n$ spinning operators via the so-called "scaffolding" of $2n$-scalar ones with specific projection operators for each spin state, which are rational functions of Mellin variables of $2n$ scalars generalizing flat-space scaffolding amplitudes. We classify possible three-point structures with spin 1 and 2 which take the same form as massive three-point amplitudes in flat space, and match with special solutions such as those extracted from 6-scalar ones in $\mathrm{AdS}_5\times S^3$ or $\mathrm{AdS}_5\times S^5$. Focusing on $\mathrm{AdS}_5$ gluons, we directly bootstrap spinning amplitudes in scaffolding form up to $n=6$ gluons (which amounts to $2n=12$ scalars) using factorizations, multi-linearity and flat-space limit. The results take a remarkably simple form in analogy with flat-space amplitudes, which can be constructed from familiar 3- and 4-vertices as well as propagators of massive spin-1 particles. Surprisingly, we find that vertices with any descendant levels are proportional to the primary ones with nice combinatorial coefficients, which makes manifest the correct flat-space limit in the simplest possible way.

Abstract: We compute the classical one-loop gravitational Compton amplitude describing the scattering of a graviton off a massive spinning compact object at the second post-Minkowskian order, including terms through the quartic order in spin. Our analysis includes spin-induced finite-size effects up to the hexadecapolar order, and extends recent results obtained for minimal couplings at the quadratic order in spin. From the amplitude, we determine the scattering phase in momentum space, applicable in both the eikonal and wave regimes. In the eikonal limit, we then isolate the spin-independent contribution of the graviton field, explicitly linking it to the dynamics of a massless scalar probe in a Kerr background. This constitutes the first complete description of classical one-loop Compton scattering for generic spinning compact objects at the second post-Minkowskian and hexadecapolar orders.

The one-loop diagram is not expressible in terms of known transcendental functions, but is shown to be expressible as an infinite sum of previously well-studied tree-level diagrams, and we compute this sum using several number-theoretic conjectures. This enables us to extract recursively, the analytic expressions of anomalous dimensions of all dual double-trace operators. In the $s$-channel various consistency checks were performed against established bootstrap method, while our results in the $t$- and $u$-channel are not available in any previous literature to our knowledge.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The one-state statement for closed universes has sparked considerable discussion. In this paper we examine its physical meaning in the context of the Hartle-Hawking state and de Sitter space. We argue that the one-state property of closed universes is fully compatible with the finite-dimensional quantum mechanics experienced by observers inside de Sitter space, and that this compatibility requires neither mixing of alpha sectors nor any modification of the rules of the gravitational path integral. The apparent tension is resolved by sharply distinguishing the baby-universe Hilbert space, namely the space of closed universes viewed from the outside, from the bulk Hilbert space that governs quantum mechanics for an observer inside a single de Sitter universe. The baby-universe Hilbert space, together with its commutative operator algebra, is not a quantum-mechanical Hilbert space: it is merely a mathematical repackaging of classical probability theory and does not carry any quantum-mechanical structure at all, a direct consequence of the one-state property of closed universes. Accordingly, attempting to formulate quantum mechanics directly on the baby-universe Hilbert space conflates classical ensemble data with the quantum mechanics experienced by bulk observers and leads to physically incorrect conclusions. By contrast, the quantum mechanics experienced by an observer inside de Sitter space emerges from the classical statistics encoded in the baby-universe Hilbert space, providing a concrete realization of Wheeler's idea of "It from Bit". We demonstrate these features by completely solving a topological toy model of one-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. Along the way we clarify the physical meaning of de Sitter entropy, showing that it corresponds to the coarse-grained entropy of the underlying state.

Abstract: The Euclidean Gravitational Path Integral has proven remarkably effective in the quantum regime of black hole physics. In this work, we examine the applicability of the Kontsevich-Segal-Witten (KSW) criterion for admissible complex metrics in the context of the Euclidean Gravitational Path Integral. We find that, for the super-conformal index of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM with unequal angular momenta, the black hole saddle points violate the KSW criterion precisely where the statistical description of the index breaks down. The corresponding critical point coincides with a phase transition into two-component ``grey galaxy'' configurations in the micro-canonical ensemble.

Abstract: This work investigates a modified theory of gravity where the Einstein-Hilbert action, including a cosmological constant, is non-minimally coupled to a Yang-Mills field via an $R^3 F^{(a)}_{μα}F^{(a)μα}$ interaction term. We derive a black brane solution for this model, accurate to the first order in the coupling parameter. Using gauge/gravity duality techniques, we then compute two key holographic transport coefficients: the color non-abelian direct current (DC) conductivity and the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density. Our analysis reveals that both transport coefficients are modified by the non-minimal coupling, with the conductivity bound violated for positive $q_2$ and the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound for shear viscosity violated for negative $q_2$. In the limit where the non-minimal coupling vanishes, our results consistently reduce to those of the standard Yang-Mills Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black brane.

Abstract: Cold atoms have become a powerful platform for quantum-simulating lattice gauge theories in higher spatial dimensions. However, such realizations have been restricted to the lowest possible truncations of the gauge field, which limit the connections one can make to lattice quantum electrodynamics. Here, we propose a feasible cold-atom quantum simulator of a $(2+1)$-dimensional U$(1)$ lattice gauge theory in a spin $S=1$ truncation, featuring dynamical matter and gauge fields. We derive a mapping of this theory onto a bosonic computational basis, stabilized by an emergent gauge-protection mechanism through quantum Zeno dynamics. The implementation is based on a single-species Bose--Hubbard model realized in a tilted optical superlattice. This approach requires only moderate experimental resources already available in current ultracold-atom platforms. Using infinite matrix product state simulations, we benchmark real-time dynamics under global quenches. The results demonstrate faithful evolution of the target gauge theory and robust preservation of the gauge constraints. Our work significantly advances the experimental prospects for simulating higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories using larger gauge-field truncations.

Abstract: The dynamics of a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate mixture, loaded into a dual-core trap, when beyond-mean-field effects are taken into account, are considered. The effects of quantum fluctuations are described by the Lee-Huang-Yang correction terms in the extended coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. The spatially uniform and inhomogeneous BEC cases are studied. In the first case, the parameter regimes associated with macroscopic quantum tunnelling, self-trapping, and revival-like localisation dynamics are found. The Josephson oscillation frequencies for both the zero-phase and the $π$-phase modes are derived. As the total atom number varies, the dynamics exhibit a nontrivial bifurcation structure: along the zero-phase branch, two pitchfork bifurcations generate bistability and hysteresis, while the $π$-phase branch shows a single pitchfork bifurcation. In the second case, the Josephson dynamics for quantum droplets and vortices are investigated. Predictions for the oscillation frequencies of the atomic population between quantum droplets are obtained and fully validated by direct numerical simulations of coupled extended GP equations. The existence of the Andreev-Bashkin nondissipative drag through simulations of droplet-droplet interactions is shown. The Josephson dynamics of vortex states are studied. Vortices with topological charge $S$ and sufficiently small particle number are typically unstable, breaking up into $S+1$ (occasionally $S+2$) fundamental fragments, with the breakup time increasing as the particle number grows. Unstable asymmetric vortices show splitting and/or crescent-like instability. For vortices with sufficiently large norms, long-time simulations confirm robust stability against small perturbations; in this regime, Josephson oscillations and Andreev-Bashkin-type entrainment for vortex states with charges $S=1, 2$, and $3$ are investigated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of measurement on quantum systems, particularly in the context of Bose-Einstein condensates and potential implications for quantum gravity.

Method: Theoretical investigation using cold atom systems and quantum many-body dynamics models.

Result:  Regimes where imaging probes bare particle or quasiparticle dynamics, path to directly measure quasiparticle modes, understanding measurement backaction.

Conclusion: Framework for evaluating experimental approaches to many-body systems and exploring quantum gravity effects on observable scales.

Abstract: Measurement plays a crucial role in a quantum system beyond just learning about the system state: it changes the post-measurement state and hence influences the subsequent time evolution; further, measurement can even create entanglement in the post-measurement conditional state. In this work, we study how careful choice of parameters for a typical measurement process on cold atoms systems -- phase contrast imaging -- has a strong impact on both what the experimentalist observes but also on the backaction the measurement has on the system, including the creation and diffusion of quasiparticles emerging from the quantum many-body dynamics. We focus on the case of a Bose-Einstein-condensate array, in the low-temperature and low-momentum limit. Our theoretical investigation reveals regimes where the imaging light probes either the bare particle or quasiparticle dynamics. Moreover, we find a path to selectively measuring quasiparticle modes directly, as well as controlling over the measurement-induced creation and diffusion of quasiparticles into different momentum states. This lays a foundation for understanding the effects of both experimental approaches for probing many-body systems, but also more speculative directions such as observable consequences of `spontaneous collapse' predictions from novel models of quantum gravity on aspects of the Standard Model.

*Mahmud Ashraf Shamim,Moshiur Rahman,Mohamed Hibat-Allah,Paulo T Araujo*

TL;DR: The paper discusses the phase structure of wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets and demonstrates that phase reconstruction is NP-hard, linking it to combinatorial optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the phase structure of complex quantum systems like frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets is crucial for advancing quantum magnetism research and has potential implications for quantum computing and condensed matter physics.

Method: The authors represent the Hilbert space as a weighted graph (Hilbert graph), recasting the phase-dependent variational energy as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on this graph, thereby reducing phase reconstruction to a weighted Max-Cut problem.

Result: The study establishes that phase reconstruction in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets is computationally intractable in the worst case (NP-hard), providing a novel connection between quantum wavefunction properties and combinatorial optimization challenges.

Conclusion: This work not only deepens our understanding of frustrated quantum magnets but also highlights the profound interplay between quantum many-body systems and classical computational complexity.

Abstract: Despite extensive study, the phase structure of the wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets (HAF) is not yet systematically characterized. In this work, we represent the Hilbert space of an HAF as a weighted graph, which we term the Hilbert graph (HG), whose vertices are spin configurations and whose edges are generated by off-diagonal spin-flip terms of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with weights set by products of wavefunction amplitudes. Holding the amplitudes fixed and restricting phases to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ values, the phase-dependent variational energy can be recast as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on the HG, so that phase reconstruction of the ground state reduces to a weighted Max-Cut instance. This shows that phase reconstruction HAF is worst-case NP-hard and provides a direct link between wavefunction sign structure and combinatorial optimization.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解铁基超导和其他二维体系提供了新的视角，实验上可以通过光栅平台模拟此模型，对双列镍酸盐 La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ 的相关性质有参考价值。

Abstract: We report the discovery of a generalized Luther-Emery liquid phase characterized by incommensurate pair-density-wave (iC-PDW) correlations in the two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_\perp$ ladder model. By tuning the potential difference between the legs, we explore the regime of intermediate layer polarization $P$. Combining density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with bosonization analysis, we identify a spin-gapped phase at finite $P$, where the interlayer and intralayer pair correlations both oscillate, but with distinct periodicities. The interlayer correlations exhibit FFLO-like oscillations, driven by pairing between layers with mismatched Fermi momenta, with a period determined by their momentum difference. In contrast, the intralayer pair correlations arise from the coupling between charges on one layer and spin fluctuations on the opposite layer, with a momentum equal to twice the Fermi momentum of the opposite layer. The iC-PDW state is robust across a wide range of doping and polarization, although finite interlayer hopping eventually destabilizes it toward a state with charge-$4e$ correlations. We conclude by discussing the experimental realization of this model in optical lattice platforms and its relevance to the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We derive a universal bound on the efficiency with which "dissipated" work can generate distinguishable changes in a quantum many-body state at a finite temperature, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information. The bound follows solely from the analytic structure of equilibrium many-body correlators and is independent of all microscopic details. It takes a frequency-resolved form with a characteristic crossover at the Planckian scale, $ω_\star\sim k_B T/\hbar$. We find that Planckian scatterers sit at the edge of optimality, displaying maximal relaxation rate before information-dissipation efficiency collapses. This suggests strange metals are not just fast dissipators, but the fastest that remain efficient in generating distinguishability. The bounded quantity can be evaluated directly from optical conductivity measurements in strongly correlated electronic systems, offering a unique window into how dissipation generates distinguishable changes.

Abstract: We present lrux, a JAX-based software package for fast low-rank updates of determinants and Pfaffians, targeting the dominant computational bottleneck in various quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms. The package implements efficient low-rank updates that reduce the cost of successive wavefunction evaluations from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$ when the update rank $k$ is smaller than the dimension $n$ of matrices. Both determinant and Pfaffian updates are supported, together with delayed-update strategies that trade floating-point operations for reduced memory traffic on modern accelerators. lrux natively integrates with JAX transformations such as JIT compilation, vectorization, and automatic differentiation, and supports both real and complex data types.

TL;DR: Spin textures in topological magnetic metals can generate spin currents even without net magnetization, a promising development for spintronics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work explores the generation of spin currents in topological magnetic materials, which is crucial for developing energy-efficient and fast information processing systems.

Method: The researchers investigated three types of spin textures: skyrmion, bimeron, and meron crystals. They studied their spin current generation under varying spin-orbit coupling and analyzed the role of magnetic symmetries in transport properties.

Result: Skyrmion (SkX) and bimeron (BmX) crystals generate spin currents with polarization aligned to their magnetization. Meron (MX) crystals, despite zero net magnetization, exhibit a spin current due to enhanced spin Berry curvature. The electronic and spin transport properties are governed by magnetic symmetries.

Conclusion: This study reveals that topological spin textures, including MX, can act as efficient spin current generators even without net magnetization, expanding spintronics applications.

Abstract: Spin current offers a promising route toward energy-efficient and high-speed information processing. Developing efficient methods for their generation remains a central challenge in spintronics. Here, we investigate spin current generation via two-dimensional topological spin textures: a skyrmion crystal (SkX) with out-of-plane magnetization, a bimeron crystal (BmX) with in-plane magnetization, and a meron crystal (MX) with zero net magnetization. We show that these distinct spin textures generate spin currents with characteristic spin polarization directions. In the absence of spin--orbit coupling, the SkX and BmX generate spin currents polarized along their magnetization directions, whereas the MX yields no spin current. Upon introducing spin--orbit coupling, while the behavior of the SkX does not qualitatively change, the BmX generates nonzero spin currents in multiple polarization directions. Notably, the MX, despite its zero net magnetization, exhibits a pronounced spin current with out-of-plane spin polarization, driven by an enhanced spin Berry curvature associated with characteristic band degeneracy. We further demonstrate that the electronic and spin transport properties of each texture are governed by their magnetic symmetries. Our results highlight the topological spin textures as efficient sources of spin current even without net magnetization, expanding the design for spintronics devices based on topological magnetic metals.

Abstract: A comprehensive spectroscopic map of the electronic, magnetic, and lattice excitations is presented for the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using Raman scattering at ambient pressure. Upon entering the spin density wave state below 153 K, the $A_{1g}$ channel exhibits an abrupt electronic spectral gap with a clear isosbestic point. In contrast, the $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ channels are dominated by pronounced two-magnon (2M) excitations, representing an unambiguous signature of incipient Mottness. These 2M signals in both channels constitute direct evidence for two distinct in-plane spin exchange interactions along the Ni-O bonding and its diagonal directions. Calculations based on the spin wave theory further reveal that the 2M mode in the $B_{2g}$ channel arises from the competition between two bond-diagonal antiferromagnetic interactions mediated by nickel $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Furthermore, emergent low-energy 2M excitations below 10 meV are found to originate from distinct, weaker spin moments, strongly supporting spin disproportionation. Simultaneously, an anomalous softening of $B_{1g}$ phonons from 280 down to 4.5 K is uncovered, suggesting the presence of an incipient lattice instability leading to checkerboard-type breathing modulations. Collectively, these findings identify a ground state of the bilayer nickelate characterized by competing bond-diagonal interactions, spin disproportionation, and an incipient lattice instability, establishing key ingredients for understanding the mechanism of nickelate superconductivity.

Motivation: Understanding the mechanism of thermal Hall effect in nonmagnetic materials is important for potential applications in spintronic and thermal management.

Method: The research involves experimental observation and analysis of the thermal Hall effect in TlBi<sub>0.15</sub>Sb<sub>0.85</sub>Te<sub>2</sub> material under various magnetic fields.

Result: The study reports that the thermal Hall ratio (κ<sub>xy</sub>/κ<sub>xx</sub>) exceeds 2% and exhibits a pronounced maximum with increasing magnetic field strength.

Conclusion: The presence of charge puddles in the material induces a large thermal Hall effect onto the phonons, thereby enhancing the intrinsic thermal Hall effect. This provides insights into the microscale mechanism underlying the phonon thermal Hall effect in nonmagnetic chalcogenides and opens up possibilities for designing spintronic devices with enhanced thermal management capability.

Abstract: We present the experimental observation of a drastically enhanced thermal Hall effect in the topological insulator material TlBi$_{0.15}$Sb$_{0.85}$Te$_2$. Although heat transport is dominated by phonons, moderate magnetic fields generate a thermal Hall ratio ($κ_{xy}/κ_{xx}$) above 2\%, an unprecedented value for a nonmagnetic material. The transverse thermal conductivity $κ_{xy}$ exhibits a pronounced maximum in fields of a few Tesla. This characteristic field dependence allows us to identify the microscopic origin of the thermal Hall effect in this system. Small densities of charged impurities induce locally conducting regions, so-called charge puddles, within the bulk insulating matrix. Via electron-phonon coupling, these charge puddles imprint a large thermal Hall effect onto the phonons accounting for both the magnitude and the magnetic-field dependence of the observed effect.

Conclusion: 通过DMFT框架中结合MCA的方法研究多轨道系统在平衡态和非平衡态下特性，捕捉了部分重要物理现象，但需进一步优化方法提升对某些现象的精度。

Abstract: We present the mixed-configuration approximation (MCA) based on the auxiliary master equation approach impurity solver to study multiorbital correlated systems under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). We benchmark the method for bulk and layered SrVO$_3$ in equilibrium and apply it to a prototypical nonequilibrium geometry in which a voltage bias is applied perpendicular to the layer via reservoirs held at different chemical potentials. For bulk SrVO$_3$, MCA reproduces the metallic state at moderate interaction strengths, but it overestimates the weight of the lower band relative to quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and fork tensor product state (FTPS) solvers. With respect to QMC and FTPS, MCA yields an earlier metal-to-insulator transition as the electron-electron interaction is increased. In layered SrVO$_3$ at equilibrium, MCA partially captures the orbital polarization in favor of the in-plane $xy$ orbital, although not as strong as in the DMFT-converged results obtained with QMC. However, when performing a one-shot impurity calculation initialized with the DFMT-QMC results, MCA yields orbital occupations which show a stronger charge polarization in favor of orbital $xy$. This suggests that our approach can be used to study multiorbital impurity problems when the focus is to assess properties without performing the full DMFT self-consistent loop. Finally, under applied bias, we observe a pronounced redistribution of orbital occupations, demonstrating that the method captures bias-driven orbital charge transfer in realistic materials in nonequilibrium conditions.

Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics induced by an interaction quench in the semiclassical Holstein model within the Ehrenfest nonadiabatic framework, which describes an isolated hybrid quantum-classical system with strictly conserved total energy. Focusing on the half-filled case, where the equilibrium ground state exhibits commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) order for any nonzero coupling, we identify three distinct post-quench dynamical regimes as a function of the final electron-phonon coupling: a nonequilibrium metallic state without CDW order, an intermediate regime characterized by slow scale-invariant ordering dynamics, and a frozen CDW state with arrested coarsening and immobile kinks. We analyze the intermediate regime in detail and uncover an unconventional algebraic decay of the kink density, $n \sim t^{-1/3}$, distinct from both ballistic annihilation and diffusive coarsening in classical dissipative systems. We show that this anomalous exponent arises from the hybrid nature of the dynamics: while the lattice evolves deterministically, the electronic degrees of freedom act as an effective internal bath that induces diffusive kink motion without energy dissipation. An effective reaction-diffusion description, incorporating both annihilation and elastic scattering of kinks, quantitatively accounts for the observed scaling behavior. Our results reveal a distinct coarsening mechanism in isolated hybrid systems, demonstrating how internal quantum dynamics can qualitatively reshape defect kinetics far from equilibrium.

Abstract: Altermagnets provide a natural platform for studying and exploiting piezomagnetism. In this paper, we introduce a class of insulating altermagnets in two dimensions (2D) referred to as Dirac quadrupole altermagnets, and show based on microscopic minimal models that the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability of such altermagnets has a topological contribution described by topological response theory. The essential low-energy electronic structure of Dirac quadrupole altermagnets can be understood from a gapless parent phase (i.e., the Dirac quadrupole semimetal), which has important implications for their response to external fields. Focusing on the strain-induced response, here we demonstrate that the topological piezomagnetic effect is a consequence of the way in which strain affects the Dirac points forming a quadrupole. We consider two microscopic models: a spinless two-band model describing a band inversion of $s$ and $d$ states, and a Lieb lattice model with collinear Néel order. The latter is a prototypical minimal model for altermagnetism in 2D and is realized in a number of recently proposed material compounds, which are discussed.

Abstract: We demonstrate an alternative approach based on complex-valued inverse temperature and partition function to probe quantum phases of matter with nontrivial spectra and dynamics. It leverages thermofield dynamics (TFD) to quantitatively characterize quantum and thermal fluctuations, and exploit the correspondence between low-energy excitations and Fisher zeros. Using the quantum XY chain in an external field as a testbed, we show that the oscillatory gap behavior manifests as oscillations in the long-time dynamics of the TFD spectral form factor. We also identify giant bubbles, i.e. large-scale closed lines, of Fisher-zeros near the gapless XX limit. They provide a characteristic energy scale that seems to contradict the predictions of the low energy theory of a featureless Luttinger liquid. We identify this energy scale and relate the motion of these giant bubbles with varying external field to the transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies. The deep connection between Fisher zeros, dynamics, and excitations opens up promising avenues for understanding the unconventional gap behaviors in strongly correlated many-body systems.

In this work, we propose a fine-grained parallel tensor network design based on FPGAs to substantially enhance the computational efficiency of two representative tensor network algorithms: the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) and the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). By employing a quad-tile partitioning strategy to decompose tensor elements and map them onto hardware circuits, our approach effectively translates algorithmic computational complexity into scalable hardware resource utilization, enabling an extremely high degree of parallelism on FPGAs. Compared with conventional CPU-based implementations, our scheme exhibits superior scalability in computation time, reducing the bond-dimension scaling of the computational cost from $O(D_b^3)$ to $O(D_b)$ for iTEBD and from $O(D_b^6)$ to $O(D_b^2)$ for HOTRG. This work provides a theoretical foundation for future hardware implementations of large-scale tensor network computations.

Abstract: Frustration on the triangular lattice has long been a source of intriguing and often debated phases in many-body systems. Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustration are systematically shaped by an implicit rule of thumb associated with spontaneous parity breaking. This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$. In bilayer systems, enhanced frustration leads to additional phases, such as supersolids, whose properties can be classified by their characteristic parity features. Benefiting from our improved tensor network contraction techniques, we confirm these results through large-scale tensor-network calculations. This study offers an alternative viewpoint and a systematic approach for examining the interplay between spin, symmetry, and frustration in many-body systems.

Abstract: We present an optimized random phase approximation method (optRPA26) that significantly improves upon conventional RPA. The method employs an empirically constructed hybrid functional to generate DFT orbitals to evaluate the RPA correlation energy, which is then scaled by a constant.

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) and linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) rely on an exchange-correlation (xc) approximation that provides not only energy but also its functional derivatives that enter the self-consistent potential and the response kernel. Here we present an end-to-end differentiable workflow to optimize a single deep-learned energy functional using targets from both Kohn-Sham DFT and adiabatic LR-TDDFT within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation. Implemented in a JAX-based two-component quantum chemistry code (IQC), the learned functional yields a consistent potential and LR kernel via automatic differentiation, enabling gradient-based training through the SCF fixed point and the Casida equation. As a proof of concept in a fixed finite basis (cc-pVDZ), we learn an exchange-correlation functional on the helium spectrum while incorporating one-electron self-interaction cancelation and the Lieb-Oxford inequality as penalty terms, and we assess its possible transfer to molecular test cases.

TL;DR: This paper presents an advanced method for calculating rare event rates using TIS and RETIS algorithms, enhanced by path reweighting and the Infinity-RETIS algorithm to compute various thermodynamic and kinetic quantities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding rare events in molecular systems is crucial for fields like chemistry and biology, and traditional MD simulations often fail to capture these events efficiently.

Method: The paper introduces the Infinity-RETIS algorithm, which improves the efficiency of replica exchange by implementing asynchronous exchanges in the infinite-swap limit, allowing for more accurate calculations of path ensembles and thermodynamic properties.

Result: The generalized path reweighting framework developed enables the computation of exact dynamic and thermodynamic variables, and an analytical approach is used to calculate conditional free energy surfaces influenced by kinetic factors like particle mass and friction.

Conclusion: This method provides a powerful tool for analyzing complex molecular systems and understanding the role of kinetic factors in transitions between metastable states.

Abstract: Transition interface sampling (TIS) and replica exchange TIS (RETIS) are powerful methods for computing rates of rare events inaccessible to straightforward molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Path reweighting extends their output, enabling the evaluation of diverse thermodynamic and kinetic quantities, including reaction prediction metrics, activation barriers, committor functions, and free energies. The recently developed Infinity-RETIS algorithm boosts parallel efficiency through asynchronous replica exchanges in the infinite-swap limit, eliminating the wall-time bottlenecks of conventional RETIS. This approach introduces fractional samples and biased sampling distributions, requiring a generalized path reweighting framework, for which we derive expressions demonstrating how it can be used to compute exact dynamic and thermodynamic variables. We then focus on a special class of free energy surfaces defined by history-dependent conditions, whose values are influenced by kinetic factors such as particle mass and friction, unlike standard unconditional free energy surfaces. These conditional free energies can reveal kinetically relevant barriers even with suboptimal reaction coordinates and therefore provide a rigorous and versatile tool for characterizing complex molecular transitions.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is crucial in global healthcare, but the traditional receive coils, as a core component of MRI, SNR enhancement is limited due to the optimization of channel number and magnetic field strength faces high cost and complexity challenges. Here, we demonstrate the use of a topological material to enhance MRI signal reception. Designed with a stack of weak couplings, this material forms quasi-two-dimensional dual topological boundary states. High properties are achieved through low-loss signal transmission via these topological states, as well as only enhanced local magnetic fields and increased number of channels. Initial tests demonstrate superior performance and accessibility compared to commercial coils, suggesting significant potential. This concept introduces a transformative paradigm for all MRI coil designs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  exploring the use of speckle in imaging for wave physics.

Method:  analyzing matrix imaging for speckle-based wavefield monitoring.

Result:  success in imaging spatio-temporal wave packet evolution and identifying focusing imperfections like defocus and reverberations.

Conclusion:  opens possibilities to improve wave focusing and imaging across various wave types beyond ultrasound using the same multi-element approach.

Abstract: This is the first article in a series of three dealing with the exploitation of speckle for imaging purposes. Speckle is the complex interference wave-field produced by a random distribution of un-resolved scatterers. In this paper, we show how these scatterers can be used as virtual microphones to monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of a wave-packet inside the medium. To do so, the concept of matrix imaging is particularly useful. It consists in decoupling the location of the transmitted and received focal spots in a standard beamforming process. By scanning the wave-field with the output focal spot that then acts as a virtual transducer, one can image the spatio-temporal evolution of the wave-packet inside the medium. This unique observable will allow us to highlight the imperfections of the focusing process, in particular the defocus and reverberations induced by a strong aberrating layer. As a proof-of-concept, we will consider ultrasound experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms. In the next two papers, we will show how this observable can be leveraged to compensate for these phenomena that hamper wave focusing and imaging in all fields of wave physics. Our method is indeed broadly applicable to different types of waves beyond ultrasound for which multi-element technology allows a reflection matrix to be measured.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the use of Matrix imaging to address the problem of multiple scattering in imaging, specifically in complex media where a fundamental limit is the multiple scattering phenomenon. The authors show how matrix imaging can be used to tailor focusing laws to monitor interference between multiply-reflected paths and the ballistic component of the wave-field. They extend the distortion matrix concept to the frequency domain and propose an iterative phase reversal process to compensate for reverberations and optimize resolution. The paper includes an experimental proof-of-concept using a tissue-mimicking phantom and explores the potential applications of this strategy for transcranial ultrasound and other areas.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenge of multiple scattering in imaging, which blurs the imaging process in depth. The authors propose a solution using Matrix imaging and frequency domain techniques to improve resolution and address the limitations of traditional methods.

Method: The method involves extending the distortion matrix concept to the frequency domain and using an iterative phase reversal process in space-time Fourier space to compensate for reverberations. The authors then provide an experimental proof-of-concept and discuss the potential and limitations of their approach for applications such as transcranial ultrasound.

Result: The paper successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of Matrix imaging in addressing multiple scattering through an experimental proof-of-concept. The results highlight the potential of the proposed method for improving imaging resolution and optimizing the axial and transverse resolution of confocal images. However, the authors also acknowledge the limitations of their approach and identify areas for further research.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper presents a novel approach to address the challenge of multiple scattering in imaging using Matrix imaging and frequency domain techniques. The experimental results demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the proposed method, but further research is needed to fully realize its applications in practical imaging scenarios.

Abstract: This is the third article in a series of three dealing with the exploitation of speckle for imaging purposes. In complex media, a fundamental limit is the multiple scattering phenomenon that completely blurs the imaging process in depth. Matrix imaging can provide a relevant framework for solving this problem. As it proved to be an adequate tool for probing reverberations in speckle [E. Giraudat et al., Part I], we will show how it can be used to tailor complex spatio-temporal focusing laws to monitor the interference between the multiply-reflected paths and the ballistic component of the wave-field. To do so, we extend the distortion matrix concept to the frequency domain. An iterative phase reversal process operated from the space-time Fourier space is then used to compensate for reverberations and optimize both the axial and transverse resolution of the confocal image. Here, we first present an experimental proof-of-concept consisting in imaging a tissue-mimicking phantom through a reverberating plate before outlining the potential and the limits of this strategy for transcranial ultrasound and beyond.

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: This paper explores the behavior of active soft-impact oscillators as models for walking droplets in non-smooth potentials, revealing complex nonlinear dynamics and bifurcations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating hydrodynamic quantum analogs and nonlinear dynamics in active systems.

Method: Coupled non-smooth soft-impact force with Lorenz-like dynamics, theoretical and numerical analysis.

Result: Diverse nonlinear behaviors, including bifurcations and attractor switching, observed in the system.

Conclusion: Provides a versatile model for studying impact dynamics in active fluid systems and their quantum analogs.

Abstract: Walking droplets are millimetric fluid drops that propel themselves across a vibrated liquid bath through interaction with their self-generated waves. They constitute classical active wave-particle entities and exhibit a range of hydrodynamic quantum analogs. We investigate an \emph{active soft-impact oscillator} as a minimal model for a walking droplet moving within a piecewise-smooth external potential, analogous to classical mass-spring soft-impact oscillators and recently explored quantum soft-impact oscillators. Our active soft-impact oscillator model couples a non-smooth soft-impact force to the Lorenz-like dynamics arising from the wave-particle entity. Theoretical and numerical exploration of the full parameter space reveals a wide variety of nonlinear behaviors and bifurcations driven by impact and grazing events. These include grazing-induced and impact-induced transitions between periodic and chaotic motion, as well as grazing-mediated attractor switching and impact-free (invisible) attractor switching. The active soft-impact oscillator thus provides a versatile platform for probing nonlinear impact dynamics in active systems and exploring hydrodynamic quantum analogs in non-smooth potentials.

A conceptual design of the RADC DAQ system along with the built system is presented, focusing on signal processing and data management optimized for high rates.

Result: The system's non-linearity was measured and found to be stable over time. The non-linearity's systematic effect was shown to be reducible to a subdominant contribution, demonstrating the system's reliability for the intended purpose.

Conclusion: This work presents a successful design and implementation of a high-rate DAQ system for the TRISTAN detector upgrade, ensuring the precision needed for detecting keV-scale sterile neutrinos through stable and controllable measurements of tritium β-decay spectrum.

Abstract: The TRISTAN detector is an upgrade to the KATRIN experiment to enable a differential measurement of the tritium $β$-decay spectrum to search for the experimental signature of keV scale sterile neutrinos. The TRISTAN detector upgrade consists of performing precision electron spectroscopy with over 1000 silicon drift detector pixels, each responsible for recording event rates of $10^5$ counts per second. A project specific data acquisition (DAQ) system is developed to meet the experimental challenges with a remote analog to digital conversion (RADC) design. In this work, the conceptual design of the RADC DAQ is presented along with the built system for operating the TRISTAN detector upgrade. The system includes flexible signal processing logic and data management that is optimized for the high-rate precision measurement. The non-linearity of the system's readout channels are measured and shown to be stable over time. The systematic effect of this non-linearity is propagated to the sensitivity to the sterile neutrino signature and is demonstrated to be reducible to a subdominant contribution.

Abstract: Optical frequency combs (OFCs) are frequency rulers essential for precision metrology, next generation navigation, and testing of fundamental physics. Despite intense efforts, chip-integrated OFCs remain laboratory-bound, unable to fulfill their promise of compact and cost-effective deployment. While improvement in fabrication and integration are important, a conceptual limitation has fundamentally stymied progress: on-chip OFC architectures have aimed to miniaturize their table-top counterparts and relied on cascading outward from (i.e., spectrally broadening) a single pump. In integrated platforms, this approach does not readily allow for the generation of strong and low-noise octave-spaced signals that are crucially needed for robust zero-frequency offset detection. Here, we overcome this limitation via an architectural inversion where an optical microcomb forms by filling the spectrum between two octave-separated pump lasers. The two pumps generate a parametrically driven cavity soliton (PDCS) in an integrated $χ^{(3)}$ resonator, which robustly self-aligns to (i.e., synchronizes with) the pump lasers across multiple foundry-fabricated devices and operating configurations. This produces a single octave-spanning comb extending from telecom to visible wavelengths, whose zero-frequency offset is completely defined by the two harmonically-related pump lasers, and can therefore be reliably detected and stabilized. We showcase our platform's capabilities by executing all of the three core tasks of OFC metrology: optical frequency synthesis, low-noise millimeter-wave generation, and integrated optical clock readout, using the same self-aligned microcomb with only its input locks changed.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a premier solid-state platform for the deterministic generation of nonclassical light, offering a compelling pathway toward scalable quantum photonic systems. While single-photon emission from QDs has reached a high level of maturity, the realization of high-fidelity entangled photon-pair sources remains an active and rapidly evolving frontier. In this review, we survey the recent progress in QD-based entangled photon sources, highlighting the conceptual evolution from the established biexciton-exciton cascade to the emerging paradigm of spontaneous two-photon emission. We further examine how advances in nanophotonic architectures and coherent control strategies are redefining fundamental performance limits, enabling concurrent improvements in source brightness, coherence, and entanglement fidelity. Finally, we discuss the key physical and technological challenges that must be addressed to bridge the gap between laboratory demonstrations and large-scale deployment. We conclude by outlining the future opportunities for integrating QD-based entangled photon sources into practical quantum communication, computation, and sensing platforms.

*Ivan Zorin,Paul Gattinger*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a nonlinear SU(1,1) quantum interferometer using non-degenerate optical parametric down-conversion, characterized by strong unbalanced group velocity dispersion (GVD). This feature leads to degraded axial point-spread function (PSF) in OCT imaging unless physically compensated, which is challenging in non-degenerate broadband regimes. To address this, the authors propose a novel empirical numerical compensation method based on time-domain phase component extraction and mid-IR spectral-domain OCT signals processing. The method improves axial resolution by 2.2-fold and outperforms alternative correction techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing robust methods to compensate for group velocity dispersion in nonlinear interferometry for OCT imaging is crucial for enhancing image quality, especially in non-degenerate and broadband scenarios where physical compensation is difficult. This paper aims to address the challenge of degraded axial resolution in OCT imaging due to inherent GVD degradations in SU(1,1) nonlinear interferometers.

Method: The authors developed a numerical compensation method that involves extracting the phase component directly from the time-domain modality (a high-precision linearized quantum Fourier transform infrared spectrometer) and injecting it into the mid-IR spectral-domain OCT signals (with a central wavelength of around 3770 nm) before performing the Fourier transform. This approach was compared with an alternative numerical technique.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated a 2.2-fold improvement in axial resolution and outperformed the alternative correction method in overall imaging performance.

Conclusion: This paper presents a novel numerical compensation method for addressing GVD-induced degradations in OCT imaging using SU(1,1) quantum interferometers. The method effectively enhances axial resolution and improves imaging performance, providing a promising solution for overcoming the limitations of current compensation techniques in non-degenerate and broadband regimes.

Abstract: Nonlinear SU(1,1) quantum interferometers based on non-degenerate optical parametric down-conversion exhibit strong unbalanced group velocity dispersion (GVD). This feature is intrinsic to this type of interferometer as correlated photons of vastly different frequencies propagate through a dispersive nonlinear crystal; consequently, the dispersion arises from the source itself. The resulting GVD degrades the axial point-spread function (PSF) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) with undetected photons; and physical compensation is less straightforward, in particular for non-degenerate broadband regimes due to the limited number of suitable materials. In this contribution, we analyze dispersion in bulk nonlinear interferometry and describe its implications for OCT imaging. Aspects of hardware compensation are addressed, and a novel empirical numerical method of compensation is proposed. The approach is based on the extraction of the phase component directly from the time-domain modality (high precision linearized quantum Fourier transform infrared spectrometer) and its injection into the mid-IR spectral-domain OCT signals (central wavelength of around 3770 nm) before the Fourier transform. The proposed method is compared with an alternative numerical technique. The results demonstrate a 2.2-fold improvement in axial resolution and outperform the alternative correction method in overall imaging performance.

Abstract: The temporal dynamics of ultrashort pulses are a fundamental feature in ultrafast optics. These dynamics can often be extracted from a two-dimensional trace consisting of a set of nonlinear spectra, using an iterative algorithm. Typically, the measurement of this trace requires integrating the signal of many pulses, which implies that the trace does not correspond to a single pulse when shot-to-shot variations occur. In this case, the pulse train can be characterized statistically, by a base pulse and a metric that quantifies the instabilities. Here, we demonstrate that the amplitude swing technique is sensitive to instabilities, which manifest as two distinct imprints on the measurement. First, we analyze the terms that compose the amplitude swing signal. Then, we study two parameters to quantify the instabilities, related to a shift in the minima of the trace marginal, and to the filling of the trace minima zones, respectively. Finally, we apply these strategies to characterize simulated unstable pulse trains, using a simple technique.

Method: A coupled crossover waveguide structure is employed with a photonic crystal nanocavity. QD emission is coupled into a GaAs waveguide, which efficiently transfers photons to a SiN waveguide.

Result: Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission, on-chip propagation, and effective outcoupling through a SiN grating coupler are demonstrated.

Conclusion: This method successfully integrates InAs/GaAs QD-SPS into SiN photonic integrated circuits with efficient quantum light transfer.

Abstract: Hybrid integration of InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) single-photon sources (SPSs) is a promising approach for introducing quantum light into SiN photonic integrated circuits. However, the large refractive-index mismatch between GaAs and SiN poses a challenge for efficient optical coupling. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate hybrid integration of an InAs/GaAs QD-SPS on SiN using a coupled crossover waveguide structure. A photonic crystal nanocavity is employed for coupling QD emission into a GaAs waveguide, which efficiently transfers photons to a SiN waveguide at the crossover section. We observed Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission, on-chip propagation, and outcoupling through a SiN grating coupler.

Abstract: While energy band topology in spatial photonic crystals (PCs) and momentum-band topology in temporal crystals have each served as powerful probes of topological phases in their respective domains, their unification in a static platform remains unexplored. In this Letter, we bridge this gap by introducing a waveguide assisted non-Hermitian SSH model, in which controlled tuning of loss and coupling drives PT-symmetry breaking and enables a continuous transition between energy- and momentum-gap regimes. This allows us to construct a complete spatiotemporal topological phase diagram in a unified parameter space. By mapping this phase diagram onto a spatially graded PC, we experimentally observe multiple Bloch momentum-band gaps and a continuous spatiotemporal topological transition via translating across the static sample, enabling real-time control over the evolution pathway of the band topology. Our work creates a versatile, bias-free platform for exploring synthetic spacetime physics and opens new avenues for controlling light via non-Hermitian band engineering.

Result: The SCISSOR node achieves error-free classification on Iris and 97%+ accuracy on the Sonar task, with efficient classification possible even in digital schemes using sparse reservoir states.

Conclusion: The study shows promising photonic components for edge computing and neuromorphic systems with potential for future on-chip training strategies.

Abstract: Understanding the physical computing mechanisms of individual network nodes is essential for scaling neuromorphic photonic architectures. This work proposes a compact passive nonlinear photonic core based on a Side-Coupled Integrated Spaced Sequence of Resonators (SCISSOR) made of three nominally equal microrings and investigate its computing capabilities. Its nonlinearities and internal feedback enable analogue, spiking, and bistable responses that are accessed by tuning the injection power and wavelength. Implemented as a single nonlinear node in a time-multiplexed reservoir computing, the SCISSOR achieves error-free classification on the Iris dataset and accuracies above 97% on the Sonar task, using both analogue and digital reservoir representations with 150 virtual nodes. In the digital scheme, spiking dynamics naturally generate sparse reservoir states, enabling efficient classification even with a single spike. Intriguingly, optimal operating points are at the boundaries where sharp transitions in dynamical complexity and/or output power occur. In these points, the SCISSOR supports high task-performance, opening novel strategies for future on-chip training. Spiking and thermal bistabilities also participate to enhance the computational performance at low injected powers below 4 mW. These results suggest optical coupled microring resonators as effective building blocks for future edge computing and neuromorphic photonic systems.

Abstract: A large field of view of an optical system is needed for many applications, and optical systems with high magnification often suffer from a limited field of view due to the limited size of the camera sensor. This study proposes a novel technique for engineering the field of view of an optical system without compromising the magnification. In the proposed method, an object response pattern is recorded on a camera by introducing a coded phase mask (CPM) in the imaging system. The coded phase mask is a multiplexing of N distinct scattering phases, where N-1 represents the number of isolated object areas to be brought within the field of view. Each scattering phase yields a point spread function of a unique sparse dot pattern on the camera. With the introduction of a coded phase mask, the objects' images are brought within the region of the camera sensor, which, without the CPM, would have remained outside the inherent field of view of the system. To reconstruct the original object plane with N objects at their respective locations, the zero-padded object response pattern is deconvolved with the system's zero-padded and shifted point spread function. A simulation study followed by experimental results for N = 2 and N = 3 is presented in this article.

Motivation: Optical delay lines with high precision and flexibility are essential for advanced photonics applications, but conventional designs struggle with compactness and tunability.

Method: Experiments with a mechanically reconfigurable slow-light delay line based on a SNAP microresonator induced by silica optical fiber bending.

Result: Achieved tunable delays from 2ns to 0.5ns over 10GHz bandwidth in ~2mm length, with <6dB insertion loss, making it suitable for photonic beamforming, frequency-comb stabilization, and neuromorphic processing.

Conclusion: Mechanical tuning of SNAP microresonators provides a robust platform for dispersion-engineered optical delays with direct relevance to various high-tech photonics applications.

Abstract: Tunable optical delay lines that simultaneously offer nanosecond-scale delay, broadband operation, low dispersion, and compact footprint remain challenging to realize with conventional integrated photonic platforms. Here we demonstrate a mechanically reconfigurable slow-light delay line based on a surface nanoscale axial photonics (SNAP) microresonator dynamically induced by controlled bending of a silica optical fiber. A localized nanoscale cutoff-wavelength dip, introduced by CO2-laser annealing, provides a reflective boundary, while fiber bending generates a smooth axial potential whose shape is continuously tunable via loop curvature. By adjusting the bending radius, the induced SNAP microresonator evolves from a nearly linear to an approximately semiparabolic axial profile, enabling a controlled transition from dispersive to nearly dispersionless delay. Using a transverse microfiber coupler operated at the impedance-matching condition, we experimentally demonstrate continuous delay tuning from 2 ns to 0.5 ns within a 10 GHz bandwidth in an approximately 2 mm long fiber segment, with insertion loss below 6 dB. The results confirm that mechanically induced SNAP microresonators provide a compact, robust, and reconfigurable platform for dispersion-engineered optical delay lines, with direct relevance to photonic beamforming, frequency-comb stabilization, and neuromorphic photonic signal processing.

Abstract: Optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) are promising to overcome the wavelength coverage and noise limitations in conventional optical amplifiers based on rare-earth doping and semiconductor gain. However, the high power requirement remains a major obstacle to the widespread use of OPAs. Integrated OPAs can in principle improve the pump efficiency with tight mode confinement; however, challenges associated with propagation loss, limited nonlinearity, and susceptibility to nanoscale fabrication imperfections prevent them from competing with conventional bulk and fiber-based OPAs. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient integrated OPAs with continuous-wave net gain. The pump efficiency is improved by over one order of magnitude. Phase-sensitive gain of 23.5 dB is demonstrated, significantly exceeding previous integrated OPAs, using only 110 mW pump power and no cavity enhancement. This is achieved with parametric down-conversion in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides using the adapted poling technique to maintain the coherence of nonlinear interactions. Moreover, the high parametric gain exceeds fibre-chip-fibre losses, leading to appreciable net gain up to 10 dB. The 3 dB bandwidth is approximately 120 nm, covering telecommunication S-, C-, and Lbands. Quantum-limited noise performance is confirmed through the measurement of output field fluctuation below the classical limit. We further demonstrate that signalto-noise ratio in noisy optical communications can be increased by leveraging this efficient integrated OPA. Our work marks a significant step towards ideal optical amplifiers with strong amplification, high efficiency, quantum-limited noise, large bandwidth, and continuous-wave operation, unlocking new possibilities for next-generation photonic information processing systems.

Abstract: Relativistic quintuple-zeta basis sets for the p elements are presented. The basis sets for the occupied spinors were optimized at the Dirac-Coulomb self-consistent field (SCF) level on the ground configurations. Valence and core correlating functions were optimized in multireference SDCI calculations on the ground configuration. Diffuse functions optimized on the anion (or derived from neighboring elements for group 18) are also provided. Basic atomic and molecular properties were used to test the newly developed basis sets. A smooth convergence to the basis set limit is observed with increased basis set quality from the previously available double-zeta, triple-zeta, and quadruple-zeta basis sets to the newly developed quintuple-zeta basis sets for the calculated molecular bond lengths and dissociation energies and for atomic ionization potentials and electron affinities. Use of these basis sets in combination with state-of-the-art approaches for treatment of relativity and correlation will allow significantly increased accuracy in calculations on the heavy elements and their compounds. The basis sets are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18351835.

Abstract: We report the first direct frequency comparison between two multi-ion optical clocks based on the S$_{1/2}$ to D$_{5/2}$ transition in \Ca and \Sr ions. Using linear chains of up to nine \Ca ions and six \Sr ions, we demonstrate improved stability as a function of the number of ions that are contributing to the laser frequency stabilization servo. The measured joint fractional frequency stability of the two clocks reaches $1.37(12)\times 10^{-15}$ at one second, placing an upper bound on the same stability of one of the clocks at $9.6(8)\times 10^{-16}$ in one second. We measured the frequency ratio of the two clocks to be $R_{\text{Sr/Ca}}=1.082076536381896986(18)$, where the systematic uncertainty is primarily limited by the room temperature blackbody radiation. Our direct measurement represents an order of magnitude improvement compared to existing indirect frequency ratio measurements. Furthermore, by combining our results with recent absolute frequency measurements of the \Sr transition, referenced to a primary frequency standard, we refined the absolute frequency of the \Ca transition to $ν_{\text{Ca}^+}=411042129776400.21(4)$ Hz, reducing its uncertainty by a factor of three. This study presents the first direct comparison between two multi-ion optical clocks, highlighting their significant potential for future applications in fundamental physics tests, geodesy, and precision metrology.

Result: 相对论与电子间相互作用对电离能的影响非线性，原子不同系统中的相互作用方式各异，部分元素两者作用相互增强，部分相互抵消。

Conclusion: 电离能受相对论与相互作用的非独立贡献影响，需同时处理两者而非分开计算。

Abstract: This study investigates the interplay between relativistic effects and electron correlation effects on the first ionization energies of heavy atoms (Au through Rn, Z = 79-86). We perform two complementary analyses: (1) comparing relativistic corrections computed at both the Hartree-Fock (HF) and coupled cluster CCSD(T) levels to assess how correlation influences the magnitude of relativistic corrections, and (2) comparing correlation corrections computed within both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks to determine how relativity influences the magnitude of correlation corrections.
  Our results reveal a striking non-linear relationship between these two effects. Specifically, the combined effect of relativity and correlation on ionization energy does not equal the sum of their individual contributions. This non-additivity indicates that relativistic and correlation effects are not independent; they interact in complex ways that depend on the atomic system. We find that for some atoms, the two effects enhance each other, while for others they partially cancel. Moreover, the order in which one may add "separate" effects also counts, in that adding "pure" relativistic effects to the remaining outcome (including correlation) would give a different result than when adding "pure" correlation effects to the remaining outcome (including relativity).
  These findings demonstrate that relativistic and correlation effects are inherently non-additive, reflecting the non-linearity of the quantum many-body problem. Accurate computational predictions of ionization energies in heavy-element systems thus require simultaneous treatment of both effects rather than treating them as independent contributions.

Abstract: We report on the realization of a $^{133}$Cs optical tweezer array in a cryogenic blackbody radiation (BBR) environment. By enclosing the array within a 4K radiation shield, we measure long Rydberg lifetimes, up to $406 (36)\,μ$s for the $55 P_{3/2}$ Rydberg state, a factor of 3.3(3) longer than the room-temperature value. We employ single-photon coupling for coherent manipulation of the ground-Rydberg qubit. We measure a small differential dynamic polarizability of the transition, beneficial for reducing dephasing due to light intensity fluctuations. Our results pave the path for advancing neutral-atom two-qubit gate fidelities as their error budgets become increasingly dominated by $T_1$ relaxation of the ground-Rydberg qubit.

Abstract: By using a neural network that takes momentum distributions of photoelectrons produced in strong-field ionization as input, we retrieve the time-dependent bond length of a dissociating one-dimensional H$_{2}^{+}$ molecule. The photoelectron momentum distributions are calculated from the direct numerical solution of the non-Born-Oppenheimer time-dependent Schrödinger equation. We simulate two setups: first, molecules prepared in the first excited electronic state, second, a pump-probe scheme starting from the ground state. We show that in both schemes a neural network trained on momentum distributions calculated for frozen nuclei retrieves the time-dependent bond length with an absolute error of $0.2$-$0.4$ a.u. We find that a neural network, when applied to photoelectron momentum distributions obtained within the pump-probe scheme, can be used for the retrieval of the equilibrium internuclear distance and ground-state population. This opens new perspectives for extracting electronic properties of molecules from electron momentum distributions using deep learning.

Abstract: An active dissipative process organizes auditory frequency analysis in the mammalian cochlea. A minimal active beam model reveals that a spatially varying viscous coupling operator, $\partial_{xx}κ\partial_{xx}$, generates dissipative forces with wave--like propagation. Local energy injection and spatial redistribution compete to govern the dynamics. This balance enables the quantitative reproduction of four key features: sharp tuning, high gain, compression, and spontaneous otoacoustic emissions. Hearing thereby belongs to a broad class of nonequilibrium pattern-forming systems.
