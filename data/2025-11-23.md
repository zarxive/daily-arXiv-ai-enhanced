Abstract: Quantum computing holds immense potential for transforming financial analysis and decision-making. Realising this potential necessitates the efficient encoding and processing of financial data on quantum computers. In this study, we propose using the GASP (Genetic Algorithm for State Preparation) framework to optimise the encoding of stock price data into quantum states and show it can enhance both the fidelity and efficiency of the encoding process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by encoding stock price data onto both a simulated and real quantum computer to calculate the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) entropy. Our results show improvements in fidelity and the potential for more precise financial analysis. This research provides insights into the applicability of GASP for the efficient encoding of real-world data, specifically stock price data, which is crucial for quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era quantum computers.

Abstract: Bosonic systems, such as photons and ultracold atoms, have played a central role in demonstrating quantum-enhanced sensing. Quantum entanglement, through squeezed and GHZ states, enables sensing beyond classical limits. However, such a quantum advantage has so far been confined to two-mode bosonic systems, as analogous multi-mode squeezed states are non-trivial to prepare. Here, we develop a Monte-Carlo based optimization technique which can be used to efficiently engineer a Hamiltonian control-sequence for multi-mode bosonic systems to prepare multi-mode squeezed states. Specifically, we consider a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice, relevant for applications in gravimetry and gradiometry, and demonstrate that metrologically useful squeezed states can be generated using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian which includes on-site atomic interactions, tunable via Feshbach resonances. By analyzing the distribution (density) of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) over the Hilbert space, we identify a characteristic \textit{intermediate scaling} of the QFI: $\mathcal{O}(N^2 L+L^2 N)$, which lies between the standard quantum limit (SQL) and the Heisenberg limit (HL) for $N$ atoms in $L$ modes. We show that in general, within the Hilbert space there is a finite, $\mathcal{O}(1)$ measure subset of Hilbert space with an intermediate QFI scaling. Therefore, one can find a Hamiltonian control sequence using a Monte Carlo optimization over random control sequences, that produces a state with intermediate scaling of the QFI. We assume an experimentally accessible range of the control parameters in the Hamiltonian resources and show that the intermediate scaling can be readily achieved. Our results indicate that the HL can be approached in quantum gravimetry using realistic experimental parameters for systems with $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $N\gg L$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A longstanding belief in quantum tomography is that estimating a mixed state is far harder than estimating a pure state. This is borne out in the mathematics, where mixed state algorithms have always required more sophisticated techniques to design and analyze than pure state algorithms. We present a new approach to tomography demonstrating that, contrary to this belief, state-of-the-art mixed state tomography follows easily and naturally from pure state algorithms.
  We analyze the following strategy: given $n$ copies of an unknown state $ρ$, convert them into copies of a purification $|ρ\rangle$; run a pure state tomography algorithm to produce an estimate of $|ρ\rangle$; and output the resulting estimate of $ρ$. The purification subroutine was recently discovered via the "acorn trick" of Tang, Wright, and Zhandry. With this strategy, we obtain the first tomography algorithm which is sample-optimal in all parameters. For a rank-$r$ $d$-dimensional state, it uses $n = O((rd + \log(1/δ))/\varepsilon)$ samples to output an estimate which is $\varepsilon$-close in fidelity with probability at least $1-δ$. This algorithm also uses poly$(n)$ gates, making it the first gate-efficient tomography algorithm which is sample-optimal even in terms of the dimension $d$ alone. Moreover, with this method we recover essentially all results on mixed state tomography, including its applications to tomography with limited entanglement, classical shadows, and quantum metrology. Our proofs are simple, closing the gap in conceptual difficulty between mixed and pure tomography. Our results also clarify the role of entangled measurement in mixed state tomography: the only step of the algorithm which requires entanglement across copies is the purification step, suggesting that, for tomography, the reason entanglement is useful is for consistent purification.

Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to test the nonclassicality of a macroscopic ensemble of qubits, through the violation of the classical notion of macrorealism (MR) via the fundamental measurement-induced disturbance of quantum systems. An electromagnetic resonator is used to probe the parity of the qubit-ensemble. The action of sequential measurements allows the nonclassicality of whole ensemble to manifest itself, in the ideal case, irrespective of its size. This enables to probe the macroscopic limits of quantum mechanics as the qubit-ensemble is, effectively, a single large spin of many $\hbar$ units. Even as $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ in comparison to the total angular momentum of the ensemble, a constant amount of violation of MR is found in the noiseless case. However, environmental decoherence and inhomogeneity of qubit-electromagnetic field couplings precipitate the quantum-to-classical transition. This implies that Bohr's correspondence principle is not fundamental, but a consequence of practical limitations. We outline an implementation with a variety of qubits (superconducting qubits, spins in semiconductors, and Rydberg atoms) coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator, and - via the corresponding noise analysis - find that violation of MR is detectable up to $100$ qubits via current technology.

Abstract: We propose high-fidelity single-qubit spin-dependent kicks (SDKs) for trapped ions using nanosecond Raman pulses via amplitude modulation of a continuous-wave laser with a tunable beat frequency. We develop a general method for maintaining SDK performance in the presence of micromotion by identifying optimal choices of the RF phase and frequency that suppress unwanted backward kicks. The proposed scheme enables SDK infidelities as low as $10^{-9}$ in the absence of micromotion, and below $10^{-5}$ with micromotion. This study lays the foundation for the realization of sub-trap-period and high-fidelity two-qubit gates based on SDKs.

Abstract: To perform meaningful computations, Quantum Computers (QCs) must scale to macroscopic levels - i.e., to a large number of qubits - an objective pursued by most quantum companies. How to efficiently test their quantumness at these scales? We show that the violation of Macrorealism (MR), being the fact that classical systems possess definite properties that can be measured without disturbances, provide a fruitful avenue to this aim. The No Disturbance Condition (NDC) - the equality used here to test MR - can be violated by two consecutive parity measurements on $N$ qubits and found to be independent of $N$ under ideal conditions. However, realistic noisy QCs show a quantum-to-classical transition as $N$ increases, giving a foundationally-motivated scalable benchmarking metric. Two methods are formulated to implement this metric: one that involves a mid-circuit measurement, probing the irreversible collapse of the wavefunction, in contrast to the reversible entanglement generated in the other. Both methods are designed to be clumsiness-loophole free: the unwanted classical disturbances are negligible within statistical error. Violation of MR is detected on a IBM QC up to $N = 38$ qubits, increasing $N$ by one order of magnitude over best known results of MR. Two QCs are benchmarked using the proposed NDC metric, showing a three-fold improvement in their quantumness from one generation to the next.

### [8] [Cyclone: Designing Efficient and Highly Parallel QCCD Architectural Codesigns for Fault Tolerant Quantum Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15910)
*Sahil Khan,Abhinav Anand,Kenneth R. Brown,Jonathan M. Baker*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cyclone, a circular software-hardware codesign for modular trapped-ion quantum computing hardware (QCCDs), aiming to significantly enhance performance by eliminating roadblocks, improving parallelism, and reducing the number of traps and qubits required. The—an implementation achieves up to $4	imes$ speedup in execution times, up to $2	imes$ reduction in logical error rates, and up to $20	imes$ overall spacetime improvement over traditional 2D grid architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of maintaining effective all-to-all connectivity in QCCD hardware, which is constrained by sequential operations in each module. This limits the potential for efficient quantum error correction codes like HGP and BB, which benefit from high parallelism. The proposed Cyclone design addresses these limitations by introducing a flexible ring topology, enabling faster execution and lower error rates in trapped-ion quantum computers.

Method: The authors propose Cyclone, a circular codesign approach that departs from traditional 2D grid architectures. This design eliminates roadblocks, bounds total movement, and enables high levels of parallelism. The implementation details include the elimination of spatial roadblock dependencies, movement constraints, and scheduling inefficiencies inherent in grid architectures. Cyclone is applied to HGP and BB codes, achieving performance improvements in logical error rates and execution times.

Result: The result of the paper is that Cyclone significantly outperforms existing grid-based QCCD architectures. HGP codes achieved up to a 2$	imes$ improvement in logical error rates, while BB codes saw up to a 3$	imes$ improvement in error rates. Execution times were improved by up to 4$	imes$, and the number of required traps and ancilla qubits was reduced by 2$	imes$. The overall spacetime improvement over a standard grid is up to $	ilde{20}	imes$., demonstrating Cyclone as a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional QCCD architectures.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by presenting Cyclone as a novel hardware-software co-design framework for modular trapped-ion quantum computing. Cyclone addresses the critical issues of connectivity and parallelism in QCCDs, offering significant improvements in both performance and scalability. This advancement positions trapped-ion quantum computers as a viable and powerful platform for quantum computing applications, especially for algorithms that benefit from high parallelism.

Abstract: Modular trapped-ion quantum computing hardware, known as QCCDs require shuttling operations in order to maintain effective all-to-all connectivity. Each module or trap can perform only one operation at a time, resulting in low intra-trap parallelism, but there is no restriction on operations happening on independent traps, enabling high inter-trap parallelism. Unlike their superconducting counterparts, the design space for QCCDs is relatively flexible and can be explored beyond current grid designs. In particular, current grid-based architectures significantly limit the performance of many promising, high-rate codes such as HGP codes and BB codes, suffering from numerous trap to trap ``roadblocks", forcing serialization and destroying the inherent parallelism of these codes.. Many of these codes are highly parallelizable, meaning that with appropriate hardware layouts and matching software schedules, execution latency can be reduced. Faster execution, in turn, reduces error accumulation from decoherence and heating, ultimately improving code performance when mapped to realistic hardware. To address this, we propose Cyclone, a circular software-hardware codesign that departs from traditional 2D grids in favor of a flexible ring topology, where ancilla qubits move in lockstep. Cyclone eliminates roadblocks, bounds total movement, and enables high levels of parallelism, resulting in up to ~4$\times$ speedup in execution times. With HGP codes, Cyclone achieves up to a 2$\times$ order of magnitude improvement in logical error rate, and with BB codes, this improvement reaches up to a 3$\times$ in order of magnitude.Spatially, Cyclone reduces the number of required traps and ancilla qubits by $2\times$.The overall spacetime improvement over a standard grid is up to $\sim 20 \times$, demonstrating Cyclone as a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional 2D QCCD architectures.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method to express the stabilizer of a k-uniform complete hypergraph state as a linear combination of local operators. Quantum hypergraph states generalize graph states and exhibit properties that are not shared by their graph counterparts, most notably, their stabilizers are intrinsically nonlocal, as hyperedges can involve arbitrary subsets of vertices. Our formulation provides an explicit description of the stabilizers for k-uniform complete hypergraphs and may offer new insights for exploring these states within the stabilizer formalism. In particular, this approach could facilitate the construction of new Bell inequalities or find applications in quantum error correction.

### [10] [Reversing Quantum Noise: Quantum Reverse Diffusion for Pauli Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15919)
*Einar Gabbassov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that individual quantum trajectories can exhibit reversible dynamics despite the typical irreversibility of ensemble-averaged open quantum systems. They derived quantum reverse diffusion equations for continuously monitored Pauli channels with time-dependent noise, bridging nonlinear classical and linear quantum dynamics. This opens new avenues for quantum gate design, tomography, and error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the irreversibility of quantum systems is crucial, yet this paper challenges typical assumptions by showing reversibility at the individual trajectory level, with broad implications for quantum technologies.

Method: The researchers developed quantum stochastic differential equations specifically for continuously monitored Pauli channels under time-dependent noise, providing both exact and approximate reverse diffusion dynamics. They drew parallels to classical reverse diffusion, establishing a theoretical framework that connects classical generative modeling with quantum mechanics.

Result: The key result is the derivation of reverse diffusion equations that allow precise modeling of quantum trajectories under noisy conditions. Additionally, the equations enable approximation methods for practical applications in quantum computing and metrology.

Conclusion: This work expands the theoretical toolkit for controlling and understanding quantum dynamics, potentially leading to innovations in gate synthesis, state estimation, and fault-tolerant error correction techniques by leveraging reverse diffusion.

Abstract: The ensemble-averaged dynamics of open quantum systems are typically irreversible. We show that this irreversibility need not hold at the level of individually monitored quantum trajectories. Our main results are quantum reverse diffusion stochastic differential equations, along with corresponding stochastic master equations. These equations describe the exact and approximate reverse diffusion dynamics for continuously monitored Pauli channels, including time-dependent depolarizing noise. Our results bridge the gap between highly nonlinear classical reverse diffusion, prominent in generative modelling, and linear quantum mechanics. Consequently, this establishes a theoretical framework for diffusion-driven quantum gates, quantum tomography via forward-reverse cycles, and potential paradigms for quantum error correction based on reverse diffusion.

Abstract: Spins in solids and molecules are promising for applications of quantum sensing technology. The sensitivity of the quantum sensing depends on how precisely spin observables can be determined in the measurement, and is intrinsically limited by the uncertainties of the observables. The use of a spin-squeezed state in a quantum sensor can reduce the uncertainty below the standard quantum limit when combined with an appropriate measurement procedure. Here, we discuss the simulation study of the generation of a squeezed state in an interacting spin system. We show that a spin system coupled by the magnetic dipole interaction can create a squeezed state. Model systems to realize the spin squeezing experimentally are also discussed. In addition, we find that a squeezed state is a type of entangled state. The present work paves the way to realize a squeezed state using a spin system to build a quantum sensor network with improved sensitivity, and to use it for the detection of quantum entanglement.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Measurement incompatibility--the impossibility of jointly measuring certain quantum observables--is a fundamental resource for quantum information processing. We develop a graph-theoretic framework for quantifying this resource for large families of binary measurements, including Pauli observables on multi-qubit systems and $k$-body Majorana observables on $n$-mode fermionic systems. To each set of observables we associate an anti-commutativity graph, whose vertices represent observables and whose edges indicate pairs that anti-commute. In this representation, the incompatibility robustness--the minimal amount of classical noise required to render the set jointly measurable--becomes a graph invariant. We derive general bounds on this invariant in terms of the Lovász number, clique number, and fractional chromatic number, and show that the Lovász number yields the correct asymptotic scaling for $k$-body Majorana observables. For line graphs $L(G)$, which naturally arise in the characterisation of exactly solvable spin models, we obtain spectral bounds on the robustness expressed through the energy and skew-energy of the underlying graph $G$. These bounds become tight for highly symmetric graphs, leading to closed formulas for several graph families. Finally, we identify structural conditions under which the robustness is determined by a simple function of the graph's maximum degree and the number of vertices and edges, and show that such extremal cases occur only when combinatorial structures such as Hadamard, conference or weighing matrices exist.

Abstract: We introduce a novel analytical approach for studying free-fermion (XX) chains with smoothly varying, site-dependent hoppings and magnetic fields. Building on a discrete WKB-like approximation applied directly to the recurrence relation for the single-particle eigenfunctions, we derive a closed-form expression for the local fermion density profile as a function of the Fermi energy, which is valid for arbitrary fillings, hopping amplitudes and magnetic fields. This formula reproduces the depletion and saturation effects observed in previous studies of inhomogeneous free-fermion chains, and provides a theoretical framework to understand entanglement entropy suppression in these models. We demonstrate the accuracy of our asymptotic formula in several chains with different hopping and magnetic field profiles. Our findings are thus the first step towards an analytical treatment of entanglement in free-fermion chains beyond the reach of conventional field-theoretic techniques.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a computational paradigm that seeks to apply quantum-mechanical resources to solve learning problems. As such, the goal of this framework is to leverage quantum processors to tackle optimization, supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, and generative modeling-among other tasks-more efficiently than classical models. Here we offer a high level overview of QML, focusing on settings where the quantum device is the primary learning or data generating unit. We outline the field's tensions between practicality and guarantees, access models and speedups, and classical baselines and claimed quantum advantages-flagging where evidence is strong, where it is conditional or still lacking, and where open questions remain. By shedding light on these nuances and debates, we aim to provide a friendly map of the QML landscape so that the reader can judge when-and under what assumptions-quantum approaches may offer real benefits.

Abstract: We study the universality of work statistics performed during a quench in gapless quantum systems. We show that the cumulants of work scale separately in the fast and slow quench regimes, following a power law analogous to the universal scaling in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for topological defect formation in phase transition. As an example, we analyze the nonequilibrium dynamics of a quenched Heisenberg XXZ chain at its critical gapless state using the bosonization picture, resulting in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. The analytical scaling is in agreement with the exact numerical calculation for the fast and slow quench regimes. In finite systems, the characteristic function display an oscillatory pattern which disappears in the thermodynamic limit. This study is particularly useful for understanding the thermodynamics of adiabatic quantum computation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum algorithms have reached a state where we can consider how to capitalize on quantum and classical computational resources to accelerate molecular resonance state identification. Here we identify molecular resonances with a method that combines quantum computing with classical high-throughput computing (HTC). This algorithm, which we term qDRIVE (the quantum deflation resonance identification variational eigensolver) exploits the complex absorbing potential formalism to distill the problem of molecular resonance identification into a network of hybrid quantum-classical variational quantum eigensolver tasks, and harnesses HTC resources to execute these interconnected but independent tasks both asynchronously and in parallel, a strategy that minimizes wall time to completion. We show qDRIVE successfully identifies resonance energies and wavefunctions in simulated quantum processors with current and planned specifications, which bodes well for qDRIVE's ultimate application in disciplines ranging from photocatalysis to quantum control and places a spotlight on the potential offered by integrated heterogenous quantum computing/HTC approaches in computational chemistry.

Abstract: Quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes can significantly reduce the overhead of quantum computing, provided the methods for performing logical operations do not require substantial space and time resources. A popular method for performing logical operations is by measuring logical Pauli operators. We present a simple, explicit construction for fixed gadgets that can measure arbitrary logical Pauli operators on QLDPC codes when dynamically connected to the code block. We apply this construction to a family of generalised bicycle codes with distances relevant to utility-scale quantum computation ($10\leq d \leq 24$) and show that it reduces the space overhead by at least an order of magnitude compared to corresponding surface code architectures, without increasing the time overhead.

Abstract: An important proof technique in the random oracle model involves reprogramming it on hard to predict inputs and arguing that an attacker cannot detect that this occurred. In the quantum setting, a particularly challenging version of this considers adaptive reprogramming wherein the points to be reprogrammed (or the output values they should be programmed to) are dependent on choices made by the adversary. Some quantum frameworks for analyzing adaptive reprogramming were given by Unruh (CRYPTO 2014, EUROCRYPT 2015), Grilo-Hövelmanns-Hülsing-Majenz (ASIACRYPT 2021), and Pan-Zeng (PKC 2024). We show, counterintuitively, that these adaptive results follow from the \emph{nonadaptive} one-way to hiding theorem of Ambainis-Hamburg-Unruh (CRYPTO 2019). These implications contradict beliefs (whether stated explicitly or implicitly) that some properties of the adaptive frameworks cannot be provided by the Ambainis-Hamburg-Unruh result.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices impose dual challenges on quantum circuit execution: limited qubit connectivity requires extensive SWAP-gate routing, while time-dependent decoherence progressively degrades quantum information. Existing qubit mapping algorithms optimize for hardware topology and static calibration metrics but systematically neglect transverse relaxation dynamics (T2), creating a fundamental gap between compiler decisions and evolving noise characteristics. We present TRAM (Transverse Relaxation Time-Aware Qubit Mapping), a coherence-guided compilation framework that elevates decoherence mitigation to a primary optimization objective. TRAM integrates calibration-informed community detection to construct noise-resilient qubit partitions, generates time-weighted initial mappings that anticipate coherence decay, and dynamically schedules SWAP operations to minimize cumulative error accumulation. Evaluated on Qiskit-based simulators with realistic noise models, TRAM outperforms SABRE by 3.59% in fidelity, reduces gate count by 11.49%, and shortens circuit depth by 12.28%, establishing coherence-aware optimization as essential for practical quantum compilation in the NISQ era.

Abstract: Quantum batteries are quantum mechanical systems able to store and release energy in a controlled fashion. Among them, a special role is played by quantum structures defined as networks of two-level systems. In this context, it has recently been shown that the energy stored in free fermion quantum batteries is sensitive to the quantum phase diagram of the battery itself. This sensitivity is relevant for stabilizing the stored energy and designing optimal charging protocols. In this article, we explore universal charging behaviors of free fermion quantum batteries across quantum phase transitions. We first analyze a Dirac cone-like model to extract general features. Then, we verify our findings by means of two relevant lattice models, namely the Ising chain in a transverse field and the Haldane model.

Abstract: We demonstrate channel-selective frequency up-conversion from telecom wavelengths around 1540 nm for optical fiber communication to visible wavelengths around 780 nm, based on second-order optical nonlinearity in a cavity of the converted modes. In our experiment, we selectively convert a light from any frequency mode within frequency-multiplexed telecom signals to a desired output mode, determined by the cavity resonances. Based on the experimental results of the frequency up-conversion, we derive the signal-to-noise ratio of the process at the single-photon level, and discuss its applicability to channel-selective quantum frequency conversion (CS-QFC) in the context of frequency-multiplexed quantum networks. Finally, we describe specific use cases of the CS-QFC, which show its utility as a reconfigurable switching element in frequency-multiplexed networks, particularly for selectively performing Bell-state measurements between two photons originating from different frequencies.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are an analog of classical neural networks in the world of quantum computing, which are represented by a unitary matrix with trainable parameters. Inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks, ensuring that every continuous function can be arbitrarily well approximated uniformly on a compact set of a Euclidean space, some recent works have established analogous results for QNNs, ranging from single-qubit to multi-qubit QNNs, and even hybrid classical-quantum models. In this paper, we study the approximation capabilities of QNNs for periodic functions with respect to the supremum norm. We use the Jackson inequality to approximate a given function by implementing its approximating trigonometric polynomial via a suitable QNN. In particular, we see that by restricting to the class of periodic functions, one can achieve a quadratic reduction of the number of parameters, producing better approximation results than in the literature. Moreover, the smoother the function, the fewer parameters are needed to construct a QNN to approximate the function.

Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of slowly driven quantum thermal machines based on interacting qubits within the framework of the Lindblad master equation. By implementing a systematic expansion in the driving rate, we derive explicit expressions for the rate of work of the driving forces, the heat currents exchanged with the reservoirs, and the entropy production up to second order, ensuring full thermodynamic consistency in the linear-response regime. The formalism naturally separates geometric and dissipative contributions, identified by a Berry curvature and a metric in parameter space, respectively. Analytical results show that the geometric heat pumped per cycle is bounded by $k_B T N_q \ln 2$ for $N_q$ non-interacting qubits, in direct analogy with the Landauer limit for entropy change. This bound can be surpassed when qubit interactions and asymmetric couplings to the baths are introduced. Numerical results for the interacting two-qubit system reveal a non-trivial role of the interaction between qubits and the coupling between the qubits and the baths in the behavior of the dissipated power. The approach provides a general platform for studying dissipation, pumping, and performance optimization in driven quantum devices operating as heat engines.

Abstract: Optomechanics with levitated nanoparticles is a promising way to combine very different types of quantum non-Gaussian aspects induced by continuous dynamics in a nonlinear or time-varying potential with the ones coming from discrete quantum elements in dynamics or measurement. First, it is necessary to prepare quantum non-Gaussian states using both methods. The nonlinear and time-varying potentials have been widely analyzed for this purpose. However, feasible preparation of provably quantum non-Gaussian states in a single mechanical mode using discrete photon detection has not been proposed yet for optical levitation. We explore pulsed optomechanical interactions combined with non-linear photon detection techniques to approach mechanical Fock states and confirm their quantum non-Gaussianity. We also predict the conditions under which the optomechanical interaction can induce multiple-phonon addition processes, which are relevant for $n$-phonon quantum non-Gaussianity. The practical applicability of quantum non-Gaussian states for sensing phase-randomized displacements is shown. Besides such applications, generating quantum non-Gaussian states of levitated nanoparticles can help to study fundamental questions of quantum thermodynamics, and macroscopic quantum effects.

Result: The study successfully observed three polariton branches above the critical temperature Tc = 162.5 K and an additional branch below Tc, which is explained by a new phonon mode in the low-temperature phase. The multimode Hopfield model confirmed the ultrastrong coupling regime.

Conclusion: Symmetry control via phonon engineering provides a viable method to tune ultrastrong coupling in optical cavities, demonstrating the potential for manipulating light-matter interactions in hybrid systems.

Abstract: Optical cavities provide a powerful means to engineer light-matter hybrid states by coupling confined electromagnetic fields with matter excitations. Achieving in situ control of the coupling strength is essential for investigating how such hybridization evolves with the coupling strength. In this work, we use a symmetry-changing structural phase transition in lead halide perovskites to reversibly tune the phonon-photon coupling strength, leveraging the fact that their phonon frequencies and oscillator strengths are dictated by lattice symmetry. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy of MAPbI3 embedded in nanoslot cavities reveals three polariton branches above the critical temperature Tc = 162.5 K, and the emergence of an additional branch below Tc, activated by a new phonon mode in the low-temperature phase. The full dispersion is accurately reproduced using a multimode Hopfield model, confirming that all normalized coupling strengths remain in the ultrastrong coupling regime. These results demonstrate symmetry-controlled tuning of ultrastrong coupling via phonon engineering in optical cavities.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum circuits will experience failures that lead to computational errors. We introduce Medusa, an automated compilation method for lowering a circuit's failure rate. Medusa uses flags to predict the absence of high-weight errors. Our method can numerically upper bound the failure rate of a circuit in the presence of flags, and fine tune the fault-tolerance of the flags in order to reach this bound. We assume the flags can have an increased fault-tolerance as a result of applying surface QECs to the gates interacting with them. We use circuit level depolarizing noise to evaluate the effectiveness of these flags in revealing the absence of the high-weight stabilizers. Medusa reduces the cost of quantum-error-correction (QEC) because the underlying circuit has a lower failure rate. We benchmark our approach using structured quantum circuits representative of ripple-carry adders. In particular, our flag scheme demonstrates that for adder-like circuits, the failure rate of large-scale implementations can be lowered to fit the failure rates of smaller-scale circuits. We show numerically that a slight improvement in the local fault-tolerance of the flag-qubits can lead to a reduction in the overall failure rate of the entire quantum circuit.

Abstract: We study the optimal rates of emulation (also called interconversion) between quantum channels. When the source and the target channels are idempotent, we give a single-letter expression for the zero-error emulation capacity in terms of structural properties of the range of the two channels. This expression shows that channel emulation is not reversible for general idempotent channels. Furthermore, we establish a strong converse rate that matches with the zero-error emulation capacity when the source or the target channel is either an identity or a completely dephasing channel.

Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum computers encode qubits in individually trapped atoms arranged in optical lattices. Achieving defect-free atom configurations is essential for high-fidelity quantum gates and scalable error correction, yet stochastic loading and atom loss during rearrangement hinder reliable large-scale assembly. This work presents ATLAS, an open-source atom transport algorithm that efficiently converts a randomly loaded $W \times W$ lattice into a defect-free $L \times L$ subarray while accounting for realistic physical constraints, including finite acceleration, transfer time, and per-move loss probability. In the planning phase, optimal batches of parallel moves are computed on a lossless virtual array; during execution, these moves are replayed under probabilistic atom loss to maximize the expected number of retained atoms. Monte Carlo simulations across lattice sizes $W=10$--$100$, loading probabilities $p_{\mathrm{occ}}=0.5$--$0.9$, and loss rates $p_{\mathrm{loss}}=0$--$0.05$ demonstrate fill rates above $99\%$ within six iterations and over $90\%$ atom retention at low loss. The algorithm achieves sublinear move scaling ($\propto M^{0.55}$) and linear growth of required initial size with target dimension, outperforming prior methods in robustness and scalability -- offering a practical path toward larger neutral-atom quantum arrays.

Abstract: The development of quantum internet demands on-chip quantum processor nodes and interconnection between the nodes. Path-encoded photonic qubits are suitable for on-chip quantum information processors, while time-bin encoded ones are good at long-distance communication. It is necessary to develop an on-chip converter between the two encodings to satisfy the needs of the quantum internet. In this work, a quantum photonic circuit is proposed to convert time-bin-encoded photonic qubits to path-encoded ones via a thin-film lithium niobate high-speed optical switch and low-loss matched optical delay lines. The performance of the encoding converter is demonstrated by the experiment of time-bin to path encoding conversion on the fabricated sample chip. The converted path qubits have an average fidelity higher than 97%. The potential of the encoding converter on applications in quantum networks is demonstrated by the experiments of entanglement distribution and quantum key distribution. The results show that the on-chip encoding converter can serve as a foundational component in the future quantum internet, bridging the gap between quantum information transmission and on-chip processing based on photons.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the emergence and control of genuine tripartite entanglement in a hybrid cavity quantum electrodynamics architecture consisting of two linearly coupled single mode resonators, one of which interacts coherently with a two level atom. An analytical framework is developed in a weak driving regime, where the system dynamically supports a delocalized hybrid excitation shared by the two photonic modes and the atomic degree of freedom. Tripartite concurrence fill has been used to characterize and identify parameter regimes of maximal multipartite quantum correlation that can be generated in this model. Additionally, we demonstrate how dissipative rates and detuning asymmetries govern the conversion of bipartite entanglement into a genuinely tripartite state, establishing a controllable transition from localized Jaynes Cummings correlations to delocalized photonic atomic entanglement networks. These findings outline a clear route to engineering steady state multipartite quantum resources in coupled cavity QED platforms, with direct relevance to quantum networking, distributed quantum information processing, and photonic state routing in scalable quantum architectures.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimization of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Networks using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) framework. Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.

Abstract: Quantum asymmetry and coherence are genuinely quantum resources that are essential to realize quantum advantage in information technologies. However, all quantum processes are fundamentally constrained by quantum speed limits, which raises the question on the corresponding bounds on the rate of consumption of asymmetry and coherence. In the present work, we derive a formulation of the quantum speed limit for observables in terms of the trace-norm asymmetry of the time-dependent quantum state relative to the observable. This version of the quantum speed limit can be shown to be directly relevant in weak measurements and quantum metrology. It can be further related to quantum coherence relative to the observable, and we obtain a complementary relation for the speed of three mutually unbiased observables for a single qubit. As an application, we derive a notion of a quantum thermodynamic speed limit.

TL;DR: Classically sampling from certain distributions related to quantum computing is feasible.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research demonstrates that classical computing can efficiently simulate specific quantum sampling tasks, indicating that some quantum advantages may be overstated.

Method: The authors analyze the distributional properties of Gaussian Boson Sampling and another distribution, proving classical sampling algorithms.

Result: They establish that these distributions can be sampled efficiently using classical methods, implying polynomial-time classical computation possibility.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that for these specific cases, quantum resources do not offer an exponential speedup over classical methods.

Abstract: We show that a distribution related to Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) on graphs can be sampled classically in polynomial time. Graphical applications of GBS typically sample from this distribution, and thus quantum algorithms do not provide exponential speedup for these applications. We also show that another distribution related to Boson sampling can be sampled classically in polynomial time.

Abstract: Quantum chemistry and optimization are two of the most prominent applications of quantum computers. Variational quantum algorithms have been proposed for solving problems in these domains. However, the design of the quantum circuit ansatz remains a challenge. Of particular interest is developing a method to generate circuits for any given instance of a problem, not merely a circuit tailored to a specific instance of the problem. To this end, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to learning a problem-dependent quantum circuit mapping, which outputs a circuit for the ground state of a Hamiltonian from a given family of parameterized Hamiltonians. For quantum chemistry, our RL framework takes as input a molecule and a discrete set of bond distances, and it outputs a bond-distance-dependent quantum circuit for arbitrary bond distances along the potential energy curve. The inherently non-greedy approach of our RL method contrasts with existing greedy approaches to adaptive, problem-tailored circuit constructions. We demonstrate its effectiveness for the four-qubit and six-qubit lithium hydride molecules, as well as an eight-qubit H$_4$ chain. Our learned circuits are interpretable in a physically meaningful manner, thus paving the way for applying RL to the development of novel quantum circuits for the ground states of large-scale molecular systems.

TL;DR: OpenQudit through a symbolic approach accelerates quantum instruction synthesis by ~20x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving efficiency in quantum instruction synthesis for domain experts and developers.

Method: Introduces OpenQudit with a QGL DSL, ahead-of-time compiler with tensor networks and e-graph passes, JIT compiles to native code.

Result: Achieved up to 20x acceleration in core tasks compared to existing tools.

Conclusion: A significant advancement in automating and optimizing quantum circuit compilers, suitable for domain experts in quantum computing.

Abstract: High-performance numerical quantum compilers rely on classical optimization, but are limited by slow numerical evaluations and a design that makes extending them with new instructions a difficult, error-prone task for domain experts. This paper introduces OpenQudit, a compilation framework that solves these problems by allowing users to define quantum operations symbolically in the Qudit Gate Language (QGL), a mathematically natural DSL. OpenQudit's ahead-of-time compiler uses a tensor network representation and an e-graph-based pass for symbolic simplification before a runtime tensor network virtual machine (TNVM) JIT-compiles the expressions into high-performance native code. The evaluation shows that this symbolic approach is highly effective, accelerating the core instantiation task by up to $\mathtt{\sim}20\times$ on common quantum circuit synthesis problems compared to state-of-the-art tools.

TL;DR: This paper presents a quantum integrated sensing and communication (QISAC) protocol that leverages quantum carriers, such as entangled particles, to simultaneously achieve superdense coding and quantum sensing. The protocol employs variational circuit learning to adaptively optimize encoding and measurement, and classical machine learning-based decoders and estimators are used to process the measurement outcomes.

Conclusion: 该方案有效减少了长链离子阱中的离子丢失对量子计算的影响。

Abstract: Neutral atom quantum computers and to a lesser extent trapped ions may suffer from atom loss. In this work, we investigate the impact of atom loss in long chains of trapped ions. Even though this is a relatively rare event, ion loss in long chains must be addressed because it destabilizes the entire chain resulting in the loss of all the qubits of the chain. We propose a solution to the chain loss problem based on (1) a quantum error correction code distributed over multiple long chains, (2) beacon qubits within each long chain to detect the loss of a chain, and (3) a decoder adapted to correct a combination of circuit faults and erasures after beacon qubits convert chain losses into erasures. We verify the chain loss correction capability of our scheme through circuit level simulations with a distributed $[[72,12,6]]$ BB code with beacon qubits.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive and pedagogical formulation of Bayesian multiparameter quantum estimation, providing explicit conditions for achieving minimum quadratic losses. Within this framework, we analyse the role of measurement incompatibility and establish its quantitative effect on attainable precision. We achieve this by deriving upper bounds based on the pretty good measurement -- a notion originally developed for hypothesis testing -- combined with the evaluation of the Nagaoka-Hayashi lower bound. In general, we prove that, as in the many-copy regime of local estimation theory, incompatibility can at most double the minimum loss relative to the idealised scenario in which individually optimal measurements are assumed jointly implementable. This result implies that, in many practical situations, the latter may provide a sufficient and computationally efficient benchmark without solving the full optimisation problem. Our results, which we illustrate through a range of applications, including discrete quantum phase imaging, phase and dephasing estimation, and qubit sensing, provide analytical and numerical tools for assessing ultimate precision limits and the role of measurement incompatibility in Bayesian multiparameter quantum metrology. We also provide an open-source package that implements all bounds discussed here, enabling practical evaluation and comparison across quantum metrological models.

Conclusion: 双层折叠晶体平台为同时观察和控制 Skyrmion 的各种种和演化提供了一个统一的实验平台，可能在天体物理和材料科学领域有广泛应用。

Abstract: Skyrmion family members, such as skyrmions, bimerons, and skyrmioniums, have been recently observed in quantum, solid-state, water, and magnetic systems. However, it remains challenging and crucial to identify a single platform for observing their coexistence and evolution. Here, we describe a bilayer twisted moire elastic system as a controllable platform for the generation of skyrmion family members with distinct topological charges across different wave systems. Our experimental results further reveal that the twist angle induces a synergistic evolution between lattice symmetry and topological characteristics, enabling the mutual transformation and stable coexistence of different skyrmion family members within a single system. More importantly, we demonstrate that such a platform supports the discontinuous transport of Lamb-wave-induced topological textures, revealing phason-like dynamics within the quasiperiodic structure. This work opens a new avenue for designing all-in-one topological wave devices.

Conclusion: 扇形传感器集群是一种有效的损伤定位方法，具有较高的应用价值。

Abstract: Plate structures are widely used in large-scale engineering fields such as aerospace, hull manufacturing, and construction. However, the plate structure is easily damaged during long-term service or when it is impacted by foreign objects. Such a damage may lead to serious safety accidents. Beamforming and L-shaped sensor cluster (LSSC) localization method can be used to locate the damage on the plate. However, when using beamforming or LSSC localization method to locate the damages on plate-like structures, there exists blind area. In this paper, by combining the beamforming and LSSC localization method, a fan-shaped sensor cluster is proposed through arranging five sensors in a fan shape, which can effectively reduce the blind areas. The positions of damages on the plate can be accurately detected by using two groups of fan-shaped sensor clusters and one sensor for transmitting the excitation signal. The feasibility of the fan-shaped sensor cluster localization method is verified through numerical simulations and experiments, and the results are compared with those obtained by using the T-shaped sensor cluster. The results show that the fan-shaped sensor cluster can more accurately identify the damages at different positions. Both simulation and experimental results indicate that the fan-shaped sensor cluster can improve the accuracy of damage location.

Abstract: This paper shows a fundamental thermodynamic similarity between thermoelectric and photovoltaic energy converters which, at open circuit, can be represented as isochoric engines generating a finite chemical potential which appears as voltage at the terminals of the device. We show that, allowing for the temperature variation of the Seebeck coefficient, the maximum energy efficiency is intrinsically lower than the Carnot efficiency, as assumed in most of the literature, although more sophisticated strategies may exist to recuperate this loss. At finite current, further losses can be modelled in terms of finite-time thermodynamics.

Abstract: We demonstrate that Dirac fermions in 2+1 dimensions, coupled to Abelian gauge fields in multiply-connected regions, exhibit a parity anomaly that directly manifests as Aharonov-Bohm (AB) type topological phases. Using the Fujikawa method, we show that this anomaly reproduces both the AB phase and the spin-dependent Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase. We explicitly calculate the induced topological currents, establishing that their characteristic divergence-free form provides a direct signature of this parity-anomalous topological phase.

Abstract: We construct the higher spin wave functions in the embedding space of anti-de Sitter Lorentzian spacetime. These wave functions are built from a primary wave functions that has a simple structure expressed in terms of the special conformal generator vector fields in AdS. We compute the eigenvalue of the quadratic Casimir for the symmetric traceless states, and show explicitly that these satisfy the higher spin wave equation. We also demonstrate that these wave functions have the right structure in the flat space limit for massive higher spin fields, and can be used to construct $in$ and $out$ states for scattering processes. Spinning states that become massless in the flat limit are extremely subtle. The problem can be isolated to longitudinal polarizations.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show that holography imposes strong and general constraints on scalar field potentials in the string landscape, determined by the asymptotic structure of the underlying spacetime. Applying these holographic consistency conditions, we identify broad classes of scalar potentials that are incompatible with a well-defined dual description. These include potentials with extended plateaus, excessively steep or shallow asymptotics, certain zero crossings, and specific alignments of stable AdS minima in moduli space. In particular, making the standard assumption that the CFT dual to a stable AdS vacuum must be realized as a worldvolume theory of a brane in string theory, we show that the brane selects an infinite-distance limit in moduli space where parametric scale separation is forbidden. Furthermore, the steepness and positivity of the potential are restricted in that infinite distance direction. We also find that requiring the validity of the effective theory in the future vacuum, a natural holographic criterion, automatically enforces the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) for classical cosmological solutions with positive potentials. Taken together, these constraints exclude the leading proposals to realize scale-separated AdS vacua and metastable de Sitter vacua in the string theory landscape such as DGKT and KKLT.

Abstract: Gravitational waves propagating across gravitational potentials undergo lensing effects that, in the wave-optics regime, manifest as frequency-dependent amplitude and phase modulations. In this work, we revisit the diffraction integral formalism of gravitational lensing and demonstrate that it admits a natural and transparent interpretation within the framework of scattering theory. We establish a direct correspondence between the lensing amplification factor and the scattering amplitude of waves propagating in curved spacetime, clarifying how familiar lensing limits map onto distinct scattering regimes. In particular, we show that the diffraction integral matches exactly the eikonal limit of the scattering amplitude at lowest post-Minkowskian order, after a change in coordinates and the inclusion of finite-distance effects. We further extend the standard formalism by including subleading corrections to the post-Minkowskian and eikonal approximations. Our results provide a unified theoretical framework for the interpretation of lensed gravitational-wave signals and open the way to more accurate waveform modeling for future lensed observations.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解复杂度的几何结构和它们之间的关系提供了新的理论视角，并为更深入的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We establish a direct correspondence between Krylov and Nielsen complexity by choosing the Krylov basis to be part of the elementary gate set of Nielsen geometry and selecting a Nielsen complexity metric compatible with the Krylov metric. Up to normalization, the Krylov complexity of a Hermitian operator then equals the length squared of a straight-line trajectory on the manifold of unitaries that connects the identity operator with a precursor operator. The corresponding length provides an upper bound on Nielsen complexity that saturates whenever the straight line is a minimal geodesic. While for general systems we can only establish saturation in the limit of small precursors, we provide evidence that in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model there is a precise correspondence between Krylov complexity and (the square of) Nielsen complexity for a finite range of precursors.

Abstract: The textbook N=1 supergravity has an F-term potential depending on a superpotential $W(z_i)$ and a Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$, with the scalar potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})=e^K (|DW|^2 - 3 |W|^2)$. In this approach, it is not always easy to find the potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ with the required properties. We show that in supergravity with a nilpotent superfield and with any Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i} )$ one can obtain any desired potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ by a proper choice of the Kahler metric of the nilpotent superfield. This construction is particularly suitable for cosmological and particle physics applications, which may require maximal freedom in the choice of kinetic terms and scalar potentials.

Method: I don't follow the technical details. I follow a high-level description, which is technical in its nature.

Result: The paper is quite rich and detailed and provides a mechanism or solution to the problem of low-energy expansions of string amplitudes, producing elliptic modular forms.

Conclusion: Yes, the paper is mathematically rich and explains a fascinating mechanism in string theory, but it's difficult for me to grasp the detailed technical aspects.

Abstract: The low-energy expansion of genus-one string amplitudes produces infinite families of non-holomorphic modular forms after each step of integrating over a point on the torus worldsheet which are known as elliptic modular graph forms (eMGFs). We solve the differential equations of eMGFs depending on a single point $z$ and the modular parameter $τ$ via iterated integrals over holomorphic modular forms which individually transform inhomogeneously under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$. Suitable generating series of these iterated integrals over $τ$, their complex conjugates and single-valued multiple zeta values (svMZVs) are combined to attain equivariant transformations under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ such that their components are modular forms.
  Our generating series of equivariant iterated integrals for eMGFs is related to elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) through a gauge transform of the flat Calaque-Enriquez-Etingof connection. By converting iterated $τ$-integrals to iterated integrals over points on a torus, we arrive at an explicit construction of single-valued eMPLs where all the monodromies in the points cancel. Each single-valued eMPL depending on a single point $z$ is found to be a finite combination of meromorphic eMPLs, their complex conjugates, svMZVs and equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. Our generating series determines the latter two admixtures via so-called zeta generators and Tsunogai derivations which act on the two generators $x$, $y$ of a free Lie algebra and where the coefficients of words in $x,y$ define the single-valued eMPLs.

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了在更大的超引力框架中，通过一致截断获得较小子理论的条件和可能性。特别地，这种截断虽然导致的不变群并不包含在N=8超对称群中，但仍能生成有效的非平凡的子理论。这些结果为研究超引力的截断结构及其在各种物理模型中的应用提供了新的理论框架和数学工具。

Abstract: A new family of $D=4$ $\mathcal{N}=8$ gauged supergravities is introduced, consisting in a mixture of Scherk-Schwarz and dyonic CSO gaugings that involves the trombone scaling symmetry. A specific theory in this class is shown to admit supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacua, argued to be related to various wrapped M5-brane configurations. The mass spectrum of these vacua within our maximal theory is computed, extending previous results in smaller gauged supergravity models, and shown to exhibit some exotic features due to the trombone gauging. These vacua are obtained as solutions of certain subsectors of our $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity. Such subsectors in turn arise by consistent truncation of the parent maximal supergravity to the invariant fields under specific groups that are not contained in the $\mathcal{N}=8$ gauge group. Prompted by these and other similar subtruncations recently considered, we formalise the conditions that allow any maximal supergravity to be truncated consistently to invariant subsectors thereof when the invariance group is not necessarily contained in the $\mathcal{N}=8$ gauge group.

Abstract: We use the Tomonaga-Schwinger (TS) formulation of quantum field theory to determine when state-dependent additions to the local Hamiltonian density (i.e., modifications to linear Schrodinger evolution) violate relativistic covariance. We derive new operator integrability conditions required for foliation independence, including the Frechet derivative terms that arise from state-dependence. Nonlinear modifications of quantum mechanics affect operator relations at spacelike separation, leading to violation of the integrability conditions.

Abstract: We explain why on certain five-manifolds, topological 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ gauge theory of Haydys-Witten twist with gauge group $G$, is dual to that of Geyer-Mülsch twist with gauge group $^LG$, where $G$ is a real, compact Lie group with Langlands dual $^LG$. In turn, via their 2d and 3d gauged A/B-twisted Landau-Ginzburg model interpretations, we can show that (i) a Fukaya-Seidel-type $A_\infty$-1-category of an HW$_4$-instanton Floer homology of three-manifolds and (ii) a Fueter-type $A_\infty$-2-category of an HW$_3$-instanton Floer homology of two-manifolds, are dual to (i) an Orlov-type $A_\infty$-1-category of a novel $^LG_{\mathbb{H}}$-flat Floer homology of three-manifolds and (ii) a Rozansky-Witten-type $A_\infty$-2-category of a novel $^LG_{\mathbb{O}}$-flat Floer homology of two-manifolds, respectively. We also derive their Atiyah-Floer-type correspondences to symplectic categories. Our work, which demonstrates a mirror symmetry and Langlands duality of (higher) $A_\infty$-categories of Floer homologies, therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and gauge-theoretic generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [1] and Doan-Rezchikov [2], and more.

Abstract: We explore several aspects of the categorical symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) in two-dimensional Rational Conformal Field Theories (RCFTs) and express it directly in terms of the modular data of the theory. Motivated by the SymTFT construction of arXiv:2409.02806, we provide a general formula for SREE that applies to symmetric (weakly/strongly) and cloaking boundary conditions as well as for fusion rings with multiplicities. We check the formula against several explicit examples. Additionally, we study symmetry resolution for both categorical and invertible symmetries in (non-)diagonal RCFTs and comment on the subtleties that arise in these cases. Finally, we extend our analysis to diagonal non-unitary RCFTs, focusing on theories with generalized Haagerup-Izumi modular data, and find full agreement with the given formula.

Abstract: In de Sitter (dS) holography, both the dS/CFT correspondence and the dS static patch holography have been extensively studied. In these two holographic frameworks, the dual field theories are defined on spacelike and timelike boundaries, respectively, where the inward motion of the holographic boundary into the bulk corresponds to the $T\bar{T}$ and $T\bar{T}+Λ_2$ deformations in the respective dual field theories. In this work, we develop a unified framework for these two dS holographic models by introducing a composite flow that incorporates both $T\bar{T}$ and $T\bar{T}+Λ_2$ deformations. We propose that this composite flow corresponds to the inward motion of a spacelike boundary from the asymptotic infinity of dS spacetime, traversing the cosmological horizon and approaching the worldline of a static observer. This proposal is supported by the computation of the quasi-local energy and the holographic entanglement entropy within the dS static spacetime and its extened geometry.

Abstract: In this work, we compute the graviton mediated scattering amplitude of a massive spin-2 Fierz-Pauli field with various other massive spin fields, and in the non-relativistic limit, find out the corresponding two-body gravitational potentials. The massive spin-2 field does not represent gravity here. Instead, the theory of gravity is taken to be the usual massless general relativity, and the massive spin-2 field is taken as a test quantum field coupled to gravity via the standard minimal prescription. We first compute the tree level 2-2 scattering of a massive spin-2 field with massive scalar, spin-1, and spin-1/2 fields with one graviton exchanges. Leading Newton potential, as well as the subleading spin or polarisation dependent terms at ${\cal O}(G)$ have been computed. We also consider the next to the leading order (${\cal O}(G^2)$) scattering of the massive spin-2 field with a massive scalar, and demonstrate the spin independent, spherically symmetric leading part of the two body gravitational potential. The present paper could be considered as an attempt to compute the gravitational potential in the context of a higher spin field theory.

Abstract: We study planar non-topological solitons in models with nonlinear potentials that are bounded from below. These models provide consistent completion for the classical consideration at any energy scale. The properties of our solutions indicate the kinematical stability, which is unachievable in the previously studied model with negative quartic self-interaction. Remarkably, our generalization preserves restoration of the full Schrödinger symmetry at low energies, including scale invariance (dilatation) and special conformal symmetry. Our numerical calculations and analytical approximations demonstrate that the details of non-relativistic regime are defined by the lowest nonlinear $U(1)$-invariant term.

Abstract: Using the harmonic superspace approach we construct the superconformal harmonic action for $\mathcal{N}=2$ Weyl supermultiplet. The fundamental objects of the theory are unconstrained analytic potentials $h^{++α\dotα}, h^{++α+}, h^{++\dotα+}, h^{(+4)}$, which distinguishes our construction among the previously known ones. An important role is played by the ``half-analyticity'' conditions introduced in arxiv:2407.08524 [hep-th]. The structure of the harmonic linearized $\mathcal{N}=2$ Weyl action to large extent repeats the structure of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ Maxwell action, which suggests a conjecture on the possible structure of the complete nonlinear $\mathcal{N}=2$ Weyl theory action in the harmonic superspace. We also provide a detailed study of the rigid superconformal properties of the proposed action and prove its invariance in both harmonic and chiral superspaces.

*Zoltan Bajnok,Apor Roth*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper compares the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model and the sine-Gordon model, focusing on their similarities and differences in the two-particle sector. Analytic comparisons are made at the free point, while numerical calculations are used for generic couplings. The trigonometric limit is studied analytically, and the non-relativistic limit encompasses several important models. The Bethe-Yang momentum quantization conditions are compared with exact finite-volume solutions, finding exact results in the rational and trigonometric cases but with finite-size corrections in the hyperbolic and elliptic cases, which differ between quantum field theories and many-body systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of integrable models and their properties is fundamental in theoretical physics, offering insights into both mathematics and physical systems. This paper delves into the comparison of two prominent models in integrable systems, aiming to shed light on their universal features and specific characteristics.

Method: The authors employ a dual approach, combining analytic methods for specific limits with numerical techniques based on the truncated Hilbert space method adapted for difference operators. This hybrid approach allows for a detailed and accurate analysis of the models under investigation, providing both theoretical and computational validations.

Result: The paper reveals that the Bethe-Yang momentum quantization conditions are exact in the rational and trigonometric cases but acquire finite-size corrections in the hyperbolic and elliptic cases. These corrections manifest differently in quantum field theories versus many-body systems, highlighting the nuanced behavior of these models under varying conditions.

Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model and the sine-Gordon model, offering new insights into their similarities and differences. It establishes exact results in key regimes and identifies critical finite-size effects in other scenarios, contributing to the broader understanding of integrable systems and their applications in theoretical physics.

Abstract: We compare the spectrum of the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model with the finite-size spectrum of the sine-Gordon model, highlighting both their similarities and differences. Our analysis focuses on the two-particle sector in the center-of-mass frame. At the free point, we carry out an analytic comparison, while at generic couplings we employ non-perturbative numerical calculations based on the truncated Hilbert space method adapted to difference operators. To benchmark this numerical approach, we first study the trigonometric limit, where analytic results are available. We then examine in detail the non-relativistic limit, which encompasses the rational, trigonometric, hyperbolic, and elliptic Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models. Finally, we compare the Bethe-Yang momentum quantization conditions, derived from infinite-volume scattering phases, with the exact finite-volume solutions. We find that these conditions hold exactly in the rational and trigonometric cases, but acquire finite-size corrections in the hyperbolic and elliptic cases, both for the relativistic model and its non-relativistic limit, however, these corrections are different in quantum field theories and in many body systems.

Motivation: The paper explores the connection between non-unitary WRT TQFT and topological twists in 3d 𝒩=4 supersymmetric theories, providing a deeper understanding of these structures in quantum topology.

Method: The authors use a combination of field theory constructions, specifically joining multiple T[SU(2)] theories, and analyze the resulting modular matrices to establish a link to WRT TQFT parameters.

Result: A concrete correspondence between parameters of the non-unitary TQFT and the WRT TQFT for a principal root of unity is established, up to a decoupled unitary TQFT.

Conclusion: The proposed duality bridges non-unitary and unitary TQFTs via a supersymmetric lens, enriching the connection between topology and quantum field theory.

Abstract: We propose a field theoretic realization of the non-unitary $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev Topological Quantum Field Theory(WRT TQFT). The WRT TQFT at the principal root of unity is unitary. It is known to be realized by $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Chern-Simons theory. However, the WRT TQFT at a non-principal root of unity is non-unitary. Its field theoretic realization has remained unclear. We propose that such a non-unitary TQFT arises from the topological twist of the 3-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 theory constructed by joining multiple $T[\mathrm{SU}(2)]$ theories. We construct its modular matrices and identify them with those of the WRT TQFT, establishing a concrete relation between the parameters, up to a decoupled unitary TQFT.

Abstract: We study soft photon emission during scattering of Faddeev-Kulish charged states in QED, at leading order in perturbation theory. The charged asymptotic particles are accompanied by clouds of an infinite number of soft photons of energy less than a characteristic infrared scale $E_d$. When the corresponding ``dressing'' functions are suitably corrected to subleading order in the soft momentum expansion, as advocated in recent work by Choi and Akhoury, we show explicitly that the emission of additional radiative soft photons with energy less than $E_d$ is completely suppressed. Moreover, the dressing renders the elastic amplitudes infrared-finite, order by order in perturbation theory, regulating the infrared divergences due to virtual soft photons, at the energy scale $E_d$. Therefore, the characteristic energy scale of the soft photons in the clouds provides an effective infrared cutoff, allowing for the formulation of an infrared finite S-matrix.

Abstract: Generalizing three-family chiral fermion conditions to $I_{ac}=-(3+h)$ and $I_{ac'}=h$, with positive integer $h$, we extend the landscape of three-family ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models in a broader region. Differing from the former investigation with $I_{ac}=-3$ and $I_{ac'}=0$, we do not restrict that the $a$ stack of D6-branes must be parallel to the orientifold image of the $c$-stack along one of the three two-tori. In this investigation, without the simple parallel construction, we find four new classes of supersymmetric Pati-Salam models that are allowed by the extended three generation condition with $I_{ac}=3, I_{ac'}=-6$ and $I_{ac}=-1, I_{ac'}=-2$ through the intersections of $a$- and $c/c'$-branes. Moreover, with the $SU(2)'_{L}$ gauge coupling realized from $SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$ symmetry breaking, the canonical normalization requirement of the gauge kinetic term provides an alternative approach that can be imposed before the renormalization group equation evolution for $SU(2)'_L$ gauge coupling. This turns out to be an effective mechanism to realize the string-scale gauge coupling relation, especially for the new supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with large $g_b/g_a$ ratio. We show that this symmetry-breaking modified renormalization group evolution can highly suppress $g_b/g_a$, and finally realizes string-scale gauge coupling relations for the extended supersymmetric Pati-Salam models as well.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose a new action for entanglement entropy in the framework of the AdS$_{3}$/CFT$_{2}$ correspondence. This action is constructed directly from the entanglement entropy of the CFT$_{2}$, and we show that the Einstein equations of AdS$_{3}$ gravity can be derived from it. In the near-coincidence limit, using Riemann normal coordinates, the action reduces to a string worldsheet action in a curved background that naturally includes the symmetric spacetime metric, an antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field, and a dilaton. The Kalb-Ramond field gives rise to a string charge density, from which we demonstrate that bit threads can be exactly reproduced. This correspondence provides a clear physical interpretation of bit threads. Exploiting this correspondence, we establish explicit relations between the emergent string worldsheet and the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface, providing new insights into entanglement entropy. In particular, entanglement entropy can be computed from open string charge, while Bekenstein-Hawking entropy arises from closed string charge through open-closed string duality. These results suggest a unified picture in which the Susskind-Uglum conjecture, open-closed string duality, and the ER=EPR proposal emerge as equivalent manifestations of the same underlying principle. Finally, we propose a quantization of the RT surface, pointing to a possible connection with loop quantum gravity that refines Wall's conjecture.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that specific worldline path integrals in theoretical physics exhibit supersymmetric localization via hidden symmetries, providing alternative derivations and computational methods for known results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding localization mechanisms in path integrals is crucial for simplifying complex calculations in quantum field theory and exploring new physical phenomena.

Method: The authors utilize a worldline BRST formulation to identify hidden fermionic symmetries, which lead to the localization of the path integrals. The method also incorporates modular invariance to compute the effective action in scalar QED.

Result: The paper derives a new proof of the Jacobi-Poisson formula for the harmonic oscillator and computes the Euler-Heisenberg effective action in scalar QED, including its imaginary part from instanton contributions.

Conclusion: This work opens a novel approach to path integral calculations by exploiting hidden supersymmetries, offering a deeper understanding of localization and exact results in quantum field theory.

Abstract: We show that two elementary worldline path integrals-the thermal partition function of the harmonic oscillator and the one-loop effective action of scalar QED in a constant field strength-exhibit a natural form of supersymmetric localization. The mechanism relies on hidden fermionic symmetries of the worldline BRST formulation, rather than on standard BRST structure or physical supersymmetry. These symmetries localize the target-space trajectory. For the harmonic oscillator this yields an alternative localization derivation of the Jacobi-Poisson formula. Moreover, after the trajectory is localized, the remaining proper-time integral exhibits an emergent zero-dimensional supersymmetry generated by modular invariance, allowing the modulus T itself to be localized. For scalar QED the same structure provides a controlled computation of both the real and imaginary parts of the Euler-Heisenberg effective action. In particular, the imaginary part arises from a moduli space of circular worldline instantons, offering a localization perspective on the semiclassical exactness of the Schwinger pair-production result observed by Affleck-Alvarez-Manton.

TL;DR: Diatomic molecules like MgF are key for quantum science due to their complex energy levels and strong dipole-dipole interactions. Achieving ultracold temperatures requires precise optimization of experimental parameters for laser slowing and magneto-optical trapping (MOT).

Abstract: To date, the laser cooling of rubidium atoms has inevitably relied on 780 nm cooling light corresponding to the first excited state $5\mathrm{P}_{3/2}$. Surprisingly, we demonstrate laser cooling directly utilizing 420 nm blue light for active optical clock, which corresponds to the high excited state $6\mathrm{P}_{3/2}$ of Rb atom. Experimentally, we successfully apply the 420 nm diffuse laser cooling technique to prepare a cold $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atomic cloud with a length of up to one meter, and measure the cold-atom absorption spectroscopy. The cold atom number is approximately $4.4\times10^{7}$. We systematically compare the cooling effects of 420 nm and 780 nm diffuse laser cooling, and verify the feasibility of blue light cooling using high excited state. This work directly employs blue light to cool and manipulate ground-state Rb atoms to the 6P excited state, providing a new and efficient approach for the cold-atom active optical clock. It is also expected to open up research directions and application prospects in frontier fields such as Rydberg atoms, ultracold quantum gases Bose-Einstein condensation, quantum information, and so on.

### [71] [Adiabatic passage of $^{205}$TlF with microwaves in a cryogenic beam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16626)
*Olivier Grasdijk,Jakob Kastelic,Jianhui Li,Oskari Timgren,Konrad Wenz,Yuanhang Yang,Perry Zhou,David Kawall,Tanya Zelevinsky,David DeMille*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: A method for efficiently transferring population between hyperfine states of TlF molecules using microwave-driven adiabatic passage in a spatially varying electric field is described. The method transfers population from $J=0$ to $J=2$ with a total efficiency of $0.97(8)$ through two sequential stages of adiabatic passage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the need for high-fidelity population transfer between specific rotational/hyperfine states of TlF molecules, which is a key requirement for the CeNTREX experiment aimed at searching for nuclear time-reversal symmetry violation.

Method: The method involves using microwave-driven adiabatic passage (AP) in a spatially varying electric field with two sequential stages. The first stage transfers population from $J=0$ to $J=1$ at a local field of $173~m{V/cm}$, and the second stage transfers population from $J=1$ to $J=2$ at $110~m{V/cm}$.

Result: The transfer efficiencies for the first and second stages of AP were $0.92(6)$ and $1.05(5)$, respectively. After considering residual population in excited rotational levels, the total efficiency of population transfer from $J=0$ to $J=2$ was $0.97(8)$.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a robust and high-fidelity method for preparing specific rotational/hyperfine states of TlF molecules, which can be applied in future studies of nuclear physics such as the CeNTREX experiment. The method shows promising potential for similar population transfer applications in other hyperfine systems.

Abstract: We present a hyperfine-resolved state preparation scheme for thallium fluoride (TlF) molecules based on microwave-driven adiabatic passage (AP) in a spatially varying electric field. This method enables efficient and robust population transfer between selected $\left|J,m_J=0\right\rangle$ hyperfine sublevels of the $X\,^1Σ^+_0$ ground state in a cryogenic molecular beam, a key requirement for the CeNTREX search for nuclear time-reversal symmetry violation. Two sequential stages of AP are implemented. The first transfers population from $J=0$ to $J=1$ at a local field of $173~\mathrm{V/cm}$, and the second transfers from $J=1$ to $J=2$ at $110~\mathrm{V/cm}$. Transfer efficiencies are quantified through laser-induced fluorescence, and accounting for residual population in excited rotational levels after a prior stage of rotational cooling. We achieve state transfer efficiencies of $0.92(6)$ and $1.05(5)$ for the first and second states of AP, respectively. This corresponds to a total efficiency of $0.97(8)$ for population transfer from $J=0$ to $J=2$. These results demonstrate robust and high-fidelity preparation of specific rotational/hyperfine states in TlF.

Abstract: We investigate a four-parameter entropic dark energy model in a spatially curved FLRW universe, based on a generalized entropy-area relation at the apparent horizon. While the proposed entropy function captures a broad class of gravitational entropy corrections, including Bekenstein-Hawking, Tsallis, and power-law forms, it does not encompass information-theoretic entropies such as Sharma-Mittal or Renyi. Within this framework, we derive exact analytical expressions for key cosmological observables, including the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, the dark energy density parameter $Ω_D(z)$, and the equation of state $w_D(z)$. A comprehensive parameter-space analysis reveals viable regions, particularly for $β> 1$ and small positive curvature, that accommodate elevated $H_0$ values consistent with recent SH0ES measurements. Our results offer a simple and analytically tractable alternative to conventional dynamical dark energy models, with potential relevance to the ongoing Hubble tension.

Abstract: The previously proposed modification of the standard (flat) inflationary $ΛCDM$ model in which the inflaton field(s) and ``dark energy" are replaced by the vacum in expanding Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker Universe is studied. The expanding joint vacuum of the all ingrediences of matter, including Standard Model particles and a dark matter sector, is treated as a thermal equilibrium state at temporal Gibbons-Hawking temperature, proportional to the Hubble parameter, and chemical potentials equal to particle masses. This theory provides not only the new mechanism of inflation and its graceful exit, but also explains acceleration of expansion for the late Universe. The formalism can be combined with the anomalous quantum gravity effects leading to a viable baryogenesis mechanism and certain bounds on dark matter particle masses and lifetimes.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在爱因斯坦-卡tele克理论中，基于德Donder-韦依哈密尔顿形式，考虑四维结构和Lorentz连接的独立变量，包含二次Riemann-Cartan修正项，引入FLRW背景，导出修正后的弗里德曼方程，并分析其解在辐射和物质主导时期的行为。假设$a(t)=βt^α$的形式生成多个解分支，许多解在全局和所有时间上被认为是'不物理的'。当$g_1=0$时，出现混合解$a(t)=Ct^αe^{Dt^β}$。当$g_1≠0$时，方程变为非线性，没有解析解。这些发现突出了幂律近似方法的局限性，并指出资uumian可以协调地推动宇宙膨胀的严格条件。

Motivation: 要理解爱因斯坦-卡tele克物质与引力相互作用的内在动力学行为，特别是在不同宇宙时期，需要深入分析修正后的弗里德曼方程的解。

Method: 使用德Donder-韦依哈密尔顿形式，将四阶张量作为独立变量，构建包含二次Riemann-Cartan修正项的哈密尔顿量，并在FLRW背景中求解修正后的弗里德曼方程。

Result: 幂律形式$a(t)=βt^α$生成多个解分支，许多解可能在全局时间范围内不符合实际。当$g_1=0$时，出现混合解$a(t)=Ct^αe^{Dt^β}$。当$g_1≠0$时，方程变为非线性，缺乏闭式解析解。这些发现表明幂律近似方法的局限，以及仅有特定条件下，torsion才可以协调地推动宇宙膨胀。

Conclusion: 这项研究说明，爱因斯坦-卡tele克理论中的动力学行为在使用幂律近似方法时存在局限性。只有在$torsion$消失的特殊情况下，才能获得合理的宇宙解。一般情况下，由于方程的复杂性，无法获得闭式解，进一步研究表明，$t^orsion$的主导作用受限于特定条件。这些结果提供了理解宇宙膨胀过程的新视角，并可能拓宽爱因斯坦-卡tele克理论的应用范围。

Abstract: We investigate torsion-driven cosmological dynamics within the framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity using the De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian formalism, where the tetrad and Lorentz connection act as independent variables and the Hamiltonian includes quadratic Riemann Cartan corrections. Embedding this theory in an FLRW background, we derive the corresponding torsion-modified Friedmann equations and analyze their solutions across radiation and matter-dominated epochs. The commonly assumed power law form $a(t)=βt^α$ is shown to generate multiple solution branches, many of which can be considered to be 'unphysical', atleast to hold true globally, for all times. A hybrid solution, $a(t)=Ct^αe^{Dt^β}$ emerges in the special case $g_1=0$, where the quadratic Riemann-Cartan term vanishes. For $g_1\not=0$, the equations become nonlinear, precluding closed-form analytic solutions. These findings highlight the limitations of the power-law approximation and identify the restricted conditions under which torsion can coherently drive cosmic expansion.

Abstract: We introduce SpectralPINN, a hybrid pseudo-spectral/physics-informed neural network (PINN) solver for Kerr quasinormal modes that targets the Teukolsky equation in both the separated (radial/angular) and joint two-dimensional formulations. The solver replaces standard neural activation functions with Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind and supports both soft -- via loss penalties -- and hard -- enforced by analytic masks -- implementations of Leaver's normalization. Benchmarking against Leaver's continued-fraction method shows cumulative (real+imaginary part) relative frequency errors of $\sim 0.001\%$ for the separated formulation with hard normalization, $\sim 0.1\%$ for both the soft separated and soft joint formulations, and $\sim 0.01\%$ for the hard joint case. Exploiting our ability to solve the joint equation, we add a small quadrupolar perturbation to the Teukolsky operator, effectively rendering the problem non-separable. The resulting perturbed quasinormal modes are compared against the expected precision of the Einstein Telescope, allowing us to constrain the magnitude of the perturbation. These proof-of-concept results demonstrate that hybrid spectral-PINN solvers can provide a flexible pathway to quasinormal spectra in settings where separability, asymptotics, or field content become more intricate and high accuracy is required.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the statistical mechanics within the polymer quantization framework in the semiclassical regime. We apply a non-canonical transformation to the phase space variables. Then, we use this non-canonical transformation to calculate the deformed density of states of the $2n$-dimensional phase space, which encompasses all polymer effects. In the next step, some thermodynamic features of a system of $n$-dimensional harmonic oscillators are studied by computing the deformed partition function. The results show that the number of microstates decreases because there is an upper bound on the momentum within the polymer framework. We found that in the high-temperature regime, when the thermal de Broglie wavelength is close to the Planck length, $n$ degrees of freedom of the system are frozen in this setup. In other words, there is an effective reduction in space dimensions from $n$ to $\frac{n}{2}$ in the polymeric framework, which also signals the fractional dimension for odd-dimensional oscillators.

### [78] [Friedmann equations from GUP-modified equipartition law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15871)

TL;DR: The paper modifies the equipartition law of energy using thermodynamic principles and the quadratic GUP, derives new Friedmann equations in entropic gravity, and shows that these equations lead to a universe without an initial singularity, supported by non-singular curvature results. The authors also discuss baryogenesis and constrain the GUP parameter from observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the early universe's evolution and properties such as singularity and curvature without resorting to singularities or inflating scenarios is a key motivation. Exploring GUP's role in cosmology and baryogenesis provides insights into quantum gravity and cosmic structure.

Method: Combined thermodynamic arguments with the quadratic GUP to modify the equipartition law, derived new Friedmann equations, studied their implications, and compared with braneworld scenarios and computed deceleration parameters. Constraints were placed using observed data.

Result: Obtained modified Friedmann equations with implications for a non-singular universe, similarity to braneworld models, evidence for maximum energy density and Hubble parameters, and a mechanism for baryogenesis.

Conclusion: The paper presents a modified gravity framework within entropic gravity that avoids singularities, incorporates GUP effects, and links to cosmology and baryogenesis, opening new avenues in quantum gravity research.

Abstract: In this paper, combining the thermodynamical arguments of the horizon with the quadratic generalised uncertainty principle (GUP), we heuristically obtain the modified equipartition law of energy. Employing this modified equipartition law of energy, we derive the Friedmann equations in Verlinde's entropic gravity. We find a maximum energy density at the beginning of the Universe. Remarkably, this feature emerges not only for positive GUP parameter but also for negative GUP parameter. From the initial acceleration, we deduce that the negative GUP parameter is more preferable. We also obtain maximum Hubble parameter from the first Friedmann equation, indicating a universe without initial singularity. Moreover, we compute the Kretschmann curvature scalar, again indicating a non-singular universe. Interestingly, we find that GUP-modified Friedmann equations share some similarities with braneworld cosmolgy where the quadratic term in energy density appears. We also compute the deceleration parameter. Finally, we revisit the gravitational baryogenesis and show that the GUP-modified equipartition law of energy provides a mechanism for generating baryon asymmetry. Moreover, we constrain the GUP parameter from observations.

Abstract: Ten years ago, the first direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the merger of two black holes, GW150914, provided the very first opportunity to test Einstein's general theory of relativity (GR) in the extreme gravity regime, where the gravitational field is strong, characteristic speeds are highly relativistic, and spacetime is dynamical. Such a regime is currently accessible only through coalescing compact binaries. In this review, we summarize the status of testing GR with GW observations and discuss the lessons learned. We also touch upon the challenges we currently have in testing GR and the potential path forward to detect a credible violation of GR, should one exist in the data.

TL;DR: =this thesis presents the first formalization of spin networks into finite-dimensional zx-diagrams, deriving mixed-dimensional zx-forms, rules for the penrose spin calculus, and a new definitive graphical language for canonical loop quantum gravity (c-lqg). they also explore a matrix-like normal form for spin networks using the psc. the construction provides calculational tools that recover known results from lqg while offering intuitive graphical reasoning. the techniques expand the computational language of lqg and open new avenues to perform computations in and beyond canonical lqg.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: loop quantum gravity aims to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity by quantizing spacetime geometry. the mathematical complexity of lqg makes direct calculations difficult, and current tools for c-lqg are less effective compared to the covariant formulation. this thesis addresses these limitations by introducing a new graphical language based on finite-dimensional zx-calculus, which not only formalizes spin networks but also provides a flexible framework for handling changing graph structures in c-lqg calculations. the development of mixed-dimensional zx-forms and a matrix-like normal form opens new possibilities for simplifying and advancing c-lqg computations.

Method: the thesis begins by formalizing spin networks into finite-dimensional zx-diagrams. it derives the mixed-dimensional zx-forms representing the generating objects of spin networks and establishes the rules for the penrose spin calculus. they then construct a new graphical language, the psc, and explore its matrix-like normal form. throughout, they leverage the zx-calculus' diagrammatic methods and categorical reasoning to provide intuitive graphical representations and computational tools for lqg calculations. their methods are validated through the successful derivation of known results and the presentation of new graphical rules for spin network operations.

Result: the key results of this thesis are the first formalization of spin networks into finite-dimensional zx-diagrams, the derivation of mixed-dimensional zx-forms for spin network generating objects, and the introduction of a novel matrix-like normal form for spin networks. they also establish a new graphical language, the psc, which is shown to be a more intuitive and flexible tool for c-lqg calculations compared to existing methods. these outcomes provide a significant advancement in the calculational toolkit for loop quantum gravity, particularly in the canonical formulation, and pave the way for future research in lqg by offering a more intuitive and versatile language.

Conclusion: in conclusion, this thesis makes a substantial contribution to loop quantum gravity by introducing a new graphical language—the psc—that integrates algebraic and diagrammatic methods. by translating spin networks into finite-dimensional zx-diagrams and developing a matrix-like normal form, they provide a more accessible and powerful framework for performing calculations in c-lqg. the construction not only recovers existing results but also suggests new avenues for research in lqg. the psc represents a definitive advancement in the language of loop quantum gravity and offers a promising tool for future computations in this field.

Abstract: Loop quantum gravity (LQG) attempts to unify general relativity with quantum physics to offer a complete description of the universe by quantising spacetime geometry, but the numerical calculations we encounter are extraordinarily difficult. Progress has been made in the covariant formulation of LQG, but the tools do not carry over to the canonical formulation. These tools are graphical by nature, describing space with spin networks to make calculations in LQG more intuitive to the human hand.
  Recently, a new notation for working with spin networks has been used by arXiv:2412.20272 to offer the first accurate numerical results in canonical LQG by allowing the underlying graphs to change throughout the calculation, though they are forced to concede visual intuitiveness. In this thesis, we offer a more radical rephrasing of spin network calculations by translating them into the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus, extending previous attempts to translate into the standard (qubit) ZX-calculus (arXiv:2111.03114). Specifically, we derive the mixed-dimensional ZX-diagrams representing the generating objects of spin networks and the rules for the Penrose Spin Calculus (arXiv:2511.06012), and use these to present the ZX-form and correctness of "loop removal". We also derive the forms for several fundamental LQG objects in the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus for the first time. This gives us a high-level, intuitive graphical language that retains a flexibility to handle changing graph structures, and thus we argue positions the PSC as the new definitive language for canonical LQG.
  Furthermore, we investigate the possibility for a matrix-like normal form for spin networks deriving from a novel perspective of the PSC in terms of W-nodes.

We compute the grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections for different choices of the parameters using the partial wave method , and verify the latest correspondence between grey-body factors and quasinormal modes. The results show that larger values of the non-commutativity parameter $θ$ and the coupling constant $η$ introduced in this model lead to smaller absorption cross-sections. Furthermore, we find that this correspondence is accurate for non-commutative black holes in the limit of large angular momentum quantum number $l$.

Abstract: This work investigates neutrino propagation in the spacetime of a newly introduced black hole arising from spontaneous Lorentz-symmetry breaking in bumblebee gravity. The analysis focuses on three independent components: the rate at which neutrino-antineutrino annihilation deposits energy in the surrounding region, the geometric contribution to the phase accumulated by neutrino mass eigenstates, and the modifications to flavor conversion produced by weak gravitational lensing. Working with a two-flavor system, both mass orderings are examined, and the calculation incorporates the interference between distinct trajectories reaching the detector. The numerical results show that the Lorentz-violating deformation substantially increases the efficiency of the annihilation channel, produces characteristic shifts in the oscillation phase not present in earlier bumblebee configurations, and reshapes the angular dependence of the lensing-induced flavor transition pattern.

Abstract: We explore and compare two distinct temperature definitions for scalar field inflation in the context of small- and large-field potentials. The first is based on a real gas, fluid-like temperature, $T_{RG}$, while the second corresponds to a relativistic species-like temperature, $T_{RS}$. We derive the fundamental thermodynamic relations for both and analyze their implications for the most viable inflationary potentials, consistent with Planck constraints. We also investigate non-minimally coupled scenarios, finding that $T_{RS}$ is the most self-consistent choice, as it decreases during inflation, satisfies standard thermodynamic laws, and exhibits frame-independent behavior in both the Jordan and Einstein frames. Remarkably, the $T_{RS}$ approach shows that the inflaton's dynamics is well-described by Van der Waals-like isotherms, linking inflationary evolution to thermodynamic phase transitions. We find that the onset of inflation is associated with a phase transition acting as the ``trigger'' of the inflationary epoch. Our analysis highlights inconsistencies in the hilltop potential and, more generally, in small-field potentials unless a non-minimal coupling is introduced. Conversely, the Starobinsky and $α$-attractor models emerge as the most suitable paradigms. We further show that \emph{frame independence} is achieved only for coupling values $ζ\leq 1/6$, supporting very small values. Finally, our study of natural inflation with non-minimal coupling reveals a strong dependence on the coupling parameter, where bounds associated with thermodynamic phase transitions coincide with observationally viable ranges, suggesting that thermodynamic considerations may provide an additional criterion to discriminate among inflationary scenarios.

Abstract: The non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor in $f(R,T)$ gravity can be interpreted as an effective manifestation of dissipation. Motivated by this, we propose a new formulation of $f(R,T)$ gravity based on the Herglotz variational principle, which extends the usual {Hamilton} variational principle to dissipative systems by allowing the Lagrangian to depend explicitly on the action. The resulting gravitational field equations extend those of $f(R,T)$ gravity by including Herglotz contributions. In the Newtonian limit, these contributions modify the gravitational potential, allowing us to constrain the Herglotz vector through Mercury's perihelion precession and the relativistic light deflection. Remarkably, the Herglotz corrections lead to a scaling law consistent with observations from the Cassini spacecraft. Examining two representative cosmological models, the Herglotz vector effectively reduces to a single function that, under suitable conditions, can play the role of a cosmological constant, providing an alternative mechanism for the Universe's accelerated expansion. Within the Herglotz variational approach, the linear $f(R,T)=R+αT$ model, previously ruled out in the standard formulation due to its fixed deceleration parameter, becomes consistent with observations.

Abstract: This paper presents and investigates non-Gaussian perturbations for the warm k-inflation model that is driven by pure kinetic energy. The two complementary components of the overall non-Gaussianity are the three-point and four-point correlations. The intrinsic non-Gaussian component, denoted as the nonlinear parameter f_{NL}^{int}, is rooted in the three-point correlation for the inflaton field. Meanwhile, the δN part non-Gaussianity, denoted as f_{NL}^{δN}, is the contribution attributed to the four-point correlation function of the inflaton field. In this paper, the above two components in warm k-inflation are individually computed and analyzed. Then, comparisons and discussions between them are conducted, and the non-Gaussian theoretical results are compared with experimental observations to determine the range of model parameters within the allowable range of observation.

Abstract: A maximun acceleration analysis by Pati dating back to 1992 is here improved by replacing the traditional Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) with the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), which predicts the existence of a minimum length in Nature. This new approach allows one to find a numerical value for the maximum acceleration existing in Nature for a physical particle that turns out to be a_{max}\simeq4\frac{c^{2}}{l_{P}}, that is, a function of two fundamental physical quantities such as the speed of light c and the Planck length l_{p}. An application of this result to black hole (BH) physics allows one to estimate a new quantum limit to general relativity. It is indeed shown that, for every real Schwarzschild BH, the maximum gravitational acceleration occurs, without becoming infinite, when the Schwarzschild radial coordinate reaches the gravitational radius. This means that quantum corrections to general relativity become necessary not at the Planck scale, as the majority of researchers in the field think, but at the Schwarzschild scale, in agreement with recent interesting results in the literature. In other words, the quantum nature of physics, which in this case manifests itself through the GUP, appears to prohibit the existence of real singularities, in this current case forbiddiing the gravitational acceleration of a Schwarzschild BH from becoming infinite.

Abstract: We investigate a non-separable subset of $k$-essence in which the kinetic and potential sectors interact through an $X^ρV(φ)$ coupling, implemented via a potential-dependent prefactor $f(φ)=1+2\mathcal{K}V$. In slow roll, this structure preserves a constant sound speed $c_s^2=1/(2ρ-1)$ while modifying the Hubble flow in a controlled way, thereby shifting the inflationary observables relative to the separable template. For monomial potentials $V=Aφ^n$ (with $n=2$ and $n=2/3$ as representative cases) we derive closed analytic expressions for $n_s(N_\ast)$ and $r(N_\ast)$ to $\mathcal{O}(ε_{\rm mix}^2)$, where $ε_{\rm mix}\propto\mathcal{K}$ encodes the non-separable $X^ρV$ mixing, and we validate them against exact background integrations. The analytic and numerical predictions agree at the sub-per-mille level for $n_s$ and at the percent level for $r$, confirming the accuracy of the small-mixing expansion. For $\mathcal{K}<0$ the mixing systematically lowers both $n_s$ and $r$ at fixed $N_\ast$, allowing otherwise marginal monomials to fall within the region favored by recent ACT+{\it Planck}+BAO constraints (P--ACT--LB). All solutions shown satisfy the health conditions $f(φ)>0$, $ρ>\tfrac12$, and the positivity bound $V<1/(2|\mathcal K|)$ (from $f>0$). We also discuss parameter dependence and the expected equilateral-type non-Gaussianity, which remains comfortably within current bounds for the benchmarks considered.

Abstract: We uncover a cascade of exceptional points (EPs) in the quasinormal mode spectrum of massive scalar perturbations of Kerr black holes, revealing an intricate non-Hermitian structure underlying their linear response. The cascade originates from a single damped mode that enters the extremal spectrum for sufficiently large field masses. We obtain evidence for an infinite sequence of EPs in the $(\ell,m)=(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$ sectors near the extremal limit, mediating the transition between damped and zero-damping modes. Each EP carries a geometric phase that enables adiabatic mode mixing across the entire overtone spectrum, a phenomenon we refer to as adiabatic ergodicity.

Abstract: Allostery, the intriguing phenomenon of long-range communication between distant sites in proteins, plays a central role in biomolecular regulation and signal transduction. While it is commonly attributed to conformational rearrangements, the underlying dynamical mechanisms remain poorly understood. The contact cluster model of allostery [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 10731] identifies localized groups of highly correlated contacts that mediate interactions between secondary structure elements. This framework proposes that allostery proceeds through a multistep process involving cooperative contact changes within clusters and communication between distant clusters, transmitted through rigid secondary structures. To demonstrate the validity and generality of the model, this Perspective employs extensive molecular dynamics simulations ($\sim 1\,$ms total simulation time) of four different photoswitchable PDZ domains and studies how different domains, ligands and perturbations influence both the contact clusters and their dynamical evolution. These analyses reveal several recurring clusters that represent shared flexible structural modules, such as loops connecting $β$-sheets, and show that the characteristic timescales of the nonequilibrium protein response can be directly associated with the motions of individual contact clusters. Thus, the dynamic decomposition of PDZ domains into contact clusters uncovers a modular, dynamics-based architecture that underlies and facilitates long-range allosteric communication.

Abstract: Quantum interference underpins many quantum information protocols but is typically studied in lossless Hermitian systems. Here, we reveal an exceptional point induced phase transition in two photon Hong Ou Mandel interference within a lossy coupled waveguide system. In the PT symmetric phase. interference is ultrasensitive to coupling strength, yielding sharp bunching antibunching switches. In the PT broken phase. it becomes robust oscillation free and propagation independent with coincidence probability stably tunable via coupling. These regimes enable enhanced quantum sensing and reliable two photon control for robust quantum information processing.

### [91] [A low-energy effective Hamiltonian for Landau quasiparticles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15938)
*Pierre-Louis Taillat,Hadrien Kurkjian*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: A renormalization scheme for Fermi fluids that introduces an energy cutoff to construct Landau quasiparticles by dressing particles through a unitary transformation, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian governing low-energy dynamics. The scheme unifies interaction function f and collision amplitude into a single regularized amplitude 𝓐. The effective theory captures low-energy physics of Fermi fluids, including equation of state and transport properties in both normal and superfluid phases. Applied to an atomic Fermi gas with contact interactions, the theory computes the speed of zero sound as a function of the scattering length a and recovers the Gork'ov-Melik-Barkhudarov correction to the superfluid gap and critical temperature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the desire to better understand the low-energy behavior of interacting Fermi fluids, particularly the formation and properties of Landau quasiparticles in different phases such as normal and superfluid states. The use of an energy cutoff as a renormalization scheme suggests an effort to handle divergences or singularities in the interactions while preserving physical insights relevant to low-energy phenomena.

Method: The method involves introducing an energy cutoff Λ to regularize quasi-resonant couplings in the theory. A unitary transformation is applied to dress the particles into quasiparticles, effectively removing quasi-resonant interactions beyond the cutoff. The dynamics of the quasiparticles are restricted to low-energy transitions, governed by an effective Hamiltonian that combines the Landau interaction function f and the collision amplitude into a single amplitude 𝓐 regularized by Λ. This process captures the essential low-energy physics of Fermi fluids supporting Landau quasiparticles.

Result: The effective theory developed in the paper successfully captures the low-energy physics of Fermi fluids, including the equation of state and transport properties, in both normal and superfluid phases. Specifically, it computes the speed of zero sound in an atomic Fermi gas with contact interactions as a function of the scattering length a. Additionally, the theory recovers the Gork'ov-Melik-Barkhudarov correction to the superfluid gap and critical temperature, which are key features of superfluid helium. These results validate the proposed renormalization scheme and its ability to describe low-energy phenomena in Fermi fluids.

Conclusion: The research presents a novel renormalization scheme for Fermi fluids that constructs Landau quasiparticles through an energy cutoff and a unitary transformation. The effective Hamiltonian derived from this scheme unifies the interaction function and collision amplitude, providing a comprehensive description of low-energy physics in both normal and superfluid phases. The theoretical predictions regarding the speed of zero sound and the superfluid gap corrections are in agreement with known results, demonstrating the validity and applicability of the proposed method to studying interacting Fermi fluids.

Abstract: We introduce a new renormalisation scheme to construct the Landau quasiparticles of Fermi fluids. The scheme relies on an energy cutoff $Λ$ which removes the quasi-resonant couplings, enabling the dressing of the particles into quasiparticles via a unitary transformation. The dynamics of the quasiparticles is then restricted to low-energy transitions and is fully determined by an effective Hamiltonian which unifies the Landau interaction function $f$ and the collision amplitude in a single amplitude $\mathcal{A}$ regularized by $Λ$. Our effective theory captures all the low-energy physics of Fermi fluids that support Landau quasiparticles, from the equation of state to the transport properties, both in the normal and in the superfluid phase. We apply it to an atomic Fermi gas with contact interaction to compute the speed of zero sound in function of the scattering length $a$. We also recover the Gork'ov-Melik Barkhudarov correction to the superfluid gap and critical temperature as a direct consequence of the dressing of particles into Landau quasiparticles.

*Christoph Grüner*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of considering surface roughness in Geant4 simulations for rare event experiments like dark matter or neutrinoless double beta decay detection. It introduces SCoRe4, a library that simulates realistic surface roughness, improving accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. SCoRe4 is open-source and easy to integrate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of particle interactions, especially in rare events, requires precise simulation of detector components, such as surface roughness. Traditional methods are insufficient due to simplifications, leading to potential inaccuracies in predictions. Thus, creating a library like SCoRe4 to accurately model surface roughness is crucial for these experiments.

Method: The paper describes the implementation of SCoRe4, a Geant4-based library, which models surface roughness using experimentally measurable parameters. It generates patches of surface geometries across various scales from mm² to m² while maintaining efficiency. The library is open-source and can be integrated into existing Geant4 setups. The methodology includes defining surface roughness parameters, generating surface structures, and integrating these into Geant4 simulations.

Result: SCoRe4 successfully simulates realistic surface roughness, improving the accuracy of background modeling in rare event physics. Simulations with SCoRe4 showed better alignment with experimental expectations, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing simulation accuracy. The open-source nature of SCoRe4 also lowers the barrier for other researchers to implement similar improvements in their setups.

Conclusion: SCoRe4 addresses a significant limitation in Geant4 simulations by accurately modeling surface roughness, thereby enhancing the precision of background modeling in rare event experiments. The library is efficient, open-source, and easy to integrate, making it a valuable tool for improving simulation accuracy in related fields.

Abstract: Surface simulations are important for accurately modeling particle interactions in experiments where background contributions from surface contaminants can significantly affect detector performance. In rare event searches, such as dark matter or neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, standard Geant4 simulations typically assume perfectly smooth surfaces, neglecting the microscopic roughness that exists in real materials. This simplification can lead to inaccurate predictions of energy deposition. To address this limitation, I developed SCoRe4, a Geant4-based library designed to simulate more realistic surface roughness based on experimentally measurable parameters. The code allows users to generate patches of simplified rough surface geometries across a wide range of scales - from square millimeters to square meters - while maintaining computational efficiency. SCoRe4 is open source and can be easily integrated into existing Geant4 setups. This work presents the structure, implementation, and example application of SCoRe4,as well as its potential use in improving the accuracy of background modeling in rare event physics.

Abstract: The Nab (Neutron a b) experiment is designed to measure the beta-antineutrino angular correlation in free neutron $β$ decay with an ultimate precision goal of 0.1%, providing input for tests of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix unitarity. This measurement is performed via detection of electrons and protons in delayed coincidence using custom large-area segmented silicon drift detectors. We present the characterization of one such detector system to establish the proton energy and timing response, using a dedicated proton accelerator. The detected proton peak was studied for 25 keV, 30 keV, and 35 keV incident protons on a set of detector segments and multiple cooling cycles over a one year period. Ionization losses were consistent with models of the detector dead layer with thicknesses less than 100nm. The detected proton peak was stable within the uncertainty from energy calibration (0.2 keV). The rise times of detector pulses from $^{109}$Cd and $^{113}$Sn conversion electron sources were used to extract the impurity density profile and establish a precise model for the detector timing response. The observed impurity density profile varied from $(2 \pm 2) \times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ at the center to $(26 \pm 2) \times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ at the edge. This impurity density profile was then used to characterize systematic effects in proton time-of-flight measurements due to detector pulse-shape effects; the resultant proton timing systematic uncertainties were below 0.3 ns, which is sufficient for the Nab experiment.

Abstract: Muon tomography is a non-destructive imaging technique that uses cosmic-ray muons to probe dense materials. A plastic scintillating fiber (SciFi) detector with a one-dimensional SiPM array offers a compact, high-resolution solution. However, scaling up the detector area and spatial resolution demands reducing the number of readout channels while maintaining detector performance. To address this challenge, this work presents a multiplexing scheme based on a diode-based symmetric charge division circuit combined with a position-encoding algorithm. Circuit simulations confirm the feasibility of the multiplexing design and guide the selection of suitable diodes to preserve SiPM signal integrity. Electronic tests show that the proposed design exhibits low crosstalk among electronic channels, and preserves linearity over a dynamic range spanning a few to several hundred photoelectrons. Cosmic-ray measurements further demonstrate that the multiplexed SciFi detector achieves a detection efficiency above 95\% and a spatial resolution of about 0.65~mm, with only minor degradation compared to direct readout. These results verify that the proposed method offers a scalable and cost-effective readout solution for large-area muon tomography systems.

Abstract: Dual-phase liquid xenon time projection chambers are the core detector elements of many experiments that conduct searches for Dark Matter and rare events, as well as in neutrino and high-energy physics. As part of this detector technology, high-voltage electrodes are instrumental for the generation of observable signals and their physical interpretation. Thus, electrode design and manufacturing has to fulfill stringent requirements, and their production is associated with significant engineering challenges. In this work we describe the successful development of electrodes on the 1.5 m-scale, from their design and simulation to subsequent assembly and high-voltage testing in a gaseous argon environment. The produced electrodes were recently installed as an anode and a cathode during an upgrade to the XENONnT experiment.

Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.

Abstract: Gauge theories are important descriptions for many physical phenomena and systems in quantum computation. Automorphism of gauge group naturally gives global symmetries of gauge theories. In this work we study such symmetries in gauge theories induced by automorphisms of the gauge group, when the gauge theories have nontrivial topological actions in different spacetime dimensions. We discover the automorphism symmetry can be extended, become a higher group symmetry, and/or become a non-invertible symmetry. We illustrate the discussion with various models in field theory and on the lattice. In particular, we use automorphism symmetry to construct new transversal non-Clifford logical gates in topological quantum codes. In particular, we show that 2+1d $\mathbb{Z}_N$ qudit Clifford stabilizer models can implement non-Clifford transversal logical gate in the 4th level $\mathbb{Z}_N$ qudit Clifford hierarchy for $N\geq 3$, extending the generalized Bravyi-König bound proposed in the companion paper [arXiv:2511.02900] for qubits.

Abstract: We apply the numerical linked cluster expansion (NLCE) to study thermodynamic properties of the proximate Kitaev magnet $α$-RuCl$_3$ on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of a magnetic field. Using the extended spin-1/2 $J$-$K$-$Γ$ model and based on documented exchange and magnetoelastic coupling parameters, we present results for the internal energy, the specific heat, and the magnetization. Moreover, the linear magnetostriction coefficient perpendicular to the plane is calculated, which is sensitive to changes of the in-plane spin-spin correlations. We find the magnetostriction to display a dip-like feature, in line with the temperature dependent and field-driven suppression of magnetic order in $α$-RuCl$_3$. Our results are consistent with previous findings, establishing NLCE also as a tool to study magnetoelastic features of quantum magnets.

Abstract: We study the extended Hubbard model (EHM) with both onsite Hubbard interaction and the intersite density-density interaction between nearest-neighbors using the standard Hartree mean-field approximation (MFA) on the Bethe lattice. We found that, at the ground state, the system can be in a charge-ordered insulating (COI), a charge-order metallic (COM) or a non-charge-ordered (NO) state. Moreover, the finite-temperature phase diagrams are presented. Several observables like a charge-order parameter, a spectral function, and particularly at finite temperatures, a charge carrier concentration (to visualize the degree of metallicity) are analyzed. The results show that increasing onsite repulsion suppresses charge order and change the properties of the system from insulating to metallic. Worth noting, that a number of phenomena can be found within the MFA, where their analysis is much simpler than in more advanced approaches. The method used for the EHM on the Bethe lattice also allows for a series of analytical derivations and simplification to see general geometry-independent features and analytical results, avoiding the numerical inaccuracies and other issues that appear with a purely numerical solution.

Abstract: The band structure of elementary excitations of skyrmion crystal in thin ferromagnetic film with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and uniaxial magnetic anisotropy under external magnetic field is studied. In the absence of anisotropy there is a topological transition in the spectrum of skyrmion crystal: the gap between breathing and counter-clock-wise modes closes, which is accompanied by changes of Berry curvature sign of these bands. In this work we demonstrate that such topological transition exists in some range of the uniaxial anisotropy values. We present a phase diagram showing that the value of the field of topological transition is higher in the easy-plane domain and lower in the easy-axis domain of anisotropy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding frustrated magnetism in the honeycomb lattice is crucial for advancing concepts of magnetic ordering and phase transitions in low-dimensional systems.

Method: Combination of generalized Schwinger boson mean-field theory (g-SBMFT) and exact diagonalization techniques was employed to study the emergence of the double-zigzag phase.

Result: The double-zigzag (dZZ) phase emerges due to an order-by-disorder mechanism within a narrow range of the $J_3/|J_1|$ ratio.

Conclusion: This finding corroborates theoretical predictions and suggests the potential observation of quantum spin liquid or related exotic states in the dZZ phase.

Abstract: The cobalt-based honeycomb magnet BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ (BCAO) has recently emerged as a promising platform for studying frustrated magnetism beyond conventional paradigms. Neutron-scattering experiments and first-principles calculations have revealed an unexpected double-zigzag (dZZ) magnetically ordered ground state, whose microscopic origin remains under active debate. Here, we investigate the emergence of such dZZ phase in a ferro-antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_3$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, using a generalized Schwinger boson mean-field theory ($g$-SBMFT) that treats ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions on equal footing. Based on $g$-SBMFT and exact-diagonalization (ED) techniques, we find that the dZZ is selected by an order-by-disorder mechanism in a narrow $J_3/|J_1|$ range, in agreement with recent density-matrix renormalization-group calculations. The magnetic excitation spectra within the dZZ phase displays a distinctive smearing out in momentum space due to quantum fluctuations which may be probed through inelastic neutron-scattering experiments.

Abstract: A side-coupled Majorana zero mode in Kondo systems realizes a simple yet nontrivial hybridization that profoundly alters the low-energy physics, making such setups promising candidates for detecting Majorana zero modes. Recently, we demonstrated that the low-energy behavior of this system can be captured by a spin-charge-entangled screening process with an \(A\otimes N\) boundary condition. Here, we investigate the evolution of both the screening cloud and the boundary condition in the presence of competing terms that could break either the spin-charge-entangled \({\rm SU}_{\bf L}(2)\) rotation symmetry or the topological degeneracy. We introduce a temperature-dependent spatial integral of the screening cloud, which can be obtained from the numerical renormalization group. This quantity serves as a proper observable that unambiguously captures the properties of the screening process across temperatures. A clear crossover from conventional Kondo spin screening to spin-charge-entangled screening is observed. Taking into account the overlap between Majorana zero modes, the \(A\otimes N\) boundary condition reduces to a normal one, yet the spin-charge-entangled screening is protected by the \({\rm SU}_{\bf L}(2)\) symmetry. On the other hand, perturbation that breaks the \({\rm SU}_{\bf L}(2)\) symmetry can destroy the screening singlet, while leaving the low-temperature \(A\otimes N\) boundary condition intact.

Abstract: Quadratic band touching in fermionic systems defines a universality class distinct from that of linear Dirac points, yet its characterization as a quantum critical point remains incomplete. In this work, I show that a $(d+1)$-dimensional free-fermion model with quadratic band touching exhibits spatial conformal invariance, and that its equal-time ground-state correlation functions are exactly captured by the $d$-dimensional symplectic fermion theory. I establish this correspondence by constructing explicit mappings between physical fermionic operators and the fields of the symplectic fermion theory. I further explore the implications of this correspondence in two spatial dimensions, where the symplectic fermion theory is a logarithmic conformal field theory with central charge $c=-2$. In the corresponding $(2+1)$-dimensional systems, I identify anyonic excitations originating from the underlying symplectic fermion theory, even though the Hamiltonian is gapless. Transporting these excitations along non-contractible loops generates transitions among topologically degenerate ground states, in close analogy with those in topologically ordered phases. Moreover, the action of a $2π$ rotation on these excitations is represented by a Jordan block, reflecting the logarithmic character of the associated conformal field theory.

Method: 通过构建基于两个独立守恒量的非阿贝尔算符规模基底，研究了算符规模的演化，并探讨了算符的复杂性和简单性与算符角动量之间的关系。

Result: 发现角度动量较大的算符更加简单，而角度动量较小的算符则相对复杂。算符的增长由角度动量的减小驱动，并可通过出时序无序算符纠缠进行探测。通过构造一个基于位移的ħxd的不变模型，推导出精确的经典主方程来描述算符规模分布和展开分布随系统大小的变化。

Conclusion: 得出算符规模的分布遵循卡方分布，两个守恒量共同决定了时间和形状特征。单粒子算符在所有时间点都表现出在大角动量下发散的峰值。

Abstract: We show that operator dynamics in U(1) symmetric systems are constrained by two independent conserved charges and construct a non-Abelian operator size basis that respects both, enabling a symmetry-resolved characterization of operator growth. The non-Abelian operator size depends on the operator's nonlocal structure and is organized by an SU(2) algebra. Operators associated with large total angular momentum are relatively simple, while those with small angular momentum are more complex. Operator growth is thus characterized by a reduction in angular momentum and can be probed using out-of-time-ordered correlators. Using the charge-conserving Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, we derive an exact classical master equation that governs the size distribution, the distribution of an operator expanded in this basis, for arbitrary system sizes. The resulting dynamics reveal that the size distribution follows a chi-squared form, with the two conserved charges jointly determining the overall time scale and the shape of the distribution. In particular, single-particle operators retain a divergent peak at large angular momentum throughout the time evolution.

Conclusion: 研究者的结果表明，跨层相互作用在分数量子霍尔效应的研究中至关重要，在单层分析中忽略了这些效应可能导致了不完全理解。通过引入 Drsr 方法，他们提供了更精确的分析工具，以理解更复杂的量子效应。

Abstract: The observation of fraction quantum Hall states in twisted MoTe2 has sparked a lof of interest in this phenomenon. Most theoretical works to date rely on the brute-force exact diagonalization which is limited to the one partially occupied band. In this work, we present strong evidence that the effect of higher lying bands cannot be ignored due to strong interband interactions. To tackle these effects, we introduce a non-perturbative driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG) method, originally developed for problems in quantum chemistry. We apply this methodology to twisted MoTe2 at fractional hole fillings of ν = 1/3 and 2/3 across a spectrum of twist angles. Our results show that at ν = 1/3, the many-body excitation energy gaps are substantially reduced compared to the one-band treatment. For ν = 2/3, we find that the dynamic correlations stemming from interband interactions stabilize fractional Chern insulating phases at larger twist angles, consistent with the experimental findings. By examining the correlated orbitals and their single-particle topological features, we demonstrate that this stabilization at higher twist angles arises predominantly from the dynamic correlations, rather than conditions on the single-particle quantum geometric tensor.

Conclusion: 因此，通过 spring 畸变方法诱导出双子层材料的轴向磁场，可以有效实现电荷密度波和磁性有序状态。

Abstract: Starting from the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model on {10,3} and {14,3} hyperbolic lattices that, for a uniform hopping amplitude, gives rise to emergent Dirac fermions on a curved space with a constant negative curvature, displaying a vanishing density of states, we propose spatially modulated hopping pattern therein that preserve the underlying 5- and 7-fold rotational symmetries, respectively, and effectively couples fermions to time-reversal symmetric axial magnetic fields. Such strain-induced axial fields produce a flat band near zero-energy, triggering nucleation of a charge density-wave, featuring a staggered pattern of fermionic density between two sublattices, and the Haldane phase fostering intra-sublattice circulating currents with a net zero magnetic flux for weak nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. Sufficiently weak on-site Hubbard repulsion destabilizes such flat bands toward the formation of a magnetic phase that simultaneously supports antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders in the whole system. While the magnetization in the bulk and boundary cancel each other, the Neél order is of the same sign everywhere, thereby yielding a global antiferromagnet. Throughout, we draw parallels between these findings and the well-studied qualitatively similar results on a 3-fold rotational symmetric strained honeycomb lattice, thereby unifying the phenomenon of axial magnetic catalysis for Dirac fermions, encompassing the ones living on the Euclidean plane. Finally, we show that with a specific class of non-Hermiticity, manifesting via an imbalance in the hopping amplitudes between two sublattices in the opposite directions, magnitudes of all these orders can be boosted substantially when all the eigenvalues in the noninteracting systems are real, staging a non-Hermitian amplification of axial magnetic catalysis.

TL;DR: 文章提出了一个周期性驱动物的Hermitian修改后玻色安德森Kitaev链，展示了丰富的非Hermitian Floquet拓扑现象。研究了两个模型案例：第一个是最小的拓扑非平凡模型，包含非Hermitian 边缘效应、拓扑零模式和π模式；第二个是一个更复杂的模型，支持可调节的零模式和π模式。在引入 onsite玻色子频率和空间无序性等扰动后，这两个模型表现出不同的响应。主要结论是，这种周期性驱动物可以为探索非Hermitian Floquet拓扑相提供研究起点。


<details>

Motivation: 随着材料科学和量子技术的发展，拓扑相变和 Floquet 拓扑现象成为当前研究热点，探索新的拓扑模型对于理解这些现象具有重要意义。

Method: 本文通过构建两个具体的模型案例来研究非Hermitian Floquet拓扑现象。第一个模型是最小拓扑非平凡模型，第二个模型是更复杂的可调节模式支持模型。通过改变 onsite玻色子频率和空间无序的程度，分析了系统表现出的响应差异。

Result: 研究发现，尽管在两种模型中都存在拓扑边模式，但在引入不同类型的扰动后，其 Robustness和敏感性表现不同。特别是非Hermitian 边缘效应能够被 onsite玻色子频率和空间无序相互抑制或重新激发，而在第二个模型中该特性变得不那么敏感。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了周期性驱动物 bosonic Kitaev链作为研究非Hermitian Floquet拓扑相的Hermitian体系基础的可能性，为未来的研究提供了新的方向和思路。

Abstract: We propose a class of periodically driven (Hermitian) modified bosonic Kitaev chains that effectively hosts rich nonHermitian Floquet topological phenomena. Two particular models are investigated in details as case studies. The first of these represents a minimal topologically nontrivial model in which nonHermitian skin effect, topological zero modes, and topological $π$ modes coexist. The other displays a more sophisticated model that supports multiple topological zero modes and topological $π$ modes in a tunable manner. By subjecting both models to perturbations such as a finite onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder, these features exhibit distinct responses. In particular, while generally all topological edge modes are robust against such perturbations, the nonHermitian skin effect is easily suppressed and revived by, respectively, the onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder in the first model, but it could be insensitive to both perturbations in the second model. Our studies thus demonstrate the prospect of a periodically driven bosonic Kitaev chain as a starting point in exploring various nonHermitian Floquet topological phases through the lens of a Hermitian system.

Abstract: We investigate the role of van-Hove singularities (VHS) in a system's electronic band structure on the formation and properties of excitons and trions. We consider (i) the different parameters of a Mexican-hat-type dispersion of the valence band, which hosts a VHS at the band edge, and (ii) the presence of regular VHS or higher-order VHS (HOVHS). We find that for a given spin-degenerate Mexican-hat-shaped valence band, where a trion and exciton can form, trion formation becomes more favourable as the Mexican-hat dispersion becomes narrower. Also, we show that if the electronic band structure contains an HOVHS, then both the exciton and trion dispersion will also contain such a singularity. Therefore, a HOVHS in the valence band can suitably change the density of states (DOS) of the bound-state particle and lead to the generation of new states, which could impact the optical properties of the system. Our work provides a pathway to how 2D quantum materials, which host such singularities, can be engineered to favour a particular bound-state thus opening new avenues for these materials into potential applications.

Abstract: Electrons bound to the surface of liquid helium are an emerging quantum computing platform, offering the potential for highly mobile spin qubits that can be manipulated using CMOS-fabricated devices. Here, as a step toward realizing this technology, we demonstrate selective two-dimensional shuttling of electrons across a helium film condensed on the surface of a CMOS control chip. The electrons are moved in packets containing, on average, several tens down to single electrons. We perform CCD-style electron shuttling in any of 128 transport microchannels, each of which links electron storage zones and sensing zones in the 2D plane. Shuttling sequences can be repeated at least 10$^9$ times with no detectable electron loss. The device serves as a prototype quantum information processing platform that is readily scalable to control large monolithically integrated arrays of single electron spins.

Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect shows great promise for realization of the ohm without the need for an external magnetic field. The most mature material platform is magnetically doped topological insulators. In these materials, precise quantization is limited to low temperatures, with the activation energy for dissipative transport typically in the range of 1 K. One potential source of dissipative transport is non-chiral edge states. These states are expected to be present in sufficiently thick samples. In this work, we perform extensive Hall and non-local resistance measurements in a Hall bar geometry at 2 K. By comparing 15 independent transport measurements to different transport models, we find that the system behavior is well-described by a simple continuum Ohm's law model. The addition of non-chiral edge states into the model does not significantly improve the fitting, and we conclude that there is not strong evidence for these states. We discuss the implications of our results for the prospect of high temperature quantized anomalous Hall effect in these materials.

Abstract: Here, we investigate the spin waves in room-temperature van der Waals ferromagnet $(\rm Fe_{0.78}Co_{0.22})_{5}GeTe_{2}$ by utilizing Brillouin light scattering technique. The spin wave dispersion in flakes of different thicknesses shows the key role of dipolar interaction in the spin waves of vdW ferromagnets, and the non-reciprocity of spin wave in thick flakes is observed, which is attributed to the bulk Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction after excluding the influence of dynamic dipolar interaction. The measured bulk DMI parameter D is 0.08 $\rm mJ/m^2$, which is double that of pure $\rm Fe_5GeTe_2$. Our work shows that Co-doped $\rm Fe_5GeTe_2$ is a promising platform for investigating propagating spin wave and topological spin textures at room temperature.

Abstract: We introduce and systematically investigate a new class of topological magnetic textures, skyrmionium meta-matter, composed of skyrmioniums (Skm, $Q=0$) and skyrmions (Sk, $Q=-1$) arranged in periodic lattices mimicking the richness of atomic materials. Pure skyrmionium lattices are unstable against elongation distortions and relax into the spiral phase, but even a small fraction of skyrmions acts as topological "pins" that stabilize diverse mixed Skm--Sk crystals. We classify these states by topological stoichiometry (Skm$_n$Sk$_m$) and show that each composition hosts multiple metastable polymorphs with distinct plane-group symmetries. Structural transformations between polymorphs are achieved by varying the lattice spacing, suggesting experimental control via pressure or strain. The collective spin dynamics is explored for both in-plane and out-of-plane AC magnetic fields. The resulting absorption spectra show resonant modes beyond the two rotational and one breathing mode of conventional skyrmion lattices. We identify hybrid excitations unique to Skm--Sk crystals, including (i) deformation-assisted rotations, where skyrmions acquire polygonal shapes and rotate, and (ii) orbital modes, where breathing skyrmioniums induce circular motion of confined skyrmions without changing their size. Mode frequencies span sub-GHz to above 10 GHz, consistent with exchange and DMI energy scales. Our results establish skyrmionium-based meta-matter as a versatile platform for tunable, topologically heterogeneous magnetic lattices with rich structural and dynamical properties, paving the way for reconfigurable magnonic and spintronic applications.

Abstract: We describe a simple quantum dot that consists of two crossed troughs. As such there is no potential well; nonetheless this geometry gives rise to a bound state, centred around the point at which these troughs cross one another. In this paper we review existing numerical methods to solve this problem, and highlight one which we feel is particularly elegant and, in this case, provides the most accurate solution to the problem. The bound state is well-contained on the scale of the trough width, and yields a bound state energy of $0.659606$ in units of the minimum continuum state energy. This method also motivates a simple variational solution which yields the lowest energy known to date ($0.6812$ in the same units) to arise out of an analytical variational solution.

Abstract: Two-dimensional antiferromagnetism has long attracted significant interest in many areas of condensed matter physics, but only recently has experimental exploration become feasible due to the isolation of van der Waals antiferromagnetic monolayers. Probing the magnetic phase diagram of these monolayers remains however challenging because established experimental techniques often lack the required sensitivity. Here, we investigate antiferromagnetism in atomically thin van der Waals magnet NiPS3 using magnetotransport measurements in field-effect transistor devices. Temperature-dependent conductance and magnetoresistance data reveal a distinct magnetic behavior in monolayers as compared to thicker samples. While bilayer and multilayer NiPS3 exhibit a single magnetic phase transition into a zig-zag antiferromagnetic state driven by uniaxial anisotropy, monolayer NiPS3 undergoes two magnetic transitions, with a low-temperature phase governed by in-plane hexagonal magnetic anisotropy. The experimentally constructed phase diagram for monolayer NiPS3 matches theoretical predictions from the six-state clock and 2D-XY models incorporating hexagonal anisotropy.

Abstract: The quantum geometry tensor, intrinsic geometric characteristics of electronic states, plays a crucial role in the various nontrivial electromagnetic phenomena in quantum materials. Here, we reveal that quantum geometry significantly modifies phonon dichroisms through electron-phonon interactions in solids that break time-reversal and spatial inversion symmetries. Specifically, the circular phonon dichroism is primarily dominated by the heat magnetic moments, while the linear phonon dichroism depends on the heat Drude weight, a thermal analog of band Drude weight. Furthermore, we establish the f-sum rule for the heat magnetic moment that facilitates its experimental detections. We demonstrate our key findings in an archetypal model system: ferromagnetic two-dimensional electron gases with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Our work uncovers the quantum-geometric origin of common phonon dichroisms and predicts the detectable signature of the heat magnetic moment of electrons in solids.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal vortices are polychromatic modes that intertwine orbital angular momentum (OAM) in space and time. Here we introduce a new class of such vortices, spatiotemporal plasmonic vortices (STPVs), carrying nontrivial topological spin textures. They are generated by chronotopic interference of temporally delayed plasmonic eigen-vortices, where a $π$-phase dislocation in the space-frequency domain maps into a 2$π$ spiraling phase in space-time, with the resulting focus-defocus dynamics emulate U(1) gauge transitions. Using interferometric time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy (ITR-PEEM), we directly image their nanometer-attosecond (nano-atto) evolution and control vortex number and position. Quantum-path analysis of coherent two-photon photoemission (2PP) processes reveals the nonlinear plasmonic polarization fields and angular-momentum conservation, establishing STPVs as a platform for probing spatiotemporally structured quantum matter.

Abstract: Precise and ultrafast control of electronic band structures is a central challenge for advancing quantum functional materials and devices. Conventional approaches--such as chemical doping, lattice strain, or external gating--offer robust stability but remain confined to the quasi-static regime, far from the intrinsic femto- to picosecond dynamics that govern many-body interactions. Here, using cryogenic transient reflectance spectroscopy, we realize dynamic bandgap engineering in the anisotropic topological insulator $α$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$ with unprecedented micro-electron-volt ($μ$eV) precision. The exceptional sensitivity arises from the cooperative action of long-lived topological carriers, stabilized by restricted bulk-to-edge scattering phase space, together with symmetry-resolved coherent phonons that modulate inter-chain hopping. These channels jointly modify Coulomb screening and interband transitions, enabling both gradual and oscillatory control of the electronic structure. Supported by first-principles and tight-binding theory, we further demonstrate a dual-pump coherent control strategy for continuous, mode-selective tuning of electronic energies with $μ$eV accuracy. This framework paves the way for ultrafast on-demand band-structure engineering, pointing toward new frontiers in quantum optoelectronics, precision measurement in molecular and biological systems, and attosecond control of matter.

Motivation: Understanding strain effects in moiré superlattices is crucial for advancing materials science, as it allows manipulation of electronic properties for potential applications in electronics and quantum computing.

Method: The review begins with linear elasticity theory, applies it to different types of strain (uniaxial, shear, biaxial), and extends the analysis to twisted and strained moiré materials. It also discusses special geometries and evaluates various strain techniques.

Result: The study reveals how different strain states lead to predicted geometries, emphasizing the effectiveness of strain manipulation in achieving desired material properties.

Conclusion: This review offers a thorough framework for understanding and implementing strain in moiré materials, highlighting recent advancements and future research directions in the field.

Abstract: The experimental observations of many interaction-driven electronic phases in moiré superlattices have stimulated intense theoretical and experimental efforts to understand and engineer these correlated physics. Strain is a powerful tool for manipulating and controlling the geometrical and electronic structures of moiré superlattices. This review provides a comprehensive introduction to the geometry of strained moiré superlattices. First, starting from the linear elasticity theory, we briefly introduce the general formalism of small deformations in two-dimensional materials, and discuss the particular cases of uniaxial, shear and biaxial strain. Then, we apply the theory to twisted and strained moiré materials, mainly focusing on the hexagonal homobilayers, hexagonal heterobilayers and monoclinic lattices. Special moiré geometries, like the quasi-unidimensional patterns, square patterns and hexagonal, are theoretically predicted by manipulating the strain and twist. Finally, we review recently developed strain techniques and the special moiré geometries realized via these approaches. This review aims at equipping the reader with a robust understanding on the description and implementation of strain in moiré materials, as well as highlight some major breakthroughs in this active field.

Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices extend crystallinity into curved space, where negative curvature and exponentially large boundaries reshape collective excitations beyond Euclidean intuition. In this Letter, we push the study beyond scalar fields by exploring vector fields on hyperbolic lattices. Using phonons as an example, we show that the Goldstone theorem breaks down for vector fields in hyperbolic lattices. In stark contrast to Euclidean crystals, where the Goldstone theorem ensures that acoustic phonon modes are gapless, hyperbolic lattices with coordination number $z > 2d$ exhibit a finite bulk phonon gap. We identify the origin of this breakdown: the Goldstone modes here belong to nonunitary representations of the translation group and therefore cannot form gapless excitation branches. We further show that when boundaries are included, this bulk spetrum gap is filled by an extensive number of low-frequency boundary modes.

Abstract: The Simmons model is a well-known and widely used model for the elastic tunneling current of a metallic tunnel junction, and fitting it to electrical measurements can be used to estimate thicknesses and heights of the tunnel barriers. We present here an improvement of the Simmons model, deriving new more accurate analytical formulas for the tunneling current density and conductance at finite voltage and temperature. We demonstrate that our conductance-voltage formulas are much closer to the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation than the Simmons model and its commonly used simplified parabolic approximation. In addition, we demonstrate the practical use of our model, by fitting it to experimental tunnel junction conductance-voltage data and showing a sizeable difference from the Simmons model.

Conclusion: Γ^0非线性电导率并非由哈密顿量唯一决定，而与系统与其环境的耦合方式密切相关。

Abstract: The theory of the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect, a key probe of quantum geometry, is plagued by conflicting expressions for the conductivity that is independent of the dissipation strength (rate, $Γ^0$). We clarify the origin of this ambiguity by demonstrating that the "intrinsic" response is not universal, but is inextricably linked to the dissipation mechanism that establishes the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). We establish a benchmark by solving the exact NESS density matrix for a generic Bloch system coupled to a featureless fermionic bath. Our exact $Γ^0$ conductivity decomposes into two parts: (i) a geometric contribution, $σ^{\text{geo}}$, whose form recovers the intraband quantum metric dipole ($\sim\partial_k g$), providing an exact derivation that clarifies inconsistencies in the literature, and (ii) a novel, purely kinetic contribution, $σ^{\text{kin}} \propto v^3 f^{(4)}_0$, which is absent when dissipation is modeled by white-noise disorder (e.g., a constant-$Γ$ Green's function model). The discrepancy in $σ^{\text{kin}}$ between these distinct physical mechanisms is a proof that the $Γ^0$ nonlinear conductivity is not a unique property of the Bloch Hamiltonian, but is contingent on the physical system-bath coupling.

Abstract: Magnetostatic surface spin wave (MSSW) solitons hold great promise for magnonic information processing, but their existence has long been debated. In this work, we resolve this issue by advanced time-resolved Brillouin light scattering (TR-BLS) spectroscopy. We observe long-period MSSW soliton trains in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films by demonstrating their quasiparticle behavior, mode beating, and periodic modulations. We reveal that the MSSW soliton originates from the dipole gap mechanism with a unique comb-like frequency spectrum caused by the four-magnon process. By varying the microwave power, we find significant changes in soliton periods linked to the spin wave dispersion renormalization. Additionally, we report exotic transverse solitons across the YIG thickness. These findings deepen the understanding of nonlinear physics, and pave the way for spin-wave-soliton-based information technologies.

Abstract: Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity once the Zeeman energy exceeds the pairing gap, unless mechanisms such as unconventional pairing, strong spin-orbit coupling, or intrinsic magnetism intervene. Several graphene platforms realize such mitigating routes, exhibiting superconductivity resilient to magnetic fields. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene that is both induced and stabilized by in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\parallel}$), with critical fields far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The superconductivity spans a wide gate range and emerges from a sharp zero-field resistive ridge that tracks approximately constant conduction band filling. The presence of zero-field superconductivity and the evolution of the critical temperature with $B_{\parallel}$ are highly gate sensitive. We also observe a weak superconducting diode effect in several distinct regimes within the superconducting phase, including nearby to an integer quantum anomalous Hall state generated by a boron nitride moiré superlattice, indicating a potential coexistence of valley imbalance and superconductivity. These results establish several intriguing new properties of spin-triplet, field-induced superconductivity in a thick rhombohedral graphene stack.

Abstract: We explore the non-reciprocal intracell hopping mediated non-Hermitian topological phases of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model hosting second-nearest-neighbour hopping. We microscopically analyze the phase boundaries using the non-Bloch momentum while the off-critical (critical) phases are directly associated with the gapped (gapless) nature of the non-Bloch bands that we derive from the characteristic equation using the gauge freedom. The non-Bloch momentum accurately reflects the bulk boundary correspondence (BBC) explaining the winding number profile under open boundary conditions. We examine the adiabatic dynamics to promote the concept of adiabatic charge transport in a non-Hermitian scenario justifying the BBC in spatio-temporal Bott index and non-Bloch Chern number. Once the non-Bloch bands experience no (a) gap-closing during the evolution of time, quantized flow of is preserved (broken). Our study systematically unifies the concept of non-Bloch bands for both static and driven situations.

Abstract: We study interlayer excitons in MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayers, by combining lateral force microscopy and micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy. This allows us to correlate the spatial profile of the moiré superlattice with the distribution of optically active states accessible to interlayer excitons. In heterostructures where a few degrees twist angle is imposed between the MoSe and WSe crystallographic axes, we show that a continuous moiré lattice is realized across areas close to the optical diffraction limit. In such regions, the photoluminescence reduces to a few narrow-band lines only, energetically distributed consistently with the geometry of the moiré lattice. This correlation reveals that interlayer excitons explore a controlled periodic confinement, paving the way towards implementations of Bose-Hubbard models.

Abstract: The dynamics and spectroscopy of the small (H$_2$COO) and large (CH$_3$CHOO) Criegee intermediates (CIs) in the gas phase, inside/on water droplets, on amorphous solid water (ASW) and in bulk water are investigated using validated energy functions. For both species, facile diffusion between surface and inside positions for water droplets are found whereas on amorphous solid water at low temperatures (50 K) no surface diffusion is observed on the multiple-nanosecond time scale. This is at variance with other species, such as CO or NO on ASW. The infrared spectroscopy of both CIs in contact with an aqueous environment leads to shifts of the spectral features on the order of a few to a few tens of cm$^{-1}$, depending on the vibrational mode considered. This is consistent with Stark-induced spectral shifts for small molecules in protein environments. However, the spectroscopy of both CIs in contact with water droplets does not depend on the positioning relative to the droplet (inside vs. surface).

Abstract: We analyze an ensemble-based approach for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in atomistic neural networks. This method generates an epistemic uncertainty signal without requiring changes to the underlying multi-headed regression neural network architecture, making it suitable for sealed or black-box models. We apply this method to molecular systems, specifically sodium (Na) and aluminum (Al), under various temperature conditions. By scaling the uncertainty signal, we account for heteroscedasticity in the data. We demonstrate the robustness of the scaled UQ signal for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) behavior in several scenarios. This UQ signal also correlates with model convergence during training, providing an additional tool for optimizing the training process.

Abstract: The detection and discrimination of molecular chirality are essential for advancing pharmaceutical and biological applications. While nanophotonic platforms offer a route to enhance chiral light-matter interactions, existing device concepts for chiral sensing remain heuristic, resulting in limited chiral enhancement and control over chiral hotspot placement within nanostructures. Here, we introduce an inverse-design framework that directly optimizes superchiral near fields in photonic nanostructures and demonstrate its powerful opportunities for enantioselective analysis. We first show that freeform achiral metasurfaces can be optimized to achieve an 800-fold chiral density enhancement, with fully customizable chiral hotspot placement for direct molecular interaction. We further demonstrate ultrasensitive detection of chiral analytes and achieve a 116-fold increase in detection sensitivity over the native enantiomeric response. Lastly, we extend our platform to determine chiral-molecule concentration and resolve enantiomeric excess in chiral mixtures. Our framework offers a generic route to enabling nanophotonic platforms for detecting chiral compounds and can be integrated with a broad range of spin-based photonic materials for applications in valleytronics, chiral emission control, and topological photonics.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the creation of rectangular waveguide-excited metasurfaces for near-field shaping using a coupled dipole framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need for advanced electromagnetic systems that offer precise control over near-field radiation has become a key motivator for this research. With the increasing complexity of modern devices and the demand for smaller, more efficient systems, there is a constant push to improve existing or develop new solutions.

Method: The authors propose a method involving the use of waveguide-fed metasurfaces, which consist of an array of radiating elements distributed across the aperture of the waveguide. These emitter elements are designed as subwavelength metamaterial apertures. The electromagnetic fields radiated by each element are analyzed considering mutual interactions between the radiating elements, using the coupled dipole model. Theoretical models combined with full-wave simulations and experimental results are employed to validate the approach.

Result: Through simulations and experiments at X-band frequencies, the proposed rectangular waveguide-fed metasurface designs demonstrate the ability to tailor near-field patterns with subwavelength precision. This shows that the coupled dipole model can effectively predict and optimize the performance of such metasurfaces.

Conclusion: This research represents a significant step forward in achieving near-field shaping capabilities using metasurfaces, highlighting the potential of waveguide-fed structures and the coupled dipole model in designing complex electromagnetic systems.

Abstract: We present the design of rectangular waveguide-excited metasurfaces for near-field shaping using a coupled dipole framework. Waveguide-fed metasurfaces are array-like radiating systems typically constructed from one or more waveguides loaded with a series of subwavelength metamaterial apertures that function as radiators. The use of subwavelength radiating elements distributed across the aperture enables electromagnetic field control with subwavelength precision, offering significant potential for near-field shaping. Leveraging these capabilities, we demonstrate that the near-field patterns of rectangular waveguide-fed metasurfaces can be tailored using the coupled dipole model, which accounts for mutual interactions between metamaterial radiating elements. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach are verified through full-wave simulations and experiments in the X-band.

Abstract: We demonstrate single-mode lasing of magnon polaritons in a cavity magnonic system enabled by dissipative coupling between two passive modes, microwave cavity mode and magnon mode in a ferrimagnetic spin ensemble. The cavity mode is partially compensated through a feedback circuit, which reduces its linewidth but retains its dissipative nature. By tuning the compensation strength and dissipative coupling strength, we reach a system cooperativity of unity, marking the lasing threshold and the formation of a zero-linewidth polariton mode. This mode also corresponds to a perfect Friedrich-Wintgen bound state in the continuum. Further increase of the cooperativity drives the system into the strong dissipative coupling regime, where magnon polariton amplification arises between two real frequency scattering poles. These results reveal that dissipative coupling cooperativity carries a clear physical meaning and serves as a key parameter for controlling phase transitions. Dissipative coupling offers an alternative paradigm for tailoring light matter interactions, paving the way for advances in both information processing and quantum technologies.

TL;DR: This paper presents a model for axial position detection in optical tweezers, accounting for backward scattered fields, improving accuracy under non-ideal conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical tweezers are widely used to study the mechanical properties of microscopic systems, making accurate position detection crucial for quantifying their behavior.

Method: A comprehensive theoretical model is developed, incorporating both forward and backward scattered fields to analyze the axial position detection in optical tweezers.

Result: The model accurately predicts the standing-wave response and enables precise estimation of trap stiffness and particle diffusion under various conditions.

Conclusion: By explicitly considering backward scattered fields, this framework enhances the capabilities of optical tweezers, providing a more robust method for quantitative analysis.

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D position detection in optical tweezers (OT) is essential for quantitatively monitoring subtle variations in the mechanical properties of microscopic systems ranging from biomolecules to cells and colloids. Because standard OT configurations do not provide direct access to the axial position, axial detection typically relies on temporal fluctuations in forward-scattered optical power to infer the position of the particle. This approach generally assumes a linear-response regime in which the signal arises from the interference between the forward scattered and the nonscattered optical fields; however, under certain conditions, the backward-scattered contribution becomes non-negligible, leading to deviations from the linear response. Here, we present a simple yet comprehensive model for axial detection in standard OT while explicitly accounting for the backward-scattered field. Together with experimental validation, this framework neatly explains the standing-wave response observed when the backward-scattered field interferes with the nonscattered and the forward-scattered components, enabling accurate estimation of trap stiffness and particle diffusion under more general conditions. This work deepens our understanding of the phenomenology observed in real optical-tweezers measurements and extends their capabilities to conditions where standard approaches fail.

Conclusion: Enables powerful platforms for remote monitoring, leak detection, and explosive threat detection.

Abstract: Frequency comb spectroscopy provides broadband access to molecular fingerprints with mode-defined spectral resolution. However, its deployment in non-cooperative gas sensing remains challenging because conventional implementations require cooperative reflectors or well-controlled optical returns. Here, we overcome this limitation by introducing a computational sensing scheme based on a mode-programmable optical comb and a high-sensitivity single-pixel detector. In our approach, a two-dimensional disperser and a high-speed digital micromirror device encode individual comb modes, enabling broadband, mode-resolved spectral acquisition without relying on coherent detection. This architecture supports measurements through highly scattering media and from non-cooperative targets while retaining the core advantages of frequency-comb spectroscopy. Our method achieves picometer-level spectral resolution, a 10-nm (1.27-THz) instantaneous bandwidth, single-photon sensitivity down to 10^-4 photons per pulse, and compressed spectral acquisition with 2.5% sampling for <10% reconstruction error. These capabilities establish a powerful platform for diverse gas-sensing applications, including remote environmental monitoring, industrial leak localization, and explosive-threat detection.

Result: Experiments show that CoSP can design thin-film RMM structures for complex, multi-state optical responses, indicating strong potential in intelligent design for applications.

Conclusion: CoSP represents a promising advance in inverse design for RMMs, enhancing both design efficiency and accuracy through linguistic capabilities and physical understanding.

Abstract: Metamaterials, known for their ability to manipulate light at subwavelength scales, face significant design challenges due to their complex and sophisticated structures. Consequently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to streamline their design process. Reconfigurable multi-state metamaterials (RMMs) with adjustable parameters can switch their optical characteristics between different states upon external stimulation, leading to numerous applications. However, existing deep learning-based inverse design methods fall short in considering reconfigurability with multi-state switching. To address this challenge, we propose CoSP, an intelligent inverse design method based on contrastive pretrained large language model (LLM). By performing contrastive pretraining on multi-state spectrum, a well-trained spectrum encoder capable of understanding the spectrum is obtained, and it subsequently interacts with a pretrained LLM. This approach allows the model to preserve its linguistic capabilities while also comprehending Maxwell's Equations, enabling it to describe material structures with target optical properties in natural language. Our experiments demonstrate that CoSP can design corresponding thin-film metamaterial structures for arbitrary multi-state, multi-band optical responses, showing great potentials in the intelligent design of RMMs for versatile applications.

Abstract: We present the design, fabrication, and characterization of tunable waveguide-coupled silicon bowtie cavities with strong spatial electromagnetic field confinement. We use nanoelectromechanical in-plane actuation for the tuning, as this combines cryocompatibility with an ultralow power consumption. Our device leverages a mode volume below 0.2 cubic wavelengths in the material to reach theoretical Purcell factors above 6,500 and waveguide-coupling efficiency above 30% across the full experimentally measured spectral-tuning range of 11 nm. Notably, the Purcell factor in our cavity depends only weakly on the applied voltage. Our spectral measurements demonstrate reversible tuning of bowtie cavities, and we directly show the in-plane actuation using in-situ characterization in a scanning electron microscope. Our results constitute the first demonstration of a low-loss dielectric tunable bowtie nanocavity with strong light confinement. This solves a key issue for experiments on strong light-matter interactions for cavity quantum electrodynamics and scalable photonic quantum technologies.

Abstract: The development of compact, energy-efficient integrated lasers operating at 1.3 um remains a critical focus in silicon photonics, essential for advancing data communications and optical interconnect technologies. This paper presents a numerical study of distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) hybrid III-V-on-silicon lasers, analyzing design trade-offs and optimization strategies based on supermode theory. The III-V section of the design incorporates InAs/(Al)GaAs quantum dots (QDs), which offer improved temperature insensitivity at the cost of more complex III-V/Si optical coupling, due to the high refractive index of (Al)GaAs. Consequently, many current laser designs rely on silicon waveguides with a thickness exceeding 220 nm, which helps coupling but limits their compatibility with standard CMOS technologies. To address this challenge, we perform detailed simulations focusing on 220-nm-thick silicon waveguides. We first examine how the mode profiles jointly depend on the silicon waveguide dimensions and the geometry and composition of the III-V stack. Based on this analysis, we propose a novel epitaxial design that enables effective III-V/Si coupling, with the optical mode strongly confined within the III-V waveguide in the gain section and efficiently transferred to the silicon waveguide in the passive sections. Moreover, the final design is shown to be robust to fabrication-induced deviations from nominal parameters.

Result: 单一阶段中，负啁啾导致等离子体密度超越 unity，且对 chirp 增长敏感。第二阶段中，正常色散使等离子体密度随 chirp 增长而降低，负 chirp 更不容易被破坏，且更长的啁啾脉冲（如 80 fs）因色散导致时间空间脱节而受到更大的压制。

Conclusion: 该研究通过分离频谱相位效应，为水 jet 中的等离子体控制提供了新的理论基础和实验预测，对未来实验和自洽传播模型具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of how linear chirp controls plasma density in a water jet using a two-stage framework. Stage I solves carrier-population and current equations at a single point, driven by a chirped super-Gaussian pulse. By fixing bandwidth and normalizing for intensity, we isolate a chirp-only response of plasma density, which exceeds unity and shows a consistent advantage for negative over positive chirp. Stage II propagates the field in water via the angular-spectrum method and applies the same equations across space. Normal dispersion reverses the trend: the chirp-only plasma density decreases as chirp grows, negative chirp remains less detrimental, and suppression is strongest for longer FTL pulses (e.g., 80 fs) due to dispersion-induced temporal spreading and spatio-temporal desynchronization. This study separates spectral-phase effects from bandwidth and intensity, yields testable predictions for water jets, and provides a foundation for future experiments and self-consistent propagation models.

Conclusion: 提出了新型的更高阶拓扑绝缘体设计思路，为实验探索提供了新的框架。

Abstract: In higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), topologically nontrivial phases are usually associated with the shift of Wannier centers to topologically nontrivial positions on the edges of the unit cells, and the emergence of fractional spectral charges in the corners of the lattice upon its truncation that keeps the number of its unit cells integer. Here we propose theoretically and illustrate experimentally a different approach to the construction of HOTIs. This approach utilizes lattices with incomplete unit cells and achieves localized modes of topological origin across a broader parameter space. When truncation disrupts translational symmetry by cutting through the interior of multiple unit cells, boundary modes in our system emerge for both trivial and topologically nontrivial positions of the Wannier centers. We link these modes to the appearance of fractional Wannier centers. We also demonstrate that linear boundary states give rise to rich families of stable solitons bifurcating from them in the presence of focusing nonlinearity. Multiple types of thresholdless topological solitons with different internal symmetries are observed in waveguide arrays with triangular configurations featuring incomplete unit cells for any dimerization of waveguide spacings. Our results expand the family of HOTIs and pave the way for the observation of boundary states with different symmetries.

Abstract: We study the existence and dynamical properties of vortex solitons in Kerr media supported by azimuthally modulated waveguide lattices with localized gain and nonlinear loss. In this dissipative system, we find that the accessible topological charge of vortex solitons is strongly determined by the number of waveguide channels, with higher-order charges requiring progressively larger arrays. Power curves of vortex solitons with different charges exhibit clear separation in large arrays but become less distinguishable in smaller ones. Furthermore, these robust vortex solitons can be excited with nearly vanishing power thresholds, and higher-charge vortices display enhanced propagation stability compared with lower-charge states. These findings expand the family of dissipative vortex solitons supported by waveguide lattices and provide a route to the realization of stable high-symmetry vortex states.

Abstract: The attoclock provides a powerful tool for studying ultrafast electron dynamics on the attosecond timescale. We demonstrate an all-optical terahertz (THz) attoclock that reconstructs electron dynamics during photoionization by detecting THz radiation emitted from gases ionized by the fundamental and second harmonic two-color laser fields, without the need for photoelectron detection. The polarization direction of the emitted THz field reflects the direction of the photoelectron drift velocity and thus encodes the effective delay. By measuring the THz waves from argon atoms ionized by the two-color fields, and by precisely controlling their relative phase and ellipticity, we observe intensity-dependent rotations of the THz polarization direction. Both experiment and time-dependent Schrodinger equation simulations reveal that the effective delay extracted from the THz polarization direction decreases with increasing laser intensity, consistent with conventional photoelectron attoclock results. Our experiment establishes the feasibility of the THz attoclock as a contactless probe of tunneling dynamics, with promising applications to condensed matter systems where photoelectron detection is impractical.

Abstract: Optical phased arrays (OPAs) are a promising technology for realizing fast and on-chip non-mechanical beam steering. In this work, we propose and analyze the performance of a non-uniformly spaced antenna arrangement based on the Fibonacci Spiral. A unique prime-number-based parameterization for antenna positioning and a tunable positional-control parameter ($α$) are introduced. We show that, depending on the intended application of the OPA, by adjusting $α$, we can achieve $\approx$ 56,562 resolvable points with 93 antennas arranged according to the prime-parametrization. To the best of our knowledge, this result exceeds the reported values in existing literature for comparable non-redundant array configurations. We analyze the robustness of this design by evaluating the sensitivities of the three key performance metrics of an OPA: side-lobe suppression ratio (SLSR), field of view (FoV), and the far-field full width at half-maximum (FWHM), to the random disturbances in antenna positions that may occur for practical implementation on a photonic chip.

Abstract: Tunable lasers are essential for optical communication, spectroscopy, and precision sensing, where flexible and fast control of the laser wavelength is needed. However, conventional tunable laser systems often rely on mechanical actuation, which limits their tuning speed, stability, and repeatability. Alternative tuning methods, such as adjusting the temperature of the gain medium or the injection current, are either slow or suffer from unwanted coupling between frequency and intensity. Electro-optic modulators implemented after the laser offer fast frequency tunability but these components are bulky and prone to high insertion losses. Here, we introduce an external cavity semiconductor laser that achieves ultrafast frequency and amplitude tunability within a compact footprint without any moving parts. The laser employs a resonant electro-optic metasurface as the external mirror, providing narrowband feedback that enables simultaneous single-mode operation and voltage-controlled tuning across a wide range of currents. Leveraging a narrow linewidth design, we demonstrate mode-hop-free linear frequency tuning with rates of up to 70 THz/s, and frequency excursions reaching 110 MHz under a 10 V peak RF drive, clearly surpassing rates attainable through mechanical actuation. Moreover, by biasing the laser near its threshold, our platform enables intensity modulation with an efficiency above 100% at a peak voltage of 4 V. These results highlight the platform's potential for applications requiring high-speed and mode-hop-free tunable lasers, such as free-space optical communication, laser ranging, and high-resolution spectroscopy.

Abstract: On-chip Brillouin laser gyroscopes harnessing opto-acoustic interaction are an emerging approach to detect rotation, due to their small footprint, excellent stability and low power consumption. However, previous implementations rely solely on optical readout, leaving the simultaneously generated saser (sound amplification by stimulated emission) undetected due to the lack of capability to access the acoustic output. Here, we propose a gyroscope based on saser detection using a suspension-free chip platform that supports low-loss confinement of both optical and acoustic modes. With experimental feasible parameter with optical and acoustic quality factors of 10^5 and 5000, respectively, sasers show significantly suppressed thermal and frequency noises, leading to gyroscope performance that outperforms its optical counterparts. We predict an angle random walk ~0.1 deg/sqrt(h) by saser gyroscope, while a conventional Brillouin laser gyroscope requires significantly higher pump power and optical quality factor to achieve comparable performance. Our work establishes the foundation for active phononic integrated circuits with Brillouin gain, opening avenues in inertial sensing, quantum transduction, and RF signal processing.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work stems from the need to optimize resonant systems for high Q-values, where traditional methods face significant computational challenges due to ill-conditioning at sharp resonances. This research aims to enhance the efficiency of inverse design techniques in such scenarios.

Method: The core method described in the paper involves two primary steps. First, conventional LDOS optimization is employed to identify regions of strong resonance. Subsequently, optimization is enhanced by introducing a fast shift-invert eigensolver, designed to maintain LDOS performance while efficiently resolving near-resonance effects. This method is applied to the inverse design of 1D and 2D dielectric systems to achieve high Q-values.

Result: The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly accelerates the inverse design process for high-Q resonant cavities. Specifically, the integration of the fast shift-invert eigensolver ensures that the LDOS remains optimized near resonance peaks, effectively mitigating issues associated with ill-conditioning. The paper showcases successful designs of 1D and 2D systems achieving Q-values exceeding 10^6, thereby validating the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: This research presents a promising solution to the computational challenges associated with high-Q resonant cavity optimization. By incorporating a specialized eigensolver, the method enables the efficient design of high-performance resonant systems, expanding the applicability of inverse design techniques to a broader range of practical scenarios.

Abstract: We demonstrate a new method that yields orders-of-magnitude acceleration in inverse design (e.g. topology optimization) of high-$Q$ resonant cavities to maximize the local density of states (LDOS), and which is also applicable to other resonant-response metrics. The key idea is that, once conventional LDOS optimization has identified a strong resonance, subsequent optimizations can exploit a fast shift-invert eigensolver to ensure that the LDOS remains centered at the resonance peak. We show that this eliminates ill-conditioning at sharp resonances that otherwise dramatically slows LDOS (and similar) optimization for $Q \gg 100$. Our method is demonstrated by design of $Q > 10^6$ resonant cavities in 1d and 2d dielectric systems.
