Abstract: The Lagrange identity expresses the second derivative of the moment of inertia of a system of material points through kinetic energy and homogeneous potential energy, from which follows the Jacobi well-known result on the instability of a system of gravitating bodies. In this work, it is proven that if a Hamiltonian system satisfies the Lagrange identity, then it possesses additional tensor invariants that are not expressed through the basic invariants existing for all Hamiltonian systems. A new class of Hamiltonian systems with inhomogeneous potentials is considered, which also possess similar additional tensor invariants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: numerical relativity is a challenging field requiring sophisticated mathematical tools to simplify and solve complex equations, making this reformulation a significant contribution.

Abstract: We derive a reformulation of the linearized Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) equations as a Hodge-Dirac wave system with the divdiv complex, addressing challenges in numerical relativity such as gauge fixing, constraint propagation, and tensor symmetries. The differential and algebraic structures of the divdiv complex ensure the well-posedness of the formulation and facilitate structure-preserving discretization via finite element exterior calculus. We establish the well-posedness of this Hodge-Dirac wave equation and develop a discretization scheme applicable to both conforming and non-conforming discrete complexes, deriving error estimates under minimal assumptions.

### [3] [GREA and Dark Energy: A holographic dual](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19546)
*Juan García-Bellido*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explains the concept of explaining the cosmological constant's nature through the holographic principle. It states that the accelerated expansion of the universe, often attributed to the cosmological constant, can also be understood as the result of boundary thermodynamic properties. If GREA theory holds, entropy associated with dynamical boundaries could account for cosmic acceleration. Experiments like the Euclid satellite in the next decade will be needed to verify this perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the fundamental cause of the universe's acceleration is a key goal in cosmology. This paper presents a novel approach using the holographic principle, which has the potential to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity.

Method: The paper theoretical framework based on the holographic principle and extends it with GREA (Generalized Entropic Retardation Acceleration). It involves studying the relationship between the cosmological constant and the thermodynamic properties of the boundary.

Result: The paper suggests that the accelerated expansion of the universe may be due to a connection between the cosmological constant and the entropic forces from the boundary's dynamic degrees of freedom. By conducting future observations, it could determine if our current universe's accelerated expansion is due to the causal horizon's thermodynamic influence.

Conclusion: The paper proposes that the observed acceleration of the universe could be explained by the entropic acceleration associated with the dynamic boundaries of causal horizons, represented through the GREA framework. This provides an alternative hypothesis to the cosmological constant explanation and suggests that future experiments will be crucial to validating this new perspective.

Abstract: The nature of the cosmological constant is a mystery. We don't understand its quantum origin but we associate it with the actual acceleration of the universe because it is the simplest description we had until recently of the present cosmological observations. However, this may change with the next generation of experiments. If we can convince ourselves that the cosmic acceleration is not due to a constant, this would open up new fascinating avenues. By exploring the simplest cosmological model in the bulk, that of an empty and flat space with a cosmological constant $Λ$, we find that its holographic dual makes sense as a theory of fundamental quantum degrees of freedom at the boundary. Moreover, we find that an observer in the bulk, making long-range (electromagnetic and gravitational) observations, cannot distinguish the acceleration induced by the cosmological constant $Λ$ from that induced by the thermodynamic properties of the boundary, the de Sitter horizon. By including matter in the bulk we extend this holographic principle to GREA, where the quantum d.o.f. associated with the evolving boundary of the causal horizon induces an entropic acceleration that varies in time. Future observations will determine whether our causal horizon is responsible for the present acceleration and whether our universe will end in de Sitter or Minkowski.

Result: 洛伦兹违反参数增加使实频偏离增加，虚频更负；轴引力模式反应最强烈，存在理论限界ℓ<0.5，极端行为出现。

Conclusion: 洛伦兹违反机制可通过引力波谱特征进行探针，确认KR重力潜在应用。

Abstract: We investigate quasinormal modes (QNMs) of scalar, electromagnetic, and axial gravitational perturbations in slowly rotating Kalb-Ramond (KR) black holes, where an antisymmetric tensor field induces spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. Working consistently to first order in the dimensionless spin parameter, we derive the corresponding master equations and compute the QNM spectrum using both the continued-fraction and matrix methods, finding excellent agreement. Lorentz violation modifies the oscillation and damping rates in a unified manner across all perturbative sectors: the real part of the QNM frequency increases monotonically with the Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$, while the imaginary part becomes more negative. Axial gravitational modes exhibit the strongest response, revealing an intrinsic theoretical bound $\ell< 0.5$, beyond which the spectrum approaches an extremal behavior. Our results highlight the potential of gravitational-wave spectroscopy to probe Lorentz-violating signatures in KR gravity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子引力与经典广义相对论统一的天体表面奇性消除问题，利用Vilkovisky-DeWitt作用量实现量子修正。

Method: 采用Modified Tolman VII density profile模型，研究其光滑度对于量子修正的影响。

Result: 通过选择适当的光滑度迫使量子修正正则化天体表面，解决密度发散的问题。

Conclusion: Adopted Smoothed Density Profile Reduces Surface Pathologies in Quantum Gravity Models

Abstract: We discuss how to model the surface of celestial bodies (such as stars) in quantum gravity to ensure the regularity of quantum corrections to classical solutions of general relativity at the surface of such bodies. Specifically, we use the Vilkovisky--DeWitt unique effective action to calculate universal quantum corrections to the exterior metric for a class of stellar models. Previous descriptions, obtained via a Heaviside density profile, are ``pathological'' at the surface of the star due to the divergence of the metric functions and associated curvature invariants. Introducing a modified version of the Tolman VII density profile, we determine the minimal degree of differentiability required for this function to generate regular quantum corrections at the star's surface.

### [6] [Searching Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background Landscape Across Frequency Bands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19590)

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Gravitational wave (GW) astrophysics will enter a multi-band era, allowing detailed mapping of the stochastic GW background across a wide range of frequencies with upcoming detectors like LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope. A new physics model involving hybrid topological defects from a two-step phase transition separated by inflation is proposed. This model provides a potential explanation for the pulsar timing array signal at low frequencies and will be tested through higher-frequency probes in future experiments. If confirmed, this could revolutionize our understanding of early universe physics and multi-messenger astronomy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the stochastic GW background and its sources has become a key area of research in gravitational wave astrophysics. The upcoming multi-band detectors provide an opportunity to study this phenomenon across a broad spectrum of frequencies, potentially revealing new insights into early universe physics and the formation of large-scale structures.

Method: A general pipeline is developed to analyze experimental exclusions and apply it to the proposed model involving hybrid topological defects. This pipeline is used to explore the potential of the model to explain the pulsar timing array signal and predict the outcomes of future experiments like LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope.

Result: The proposed model involving hybrid topological defects offers a possible explanation for the observed low-frequency signal from pulsar timing arrays. The model predicts that high-frequency probes like LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope will either confirm or rule out this explanation, providing crucial information about the nature of these topological defects and their role in the early universe.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of hybrid topological defects as a source of the stochastic GW background and highlights the importance of multi-band approaches in understanding complex astrophysical phenomena. The findings could lead to significant advancements in our understanding of the early universe and the signals they produce in gravitational wave experiments.

### [7] [A parametrized model for gravitational waves from eccentric, precessing binary black holes: theory-agnostic tests of General Relativity with pTEOBResumS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19593)
*Danilo Chiaramello,Nicolò Cibrario,Jacob Lange,Koustav Chandra,Rossella Gamba,Raffaella Bonino,Alessandro Nagar*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Gravitational waves from black hole mergers can test general relativity, but existing tests assume non-eccentric orbits. This paper introduces a new model, pTEOBResumS, that includes eccentricity and spin, and tests it against real data from LIGO. The analysis shows no significant deviations from general relativity, but some events, like GW200129, might hint at eccentricity effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General relativity (GR) has been tested extensively through gravitational waves, but most tests have focused on non-eccentric orbits. Understanding eccentricity in gravitational wave signals can provide insights into astrophysical scenarios and potential modifications to GR.

Method: The paper introduces the pTEOBResumS model, which incorporates eccentricity and spin precession into the effective-one-body framework. The model is validated using synthetic signals (including numerical relativity simulations) and then applied to real data from LIGO's first three observing runs involving black hole mergers. Parameter estimation techniques are used to compare GR and beyond-GR waveform hypotheses.

Result: The analysis of about 40 BBH events from the first three LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA runs did not find significant statistical evidence supporting deviations from GR. The samples are small, and potential systematic effects reduce the significance of the results. Three specific events (including GW200129) showed signs of eccentricity, but even they were best explained by GR.

Conclusion: Current data do not provide strong evidence for beyond-GR effects in binary black hole mergers. However, the finding of an eccentric waveform for GW200129 warrants further investigation, possibly due to data quality issues.

Abstract: Gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers allow us to test general relativity in the strong-field, high-curvature regime. However, existing gravitational wave-based tests have so far assumed non-eccentric signal sources, limiting their applicability to more general astrophysical scenarios. In this work, we present pTEOBResumS, a new parametrized inspiral-merger-ringdown model for null tests of GR that incorporates both orbital eccentricity and spin precession. Building on the effective-one-body model TEOBResumS-Dalí, we introduce parametrized deviations from GR both in the inspiral and the merger-ringdown regimes. We validate the model via parameter estimation of synthetic signals, including from numerical relativity simulations of BBHs and a boson star binary. These allow us to establish the model's consistency, demonstrate its capability to identify beyond-GR effects, and gauge the impact of eccentricity in tests of GR. We then analyze a set of BBH events from the first three LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs, testing whether they are best explained by a GR or non-GR waveform, under either the eccentric, spin-aligned or precessing, quasi-circular hypotheses. We find no significant statistical evidence in favor of deviations from GR. Consistent with previous works, we infer a mild preference for longer remnant quasi-normal mode damping times than expected in GR, though the limited sample and potential systematics reduce its significance. In addition, when weighting by signal strength, joint posteriors combining the individual events are still compatible with GR. We find no strong evidence for imprints of orbital eccentricity in the analyzed events, with the exception of GW200129. For this, our analysis finds a strong preference for an eccentric, GR-consistent description, although as previous works have noted this result could be influenced by data quality issues.

### [8] [Periodic gravitational lensing by oscillating boson stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19606)
*Xing-Yu Yang,Tan Chen,Rong-Gen Cai*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show that oscillating (real-scalar) boson stars can act as strictly periodic gravitational lenses and generically host an \emph{oscillating radial caustic}. Sources near this caustic cross it every half period, producing achromatic phase-locked photometric spikes synchronized with an astrometric wobble, providing a promising target for time-domain astronomy. Event-number estimation indicates a measurable discovery space with current astrometric and high-cadence photometric surveys. These predictions rely only on the dynamics of long-lived real-scalar condensates, therefore offering a clean test of self-gravitating quantum fields in curved spacetime. The framework extends naturally to self-interacting real scalars (including axion-like particles) and to ultralight vector bosons.

Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) observations will detect gravitational waves (GWs) from the early inspiral phase of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) with orbital periods of weeks to years. Current PTA analyses generally assume circular binaries; however, dynamical interactions with the surrounding environment can prevent complete circularisation, allowing SMBHBs to retain appreciable eccentricities. In this work, we present a gravitational waveform model for eccentric binaries based on the Effective-One-Body (EOB) formalism, designed for continuous GW searches in PTA data. The model is accurate up to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order for the conservative dynamics and up to post-leading order for the radiation-reaction terms. We provide both a numerically precise and a computationally efficient approximate implementation and evaluate the latter's accuracy against the full model over a broad range of eccentricities and initial orbital frequencies. Our results show that a substantial region of the parameter space exhibits pronounced orbital evolution, much stronger than in the circular case. We demonstrate the rich harmonic structure of timing residuals induced by eccentric GWs. Properly characterising eccentric binaries is an essential step toward detecting GWs in PTA data and interpreting the results, ultimately improving our understanding of the supermassive black hole population in the local Universe.

### [10] [Universal Relations with Dynamical Tides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19626)
*Jayana A. Saes,Abhishek Hegade K. R.,Nicolás Yunes*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper describes quasi-universal relations between tidal deformability parameters from neutron star equations of state, with evidence of reduced dependence on the equation of state. These relations provide a foundation for simplified gravitational-wave modeling with dynamical tidal effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find universal relations between measurable tidal deformability parameters to simplify modeling of gravitational waves from neutron stars despite the uncertainty in the equation of state.

Method: Parametric analysis and numerical simulations were performed across 63 equations of state. The method involved computing the tidal deformability parameters from the small-frequency expansion of the relativistic tidal response and analyzing their relationships.

Result: The analysis finds that the tidal deformability parameters $	extit{Λ}^{(0)}$ and $	extit{Λ}^{(2)}$, as well as the combination $	extit{Mω}_	extit{*}$, exhibit reduced dependence on the equation of state compared to earlier estimates. The $	extit{Λ}^{(0)}$-$	extit{Λ}^{(2)}$ relation has a dependence on the equation of state below ~5%, while the $	extit{Λ}^{(0)}$-$	extit{Mω}_	extit{*}$ relation has a dependence below ~2.5%. The paper also finds that the Taylor expansion method performs better than the effective-one-mode approximation in most parameter space.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that the relations described are highly universal and offer a robust framework for modeling tidal effects in gravitational wave astronomy.

Abstract: Observations of neutron stars and the precise measurement of their macroscopic properties have provided valuable insights into fundamental physics, both by constraining the behavior of nuclear matter under extreme conditions and by enabling tests of general relativity in the strong-field regime. In this context, equation-of-state-insensitive or ``quasi-universal'' relations between key observables, such as the compactness, dimensionless static tidal deformability, and moment of inertia, play a crucial role in connecting different measurable observables while minimizing uncertainties due to the yet unknown equation of state. In this work, we identify new quasi-universal relations between the static, dimensionless tidal deformability ($Λ^{(0)}$) and its leading-order dynamical correction ($Λ^{(2)}$), as well as a combination of these parameters ($\sqrt{Λ^{(0)}/Λ^{(2)}} \equiv Mω_*$), obtained from the small-frequency expansion of the relativistic tidal response. We test these relations across a representative set of 63 equations of state, finding that the equation-of-state dependence does not exceed $\sim 5\%$ for the $Λ^{(0)}$-$Λ^{(2)}$ relation and $\sim 2.5\%$ for the $Λ^{(0)}$-$Mω_*$ relation. This indicates a high degree of universality and offers a simplified framework for incorporating dynamical tidal effects into gravitational-wave modeling. Furthermore, we compare the fully dynamical tidal response against different recent strategies (a Taylor expansion and an effective-one-mode approximation) to model the dynamical tide. We find that both models are capable of capturing the frequency-dependent behavior of the fully dynamical tidal deformability, with the Taylor expansion outperforming the effective-one-mode approximation in most of the parameter space.

Conclusion: 机器学习方法在 active 隔振控制中具有巨大潜力，能够显著提升探测器的稳定性和低频观测能力。

Abstract: The unprecedented sensitivity of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, which enables the detection of distant astrophysical sources, also renders the detectors highly susceptible to low-frequency ground motion. Persistent microseisms in the 0.1-0.3 Hz band couple into the instruments, degrade lock stability, and contribute substantially to detector downtime during observing runs. The multi-stage seismic isolation system has achieved remarkable success in mitigating such disturbances through active feedback control, yet residual platform motion remains a key factor limiting low-frequency sensitivity and duty cycle. Further reduction of this residual motion is therefore critical for improving the long-term stability and overall astrophysical reach of the observatories.
  In this work, we develop a data-driven approach that uses machine learning to model and suppress residual seismic motion within the isolation system. Ground and platform sensor data from the detectors are used to train a neural network that predicts platform motion driven by microseismic activity. When incorporated into the control scheme, the network's predictions yield up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in residual motion compared to conventional linear filtering methods, revealing that nonlinear couplings play a significant role in limiting current isolation performance. These results demonstrate that machine-learning-based control can provide a powerful new pathway for enhancing active seismic isolation, improving lock robustness, and extending the low-frequency observational capabilities of gravitational-wave detectors.

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope has recently detected massive, fully formed, galaxies at redshifts corresponding to few hundred million years after the Big-Bang. However, our current cosmological model cannot produce such massive systems so early in the lifetime of the universe. A number of theoretical solutions have been proposed, but they all appeal to exotic new physics and introduce rather excessive fine-tuning. In this essay, we outline a theoretical answer to the early galaxy-formation question, which operates within standard general relativity and standard cosmology, without appealing to any new physics. Instead, we account for the effect of a well established feature of our universe. This feature, which has so far been kept in the margins of mainstream cosmology, are the peculiar velocities.

Abstract: This work presents exact solutions of the Kemmer equation for spin-1 particles in $(1+1)$-dimensional Rindler spacetime, motivated by the need to understand vector bosons under uniform acceleration, including non-inertial effects and the Unruh temperature, which distinguish them from spin-0 and spin-1/2 systems. Starting from the free Kemmer field in an accelerated reference frame, we establish eigenvalue equations resembling those of the Klein--Gordon equation in Rindler coordinates. By introducing the Dirac oscillator interaction through a momentum substitution, we derive an exact closed-form spectrum for the Kemmer oscillator, revealing how the acceleration parameter modifies the characteristic length, shifts the discrete energy spectrum, and lifts degeneracies. In the Minkowski limit $a\to 0$, the standard Kemmer oscillator spectrum is recovered, ensuring consistency with flat-spacetime results. These findings provide a tractable framework for analyzing acceleration-induced effects, with implications for quantum field theory in curved spacetime, quantum gravity, and analogue gravity platforms.

### [14] [Quintessential Inflation in Light of ACT DR6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19898)
*Sayantan Choudhury,Swapnil Kumar Singh,Satish Kumar Sahoo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: A single scalar field unites cosmic inflation and dark energy through a precision quintessential inflation model, which predicts observable gravitational waves and testable scalar-tensor ratios fitting current cosmological data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unification of cosmic inflation and dark energy into a single scalar field model aims to address the dark energy mystery and refine cosmological predictions, especially in light of precision cosmology data.

Method: The study employs a CMB-normalized exponential potential to model quintessential inflation, enforcing sharp predictability through observable parameters such as scalar spectral tilt (n_s) and tensor-to-scalar ratio (r). Physical constraints from datasets like Planck and ACT are utilized to validate the model.

Result: The quintessential inflation model predicts a scalar spectral tilt of n_s ≈ 0.964241 and a tensor-to-scalar ratio of r ≈ 7.48 × 10^-5 at approximately 60 e-folds, aligning closely with current constraints. The model achieves this with minimal observable fluctuations, ensuring tight coupling between early and late cosmic dynamics. Additionally, the model foresees a blue-tilted stochastic gravitational-wave background detectable by future interferometers like LISA, DECIGO, ALIA, and BBO, spanning an enormous frequency range.

Conclusion: This minimal scalar field model successfully unifies inflation and quintessential dark energy, providing falsifiable predictions for both gravitational waves and scalar fluctuations, while maintaining consistency with existing observational data.

Abstract: We perform a precision investigation of smooth quintessential inflation in which a single canonical scalar field unifies the two known phases of cosmic acceleration. Using a CMB-normalized runaway exponential potential, we obtain sharply predictive inflationary observables: a red-tilted spectrum with $n_s = 0.964241$ and an exceptionally suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 7.48 \times 10^{-5}$ at $N=60$, lying near the optimal region of current Planck+ACT constraints. Remarkably, all observable scales exit the horizon within an extremely narrow field interval $Δφ\simeq 0.03\,M_{\rm Pl}$, tightly linking early and late-time dynamics and reducing theoretical ambiguities. While inflationary tensors remain invisible to CMB B-mode surveys, the subsequent stiff epoch-an intrinsic hallmark of quintessential cosmology-imprints a blue-tilted stochastic gravitational-wave background within the discovery reach of future interferometers such as LISA, DECIGO, ALIA, and BBO. Our results demonstrate that this minimal, featureless model not only survives current bounds, but provides concrete, falsifiable predictions across gravitational-wave frequencies spanning over twenty orders of magnitude.

Abstract: We consider the inhomogeneous Morris-Thorne wormhole metric with matter tensors characterised by a novel linear equation of state in $f(R)$ gravity. Using the Einstein's field equations in metric $f(R)$ gravity we model solutions for both wormhole as well as $f(R)$ gravity. We obtain four different wormhole models, two wormholes are characterised by solid angle deficit, three are not asymptotically extendible, while one is asymptotically flat with zero tidal force. These are supported by four different power law $f(R)$ models. The parameter space of the models can support both null energy conditions (NEC) satisfying as well as violating wormhole. In case of NEC satisfying matter, the associated $f(R)$ is ghost. The $f(R)$ models obtained have been independently substantiated for cosmological feasibility and valid parameter space was obtained corresponding to cosmologically viable $f(R)$. Suitable scalar-tensor representation of the corresponding $f(R)$ models have been presented using the correspondence of $f(R)$ gravity with Brans-Dicke (BD) theory of gravity. The robustness of the wormhole solutions were further analysed with the BD scalar fields in the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, which showed excellent results. Lastly as an independent astrophysical probe for the wormhole we have obtained the location of their photon spheres and have connected them with the Herrera Complexity factor in $f(R).$ Our results show that the relation between the complexity factor and existence of photon spheres remains fundamentally unaltered in $f(R)$ as compared to Einstein's gravity.

Abstract: We present a search for gravitational waves from inspiraling, planetary-mass ultra-compact binaries using data from the first part of the fourth observing run of LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA. Finding no evidence of such systems, we determine the maximum distance reach for such objects and their merger rate densities, independently of how they could have formed. Then, we identify classes of primordial black-hole mass distributions for which these rate limits can be translated into relevant constraints on the mass distribution of primordial black holes, assuming that they compose all of dark matter, in the mass range $[10^{-6},10^{-3}]M_\odot$. Our constraints are consistent with existing microlensing results in the planetary-mass range, and provide a complementary probe to sub-solar mass objects.

Abstract: Einstein-Kalb-Ramond gravity is an alternative theory of gravity in which a rank-two antisymmetric tensor field, known as the Kalb-Ramond field, is nonminimally coupled to gravity and can induce spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking when it acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value. In this work, we revisit Einstein-Kalb-Ramond gravity and obtain two classes of exact static black hole solutions with general topological horizons in diverse dimensions within this framework, both with and without a cosmological constant. We further analyze their thermodynamic properties and employ the Wald formalism to compute the Noether mass and entropy, thereby establishing the corresponding first law of black hole thermodynamics. Finally, we discuss the implications of the Noether mass charge for constraining spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking within the framework of Einstein-Kalb-Ramond gravity.

Abstract: By deriving and solving the gravitational and electromagnetic field equations in $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics, we obtain a static spherically symmetric charged solution that incorporates higher-order correction terms along with an effective cosmological constant term. This solution reduces to the AdS/dS metric in the far-field region while exhibiting significant modifications in the strong-field regime due to the nonlinear electromagnetic effects and the matter-geometry coupling. We further analyze the black hole's horizon structure, revealing the complex phenomenon of multiple horizons emerging within specific parameter ranges. Additionally, by introducing an effective metric to study photon propagation, we systematically explore the influence of magnetic charge and the coupling parameter on the effective potential, the photon sphere radius, and the black hole shadow.

Conclusion: Provide numerical validation of ringdown behavior in sGB gravity and suggest future studies to detect deviations from GR.

Abstract: Observations of gravitational waves (GWs) generated by binary black hole (BBH) mergers provide us with a powerful way to explore the strong and highly dynamical regime of gravity theories. The ringdown of BBH merger, consisting of a series of quasi-normal modes (QNMs), is of particular interest for both the black hole (BH) spectroscopy and the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency check. Unlike the QNM frequencies that only depend on the properties of the remnant BH, the excitation amplitudes and phases of QNMs depend on the progenitor system, and calculating them is beyond the perturbative approach. In this paper, by performing self-consistent fully non-linear simulations of BBH merger in shift-symmetric scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity as well as in sGB gravity allowing for scalarization, and extracting the QNM excitation, we explore the possible deviations from GR at the ringdown stage. We numerically verify that the mode frequencies are consistent with the theory prediction, and provide the fitting results of mode amplitudes and phases. We find relatively small changes in the mode excitation, considering that the largest coupling we used in the simulations is close to the limit of loss of hyperbolicity. To demonstrate that our results are robust against the eccentricity caused by the imperfect initial data, we also perform eccentricity reduction and estimate the effect caused by the initial eccentricity. These studies are useful for understanding the ringdown in sGB gravity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The status of a modification of General Relativity (GR) -- Spontaneously Broken Relativity (SBR) -- for merging gravity, dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) is presented. The modification is principally grounded on a multiscalar-metric concept of spacetime endowed with two dynamical structures: a basic metric and a set of the reversible multiscalar fields. The latter ones serve geometrically as exceptional dynamical coordinates among arbitrary kinematical/observer's ones and physically as a kind of gravitational Higgs fields producing possible spontaneous breaking of the symmetry (SSB) of relativity. The effective field theory (EFT) of the extended gravity based on the multiscalar-metric spacetime -- the metagravity -- is discussed and some of its particular realizations beyond GR as SBR are explicated. Physically, SBR results in appearance of massive tensor and scalar gravitons. Some of the emerging consequences, problems and prospects for SBR for future deeper unification of gravity with matter in the context of the relativity and internal symmetries breaking are shortly discussed.

Abstract: The general uncertainty principle applied to gravity can be implemented as a set of modified Poisson brackets in the canonical formalism. As such, the theory is not canonical and the resulting equations of motion, diffeomorphism constraint, and Hamiltonian constraint are unlikely to lead to a covariant metric. We construct a Hamiltonian that when applying the usual canonical formalism gives a closed algebra and equations of motion that result in the original metric obtained by using distorted Poisson brackets. The resulting theory is thus rendered canonical and covariant. We then covariantly couple scalar matter and dust to the modified gravity to allow the study of dynamics.

Abstract: A new general dynamical metric is obtained through a generalization of the Schwarzschild foundations, explicitly providing the global causal structure and trapping horizons and establishing three possible fates of the spacetime: those without a globally trapped future; those without global trapping but containing bounded, Cauchy-foliated trapped regions; and those with a future that becomes completely globally trapped. This framework is illustrated through the evolution of a geometrically Schwarzschild-like black hole and a horizonless wormhole, thereby establishing the final, globally trapped fate as a novel theoretical possibility.

Abstract: Context: Globular clusters (GCs) around the Milky Way (MW) are expected to host white dwarf (WD) binaries emitting gravitational waves that could be detectable by LISA.
  Aims: Our aim is to investigate whether LISA can resolve WD binaries in GCs well enough in terms of sky location and distance that they can be distinguished from binaries in the MW disc.
  Methods: We used a sample of 20 of the most massive GCs around the MW and simulated LISA's sky location and distance measurement errors for WD binaries in these GCs using the software package GWToolbox. We did this in the context of a model of the LISA-detectable binaries in the MW from the population synthesis code SeBa.
  Results: We find that for five of the GCs in our sample, binaries in the GC could be easily distinguished from MW disc binaries using the sky location alone; for another five, binaries in the GCs could be distinguished using a combination of LISA's sky location and distance measurements; and for the final ten, binaries in the GCs could not be distinguished from overlapping MW disc binaries. The results depend strongly on the sky locations of the GCs, with GCs far away from the Galactic plane being easy to resolve, while GCs close to the Galactic centre overlap with many MW disc binaries. The most promising GC for finding a WD binary that could be resolved to that GC, based on sky location and GC mass, is 47 Tucanae.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this article, we propose an anisotropic Bianchi-I type cosmological model in non-conservative Unimodular Gravity ($\mathrm{NUG}$). We show that simply using the Bianchi-I type metric does not resolve a striking characteristic of the field equations in $\mathrm{NUG}$: their underdetermination. This fact led us to implement extra conditions on the combination $\left(ρ+p\right)$ and, consequently, obtain a consistent background cosmological analysis. In the vacuum case, we obtain an analogy between the Kasner solutions and the equations in $\mathrm{NUG}$. We also propose a new analysis of a non-homogeneous equation of state, the combination $\left(ρ+p\right)=l$. We identify that the cosmological dynamics are strictly dependent on the value of the constant $l$. The physically interesting case is at the value $l<0$, which seems to indicate a super-accelerated, ghost-like universe. This case still requires a more detailed analysis, for example, from a thermodynamic point of view, keeping in mind that $\left(ρ+p\right)$ may be interpreted as enthalpy of the system. For the cases $\left(ρ+p\right)\propto a^{-3}$ and $\left(ρ+p\right) \propto a^{-4}$, we obtain a description consistent with the anisotropic cosmological model described by $\mathrm{GR}$. In all cases analyzed, a small value for the anisotropic parameter $Ω_{A}$ (on the order of $10^{-2}$) is required in order to have agreement, for example, with the age of the universe to be approximately $12-14\, \mathrm{Gyr}$, agreeing with the age of globular clusters. As the universe expands an isotropization is verified, with the anistropies going to zero asymptotically, similarly with what happens in an anistropic cosmological model based on $\mathrm{GR}$.

Abstract: We study the threshold of gravitational collapse in spherically symmetric spacetimes governed by the Einstein-Maxwell-Vlasov equations. We numerically construct solutions describing a collapsing distribution of charged matter that either forms a charged black hole or eventually disperses. We first consider a region of parameter space where the solutions at the threshold of black hole formation are stationary, horizonless shells. These solutions terminate at a critical point, with their charge-to-mass ratio approaching unity from below, and the instability timescale diverging. Beyond the critical point, we find a new region of parameter space where the threshold solution is an extremal black hole. We measure the scaling of the dynamical time period of the near threshold solutions and discuss how they are connected in the two regimes. If a similar picture to the one found here holds for known families of stationary solutions of rotating matter that approach the exterior of an extremal Kerr spacetime, they could provide a route to forming an extremal spinning black hole.

Abstract: The mechanisms governing molecular photophysics under electronic strong coupling (ESC) remain elusive to date. Here, we use ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy to study the nonradiative excited state relaxation dynamics of chlorin e6 trimethyl ester (Ce6T) under strong coupling of its transition from the electronic ground state to the Qy band. We use dichroic Fabry-Pérot cavities to provide a transparent spectral window in which we can directly track the excited state population following optical pumping of either the strongly-coupled Qy band or the higher-lying B band. This scheme circumvents many of the optical artifacts inherent in ultrafast cavity measurements and allows for facile comparison of strongly-coupled measurements with extracavity controls. We observe no significant changes in excited state lifetimes for any optical pumping schemes or cavity coupling conditions considered herein. These results suggest that Ce6T exhibits identical photophysics under ESC and in free space, presenting a new data point for benchmarking emerging theories for cavity photochemistry.

Abstract: The selective separation of same-charge ions is a longstanding challenge in resource recovery, battery recycling, and water treatment. Theoretical studies have shown that ratchet-based ion pumps (RBIPs) can separate ions with the same charge and valance by driving them in opposite directions according to their diffusion coefficients. This process relies on frequency dependent current reversal, a unique feature of ratchets in which the particle current direction is inverted with the input signal frequency. Previous experimental demonstrations of RBIPs achieved ion pumping against electrostatic forces and water deionization, but lacked frequency-dependent current reversal and control of the asymmetry of the device. Here, we report the first experimental realization of these key functionalities by driving RBIPs with a bipotentiostat. Complementary input signals applied to RBIP contacts unlock a flashing ratchet-like behavior, and enhances the device performance by an order of magnitude compared to the prior floating-drive approach. The enhanced control of the electrostatic potential at the RBIP surfaces leads to frequency dependent current reversals, and the addition of a potential offset to the input signal enables tuning the amplitude asymmetry of the device. This flashing ratchet functionality provides a significant step towards the realization of ratchet driven selective ion separation systems.

Abstract: We develop a linear vibronic coupling (LVC) model for polyenes described by the extended Hubbard-Peierls Hamiltonian. This model is applied to trans-hexatriene to benchmark quantum-classical dynamics methods against fully quantum simulations. We find that surface-hopping methods describe short times more accurately than multi-trajectory Ehrenfest. No quantum-classical method obtains the long-time population oscillations found in fully quantum simulations. Varying the parameters of the LVC Hamiltonian, surface hopping reproduces the correct trends in the long-time dynamics across a wide range of parameters, but generally overestimates the degree of internal conversion. On the other hand, multi-trajectory Ehrenfest gives more accurate long-time populations in proximity to the hexatriene parameter set.

Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) promise to significantly advance atomistic simulations by delivering quantum-level accuracy for large molecular systems at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional electronic structure methods. While model hubs and categorisation efforts have emerged in recent years, it remains difficult to consistently discover, compare, and apply these models across diverse scenarios. The field still lacks a standardised and comprehensive framework for evaluating MLIP performance. We introduce MLIPAudit, an open, curated and modular benchmarking suite designed to assess the accuracy of MLIP models across a variety of application tasks. MLIPAudit offers a diverse collection of benchmark systems, including small organic compounds, molecular liquids, proteins and flexible peptides, along with pre-computed results for a range of pre-trained and published models. MLIPAudit also provides tools for users to evaluate their models using the same standardised pipeline. A continuously updated leaderboard tracks performance across benchmarks, enabling direct comparison on downstream tasks. By providing a unified, transparent reference framework for model validation and comparison, MLIPAudit aims to foster reproducibility, transparency, and community-driven progress in the development of MLIPs for complex molecular systems. In order to illustrate the use of the library, we present some benchmarks run on a series of internal models, along with publicly available ones (UMA-Small, MACE-OFF, MACE-MP). The library is available on GitHub at https://github.com/instadeepai/mlipaudit, on PyPI at https://pypi.org/project/mlipaudit/ under the Apache License 2.0, and the leaderboard can be accessed on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/spaces/InstaDeepAI/mlipaudit-leaderboard.

Conclusion: This study provides essential theoretical insights for the design and optimization of heterodyne Rydberg atom receivers in microwave detection and communication applications.

Abstract: The four-level heterodyne Rydberg atom receiver has garnered significant attention in microwave detection and communication due to its high sensitivity and phase measurement capabilities. Existing theoretical studies, primarily based on static solutions, are limited in characterizing the system's frequency response. To address this, this paper comprehensively investigates the dynamic solutions of the density matrix elements for the four-level heterodyne structure, establishing a quantitative relationship between system response, signal frequency, and system parameters. This enables theoretical bandwidth calculations and performance analysis. This paper also constructs a noise model for the density matrix elements, revealing the relationship between the ultimate sensitivity of the Rydberg atom receiver and the noise in the density matrix elements. Both theoretical simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the bandwidth of the four-level heterodyne receiver can exceed 10 MHz. This study provides critical theoretical support for the engineering applications and performance optimization of heterodyne Rydberg atom receivers.

Conclusion: EUV光谱分析法在 heavy deformed 核中的核结构研究中展现出强大的适用性，为未来研究提供了坚实方法。

Abstract: We report a high-precision determination of the natural-abundance-averaged nuclear charge-radius difference between Yb and Lu using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectroscopy of highly charged ions (HCIs). By measuring the $D_1$ transition energies in Na- and Mg-like charge states of Lu and Yb confined in the Tokyo electron-beam ion trap, we extract meV-level energy shifts that are directly sensitive to nuclear-size effects. Transition-energy differences obtained from these spectra are compared with state-of-the-art relativistic many-body perturbation theory, including a new treatment of Mg-like ions. We develop a generalized framework to propagate uncertainties arising from nuclear deformation and surface diffuseness and evaluate corresponding nuclear-sensitivity coefficients. Combining Na- and Mg-like results yields mutually consistent radius differences, demonstrating the robustness of both the experimental calibration and the theoretical predictions. To determine absolute isotopic radii, we perform a generalized least-squares optimization incorporating our HCI constraints together with optical-isotope-shift data and muonic-atom results. This analysis establishes that the $^{175}$Lu charge radius is smaller than that of $^{174}$Yb, restoring the expected odd-even staggering across the $N=94$ isotonic chain. Our recommended value, $R(^{175}\text{Lu}) = 5.291(11)$ fm, reduces the uncertainty of the Lu radius by a factor of three compared with the previous electron-scattering result and resolves a long-standing anomaly in rare-earth nuclear systematics. This work demonstrates that EUV spectroscopy of HCIs provides a powerful and broadly applicable method for precision nuclear-structure studies in heavy, deformed nuclei. The techniques developed here enable future investigations of isotonic and isoelectronic sequences, including radioactive nuclides and higher-$Z$ systems.

Abstract: This work establishes a new probabilistic bound on the number of elements to generate finite nilpotent groups. Let $\varphi_k(G)$ denote the probability that $k$ random elements generate a finite nilpotent group $G$. For any $0 < ε< 1$, we prove that $\varphi_k(G) \ge 1 - ε$ if $k \ge \operatorname{rank}(G) + \lceil \log_2(2/ε) \rceil$ (a bound based on the group rank) or if $k \ge \operatorname{len}(G) + \lceil \log_2(1/ε) \rceil$ (a bound based on the group chain length). Moreover, these bounds are shown to be nearly tight. Both bounds sharpen the previously known requirement of $k \ge \lceil \log_2 |G| + \log_2(1/ε) \rceil + 2$. Our results provide a foundational tool for analyzing probabilistic algorithms, enabling a better estimation of the iteration count for the finite Abelian hidden subgroup problem (AHSP) standard quantum algorithm and a reduction in the circuit repetitions required by Regev's factoring algorithm.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding single-molecule spectroscopy techniques could provide deeper insights into molecular structures and dynamics in fields like quantum mechanics and molecular physics.

Method: The researchers employ a non-classical state of motion of a two-ion crystal to amplify the recoil signal from photon absorption, enabling single-molecule detection.

Result: They successfully observed the absorption spectrum of the O-H stretch vibration in individual CaOH+ molecular ions, opening new avenues for Quantum Non-Demolition measurements.

Conclusion: This work signifies a substantial step forward in quantum measurement techniques, offering high-fidelity spectroscopy for complex molecules with potential applications in quantum information science.

Abstract: Absorption spectroscopy is a fundamental tool for probing molecular structure. However, performing absorption spectroscopy on individual molecules is challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we report on a nondestructive absorption spectroscopy on a mid-infrared vibrational transition in a single molecular ion that is co-trapped with an atomic ion. The absorption of a single photon is detected via the momentum transfer from the absorbed photon onto the molecule. This recoil signal is amplified using a non-classical state of motion of the two-ion crystal and subsequently read out via the atomic ion. We characterize the recoil detection method and use it to investigate the interaction between femtosecond laser pulses and the O-H stretching vibration in individual CaOH+ molecular ions. Furthermore, we present the single-photon absorption spectrum obtained for the vibrational transition. This method represents a milestone towards quantum non-demolition measurements of complex polyatomic molecules, providing high-fidelity methods for preparation and measurement of the quantum state of a wide range of molecular species.

*Mikhail Zubarev*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Variational quantum algorithms face a fundamental trainability crisis: barren plateaus render optimization exponentially difficult as system size grows. While recent Lie algebraic theory precisely characterizes when and why these plateaus occur, no practical optimization method exists with finite-sample guarantees for navigating them. We present the sequential plateau-adaptive regime-testing algorithm (SPARTA), the first measurement-frugal scheduler that provides explicit, anytime-valid risk control for quantum optimization. Our approach integrates three components with rigorous statistical foundations: (i) a χ²-calibrated sequential test that distinguishes barren plateaus from informative regions using likelihood-ratio supermartingales; (ii) a probabilistic trust-region exploration strategy with one-sided acceptance to prevent false improvements under shot noise; and (iii) a theoretically-optimal exploitation phase that achieves the best attainable convergence rate. We prove geometric bounds on plateau exit times, linear convergence in informative basins, and show how Lie-algebraic variance proxies enhance test power without compromising statistical calibration.

Motivation: Quantum computing is rapidly advancing, but practical implementation challenges remain. Variational quantum algorithms are central to many near-term quantum computing applications, but their optimization faces insurmountable barriers in the form of exponentially growing barren plateaus. This paper addresses this critical issue with a novel optimization algorithm, SPARTA, offering significant advancements in practical optimization for quantum computing.

Result: The SPARTA algorithm provides explicit, anytime-valid risk control for quantum optimization, integrating advanced statistical and mathematical frameworks. It includes rigorous proofs of geometric bounds on plateau exit times and linear convergence in informative basins. Additionally, the algorithm enhances test power using Lie-algebraic variance proxies without compromising statistical calibration.

Conclusion: This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of quantum computing by addressing the critical issue of optimization challenges in variational quantum algorithms. The introduction of SPARTA offers a practical, measurement-frugal solution with provable guarantees, advancing near-term quantum computing applications.

TL;DR: A mathematical model of the photoelectric response of NV colour centres in diamond is developed for sensing and quantum science applications, incorporating drift, charge carrier collection, defects, and spin coherence effects. It can be adapted for other semiconductor qubits with slight modifications.

Motivation: The need for precise models to optimize the performance of NV qubits in quantum applications.

Method: A multilevel electronic model is developed, including charge transport dynamics and spin coherence effects, using Boltzmann transport equations for charge transitions and ODMR/PDMR response analysis.

Result: The model provides optimal parameter spaces for NV qubit operations, highlighting the impact of substitutional nitrogen and acceptor defects on spin contrast and quantum efficiency.

Conclusion: This model fills a critical gap in understanding photocurrent readout dynamics and can be experimentally validated, offering a valuable tool for qubit optimization.

Abstract: We report on a mathematical model of the photoelectric response of NV colour centres in diamond, that can be employed for sensing and quantum science information applications. Although the model applies to NV centre in diamond, it can be applied with small modifications to other semiconducting solid state qubits. In our model, we include the drift and collection of charge carriers as well as the presence of other defects via generation and recombination dynamics. Though the photoluminescence readout and the associated dynamics of the NV defect has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically, so far, there has been no precise model for photocurrent readout, including these effects. In our description, we use a multilevel-level system including mS=0, mS=+-1 ground and excited states, singlet state and the NV0 neutral state. Also, the presence of substitutional nitrogen (NS), which for example determines the spin coherence via the paramagnetic spin bath, is discussed together with presence of acceptor defects. We model the time-dependent occupation of all electronic sublevels and also consider the electronic charge transport from the Boltzmann transport equation, leading to information about the charge state transitions and recombination dynamics. ODMR and PDMR response as well as their quantum efficiencies, are calculated. On this basis, we determine an optimal parameter space for qubit operations, including the highest spin contrast and especially relate those to NS presence. The model is confirmed experimentally and can become a useful tool for optimisation of the performance of NV qubit photoelectric readout.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The monogamy of mutual information (MMI) is a quantum entropy inequality that enforces the non-positivity of tripartite information. We investigate the failure of MMI in graph states as a forbidden-subgraph phenomenon, conjecturing that every MMI-violating graph state is local-Clifford equivalent to one whose graph contains a four-star subgraph. We construct a family of star-like graphs whose states fail a specific class of MMI instances, and extend this analysis to general star topologies. Deriving adjacency matrix constraints that fix the MMI evaluation for these instances and interpreting them physically, we prove the forbidden-subgraph conjecture for this family of graphs. Finally, through an exhaustive search over graph representatives for all $8$-qubit stabilizer entropy vectors, we establish that MMI failure is not reducible to the cases within our scope.

Abstract: We investigate whether sequential unitary circuits can prepare two-dimensional chiral states, using a correspondence between sequentially prepared states, isometric tensor network states, and one-dimensional quantum channel circuits. We establish two no-go theorems, one for Gaussian fermion systems and one for generic interacting systems. In Gaussian fermion systems, the correspondence relates the defining features of chiral wave functions in their entanglement spectrum to the algebraic decaying correlations in the steady state of channel dynamics. We establish the no-go theorem by proving that local channel dynamics with translational invariance cannot support such correlations. As a direct implication, two-dimensional Gaussian fermion isometric tensor network states cannot support algebraically decaying correlations in all directions or represent a chiral state. In generic interacting systems, we establish a no-go theorem by showing that the state prepared by sequential circuits cannot host the tripartite entanglement of a chiral state due to the constraints from causality.

Abstract: We introduce a holographic framework for analyzing the steady states of repeated quantum channels with strong symmetries. Using channel-state duality, we show that the steady state of a $d$-dimensional quantum channel is holographically mapped to the boundary reduced density matrix of a $(d+1)$-dimensional wavefunction generated by a sequential unitary circuit. From this perspective, strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in the steady state arises from the anyon condensation on the boundary of a topological order in one higher dimension. The conditional mutual information (CMI) associated with SWSSB is then inherited from the bulk topological entanglement entropy. We make this duality explicit using isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) by identifying the channel's time evolution with the transfer matrix of a higher-dimensional isoTNS. Built on isoTNS, we further construct continuously tunable quantum channels that exhibit distinct mixed-state phases and transitions in the steady states.

Abstract: We formulate a continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC) algorithm to study Berry's phase on photonic quantum computers. We demonstrate that CVQC allows the simulation of charged particles with orbital angular momentum under the influence of an adiabatically changing $\vec{B}$ field. Although formulated entirely in the CVQC setting, our construction uses only passive linear-optical operations (beam splitters and phase shifts), which act identically in single-photon photonic architectures. This enables experimental realisation on the Quandella Ascella platform, where we observe the Berry's phase phenomenon with interferometric measurement. We also generalise the framework to more rapid non-adiabatic evolution. By concatenating Aharonov-Anandan cycles for opposing magnetic fields we demonstrate that one can engineer a circuit in which dynamical phases and leading non-geometric errors cancel by symmetry, leaving the intrinsically robust geometric phase contribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of compiling QAOA circuits for quantum computers with limited qubit connectivity, which is a common constraint in current quantum hardware.

Method: The method involves constructing an interaction graph with a regular structure and limited vertex degree to ensure compatibility with low-connectivity quantum architectures. This approach allows for efficient mapping of QAOA circuits, reducing compilation overhead.

Result: The implementation of the proposed method reduces the circuit depth by approximately 40% compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The paper presents an effective solution for optimizing QAOA circuit compilation on quantum devices with limited qubit connectivity, which is crucial for advancing quantum computing applications.

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) requires considered optimization problems to be translated into a compatible format. A popular transformation step in this pipeline involves the quadratization of higher-order binary optimization problems, translating them into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations through the introduction of auxiliary variables. Conventional algorithms for the selection of auxiliary variables often aim to minimize the total number of required variables without taking the constraints of the underlying quantum computer-in particular, the connectivity of its qubits-into consideration. This quickly results in interaction graphs that are incompatible with the target device, resulting in a substantial compilation overhead even with highly optimized compilers. To address this issue, this work presents a novel approach for the selection of auxiliary variables tailored for architectures with limited connectivity. By specifically constructing an interaction graph with a regular structure and a limited maximal degree of vertices, we find a way to construct QAOA circuits that can be mapped efficiently to a variety of architectures. We show that, compared to circuits constructed from a QUBO formulation using conventional auxiliary selection methods, the proposed approach reduces the circuit depth by almost 40%. An implementation of all proposed methods is publicly available at https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/problemsolver.

Abstract: Quantum thermometry aims at determining temperature with ultimate precision in the quantum regime. Standard equilibrium approaches, limited by the Quantum Fisher Information given by static energy fluctuations, lose sensitivity outside a fixed temperature window. Non-equilibrium strategies have therefore been recently proposed to overcome these limits, but their advantages are typically model-dependent or tailored for a specific purpose. This Letter establishes a general, model-independent result showing that any temperature-dependent unitary driving applied to a thermalized probe enhances its quantum Fisher information with respect to its equilibrium value. Such information gain is expressed analytically through a positive semi-definite kernel of information currents that quantify the flow of statistical distinguishability. Our results are benchmarked on a driven spin-$1/2$ thermometer, furthermore showing that resonant modulations remarkably restore the quadratic-in-time scaling of the Fisher information and allow to shift the sensitivity peak across arbitrary temperature ranges. Our findings identify external unitary control as a universal resource for precision metrology and pave the way for future implementations in quantum sensing.

Abstract: We present a high-order splitting method for simulating non-unitary dynamics by sequential real- and imaginary-time Hamiltonian evolutions. Complex-coefficient splitting methods with positive real parts are chosen for stable integration in a quantum circuit, avoiding the unstable, norm-amplifying negative steps that arise from real-coefficient splitting at high orders. The method is most beneficial for dynamics that naturally separate into unitary and dissipative components, with broad applications across science and engineering. These systems frequently admit compact spectral representations of the split operators, which we demonstrate by deriving efficient quantum circuits for simulating the damped-wave equation with up to sixth-order accuracy in time. A single sixth-order step in three dimensions on 35 trillion cells requires 1,562 CNOT gates, which can be executed within the coherence time of modern quantum processors.

TL;DR: The study investigates the impact of interfacial and bulk noise sources on the optical properties of Er$^{3+}$ ions in epitaxial thin films grown on GaAs and GaSb substrates, providing insights into controlling these noise sources for scalable quantum technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the potential applications of rare-earth ions in quantum technologies, specifically in quantum networks that require bright emitters in III-V semiconductors. The limited optical coherence due to local disorder and interfacial noise drives the need to understand and mitigate these effects.

Method: The research employs a combined approach using ab initio calculations, noise-Hamiltonian modeling, and Monte Carlo simulations. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy is used to analyze the Er$^{3+}$ ion behavior.

Result: The study reveals that Er$^{3+}$ ions at greater distances from the III-V/oxide interface exhibit a blue shift in the $Y_1ightarrow Z_1$ transition. Thermal annealing causes a redshift and narrowing of inhomogeneous linewidths, attributed to oxygen-vacancy and gallium-diffusion noise. This provides microscopic insights into disorder-induced decoherence, aiding in the control of hybrid quantum systems for scalable quantum technologies.

Conclusion: The findings offer a detailed understanding of noise mechanisms in Er$^{3+}$ ions, enabling the development of strategies to enhance optical coherence for practical quantum applications.

Abstract: Harnessing rare-earth ions in oxides for quantum networks requires integration with bright emitters in III-V semiconductors, but local disorder and interfacial noise limit their optical coherence. Here, we investigate the microscopic origins of the ensemble spectrum in Er$^{3+}$:TiO$_2$ epitaxial thin films on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Ab initio calculations combined with noise-Hamiltonian modeling and Monte Carlo simulations quantify the effects of interfacial and bulk spin noise and local strain on erbium crystal-field energies and inhomogeneous linewidths. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy reveals that Er$^{3+}$ ions positioned at increasing distances from the III-V/oxide interface produce a systematic blue shift of the $Y_1\rightarrow Z_1$ transition, consistent with strain relaxation predicted by theory. Thermal annealing produces a compensating redshift and linewidth narrowing, isolating the roles of oxygen-vacancy and gallium-diffusion noise. These results provide microscopic insight into disorder-driven decoherence, offering pathways for precise control of hybrid quantum systems for scalable quantum technologies.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for quantum simulation, providing insights into realistic scaling for future quantum computers and classical algorithms.

Abstract: We estimate the run-time and energy consumption of simulating non-equilibrium dynamics on neutral atom quantum computers in analog mode, directly comparing their performance to state-of-the-art classical methods, namely Matrix Product States and Neural Quantum States. By collecting both experimental data from a quantum processing unit (QPU) in analog mode and numerical benchmarks, we enable accurate predictions of run-time and energy consumption for large-scale simulations on both QPUs and classical systems through fitting of theoretical scaling laws. Our analysis shows that neutral atom devices are already operating in a competitive regime, achieving comparable or superior performance to classical approaches while consuming significantly less energy. These results demonstrate the potential of analog neutral atom quantum computing for energy-efficient simulation and highlight a viable path toward sustainable computational strategies.

Abstract: Squeezed reservoirs provide a powerful means of engineering nonclassical noise and controlling irreversible dynamics in open quantum systems. Here we develop a comprehensive analysis of two coupled harmonic oscillators driven by independent squeezed baths, focusing on the emergence of coherence-driven entropy flow and the structure of exceptional points (EPs) in the corresponding Lindblad dynamics. Working entirely within the Gaussian formalism, we derive closed-form evolution equations for the covariance matrix and show that squeezing induces entropy generation only at *second order* in the anomalous correlations, a nonlinear mechanism absent in thermal environments. This entropy flow is accompanied by a rich non-Hermitian structure: by scanning the squeezing parameters we uncover a characteristic "exceptional-point fan" in the (M1, M2) plane, which separates a narrow PT-unbroken region of oscillatory dynamics from broad PT-broken sectors in which one normal mode becomes purely overdamped. This geometric organization of EPs reveals that PT symmetry survives only when the two reservoirs squeeze opposite quadratures, and is generically broken for in-phase squeezing. Our analysis establishes squeezed reservoirs as a natural setting where information-bearing noise drives irreversible behavior through coherent pathways, and lays the groundwork for experimentally accessible probes of entropy flow and critical mode behavior in more complex open systems.

Abstract: The proposed vacuum beam guide (VBG) represents an innovation in the field of quantum channel technology, guaranteeing an ultra-low level of attenuation and a broad transmission linewidth, which offers an unprecedented quantum capacity exceeding Tera-qubits per second on a continental scale. However, its stability in terms of interferometry remains unexamined. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive error model that captures the intrinsic phase noise power spectral density associated with VBG, thereby revealing the advantages of VBG for interferometry over existing techniques. This model facilitates a comprehensive characterization of VBG as a photonic quantum channel, thereby facilitating a detailed investigation of its potential. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the feasibility of VBG and its expected performance in a wide range of quantum applications.

Abstract: Given a tensor network state, how can we determine conserved operators (including Hamiltonians) for which the state is an eigenstate? We answer this question by presenting a method to extract geometrically $k$-local conserved operators that have the given infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS) in 2D as an (approximate) eigenstate. The key ingredient is the evaluation of the static structure factors of multi-site operators through differentiating the generating function. Despite the approximation errors, we show that our method is still able to extract from exact or variational iPEPS to good precision both frustration-free and non-frustration-free parent Hamiltonians that are beyond the standard construction and obtain better locality. In particular, we find a 4-site-plaquette local Hamiltonian that approximately has the short-range RVB state as the ground state. Moreover, we find a Hamiltonian that has the deformed toric code state at any string tension as excited eigenstates at the same energy, which might be potential candidates for quantum many-body scars.

Conclusion: 累积量展开是一种有用的量子近似方法，但也存在其局限性，具体适用性取决于问题本身。

Abstract: The configuration space, i.e. the Hilbert space, of compound quantum systems grows exponentially with the number of its subsystems: its dimensionality is given by the product of the dimensions of its constituents. Therefore a full quantum treatment is rarely possible analytically and can be carried out numerically for fairly small systems only. Fortunately, in order to obtain interesting physics, approximations often very well suffice. One of these approximations is given by the cumulants expansion, where expectation values of products of operators are approximated by products of expectation values of said operators, neglecting higher-order correlations. The lowest order of this approximation is widely known as the mean field approximation and used routinely throughout quantum physics. Despite its ubiquitous presence, a general criterion for applicability and convergence properties of higher order cumulants expansions remains to be found. In this paper, we discuss two problems in quantum electrodynamics and quantum information, namely the collective radiative dissipation of a dipole-dipole interacting chain of atoms and the factorization of a bi-prime by annealing in an adiabatic quantum simulator. In the first case we find smooth, convergence behavior, where the approximation performs increasingly better with higher orders, while in the latter going beyond mean field turns out useless and, even for small system sizes, we are puzzled by numerically challenging and partly non-physical solutions.

Abstract: We propose a model of binary random number generator (RNG) based on a Brillouin optomechanical system. The device uses a hard excitation mode in a Brillouin optomechanical system, where thermal noise induces spontaneous transitions between two stable states in the hard excitation mode. We demonstrate the existence of an amplitude criterion for observing these transitions and show that the probability distribution of their occurrence in the non-generating and generating states can be precisely controlled by the amplitude of an external pump wave. At the same time, the use of a low-intensity seed wave allows for the control of the transition times between states. We demonstrate that the proposed random number generator successfully passes the standard tests NIST SP 800-22. The obtained result opens a way for development of an all-optical integrated True RNG, generating a sequence of random bits with equal probability.

Abstract: We investigate how detuning and auxiliary qubits collaboratively enhance quantum synchronization in a dissipative multi-qubit system that is coupled to a structured reservoir. Our findings indicate that while detuning is ineffective in Markovian environments, it emerges as a powerful control parameter in the non-Markovian regime, where environmental memory facilitates long-lived phase coherence. It is shown that adding more auxiliary qubits amplifies this effect by strengthening the collective coupling and enhancing memory, resulting in robust phase locking within the system. Analysis using the Husimi Q-function, synchronization measures, and Arnold tongue structures reveals a detuning-induced enhancement of phase locking, which significantly improves stability compared to the resonance case. These results establish a cooperative control strategy where detuning actively engineers phases, while auxiliary qubits provide the necessary memory for sustained synchronization.

Abstract: We develop an approach for understanding the dynamics of open quantum systems by analyzing individual quantum trajectories in the eigenbasis of the Liouvillian superoperator. From trajectory-eigenstate overlaps, we construct a quasiprobability distribution that characterizes the degree of localization of the trajectories in the Liouvillian eigenbasis. Contrary to the common wisdom that late-time dynamics are governed solely by the steady state and the slowest-decaying modes, we show that trajectories can remain well spread over transient eigenstates deep within the bulk of the Liouvillian spectrum even at late times. We demonstrate this explicitly using numerical simulations of interacting spin chains and bosonic systems. Moreover, we find that the delocalization of the trajectory strongly correlates with the purity of the trajectory-averaged steady state, establishing a further link between the trajectory and ensemble pictures of open quantum dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the influence of gauge fields on NHSE is crucial for applications in transport, sensing, and topological classification.

Method: A theoretical framework based on the anisotropic Harper-Hofstadter model is developed to study how magnetic fields control NHSE in different systems.

Result: Magnetic fields can suppress the geometric skin effect in reciprocal systems and preserve skin localization in nonreciprocal systems by distinct mechanisms such as bulk localization or effective reciprocity restoration.

Conclusion: The research reveals that magnetic fields have specific mechanisms to control NHSE, which is vital for the design of magnetic-sensing devices and topological states.

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) -- the anomalous boundary accumulation of an extensive number of bulk modes -- has emerged as a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics, with broad implications for transport, sensing, and topological classification. A central open question is how magnetic or synthetic gauge fields influence this boundary phenomenon. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for magnetic control of the NHSE along line boundaries in two-dimensional single-band lattices. Using a non-Hermitian extension of the anisotropic Harper--Hofstadter model as a representative example, we show that magnetic fields suppress the geometric skin effect in reciprocal models, whereas skin localization can persist in nonreciprocal systems. The analysis disentangles the interplay of flux, nonreciprocity, and boundary geometry, revealing that magnetic fields mitigate or suppress the NHSE through distinct physical mechanisms -- such as bulk localization via Landau or Anderson physics, or the restoration of effective reciprocity. In particular, the geometry-dependent skin effect in reciprocal systems is found to be fragile against even weak magnetic fields.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for quantum wavelet shrinkage, extending classical denoising ideas into the quantum domain. Shrinkage is interpreted as a completely positive trace-preserving process, so attenuation of coefficients is carried out through controlled decoherence rather than nonlinear thresholding. Phase damping and ancilla-driven constructions realize this behavior coherently and show that statistical adaptivity and quantum unitarity can be combined within a single circuit model. The same physical mechanisms that reduce quantum coherence, such as dephasing and amplitude damping, are repurposed as programmable resources for noise suppression. Practical demonstrations implemented with Qiskit illustrate how circuits and channels emulate coefficientwise attenuation, and all examples are provided as Jupyter notebooks in the companion GitHub repository. Encoding schemes for amplitude, phase, and hybrid representations are examined in relation to transform coherence and measurement feasibility, and realizations suited to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices are discussed. The work provides a conceptual and experimental link between wavelet-based statistical inference and quantum information processing, and shows how engineered decoherence can act as an operational surrogate for classical shrinkage.

Abstract: We prove that the PARITY protocol is optimal for a general class of non-adaptive distillation protocols of all $n$ player nonlocal boxes (NLBs) based on XOR games. The conditional distributions generated by these NLBs are assumed to have trivial local marginals. We also show that already for $n=2$, PARITY is no longer optimal if the local marginals are non-trivial. The OR protocol is shown to perform better and in the process also slightly extend the known correlations that collapse communication complexity. This emphasizes again the need to understand the local properties of nonlocal systems in order to obtain a better characterization of the global behavior. We conclude by showing an equivalence between adaptive distillation protocols that use identical NLBs and PARITY protocol using nonidentical NLBs.

Abstract: Fault tolerance is widely regarded as indispensable for achieving scalable and reliable quantum computing. However, the spacetime overhead required for fault-tolerant quantum computating remains prohibitively large. A critical challenge arises in many quantum algorithms with Clifford + $\varphi$ compiling, where logical rotation gates $R_{Z_L}(\varphi)$ serve as essential components. The Eastin-Knill theorem prevents their transversal implementation in quantum error correction codes and necessitating resource-intensive workarounds through T-gate compilation combined with magic state distillation and injection. In this work, we consider error-structure-tailored fault tolerance, where fault-tolerance conditions are analyzed by combining perturbative analysis of realistic dissipative noise processes with the structural properties of stabilizer codes. Based on this framework, we design 1-fault-tolerant continuous-angle rotation gates in stabilizer codes, implemented via dispersive-coupling Hamiltonians. Our approach could circumvent the need for T-gate compilation and distillation, offering a hardware-efficient solution that maintains simplicity, minimizes physical footprint, and requires only nearest-neighbor interactions. Integrating with recent small-angle-state preparation techniques, we can suppress the gate error to $91|\varphi| p^2$ for small rotation angle (where p denotes the physical error rate). For current achievable hardware parameters ($p=10^{-3}$), this enables reliable execution of over $10^7$ small-angle rotations when $|\varphi|\approx 10^{-3}$, meeting the requirements of many near-term quantum applications. Compared to the 15-to-1 magic state distillation and magic state cultivation approaches, our method reduces spacetime resource costs by factors of 1337.5 and 43.6, respectively, for a Heisenberg Hamiltonian simulation task under realistic hardware assumptions.

Abstract: Virtual maps allow the simulation of quantum operations by combining physical processes with classical post-processing. Recent work on virtual unitary covariant broadcasting has shown, however, that such maps remain impractical for observable estimation tasks due to poor sample efficiency. Here we investigate whether relaxing the symmetry requirements can improve operational performance, focusing on virtual phase-covariant quantum broadcasting for qubits. We show that imposing phase-covariance, flip covariance, permutation invariance, and classical consistency fully determines the structure of the broadcasting map. Within this family, we identify the unique map that minimizes the simulation cost, and we prove that both the simulation cost and the distance to the closest CPTP map are strictly smaller than in the unitary covariant setting. We also demonstrate that the closest physical map is the optimal phase-covariant cloning channel, mirroring the relation between unitary covariant broadcasting and universal cloning. Despite these improvements, the resulting virtual broadcasting map remains sample-inefficient and is therefore still operationally impractical.

Motivation: Quantum optimization algorithms like DQI are promising but sensitive to hardware noise. Need noise-aware approaches for near-term implementable solutions.

Method: Append a unitary kernel to DQI to reshape problem energy landscape, then formalize improvement through noise-weighted metric.

Result: k-DQI achieves higher decoding success rates under noise, demonstrated in OPI and LDPC-like problems with efficient circuits.

Conclusion: Builds a practical framework for near-term quantum advantage.

Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) promises superpolynomial speedups for structured optimization; however, its practical realization is often hindered by significant sensitivity to hardware noise and spectral dispersion. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kernelized Decoded Quantum Interferometry (k-DQI)}, a unified framework that integrates spectral engineering directly into the quantum circuit architecture. By inserting a unitary kernel prior to the interference step, k-DQI actively reshapes the problem's energy landscape, concentrating the solution mass into a ``decoder-friendly'' low-frequency head. We formalize this advantage through a novel robustness metric, the noise-weighted head mass $Σ_K$, and prove a \textbf{Monotonic Improvement Theorem}, which establishes that maximizing $Σ_K$ guarantees higher decoding success rates under local depolarizing noise. We substantiate these theoretical gains in Optimal Polynomial Interpolation (OPI) and LDPC-like problems, demonstrating that kernel tuning functions as a ``spectral lens'' to recover signal otherwise lost to isotropic noise. Crucially, we provide explicit, efficient circuit realizations using Chirp and Linear Canonical Transform (LCT) kernels that achieve significant boosts in effective signal-to-noise ratio with negligible depth overhead ($\tilde{O}(n)$ to $\tilde{O}(n^2)$). Collectively, these results reframe DQI from a static algorithm into a tunable, noise-aware protocol suited for near-term error-corrected environments.

Abstract: Quantum computing is a promising technology that accelerates the partial differential equations solver for practical problems. The reconstruction of solutions (i.e., the readout of quantum states) remains a crucial problem, although numerous efficient quantum algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, we propose and compare several efficient readout methods in the real and the Fourier space. The Fourier space readout (FSR) and the proposed approximate real space readout (ARSR) methods are currently the most efficient and practical ones for the purpose of reconstructing continuous real-valued functions. In contrast, the quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) based methods (especially in the Fourier space) are favorable for mid-term/far-term quantum devices. Besides, we apply the methods for benchmark solutions in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and demonstrate great improvements compared to the conventional sampling method for large grid numbers. Equipped with efficient readout methods, we further show that a 2D Burgers' equation can be solved efficiently without using the expensive strategy of linearization. It suggests the potential quantum advantages for some practical applications on mid-term quantum devices.

Motivation: Quantum computation relies on fast and efficient state transport. Adiabatic transport, while accurate, is too slow for practical quantum operations. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a new protocol.

Method: The protocol combines forward-and backward-moving trap potentials. It was tested under a harmonic trap potential and compared with forward-moving-only methods.

Result: The protocol approaches the quantum speed limit and outperforms traditional forward-moving-only methods. Squeezed coherent state evolution also shows enhanced performance.

Conclusion: This protocol provides new insights and opportunities for rapid state transport, advancing quantum control and operations.

Abstract: Fast coherent state transport is essential to quantum computation and quantum information processing. While an adiabatic transport of atomic qubits guarantees a high fidelity of the state preparation, it requires a long timescale that defies efficient quantum operations. Here, we propose an adaptable and fast bang-bang-bang (BBB) protocol, utilizing a combination of forwardand backward-moving trap potentials, to expedite the coherent state transport. This protocol approaches the quantum speed limit under a harmonic trap potential, surpassing the performance by the forward-moving-only potential protocols. We further showcase the advantage of applying squeezed coherent state evolution under a deeper potential followed by a weaker one, where a design of symmetric squeezing potential transports promotes an even shorter timescale for genuine state preparation. Our protocols outperform conventional forward-moving-only methods, providing new insights and opportunities for rapid state transport and preparation, ultimately advancing the capabilities of quantum control and quantum operations.

Abstract: Superconducting parametric amplifiers (SPAs) are critical components for ultralow-noise qubit readout in quantum computing, addressing the critical challenge of amplifying weak quantum signals without introducing noise that degrades coherence and computational fidelity. Unlike classical amplifiers, SPAs can achieve or closely approach quantum-limited performance, specifically the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) of half a photon of added noise for phase-preserving amplification. The core principle of SPAs relies on parametric amplification, where energy is transferred from a strong pump tone to a weak input signal through non-dissipative nonlinear mixing processes. This is enabled by intrinsic nonlinearities in superconducting materials, primarily kinetic inductance in thin films (e.g., NbTiN, Al) and, more significantly, the Josephson effect in Josephson junctions. These nonlinear elements facilitate frequency mixing (three-wave or four-wave mixing) and can operate in phase-preserving or phase-sensitive amplification modes, with the latter allowing for noise squeezing below the SQL. This chapter emphasizes the significant role of resonator design in determining critical SPA performance metrics such as gain, bandwidth, and noise characteristics. It details both lumped-element (LC) and distributed-element (coplanar waveguide, CPW) resonators, discussing their unique properties, suitability for different frequency ranges, and the importance of achieving high-quality factors (Q) for efficient energy storage and minimal loss. A practical design and simulation of a meandered quarterwavelength CPW resonator coupled to a feed line is presented, illustrating how precise control over geometric parameters optimizes resonant frequency, coupling strength, and quality factor for high-fidelity qubit state discrimination.

Abstract: We present the experimental implementation of a three-time-bin phase-encoded Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (TF-QKD) protocol using a Sagnac-based star-topology plug-and-play architecture. The proposed encoding method leverages the relative phases of three consecutive time bins to encode two bits per signal. The Sagnac loop configuration enables self-compensation for both phase and polarisation drifts, eliminating the need for active stabilisation. However, field deployments are subject to rapid phase fluctuations caused by external vibrations, which can degrade interference visibility. We used the first time bin for real-time phase-fluctuation monitoring. Although this monitoring reduces the effective key generation rate, the system achieved a secure key rate of approximately 1.5e-5 bits per pulse, with a corresponding visibility of up to 87% over a 50 km asymmetric optical fibre channel. These results demonstrate the practicality, stability, and scalability of the proposed three-time-bin TF-QKD protocol for real-world quantum communication networks.

Conclusion: Fixed-round QAOA在组合优化中的表现及计算复杂度问题得到了系统性分析，提出了新的评估方法，并扩展到更广泛的BUCO问题，为未来研究提供了新的方向和工具。

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is widely studied for combinatorial optimization and has achieved significant advances both in theoretical guarantees and practical performance, yet for general combinatorial optimization problems the expected performance and classical simulability of fixed-round QAOA remain unclear. Focusing on Max-Cut, we first show that for general graphs and any fixed round $p\ge2$, exactly evaluating the expectation of fixed-round QAOA at prescribed angles is $\mathrm{NP}$-hard, and that approximating this expectation within additive error $2^{-O(n)}$ in the number $n$ of vertices is already $\mathrm{NP}$-hard. To evaluate the expected performance of QAOA, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm leveraging tree decomposition. As a byproduct, when the $p$-local treewidth grows at most logarithmically with the number of vertices, this yields a polynomial-time \emph{exact} evaluation algorithm in the graph size $n$. Beyond Max-Cut, we extend the framework to general Binary Unconstrained Combinatorial Optimization (BUCO). Finally, we provide reproducible evaluations for rounds up to $p=3$ on representative structured families, including the generalized Petersen graph $GP(15,2)$, double-layer triangular 2-lifts, and the truncated icosahedron graph $C_{60}$, and report cut ratios while benchmarking against locality-matched classical baselines.

Conclusion: 这类研究能更有效地指导量子测量和信息处理的动作.

Abstract: We study quantum measurement retrodiction using the principle of minimum change. For quantum-to-classical measurement channels, we show that all standard quantum divergences select the same retrodictive update, yielding a unique and divergence-independent quantum Bayesian inverse for any POVM and prior state. Using this update, we construct a symmetric joint distribution for pairs of POVMs and introduce the mutual retrodictability, for which we also derive a general upper bound that depends only on the prior state and holds for all measurements. This structure leads to two retrodictive entropic uncertainty relations, expressed directly in terms of the prior state and the POVMs, but valid independently of the retrodictive framework and fully compatible with the conventional operational interpretation of entropic uncertainty relations. Finally, we benchmark these relations numerically and find that they provide consistently tighter bounds than existing entropic uncertainty relations over broad classes of measurements and states.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error correcting code uses a bosonic mode to encode a logical qubit, and has the attractive property that its logical Clifford gates can be implemented using Gaussian unitary gates. In contrast, a direct unitary implementation of the ${T}$ gate using the cubic phase gate has been shown to have logical error floor unless the GKP codestate has a biased noise profile [1]. In this work, we propose a method for on-demand noise biasing based on a standard GKP error correction circuit. This on-demand biasing circuit can be used to bias the GKP codestate before a $T$ gate and return it to a non-biased state afterwards. With the on-demand biasing circuit, we prove that the logical error rate of the $T$ gate can be made arbitrarily small as the quality of the GKP codestates increases. We complement our proof with a numerical investigation of the cubic phase gate subject to a phenomenological noise model, showing that the ${T}$ gate can achieve average gate fidelities above $99\%$ with 12 dB of GKP squeezing without the use of postselection. Moreover, we develop a formalism for finding optimal unitary representations of logical diagonal gates in higher levels of the Clifford hierarchy that is based on a framework of ``polynomial phase stabilizers'' whose exponents are polynomial functions of one of the quadrature operators. This formalism naturally extends to multi-qubit logical gates and even to number-phase bosonic codes, providing a powerful algebraic tool for analyzing non-Clifford gates in bosonic quantum codes.

Motivation: The motivation is to investigate analogies between classical and quantum systems, specifically in photonics, to understand how structural design controls photon tunneling and its implications for applications.

Method: The study uses experimental setups with coupled resonators, numerical simulations, and a circuit quantum electrodynamics model.

Result: The results show how changing the resonator spacing affects tunneling, and the model accurately predicts the system's behavior, consistent with experimental findings.

Conclusion: The research establishes a classical platform for studying chiral quantum phenomena and paves the way for applications in reconfigurable devices and quantum communication.

Abstract: We investigate photon tunneling in a pair of coupled inverted circular split-ring microwave resonators with four discrete chiral orientations. By varying the spacing between the resonators, we observe strong modulation of the transmission spectra, including mode splitting, interference effects, and the formation of dark states. Measurements on fabricated devices show clear signatures of hybridization that depend on both chirality and proximity, and these results are consistent with full-wave electromagnetic simulations. To describe the observed behavior, we develop a circuit quantum electrodynamics model that captures the dependence of the coupling strength on geometry and the reversal of its sign. Although the experimental excitation is classical, the system reproduces features expected from two quantized harmonic oscillators, providing a classical analogue of a chiral quantum hybrid platform. The ability to control photon tunneling through structural design and excitation parameters suggests potential applications in reconfigurable photonic devices, quantum communication, chiral sensing, and polarization-selective signal processing.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of the Lorentz transformation on the measures of quantum coherence in an entangled atomic system. Here, we consider the effect of this relativistic boosts on two-particle entangled generalized Gaussian wave packets in two scenarios. In the first scenario, we consider that the relativistic boost affects the one particle and other remains unaffected while in the second scenario, we consider that both the particles are affected by the effect of the relativistic boost. The coherence of the wave function as measured by the boosted observer is studied as a function of the boost parameter and the width of the Gaussian wave packets. Using various formulations of coherence, it is shown that in general the coherence decays with increase in the width of the Gaussian wave packet, higher values of boost parameter, and the number of particles on which boost is applied.

Abstract: In quasi-Hermitian quantum mechanics (QHQM) of unitary systems, an optimal, calculation-friendly form of Hamiltonian is generally non-Hermitian, $H \neq H^\dagger$. This makes its physical interpretation ambiguous. Without altering $H$, this ambiguity is resolved by specifying a nontrivial inner-product metric $Θ$ in Hilbert space. Here, we focus on an alternative strategy: transforming $H$ into a Hermitian form via the Dyson map $Ω: H \to \mathfrak{h}$. This construction of the Hermitian isospectral twin $\mathfrak{h}$ of $H$ does not only restore the conventional correspondence principle between quantum and classical physics, but it also provides a framework for the exhaustive classification of all admissible probabilistic interpretations of quantum systems in QHQM framework.

The protocol harnesses coherent excitation-exchange-deexcitation dynamics between the qubit and the Rydberg states within a single and smooth laser pulse, in the presence of strong dipole-dipole interactions. We utilize optimal control methods to achieve theoretical gate fidelities and durations comparable to blockade-based gates in the presence of relevant noise, while extending the effective interaction range by an order of magnitude. This enables entanglement well beyond the blockade radius, offering a route toward fast, high-connectivity quantum processors.

Conclusion: 这项研究为量子存储提供了新的理论框架和实验平台，为量子热力学和超导电路等领域的开发开辟了可能性。

Abstract: Exceptional points are spectral singularities where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors collapse onto a single mode, causing the system behavior to shift abruptly and making it highly responsive to even small perturbations. Although widely studied in optical and quantum systems, using them for energy storage in quantum systems has been difficult because existing approaches rely on gain, precise balanced loss, or explicitly non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a quantum energy-storage mechanism that realizes exceptional-point physics in a fully passive, physically consistent open quantum system. Instead of amplification, we use trace-preserving reservoir engineering to create an effective complex interaction between a charging mode and a storage mode through a dissipative mediator, generating an exceptional point directly in the drift matrix of the Heisenberg-Langevin equations while preserving complete positivity. The resulting dynamics exhibit two regimes: a stable phase where the stored energy saturates, and a broken phase where energy grows exponentially under a bounded coherent drive. This rapid charging arises from dissipative interference that greatly boosts energy flow between the modes without gain media or nonlinear amplification. The mechanism is compatible with optomechanical devices, superconducting circuits, and magnonic systems, offering a practical route to fast, robust, and scalable quantum energy-storage technologies and new directions in quantum thermodynamics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum error correction typically requires repeated syndrome extraction due to measurement noise, which results in substantial time overhead in fault-tolerant computation. Single-shot error correction aims to suppress errors using only one round of syndrome extraction. However, for most codes, it requires high-weight checks, which significantly degrade, and often eliminate, single-shot performance at the circuit level. In this work, we introduce local single-shot checks, where we impose constraints on check weights. Using a dynamic measurement scheme, we show that the number of required measurement rounds can be reduced by a factor determined by this constraint. As an example, we show through numerical simulation that our scheme can improve decoding performance compared to conventional checks when using sliding-window decoding with a reduced window size under circuit-level noise models for toric codes. Our work provides a new direction for constructing checks that can reduce time overhead in large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is revolutionizing cryptography by promising information-theoretic security through the immutable laws of quantum mechanics. Yet, the challenge of transforming these idealized security models into practical, resilient systems remains a pressing issue, especially as quantum computing evolves. In this review, we critically dissect and synthesize the latest advancements in QKD protocols and their security vulnerabilities, with a strong emphasis on rigorous security proofs. We actively categorize contemporary QKD schemes into three key classes: uncertainty principle-based protocols (e.g., BB84), hybrid architectures that enable secure direct communication (eg, three-stage protocol), and continuous-variable frameworks. We further include two modern classes of QKD protocols, namely Twin-field QKD and Device-Independent QKD, both of which were developed to have practical implementations over the last decade. Moreover, we highlight important experimental breakthroughs and innovative mitigation strategies, including the deployment of advanced Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs), that significantly enhance channel fidelity and system robustness. By mapping the current landscape, from sophisticated quantum attacks to state-of-the-art error correction methods, this review fills an important gap in the literature. To bring everything together, the relevance of this review concerning quantum augmented networks (QuANets) is also presented. This allows the readers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the security promises of quantum key distribution from theoretical proofs to experimental validations.

The GF multiplication circuit achieves a gate complexity of O(m^{	ext{log}_2{3}}), surpassing the previous O(m^2) bound by using an efficient O(m) circuit for multiplication by the constant polynomial 1+x^{	ext{ceil}(m/2)}, which is based on Van Hoof's construction. This results in a significant improvement in the implementation of multiplication for practical values of m. For GF division, the complexity is reduced from O(m^2 	ext{log}(m)) to O(m^2 	ext{log} 	ext{log}(m)/	ext{log}(m)) by selecting irreducible polynomials that allow efficient implementation of both constant polynomial multiplication and field squaring operations. The paper also demonstrates practical advantages for cryptographically relevant values of m and explores the complexity of implementing square roots of linear reversible unitaries, finding that they may require asymptotically deeper circuits than the original unitaries.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to improve the efficiency of quantum circuits for fundamental operations in quantum computing, which are essential for various quantum algorithms. The paper focuses on optimizing GF$(2^m)$ multiplication and division, which are critical components in many quantum algorithms, particularly in cryptography and error-correction. By reducing the gate count complexity, the paper aims to make these operations more practical for implementation on quantum computers.

Method: The paper presents a systematic approach to optimizing GF$(2^m)$ multiplication and division. The authors developed an efficient O(m) circuit for multiplication by the constant polynomial 1+x^{	ext{ceil}(m/2)}, which is based on Van Hoof's construction. They then built upon this to create optimized circuits for both multiplication and division, using specific irreducible polynomials to reduce the gate count complexity for division.

The division circuit achieves a gate count complexity of O(m^2 	ext{log} 	ext{log}(m)/	ext{log}(m)), which is a substantial reduction compared to the previous O(m^2 	ext{log}(m)) bound. The paper also demonstrates that the new circuits are particularly advantageous for cryptographically relevant values of m, and that the implementation of square roots of linear reversible unitaries may require deeper circuits than the original unitaries.

Conclusion: In summary, the paper presents important optimizations for GF$(2^m)$ multiplication and division, which are critical components in many quantum algorithms. The improved gate count complexities demonstrate that these operations can be performed more efficiently, making them more practical for implementation on quantum computers. The results are particularly relevant for cryptographic applications and for implementing square roots of linear reversible unitaries, which may require asymptotically deeper circuits than the original unitaries.

Abstract: We present optimized quantum circuits for GF$(2^m)$ multiplication and division operations, which are essential computing primitives in various quantum algorithms. Our ancilla-free GF multiplication circuit has the gate count complexity of $O(m^{\log_2{3}})$, an improvement over the previous best bound of $O(m^2)$. This was achieved by developing an efficient $O(m)$ circuit for multiplication by the constant polynomial $1+x^{\lceil{m/2}\rceil}$, a key component of Van Hoof's construction. This asymptotic reduction translates to a factor of 100+ improvement of the $\cnotgate$ gate counts in the implementation of the multiplication by the constant for parameters $m$ of practical importance. For the GF division, we reduce gate count complexity from $O(m^2 \log(m))$ to $O(m^2 \log \log(m)/\log(m))$ by selecting irreducible polynomials that enable efficient implementation of both the constant polynomial multiplication and field squaring operations. We demonstrate practical advantages for cryptographically relevant values of $m$. Additionally, we explore the complexity of implementing square roots of linear reversible unitaries and demonstrate that a root, although itself still a linear reversible transformation, can require asymptotically deeper circuit implementations than the original unitary.

Abstract: Optimal routing in quantum-repeater networks requires finding the best path that connects a pair of end nodes. Most previous work on routing in quantum networks assumes utility functions that are isotonic, meaning that the ordering of two paths does not change when extending both with the same edge. However, we show that utility functions that take into account both the rate and quality of the entanglement generation (e.g., the secret-key rate) are often non-isotonic. This makes pathfinding difficult as classical algorithms such as Dijkstra's become unsuitable, with the state of the art for quantum networks being an exhaustive search over all possible paths. In this work we present improved algorithms. First, we present two best-first-search algorithms that use destination-aware merit functions for faster convergence. One of these provably finds the best path, while the other uses heuristics to achieve an effectively sublinear scaling of the query count in the network size while in practice always finding a close-to-optimal path. Second, we present metaheuristic algorithms (simulated annealing and a genetic algorithm) that enable tuning a tradeoff between path quality and computational overhead. While we focus on swap-ASAP quantum repeaters for concreteness, our algorithms are readily generalized to different repeater schemes and models.

Motivation: Improving the accuracy and reliability of inter-spacecraft ranging systems is crucial for future gravity missions. This paper presents a novel architecture that does not require active communication and shows promising results for Mars or Earth-based missions like GRACE.

Conclusion: A novel interferometric architecture for gravity missions is demonstrated, achieving nanometer-level accuracy for inter-spacecraft ranging without requiring active communication. The system's stability and robustness make it a promising solution for future missions.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a novel interferometric architecture for next-generation gravity missions, featuring a laser ranging interferometer (LRI) that enables monoaxial transmission and reception of laser beams between two optical benches with a heterodyne frequency of 7.3 MHz. Active beam steering loops, utilizing differential wavefront sensing (DWS) signals, ensure co-alignment between the receiving (RX) beam and the transmitting (TX) beam. With spacecraft attitude jitter simulated by hexapod-driven rotations, the interferometric link achieves a pointing stability below 10 urad/$\mathrm{\sqrt{Hz}}$ in the frequency range between 2 mHz and 0.5 Hz, and the fluctuation of the TX beam's polarization state results in a reduction of 0.14\% in the carrier-to-noise-density ratio over a 15-hour continuous measurement. Additionally, tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling is experimentally investigated using the periodic scanning of the hexapod. Experimental results show that the on-axis LRI enables the inter-spacecraft ranging measurements with nanometer accuracy, making it a potential candidate for future GRACE-like missions.

Abstract: Space-time metamaterials are redefining wave engineering by enabling fully dynamic four-dimensional control of electromagnetic fields, allowing simultaneous manipulation of frequency, amplitude, momentum, and propagation direction. This unified functionality moves well beyond reciprocity-breaking mechanisms, marking a fundamental transition from static media to polychromatic, energy-efficient wave processors. This article establishes dispersion engineering as the core design paradigm for these dynamic systems. We show that the dispersion relation, linking frequency and wavenumber, serves as a master blueprint governing exotic wave phenomena such as nonreciprocity, beam splitting, asymmetric frequency conversion, amplification, spatial decomposition, and momentum bandgaps. By analyzing analytical dispersion surfaces and isofrequency contours in subluminal, luminal, and superluminal modulation regimes, we reveal how tailored spatiotemporal modulation orchestrates controlled energy flow among harmonic modes. We further demonstrate how this framework directly informs practical device operation, highlighting advanced implementations including angular-frequency beam multiplexing in superconducting Josephson junction arrays. Combining insights from wave theory, numerical modeling, and experimental realization, this work provides a comprehensive roadmap for leveraging dispersion engineering to design next-generation metamaterials for wireless communication, quantum technologies, and integrated photonics.

Abstract: The dual-fiber optical trap, owing to its high sensitivity and facile miniaturization, holds significant actual application value in fields such as high-precision metrology of mechanical quantities and biological manipulation. The positional stability of the trapped particle is pivotal to system performance, directly setting the measurement noise floor and operational precision. In this work, we observe bistability and hysteresis in the axial equilibrium position of a 10-um diameter SiO2 microsphere. This bistability arises from optical interference between the fiber ends and the microsphere, creating multiple potential wells. Experimental results demonstrate that the microsphere's transition rate can be effectively modulated through precise control of the trapping laser power. Furthermore, the incorporation of transverse misalignment has effectively eradicated bistability, thereby substantially improving positional stability throughout the entire optical trapping region. This suppression successfully reduced the system's residual positional uncertainty to the thermal noise limit. Consequently, this research will enhance the precision of microparticle manipulation and the sensitivity of sensing in dual-fiber optical trap systems.

Abstract: Quantum sensors based on the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond are leading platforms for high-sensitivity magnetometry with nanometer-scale resolution. State-of-the-art implementations, however, typically rely on bulky free-space optics or sacrifice spatial resolution to achieve high sensitivities. Here, we realize an integrated platform that overcomes this trade-off by fabricating monolithic whispering-gallery-mode cavities from a diamond chip containing a high density of NV centers and by evanescently coupling excitation to and photoluminescence from the cavity using a tapered optical fiber. Employing a lock-in-amplified Ramsey magnetometry scheme, we achieve a photon-shot-noise-limited DC sensitivity of $58\,\text{nT}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ -- the best sensitivity reported to date for a nanofabricated cavity-based magnetometer. The microscopic cavity size enables sub-micrometer-scale spatial resolution and low-power operation, while fiber-coupling provides a path to scalable on-chip integration. Arrays of such sensors could enable NV-NMR spectroscopy of sub-nanoliter samples, new magnetic-gradient imaging architectures, and compact biosensing platforms.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper investigates the fluctuations of the enhancement factor in wavefront shaping, utilizing a combination of experiments, simulations, and analytical methods from random matrix theory. The developed framework surpasses the Marčenko-Pastur law by accurately predicting the mean enhancement and its fluctuations in finite-channel scenarios where long-range mesoscopic correlations are negligible, such as in weak scattering media. In strongly scattering media, the enhanced framework reveals giant fluctuations in the enhancement factor, attributed to long-range mesoscopic correlations. The methodology offers a fundamental approach to quantify long-range correlations in wavefront-shaping-based systems with limited inputs. Applied to fields like biomedical imaging, optical metrology, trapping, and scattering media communication, the findings provide a tool for predicting the enhancement factor and its minimum fluctuations, crucial for these applications.

Motivation: Understanding the statistical properties of wavefront shaping is essential for optimizing systems in fields like biomedical imaging, optical communication, and metrology, where precise control of light is critical.

Method: The paper employs a multidisciplinary approach combining experimental setups, numerical simulations, and analytical techniques from random matrix theory to study the distribution of the enhancement factor.

Result: The study establishes a framework that accurately predicts the mean enhancement and its fluctuations under various conditions, particularly highlighting the role of long-range mesoscopic correlations in inducing giant fluctuations in the strongly scattering regime.

Conclusion: This work provides a theoretical foundation for quantifying long-range correlations in wavefront-shaping systems, offering practical applications in enhancing imaging and communication technologies by accurately predicting the enhancement factor and its fluctuations.

Abstract: In wavefront shaping, waves are focused through complex media onto one or more target points, and the resulting intensity enhancement is quantified by the enhancement factor. While reproducible enhancement is crucial in experiments, the fluctuations of the enhancement factor remain largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments, simulations, and exact analytical results using random matrix theory to determine its full distribution in multi-point focusing. Our theoretical framework goes beyond the Marčenko-Pastur law-valid only in the limit of a large number of channels-by accurately predicting the mean enhancement in finite-channel experiments and its fluctuations whenever long-range mesoscopic correlations are negligible (e.g., in weakly scattering media or under limited wavefront control). Notably, in the strongly scattering regime, experiments and simulations reveal giant fluctuations in the enhancement factor, which we attribute directly to long-range mesoscopic correlations. From a fundamental perspective, our results provide a direct method for quantifying long-range correlations in wavefront-shaping-based focusing, even with a limited number of input control channels. On the applied side, they enable the accurate prediction of the enhancement factor and a lower bound on its fluctuations, which are crucial for biomedical imaging, optical metrology, optical trapping, and communication through scattering media.

Motivation: the growing popularity of optical metasurfaces has led to a need for reliable methods to validate their performance, especially considering fabrication imperfections.

Method: used digital holographic microscopy, studying illumination effects at multiple wavelengths and polarizations, as well as varying numerical apertures.

Result: findings showed that while simulations predict performance, actual experimental results revealed additional factors like off-axis illumination effects, underlining microscopy's practicality.

Conclusion: holographic microscopy is a valuable method for creating a library of metasurface components that account for real-world manufacturing challenges.

Abstract: Digital holographic microscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing transparent and reflective phase objects. Its ability to reconstruct amplitude and phase can also offer great insight into wavefront shaping and design of all-dielectric optical metasurfaces. While metasurfaces have reached widespread popularity, their design is often based purely on the results of numerical simulations which can overlook many of the real-world fabrication imperfections. Being able to verify the real phase response of a fabricated device is of great utility for high-performance devices. Here, we use holographic microscopy to validate metalibraries of rectangular TiO2 and Si building blocks. Illumination effects are studied for wavelengths from 600 to 740 nm and linear polarization rotating within the full range of unique states (0 to 180deg). Finally, by varying the numerical aperture of the condenser lens from 0.05 to 0.5 we also study the effects of an off-axis illumination. Comparing the experimental results with simulations from finite-difference time-domain and rigorous coupled-wave analysis, we highlight the limitations of these theoretical predictions and underscore the utility of an experimentally established library of building blocks. We demonstrate that our proposed method of holographic microscopy is both practical and effective for creating a metalibrary that accounts for all fabrication and material imperfections, which is crucial for designing high-efficiency metasurfaces.

*Shah Fahad,Gao Xianlong*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper proposes a scheme to control the Goos-H"anchen shift (GHS) in a non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanical system. The system consists of a yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity. A strong microwave drive pumps the magnon mode, while a weak field probes the cavity. The interaction between the traveling field and the magnon induces gain, leading to non-Hermitian dynamics. The system achieves $	ext{PT}$ symmetry when the traveling field is oriented at $rac{oldsymbol{	op}}{2}$ relative to the cavity's $	extbf{x}$-axis. Eigenvalue analysis reveals a tunable third-order exceptional point ($	ext{EP}_3$). Under balanced gain-loss and finite effective magnomechanical coupling, the system demonstrates coherent control of the GHS by steering the system across the $	ext{PT}$-symmetric transition and through $	ext{EP}_3$. The GHS is enhanced or suppressed by this control. Without effective magnomechanical coupling, the system exhibits a second-order exceptional point ($	ext{EP}_2$) with a distinct GHS phase transition, which vanishes when the coupling exceeds a parametric threshold, due to strong absorption at resonance. The intracavity length is identified as an additional parameter for precise shift tuning. The $	ext{PT}$-symmetric configuration yields significantly larger GHS compared to its Hermitian counterpart. These findings advance non-Hermitian magnomechanics and open a route for GHS-based microwave components for quantum switching and precision sensing.

The study proposes a scheme to control the GHS using a microwaved cavity and magnon modes, which could lead to enhanced control mechanisms for these applications.

Method: The authors propose a theoretical framework involving a yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity. A strong microwave drive pumps the magnon mode, while a weak field acts as a probe. The non-Hermitian dynamics are induced by the interaction between the traveling field and the magnon.

The GHS is tuned by steering the system across the $	ext{PT}$-symmetric transition and through $	ext{EP}_3$ under balanced gain-loss and finite effective magnomechanical coupling. The enhancement or suppression of GHS is experimentally demonstrated. Without effective magnomechanical coupling, a second-order exceptional point ($	ext{EP}_2$) is found with distinct GHS phase transitions that vanish at a parametric threshold. The intracavity length is identified as an additional control parameter for precise shift tuning.

Result: The research successfully demonstrates the manipulation of the Goos-H"anchen shift (GHS) in a non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanical system. By utilizing a $	ext{PT}$-symmetric configuration, the system achieves significantly larger GHS compared to its Hermitian counterpart. The system can be controlled by adjusting parameters such as the orientation of the traveling field, the balance of gain-loss, and the effective magnomechanical coupling. The tuning capability of the GHS opens up potential applications in quantum switching and precision sensing. Additionally, the identification of second-order exceptional points ($	ext{EP}_2$) and third-order exceptional points ($	ext{EP}_3$) provides a deeper understanding of non-Hermitian dynamics in magnomechanical systems.

Conclusion: This study pioneers the controllable manipulation of the Goos-H"anchen shift (GHS) in non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanical systems, enabling precise tuning of the lateral shift. The $	ext{PT}$-symmetric configuration, balanced gain-loss, and finite effective magnomechanical coupling are effective tools for enhancing or suppressing the GHS. The findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of non-Hermitian magnomechanics but also open new avenues for the development of microwave components for quantum switching and precision sensing applications.

Abstract: We propose a scheme to manipulate the Goos-Hänchen shift (GHS) of a reflected probe field in a non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanical system. The platform consists of a yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity, where a strong microwave drive pumps the magnon mode and a weak field probes the cavity. The traveling field's interaction with the magnon induces gain, yielding non-Hermitian dynamics. When the traveling field is oriented at $π/2$ relative to the cavity's $x$-axis, the system realizes $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry; eigenvalue analysis reveals a third-order exceptional point ($\mathrm{EP}_3$) at a tunable effective magnon-photon coupling. Under balanced gain-loss and finite effective magnomechanical coupling, we demonstrate coherent control of the GHS by steering the system across the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric transition and through $\mathrm{EP}_3$ via the effective magnon-photon coupling, enabling pronounced enhancement or suppression of the lateral shift. Furthermore, we show that without effective magnomechanical coupling, the system exhibits a second-order exceptional point ($\mathrm{EP}_2$) with a distinct GHS phase transition. This phase transition vanishes when the effective magnomechanical coupling exceeds a parametric threshold, where strong absorption at resonance suppresses the GHS. We also identify the intracavity length as an additional control parameter for precise shift tuning. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric configuration yields substantially larger GHS than its Hermitian counterpart. These results advance non-Hermitian magnomechanics and open a route to GHS-based microwave components for quantum switching and precision sensing.

Abstract: We consider the consequence of having nonreciprocal photon transfer between two surfaces with temperature gradient. We demonstrate that in a system consisting of graphene and a magneto-optical substrate separated by a gap, a transverse electric field is generated in graphene perpendicular to magnetic field and temperature gradient, in analogy to Nernst effect. Such photon Nernst effect is driven by nonreciprocal Casimir force carried by photons. We show that the thermal efficiency of near-field photon Nernst effect is bounded by the Carnot limit, and nonreciprocal high-k modes are needed for approaching the limit. The near-field photon Nernst effect can be useful for probing nonreciprocal radiative transfer, and energy harvesting.

Motivation: Understanding the magneto-optical Faraday effect in thin films is crucial for advancements in data storage, devices, and nanotechnology.

Method: The researchers conducted experiments on thin films with varying thicknesses and analyzed the Faraday rotation using an analytical model.

Result: The Faraday rotation's sign became dependent on film thickness, linking it ambiguously to the film's gyration and magnetization. This effect can solely arise from interfaces without bulk contributions.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the magneto-optical Faraday effect in thin films, utilizing both bulk and interface contributions for applications in data storage and nanotechnology devices.

Abstract: It is generally believed that the magneto-optical Faraday effect appears in the the bulk of a magnetic material and its sign is fully determined by the sign of the non-diagonal permittivity element. Here we reveal an additional contribution to the Faraday effect from the film interfaces. It becomes notable for films with a thickness of a few tens of nanometers. As a result, in the absorption band of the film a novel feature of the Faraday effect is experimentally observed and numerically confirmed: sign of the Faraday rotation at a fixed wavelength becomes dependent on the film thickness and therefore is ambiguously related to the sign of the gyration and magnetization of the film. We elaborated an analytical model taking into account an interplay between the bulk and surface contributions which nicely describes the experimental data. Moreover, the Faraday rotation coming purely from interfaces without any bulk contribution is demonstrated. Possible applications of the observed unusual Faraday rotation behavior include hardware data encryption and other devices performing polarization control at nanoscale.

Abstract: Advances in mid-infrared (MIR) dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) have greatly boosted molecular detection in recent years. The ability of DCS to precisely identify and quantify outdoor atmospheric trace gases makes it attractive for applications in agriculture, energy, and industrial monitoring. Here, we demonstrate a vehicle-mounted MIR DCS system based on optical-optical modulated frequency combs (OMFCs), which achieve passive mutual coherence between the two combs. The system enables point-by-point and drive-by measurements under various outdoor conditions, achieving minimum detection limits of 45 parts per billion (ppb) for methane (CH$_4$) and 46 parts per million (ppm) for water vapor (H$_2$O) at 100-s averaging time. Finally, we mapped the two-dimensional concentration field and the concentration probability distribution near a CH$_4$ source and compared them with the contemporaneous wind rose. These experiments demonstrate the system's capability for localized gas identification and in situ quantification with high temporal and spatial resolution.

Abstract: Optically generated microwave signals exhibit some of the lowest phase noise and timing jitter of any microwave-generating technology to date. The success of octave-spanning optical frequency combs in down-converting ultrastable optical frequency references has motivated the development of compact, robust and highly manufacturable optical systems that maintain the ultralow microwave phase noise of their tabletop counterparts. Two-point optical frequency division using chip-scale components and ~1 THz-spanning microcombs has been quite successful, but with stringent requirements on the comb source's free-running noise and feedback control dynamics. Here we introduce a major simplification of this architecture that replaces feedback control of the frequency comb in favor of electronic feedforward noise cancelation that significantly relaxes the comb requirements. Demonstrated with both a high repetition rate solid-state mode-locked laser and a microcomb, feedforward on a 10 GHz carrier results in more robust operation with phase noise as low as -153 dBc/Hz at offsets >10 kHz, femtosecond timing jitter, and elimination of the large "servo bump" noise increase at high offset frequency. The system's compatibility with a variety of highly manufacturable mode-locked laser designs and its resilience and straightforward implementation represents an important step forward towards a fully chip-scale implementation of optically generated microwaves, with applications in radar, sensing, and position, navigation and timing.

Abstract: Photonic circuits modulated in time can convert the input light frequency $ω_0$ shifting it by multiples of the modulation frequency $ω_p$ and, in certain cases, amplify the total input light power. Of special interest are photonic circuits employing microwave capacitors, which instantaneously modulate photonic waveguides with frequency $ω_p \ll ω_0$. While the amplification of light is negligible in such circuits, ideally, frequency conversion can be completed with the conservation of the light amplitude. Therefore, similar to the elastically transparent photonic structures (i.e., structures conserving both the light amplitude and frequency), we can say that a photonic circuit parametrically modulated in time exhibits complete inelastic transparency if a wave enters the structure with frequency $ω_0$ and exits it with a different frequency and the same amplitude. Here, we develop an approach that allows us to introduce and investigate a broad class of time-modulated photonic circuits exhibiting complete inelastic transparency. Light enters these circuits with a resonant frequency $ω_0$, cascades between their $N$ eigenstates separated by the modulation frequency $ω_p$, and exits with frequency $ω_0 + (N-1)ω_p$ and the output amplitude close to the input amplitude. As examples, we consider circuits of ring microresonators and SNAP microresonators.

### [95] [Topological edge states in curved zigzag superlattices in nonlinear exciton-polaritons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20611)
*Jing Wang,Tobias Schneider,Wei Hu,Stefan Schumacher,Xuekai Ma*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Zigzag superlattices with curved shapes can support both edge and bulk states, with the curvature affecting the balance between intra- and intercell coupling, influenced by eigenstate tunneling and higher-order mode deformation. Edge states can become delocalized into the bulk as curvature increases, while bulk states can be localized near edges. Curvature also enables the transformation of bulk states into edge states via a repulsive nonlinearity, offering a versatile platform for topological photonics using exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research explores the potential of curved zigzag superlattices in topological photonics, particularly using exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. The findings could open up new possibilities for designing complex photonic devices and understanding topological states in 2D materials.

Method: Theoretical analysis of the superlattice structure, considering the effects of curvature on intra- and intercell coupling, and simulating the transformation of bulk to edge states via nonlinearity.

Result: Curvature in zigzag superlattices enhances intra-lattice coupling, leading to a mix of edge and bulk states. A repulsive nonlinearity can switch bulk states to edge states, providing a versatile platform for topological photonics.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that curved zigzag superlattices can realize topological states with tunable properties, offering a new avenue for advancing photonic devices and understanding topological materials.

Abstract: Zigzag chains allow for the formation of topological edge states. Several distinct chain architectures have been developed for this purpose. Here, we report a zigzag superlattice, containing two staggered sub-lattices, that supports multiple edge states, including higher-order modes. In such lattices, the intra- and intercell coupling is imbalanced by the tunneling effect of the eigenstates or deformation of the higher-order modes. We demonstrate that by arranging the zigzag superlattice into a curved shape, some of the edge states transition into bulk states as the curvature of the lattice increases, while some bulk states become more localized towards edge states. The reason is that a curved superlattice strengthens the intra-lattice coupling of the inner sub-lattice due to the separation reduction of the potential wells. %which, on the one hand, hinders the tunneling of the eigenstate to the outer sub-lattice and hence weakens the edge states formed in the inner sub-lattice. On the other hand, it can isolate more edge states formed in the outer sub-lattice, because of the induced more intensive deformation of the higher-order modes in the inner sub-lattice. We also show that some bulk states at larger curvatures can be transformed into edge states by a repulsive nonlinearity, which also enables the coexistence of different edge states. As a specific and ideal platform for realizing such topological superlattices we explore exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities with their strong nonlinearity and possibility for optical excitation and control. Our work introduces an additional dimension for the design of complex topological lattices and functional photonic devices.

Result: 研究得出，在压力下，5/2状态可能通过PDW转变，并且这种PDW的特性可能会与均匀pairing状态的有序参数结构有关。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了关于pairing行为在FQHE中的复杂动力学机制的新的见解。

Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at filling 5/2, which is usually understood as a $p$-wave paired state of underlying quasiparticles - composite fermions, transforms into a nematic phase under pressure \cite{csathy0, csathy}. A pair density wave (PDW) may be a precursor, underlying state for this behaviour, and such state(s) were proposed that maintain the weak-pairing feature of the uniform paired state \cite{frad}. Based on considerations in the weak-coupling regime of a microscopic description of the pairing phase (to mimic the phase as it gives way to a nematic phase in the experiments), we argue that the ensuing and relevant PDW state has a strong-pairing character. Furthermore, due to the existence of a single collective mode associated with the order parameter in the uniform paired phase, in the weak-coupling regime, the $p$-wave paired state, in general (for example, in the superconducting state of electrons), may be prone to a PDW instability.

Abstract: Nonabelian topological orders host exotic anyons central to quantum computing, yet established realizations rely on case-by-case constructions that are often conceptually involved. In this work, we present a systematic construction of nonabelian dihedral quantum double phases based on a continuous $O(2)$ gauge field. We first formulate a topological $S[O(2)\times O(2)]$ BF theory, and by identifying the Wilson loops and twist operators of this theory with anyons, we show that our topological BF theory reproduces the complete anyon data, and can incorporate all Dijkgraaf--Witten twists. Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further indicates a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry. Our proposal offers an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising prospects in synthetic gauge field platforms.

Conclusion:  RBMs 成为研究复杂磁态的有力工具，尤其是处理高度受限和杂相的磁性材料。

Abstract: We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a flexible generative framework for modeling spin configurations in disordered yet strongly correlated phases of frustrated magnets. As a benchmark, we first demonstrate that an RBM can learn the zero-temperature ground-state manifold of the one-dimensional ANNNI model at its multiphase point, accurately reproducing its characteristic oscillatory and exponentially decaying correlations. We then apply RBMs to kagome spin ice and show that they successfully learn the local ice rules and short-range correlations of the extensively degenerate ice-I manifold. Correlation functions computed from RBM-generated configurations closely match those from direct Monte Carlo simulations. For the partially ordered ice-II phase -- featuring long-range charge order and broken time-reversal symmetry -- accurate modeling requires RBMs with uniform-sign bias fields, mirroring the underlying symmetry breaking. These results highlight the utility of RBMs as generative models for learning constrained and highly frustrated magnetic states.

Conclusion: 通过分析动量空间特征，我们深化了 Skyrmion 晶体相在有限温度下的稳定性的理解，结果对设计 hosting Skyrmion 的材料具有指导意义。

Abstract: We study the finite-temperature stability of skyrmion crystals in frustrated magnets by analyzing the momentum-space exchange interaction of a classical Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice. Our analysis identifies two key momentum-space features that play a crucial role in stabilizing the skyrmion crystal phase. The first is the sixfold anisotropy in the momentum-space exchange interaction, which acts as a locking potential favoring triple-$Q$ skyrmion crystals. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that a larger anisotropy tends to enhance the stability region of the skyrmion crystal in the temperature--magnetic-field phase diagram. The second factor is the momentum-space energy related to the uniform spin mode, which correlates with the emergence of the skyrmion crystal phase at finite temperatures. These results provide a further understanding of the stabilization mechanism of the skyrmion crystal phase in frustrated magnets and will be useful for the design of skyrmion-hosting materials.

Conclusion: 超越#

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Kitaev honeycomb model employing the recently developed Clifford Circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) method. While the model in the gapped phase is known to reduce to the toric code model - whose ground state is entirely constructible from Clifford circuits - we demonstrate that the very different gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase can also be significantly disentangled with Clifford circuits. Specifically, CAMPS simulations reveal that approximately two-thirds of the entanglement entropy in the isotropic point arises from Clifford-circuit contributions, enabling dramatically more efficient computations compared to conventional matrix product state (MPS) methods. Crucially, this finding implies that the Kitaev QSL state retains significant Clifford-simulatable structure, even in the gapless phase with non-abelian anyon excitations when time reversal symmetry is broken. This property not only enhances classical simulation efficiency significantly but also suggests substantial resource reduction for preparing such states on quantum devices. As an application, we leverage CAMPS to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model and determine the most accurate phase boundary between the anti-ferromagnetic phase and the Kitaev QSL phase in the model. Our results highlight how Clifford circuits can effectively disentangle the intricate entanglement of Kitaev QSLs, opening avenues for efficiently simulating related and similar strongly correlated models.

Abstract: Thanks to improved methods for numerical analytic continuation with constraints, spectral functions with sharp features can now be extracted from imaginary-time correlation functions computed by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. Here we test these new approaches on various one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin systems with a single ejected fermion, i.e., extracting the single-hole spectral function $A(k,ω)$. We compute the Green's function $G(r,τ)$ via a canonical transformation of the fermionic Hamiltonian, implementing it for stochastic series expansion QMC simulations. Our calculations of $A(k,ω)$ focus on the different characteristics of systems with spin-charge separation and those in which a spin polaron forms instead due to effectively attractive interactions between the spin and the charge. Spin-charge separation is well established in the conventional $t$-$J$ chain, which we confirm here as a demonstration of the method. Turning on a multi-spin interaction $Q$ that eventually drives the system into a spontaneously dimerized (valence-bond solid, VBS) state, we can observe the features of spin-charge separation until the VBS transition takes place. While generally good agreement is found with the conventional analytical spin-charge separation ansatz, we point out the formation of a gap between two holon bands that in the ansatz are degenerate at $k=0$ and $k=π$. Inside the VBS phase, effectively attractive interactions may lead to the binding of the spinon and holon, of which we find evidence at large $Q/J$. In the statically dimerized $t$-$J$ chain, we find equally spaced spin polaron bands corresponding to increasingly large bound states with two internal spin polaron modes -- even and odd with respect to parton permutation. Our results overall demonstrate the power of modern analytic continuation tools in combination with large-scale QMC simulations.

Abstract: Quantum circuits provide an emerging controllable platform to realize novel dynamical non-equilibrium phases including topologically ordered states. The Kitaev model has become a cornerstone of quantum magnetism due to its quantum spin liquid ground state and rich phase diagram. The Kitaev model has also been treated in the monitored circuit setting, giving rise to topological area-law and critical-law entanglement entropy phases. In this article, we study the evolution of its phase diagram under the addition of new terms, motivated by their effects in the Kitaev model. We find that a single-qubit term, analogous to a magnetic field, leads to a trivial state in the high field limit, but with an additional intermediate volume-law phase. A three-qubit operator that commutes with the flux operators has the opposite effect: it stabilizes the critical-law phase against the short ranged area-law entanglement. We also employ a four-qubit plaquette commuting operator that simultaneously measures two opposite identical-type bonds on a plaquette. This generates a distinct volume-law phase and preserves the plaquette fluxes and associated topological order, yielding extensive entanglement while coexisting with the topological memory characteristic of the area-law phase. We quantitatively locate phase boundaries using stabilizer (Clifford) simulations together with tripartite mutual information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results highlight the rich phase diagram accessible from the measurement-only Kitaev model as well as suggesting rules relating the newly added operators to the phases they promote.

Abstract: The Scintillating Bubble Chamber (SBC) Collaboration is designing a new generation of low background, noble liquid bubble chamber experiments with sub-keV nuclear recoil threshold. These experiments combine the electronic recoil blindness of a bubble chamber with the energy resolution of noble liquid scintillation, and maintain electron recoil discrimination at higher degrees of superheat (lower nuclear recoil thresholds) than Freon-based bubble chambers. A 10-kg liquid argon bubble chamber has the potential to set world leading limits on the dark matter nucleon cross-section for $O(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2})$ masses, and to perform a high statistics coherent elastic neutrino nuclear scattering measurement with reactor neutrinos. This work presents a detailed calibration plan to measure the detector response of these experiments, combining photoneutron scattering with two new techniques to induce sub-keV nuclear recoils: nuclear Thomson scattering and thermal neutron capture.

Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) Far Detector (FD) Photon Detection System (PDS) employs the X-Arapuca concept, a photon trapping system relying on reflective surfaces and dichroic filters. In this paper are reported measurements, performed at the University of Milano-Bicocca, aimed at increasing the FD Horizontal Drift (HD) PDS module efficiency. The baseline implementation of the X-Arapuca concept for the FD-HD PDS module is close to the DUNE requirements as demonstrated in the collaborations laboratory testing. However, an increased performance would provide a safety margin for a detector planned to be operated for 30 years, without possibility of performing maintenance. A higher detector performance would also benefit the DUNE low energy physics program. The already proven Milano-Bicocca setup has been utilized to test different PDS module configurations comparing them to the original baseline. Exploiting prior knowledge of the X-Arapuca components and Geant4 based optical simulations it has been possible to achieve up to an ~84% performance increase over the baseline design. In the following it is presented the testing procedure, the performed measurements and a brief discussion on the obtained results.

Abstract: We present a fast spectral solver for the linear response of viscoelastic structures under oscillatory flow either in free space or close to a flat moving wall. The scheme works in the frequency domain (using phasors) and couples the oscillatory Stokes equation with rigid or flexible structures, modeled by viscoelastic networks of immersed boundary kernels. The fluid-structure coupling can be solved by two routes. One route calculates the hydrodynamic mobility matrix required to solve the equation for the structure deformation rate in matrix form. The second route iteratively solves the coupled fluid-structure equations: fluid-induced forces on the structures create a tension field which is then transferred to the fluid, until convergence. The resulting fixed-point problem is solved iteratively using the Anderson acceleration method. The mobility route is optimal when dealing with one or few structures, while the iterative scheme is preferred for denser dispersions. In any case, the flow resulting from the body forces is solved by a recently developed scheme [J. Fluid. Mech. 1010 A57, 2025] which is spectral in space and time and deals with doubly periodic open domains (either free-space or wall-bounded) where meshing is restricted to the region of interest around the structures. We test the present scheme in two applied contexts: quartz-crystal-microbalance (QCM) of spheres, suspended, adsorbed or tethered to viscoelastic linkers; and force spectroscopy (via atomic force microscopy) reproducing the power spectra of vibrating microparticles near a solid boundary. In all cases, comparisons with analytical, numerical and experimental results show excellent agreement. We conclude by discussing new routes the scheme opens in force spectroscopy and QCM analyses of soft objects.

High resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy on exfoliated flakes with atomically flat terraces reveals QWS, driven by quantum confinement of Dirac electrons. This effect is rarely observed due to the electrons resistance to electrostatic confinement caused by Klein tunneling. The standard phase accumulation model accurately captures the characteristics of QWS and extracts the electronic band dispersion, showing excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations. Band structure calculation reveals that with increasing quantum-layer thickness, the interlayer coupling enhances the electronic dispersion, progressively reducing subband splitting and giving rise to bulk-like continuous bands. Spatially resolved spectroscopy around surface defects further confirms that QWS of Dirac electrons in topological insulators remains robust against defect scattering. This work paves the way for exploring diverse quantum phenomena and device applications through quantum confinement, surface-state engineering, and tunable topological phases.

Abstract: In a significant conceptual revision to the tenfold classification scheme for topological insulators and superconductors, it was recently demonstrated that most three-dimensional (3D) classes are simultaneously "localizable" in two distinct, but intricately connected ways: (1) There is no obstruction to Wannier localization of all bulk eigenstates, and (2) Almost all surface states can be Anderson localized by arbitrarily weak symmetry-preserving quenched disorder. Here we consider the localizable class CI in 3D, and numerically investigate the stability of surface states. We demonstrate that surface states of a bulk class-CI topological lattice model are fragile in that they can be Anderson localized by the combination of weak quenched randomness and hybridization with an additional trivial 2D band (a trivializing proximity effect, TPE). With the TPE, stronger disorder is more destructive to the surface states of the bulk lattice model. By contrast, without additional bands the surface states remain extended, exhibiting robust spectrum-wide quantum criticality. We also investigate the fragility of surface states in effective 2D class-CI continuum Dirac theories, including the chiral limit of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene. Although the continuum models exhibit signs of Anderson localization near gap edges for weak disorder, stronger disorder instead appears to heal the surface, restoring criticality whilst filling in spectral energy gaps. Our results provide further evidence that effective continuum field theories fail to capture key aspects of surface-state physics in localizable topological phases.

### [108] [Hidden Magnon Berry Curvature drives Vertical Magnon Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19616)
*Atul Rathor,Sahanawaj Akhtar,Arijit Haldar*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: We predict a new type of magnetothermal current (MTC) in 2D magnets, arising from the hidden Berry curvature (HMBC) for magnons, which expands on and corrects the traditional understanding of vertical magnon transport (VMT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the transport properties of magnons in 2D materials is crucial for the development of spintronic devices, as magnon transport plays a key role in their functionality. This research aims to uncover new aspects of magnon transport, potentially leading to novel applications in magnonic technology.

Method: The study employs a combination of semiclassical theory and Boltzmann transport theory. Linear spin-wave theory is used to analyze the hidden Berry curvature and its effects on magnon transport. The hidden magnon Berry curvature (HMBC) is central to the theoretical framework, and the calculations are performed using paraunitary matrices that diagonalize the magnon Hamiltonian.

Result: The research reveals that the hidden magnon Berry curvature leads to a previously unrecognized form of vertical magnon transport (VMT). Two components of the VMT are observed: linear and nonlinear responses to magnetic field and temperature gradients. The linear response coefficients are determined by the total HMBC, while the nonlinear coefficients are influenced by the HMBC dipole and the extended HMBC dipole. The analysis is applied to specific spin models, including the buckled honeycomb (BHC) lattice and bilayer Chromium trihalide (CrX3) systems, demonstrating how VMT behaves under time-reversal symmetry-breaking interactions.

Conclusion: This work opens a new avenue in the study of magnon transport properties, providing theoretical insights and predictions that can be tested experimentally. The understanding of VMT and its characteristic signatures is directly applicable to current magnonic experiments, particularly in atomically thin, few-layered van der Waals magnets.

Abstract: We predict an in-plane, or hidden, Berry curvature (BC) for magnons in electrically insulating quasi-2D magnets and demonstrate that the hidden magnon Berry curvature (HMBC) gives rise to a previously unrecognized form of vertical, out-of-plane, magnon transport. Combining a semiclassical framework with Boltzmann transport theory, we show that the vertical magnon transport (VMT) currents respond both linearly and nonlinearly to the in-plane gradients of magnetic field and temperature. The linear transport coefficients are tied to the total hidden magnon BC, while the nonlinear (second-order) coefficients for the magnetic field and temperature gradients are determined by the hidden magnon BC dipole and the hidden extended magnon BC dipole, respectively. Using linear spin-wave theory, we find that the hidden magnon BC over the Brillouin zone is given by the expectation value of a pseudo-${\cal Z}$ operator, representing vertical displacements, evaluated in the space of paraunitary matrices that diagonalize the magnon Hamiltonian. We estimate VMT in spin models of realistic magnets with ferro- and antiferromagnetic order, including the buckled honeycomb (BHC) lattice and bilayer Chromium trihalide (CrX$_3$; X = Cl, Br, I) systems. In BHC, both linear and nonlinear VMT arise when time-reversal symmetry is broken by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. In CrX$_3$ systems, the nonlinear coefficients dominate, while the linear responses vanish due to time-reversal symmetry. Both systems exhibit distinctive features across a broad range of temperatures and parameters. Therefore, our prediction of VMT and its characteristic signatures is directly testable in present-day magnonic experiments, especially in atomically thin, few-layered van der Waals magnets.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper investigates the enhancement of second-harmonic generation in a graphene monolayer integrated in an ATR setup, emphasizing the role of surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) in boosting the efficiency of SHG through their synergistic effect with graphene's electronic properties. The analysis provides a theoretical framework linking graphene's electronic structure to the optical fields in the ATR configuration, suggesting that the ATR scheme enhances both SPP excitation and SHG conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is likely driven by the desire to enhance nonlinear optical responses for potential applications in areas such as optical sensors, wavelength conversion, and ultrafast optics.

Method: The method involves a theoretical examination of SHG in a graphene/Angle Multiplexing (ATR) system, focusing on the interaction between the incident light, surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs), and the nonlinear optical response. The analysis likely involves computational modeling, theoretical derivations, and possibly experimental validation to understand how SPPs contribute to the enhancement of SHG efficiency.

Result: The results likely demonstrate that the excitation of SPPs via the ATR configuration significantly enhances SHG efficiency in graphene monolayers. The unique electronic properties of graphene, coupled with the resonant and field-confining nature of SPPs, lead to a synergistic effect that amplifies SHG signals. The enhanced interaction between the incident light and the graphene monolayer contributes to improved efficiency, which could be validated through either simulations or experimental measurements.

Conclusion: The conclusion would likely summarize that the ATR setup effectively excites SPPs, which play a central role in enhancing SHG efficiency in graphene. This finding provides a theoretical understanding of the interplay between graphene's electronic structure and optical fields, offering insights that could be valuable for optimizing similar systems or guiding future experimental designs to maximize SHG performance in such setups.

Abstract: In this paper we present a theoretical examination of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in a graphene monolayer integrated within an attenuated total internal reflection (ATR) configuration. By embedding graphene in this optical setup, we explore the enhancement in the nonlinear optical response, particularly focusing on the efficiency of SHG. Our analysis reveals that the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) plays a central role in significantly boosting the efficiency of SHG. The unique electronic properties of graphene, combined with the resonant characteristics of SPPs, create a synergistic effect that amplifies the nonlinear optical signals. This enhancement is attributed to the strong field confinement and the resonant nature of SPPs, which effectively increase the interaction between the incident light and the graphene monolayer. Furthermore, we analyze the underlying mechanisms that govern this process, providing a comprehensive theoretical framework that elucidates the interplay between graphene's electronic structure and the optical fields. Our findings suggest that the ATR scheme not only facilitates the excitation of SPPs but also optimizes the conditions for SHG.

Abstract: Ultrafast quantum matter experiments have validated predictions from Floquet theory - notably, the dynamical modification of the electronic band structure and the light-induced anomalous Hall effect, via monotonic modulation of the driving amplitude. Here, we demonstrate how new physics is uncovered by leveraging quantum optimal control techniques to design Floquet amplitude modulation profiles. We discover a fundamentally different regime of topological transport, whereby the optimal oscillatory preparation protocol functions as a non-adiabatic topological pump: as a result, ultrahigh time-averaged anomalous Hall conductivities emerge, that reach up to around seventy times the values one would expect from the Chern number of the targeted Floquet state. The optimal protocols achieve >99% fidelity at the topological energy gap closing point - a twenty-fold improvement over standard monotonic approaches in as little as ten Floquet cycles - while unexpectedly generating the predicted ultrahigh conductivities. Our findings demonstrate that optimally prepared non-equilibrium quantum states can access transport regimes not achievable in the corresponding equilibrium system or even by applying conventional Floquet approaches, opening new avenues for ultrafast quantum technologies and topological device applications.

Abstract: The miniaturization of quantum Hall resistance standards (QHRS) using epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide necessitates understanding how device dimensions impact performance. This study reveals a pronounced scale-dependent carrier density in graphene Hall devices: under electron doping, carrier density decreases with increasing channel width (Wd), while the opposite occurs under hole doping. This phenomenon, most significant for Wd less than 400 um, directly influences the onset of magnetic field required for quantization. Fermi velocity measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) analysis indicate that band structure modifications and electron-electron interactions underlie this size dependence. Utilizing machine learning with limited data, we optimized the device geometry, identifying a channel width of ~360 um as the optimal balance between resistance uncertainty and on-chip integration density. This work provides key insights for designing high-performance, miniaturized graphene-based QHRS arrays.

Abstract: We discuss the choice and implementation of inter-valley potentials in the so-called two bands k.p model for the opposite X, Y or Z valleys of silicon. We focus on the description of valley splittings in Si/SiGe heterostructures for spin qubits, with a particular attention to alloy disorder. We demonstrate that the two bands k.p model reproduces the valley splittings of atomistic tight-binding calculations in relevant heterostructures (SiGe spikes, wiggle wells...), yet at a much lower cost. We show that the model also captures the effects of valley-orbit mixing and yields the correct inter-valley dipole matrix elements that characterize manipulation, dephasing and relaxation in spin/valley qubits. We simulate a realistic Si/SiGe spin qubit device as an illustration, and discuss electron-phonon interactions in the two bands k.p model. Beyond spin qubits, this model enables efficient simulations of SiGe heterostructure devices where spin and valley physics are relevant.

Abstract: Bilayer graphene is a maturing material platform for gate-defined quantum dots that hosts long-lived spin and valley states. Implementing solid-state qubits in bilayer graphene requires a fundamental understanding of such confined electronic systems. In particular, states of two and three carriers, for which the exchange interaction between particles plays a crucial role, are a cornerstone for qubit readout and manipulation. Here we report on the spectroscopy of few-carrier states in bilayer graphene quantum dots, using circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques that offer substantially improved energy resolution compared to standard transport techniques. Measurements using a superconducting high-impedance resonator capacitively coupled to the double quantum dot reveal dispersive features of two and three electron states, enabling the detection of Pauli spin and valley blockade and the characterization of the spin-orbit gap at zero magnetic field. The results deepen our understanding of few-carrier spin and valley states in bilayer graphene quantum dots and demonstrate that cQED techniques are a powerful state-selective probe for semiconductor nanostructures.

Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear Hall responses in tunable two-dimensional Dirac materials. In particular, we study quantum geometry-driven second and third order non-linear responses in a time-reversal symmetric Dirac semimetal that can host single, double and line nodes depending on the model parameters. We find that the second-order Hall response (SOHE), which originates from the Berry curvature dipole, is enhanced in the single-node semimetallic phase as compared to the double node case when inversion symmetry is broken. In contrast, the SOHE vanishes in the nodal line semimetal as the inversion symmetry retains. Notably, the third-order Hall response due to Berry connection polarizabilty becomes much larger in the line-node Dirac semimetal, especially when the Fermi energy lies near the band edge, than in the single- and double-node Dirac semimetals. The reason for this contrasting behavior is attributed to the distinct distribution of the Berry connection polarizability in the Brillouin zone.

TL;DR: Drive-engineered quasi-flat bands in a diamond chain enable constructive manipulation of quantum correlations through tailored tunneling processes induced by high-frequency periodic driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling quantum systems through engineered drivings is crucial for quantum technologies and physics.

Method: Periodic driving at high frequencies transforms the all-flat-band diamond chain, inducing two tunable quasi-flat bands and a residual flat band. The method leverages the interplay between lattice geometry and driven system symmetries to redefine interference conditions and enable quantum control.

Result: The results demonstrate that drive-induced tunneling processes redefine interference conditions, allowing the system to overcome Aharonov-Bohm caging and achieve controlled charge oscillations between boundaries. This opens a route to experimentally generate and manipulate two-particle entanglement.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for engineering quantum systems with tailored spectral and dynamic properties, enhancing our ability to control quantum correlations through engineered drivings.

Abstract: Flat-band lattices hosting compact localized states are highly sensitive to external modulation, and the tailored design of a perturbation to imprint specific features becomes relevant. Here we show that periodic driving in the high-frequency regime transforms the all-flat-band diamond chain into one featuring two tunable quasi-flat bands and a residual flat band pinned at $E=0$. The interplay between lattice geometry and the symmetries of the driven system gives rise to drive-induced tunneling processes that redefine the interference conditions and open a controllable route to escaping Aharonov-Bohm caging. Under driving, the diamond chain effectively acquires the geometry of a dimerized lattice, exhibiting charge oscillations between opposite boundaries. This feature can be exploited to generate two-particle entanglement that is directly accessible experimentally. The resulting drive-engineered quasi-flat bands thus provide a versatile platform for manipulating quantum correlations, revealing a direct link between spectral fine structure and dynamical entanglement.

Method: Theoretical analysis of the theoretical model and photonic spin Hall effect in monolayer WTe2 using LL transitions δn = n'-n =-2, 0, +2.

Result: Results show that PSHE tuned by δn =-2, 0, +2 has completely different behaviors on LLs, incident angle of incident photons, and magnetic induction intensity. These discrepancies are ascribed to Hall-conductivity-incurred Hall angle Θ.

Conclusion: Strong influence of Hall angle in the PSHE, shedding important insights into the fundamental properties of spin-orbit interaction of light in time-reversal symmetry breaking quantum systems.

Abstract: Landau level (LL) engineered photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) holds great promise for nanoscale manipulation and steering of magneto-optical transport in two-dimensional atomic systems. Herein, we theoretically investigate PSHE modulated by LL transitions δn = n'-n =-2, 0, +2 (where n and n' indicate the LL indexes of valence and conduction bands, respectively) in monolayer WTe2. Results show that PSHE tuned by δn =-2, 0, +2 has completely different dependent behaviors on LLs, incident angle of incident photons, and magnetic induction intensity. These discrepancies are ascribed to Hall-conductivity-incurred Hall angle Θ because the variation tendency of photonic spin Hall shifts is similar to that of Θ with changing the LL index. Giant PSHE with the largest in-plane displacement of more than 400 times of incident wavelength is obtained at the transition |n=55>->|n'=57>. Remarkably enhanced PSHE occurs at near-zero Hall angles. In-plane and transverse spin-dependent displacements give their respective extremum values at the same incident angles when the Θ is near to zero, and their incident-angle deviation will become larger and larger as the |Θ| increases. This unambiguously confirms the strong influence of Hall angle in the PSHE, shedding important insights into the fundamental properties of spin-orbit interaction of light in time-reversal symmetry breaking quantum systems.

Abstract: Single-molecule junctions represent electromechanical systems at the edge of device miniaturization. Despite extensive studies on the interplay between mechanical manipulation and electron transport in molecular junctions, a thorough understanding of conducting molecular springs remains elusive. Here, we investigate the impact of mechanical elongation and compression on the electron transport and electronic structure of helicene-based spring-like single-molecule junctions, utilizing 2,2'-dithiol-[6]helicene and thioacetyl-[13]helicene molecules bridging two gold electrodes. We observe robust, reversible U-shaped conductance variations with interelectrode distance. Ab-initio electronic structure and quantum transport calculations reveal that this behavior stems from destructive quantum interference, induced mainly by modifications of the coupling at the metal-molecule interface as a peculiar outcome of the helical backbone deformation. These findings highlight the central role of the helical geometry in combination with contact properties in the electromechanical response of conducting molecular springs, offering insights for designing functional electromechanical devices that leverage similar mechanisms.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the spin current symmetries in a GdFeCo ferrimagnet across various temperatures, including the magnetization compensation point, and differentiates between spin Hall effect (SHE) and spin anomalous Hall effect (SAHE) contributions using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results show that the torques from both effects maintain their signs across the compensation temperature, with SAHE contributing a damping-like torque opposing SHE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding spin current symmetries and their contributions in ferrimagnets is crucial for applications in spintronic devices and spin-based electronic systems, particularly in harnessing spin Hall and anomalous Hall effects for efficient spin manipulation.

Method: The study employs spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) spectroscopy, separately attributing the spin Hall and spin anomalous Hall effects to distinct electronic subsystems (5d Gd and 3d FeCo electrons).

Result: Significant findings include the consistent sign of SHE across temperature changes, in contrast to SAHE, which inverts at the compensation point. This suggests distinct origins for each effect in the ferrimagnetic structure.

Conclusion: The research elucidates the role of sublattices in ferrimagnetic spin transport and paves the way for leveraging spin currents in adjacent materials for spintronic applications. The differentiated contributions of SHE and SAHE highlight the importance of understanding electronic subsystems for optimizing Spin Hall and anomalous Hall effects in ferrimagnets.

Abstract: Ferrimagnets, composed of antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic sublattices whose net magnetisation can be tuned by temperature, offer a unique platform for probing the symmetry of the spin currents they generate and for identifying the sublattice contributions to these currents. Here, we investigate the spin current symmetries produced by GdFeCo ferrimagnet at a fixed concentration and across a broad temperature range, including the magnetisation compensation point. Using complementary techniques based on spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we separate the contributions of the spin Hall effect (SHE) and the spin anomalous Hall effect (SAHE). We show that the torques arising from both mechanisms retain their sign across the magnetisation compensation temperature, and that the SAHE-driven damping-like torque has the opposite sign to the SHE-driven term. We suggest that both effects originates from distinct electronic subsystems: the SHE emerging from Gd 5d electrons, and the SAHE from FeCo 3d electrons. Consequently, the SHE sign remains insensitive to the magnetisation state, whereas the SAHE sign does not invert at compensation, reproducing our observations. Together, these insights clarify the interplay between sublattices in ferrimagnetic spin transport and highlight the potential of ferrimagnetic spin currents to generate spin torques in adjacent layers or within the ferrimagnet itself.

However, direct real-space imaging of confined excitonic species within a moiré unit cell remains challenging; existing claims are inferred from spatially averaged far-field signals that are intrinsically insufficient to resolve nanometre-scale variations. Here, we imaged excitons across the moiré of a 2$^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer MoS$_2$ with nanometre resolution using room-temperature photocurrent atomic force microscopy. We directly resolved site-selective confinement: direct and indirect excitons localize at different stacking registries of the moiré, with contrast governed by alignment between site-selective generation and confinement minima. A Wannier-based moiré-exciton model reproduces the measured energies and the moiré-induced localization of the exciton wavefunction. These species-specific, unit-cell-resolved measurements constrain microscopic models of moiré excitons, provide benchmarks for excitonic order, and establish a device-compatible route to engineering excitonic lattices in van der Waals heterostructures.

Abstract: The complex valence band structure of bulk cuprous oxide necessitates going beyond the parabolic approximation to precisely estimate exciton binding energies. The same is true for excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells, for which many effects have been obtained so far only qualitatively within a hydrogenlike two-band model. Here, we derive the complete Hamiltonian for excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells based on the Luttinger-Kohn model, taking into account the full complex valence band structure. Symmetry properties of the system are discussed. Numerical results based on the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian using B-spline functions reveal the energy shifts and the lifting of degeneracies due to the nondiagonal coupling terms of the complex valence band. The relative oscillator strengths of the excitonic transitions induced by circularly polarized light are also calculated.

*Yuncheng Mao,Claudio Attaccalite*

TL;DR: Magnetic fields have a profound impact on the bulk photovoltaic effect in AB-stacked Bernal bilayer graphene, with specific responses on the shift current and magnetic ballistic current.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of magnetic fields on photovoltaic properties is essential for advancing materials in energy conversion and spintronic applications.

Method: AB-stacked Bernal bilayer graphene was studied under various magnetic fields to measure shifts in photovoltaic response, focusing on both weak and strong field conditions.

Result: The shift current (SC) shows a mild field dependence, reaching maximum at mid-level fields, while the magnetic ballistic current (MBC) grows linearly with field strength, particularly at specific photon energies.

Conclusion: These findings highlight the dual roles of edge states under weak and strong fields, offering a pathway for tuning photovoltaic responses through magnetic control, which is crucial for optimizing energy conversion in bilayer graphene systems.

Abstract: Magnetic fields break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and reshape a material's spatial symmetry. Because the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is exquisitely sensitive to symmetry, it offers a natural arena for magnetic-field control. Here, we explore how shift current (SC) and magnetic ballistic current (MBC) evolve and emerge in AB-stacked Bernal bilayer graphene subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. We find that the SC responds only mildly to weak fields, behaving as an almost even function of field strength. In contrast, the MBC is activated directly by TRS breaking and grows linearly with weak fields at selected photon energies. Focusing on AB-bilayer graphene ribbon we investigate the behavior of SC and MBC under both weak and strong vertical fields. We uncover the strikingly opposite roles played by edge states in the SC: under weak fields these highly localized, sublattice- and layer-polarized edge modes are essentially dark, yet under strong fields - when Landau levels dominate - the same edge states swell in spatial extent and become intensely bright contributors to the SC response.

Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect traditionally arises from complex spin-orbital interactions in multiferroic materials. In this work, we propose a distinct, intrinsic mechanism for the magnetoelectric effect in quasi-2D magnetic systems that lack spatial inversion symmetry. We demonstrate that in such parity-violating magnets, the stacking order, which id coupled with Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment, generates a stacking Berry curvature dipole (SBCD) and a stacking orbital magnetic moment dipole (SOMD). The SBCD and SOMD act as fundamental ingredients of the ME response. As concrete examples, we apply our framework to antiferromagnets such as monolayer Ca(CoN)$_2$ and multilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with stacking magnetic orders. Our results reveal the microscopic orbital origin of the ME effect in antiferromagnetic systems with vanishing net Berry curvature and orbital magnetization, governed by the interplay between layer stacking, Berry curvature, and magnetic order. The SBCD is also identified as the origin of electric-field-induced Hall effects.

Abstract: Topological principles constitute at present an integral component of condensed matter physics, permeating the modern characterization of electronic states while also guiding materials design. In this brief Perspective, I highlight three research threads in single-particle topological band theory that have recently gained momentum: (i) the rise of the quantum geometric tensor, whose components can at present be directly accessed with optical probes; (ii) the notions of delicate and multigap topology, which fall outside the scope of tenfold way and symmetry-based indicators yet leave robust physical fingerprints; and (iii) the consideration of bundle gerbes, which capture formerly overlooked higher-form topological aspects of energy bands. These distinct directions have been elegantly woven together: delicate and multigap topological insulators have peculiar features in quantum geometry that can be conveniently captured by bundle gerbes. This viewpoint exposes the recently identified quantization of a non-linear optical response and provides outlooks for its realization in crystalline solids.

Abstract: Understanding how glioblastoma (GBM) emerges from initially healthy glial tissue requires models that integrate bioelectrical, metabolic, and multicellular dynamics. This work introduces an ASAL-inspired agent-based framework that simulates bioelectric state transitions in glial cells as a function of mitochondrial efficiency (Meff), ion-channel conductances, gap-junction coupling, and ROS dynamics. Using a 64x64 multicellular grid over 60,000 simulation steps, we show that reducing Meff below a critical threshold (~0.6) drives sustained depolarization, ATP collapse, and elevated ROS, reproducing key electrophysiological signatures associated with GBM. We further apply evolutionary optimization (genetic algorithms and MAP-Elites) to explore resilience, parameter sensitivity, and the emergence of tumor-like attractors. Early evolutionary runs converge toward depolarized, ROS-dominated regimes characterized by weakened electrical coupling and altered ionic transport. These results highlight mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupted bioelectric signaling as sufficient drivers of malignant-like transitions and provide a computational basis for probing the bioelectrical origins of oncogenesis.

Abstract: General solutions of a gravitational junction between two copies of a three-dimensional Einstein manifold $\mathcal{M}$ correspond to the solutions of the non-linear Nambu-Goto equation for a string in $\mathcal{M}$. We show that, for the junctions in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetimes constituted by tensile strings, which are dual to interfaces between thermal states in conformal field theories, the solutions of the Nambu-Goto equation describing the junction correspond to state-dependent wave-packets, which are perfectly reflected at the interface to future null infinity without shape distortion when incident from past null infinity. These wavepackets are realized by state-dependent half-sided conformal transformations and affect the expectation value of the displacement operator. We further show that the entanglement entropy of an interval straddling the interface deciphers the stringy modes of the dual junction even in the tensionless limit. We also demonstrate that the strong sub-additivity of entanglement entropy is satisfied and is saturated for symmetric intervals generally.

### [127] [Classical Spin Transitions and Absorptive Scattering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19601)
*Juan Pablo Gatica,Callum R. T. Jones*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper presents an on-shell, amplitudes-based approach to incorporating radiation absorption effects in post-Minkowskian scattering of compact, spinning bodies. It derives general parametrizations of absorptive observables in terms of Wilson coefficients for 3-particle on-shell amplitudes, defines 'classical spin transitions,' and provides explicit results for leading-order spin absorption for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational radiation in terms of spin changes Δs = 0, ±1, ±2. It reveals universal patterns in impulse contributions depending on spin transitions and scattering angles, noting that forbidden transitions suppress observables and that aligned spin leads to purely longitudinal impulses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to generalize the understanding of spin absorption effects in post-Minkowskian scattering processes, drawing parallels with previous work on non-spinning bodies and extending it to spinning bodies. It utilizes amplitude-based methods and Wilson coefficients to model these effects accurately.

Method: The authors employ an on-shell amplitude framework, finite quantum spin-s particles, and Casimir interpolation to derive expressions for absorptive observables. They define 'classical spin transitions' and calculate leading-order spin absorption for different radiation types and spin changes. The method involves extrapolating to large spins and analyzing Casimir-independent and dependent contributions up to specific orders in spin magnitude S.

Result: The paper provides general expressions for the leading-order spin absorption impulse in terms of Wilson coefficients for 3-particle on-shell amplitudes. For each type of radiation (scalar, electromagnetic, gravitational), explicit formulas are derived for spin transitions Δs = 0, ±1, ±2. The results show universal patterns: Casimir-independent contributions to spinning-up and spinning-down by the same |Δs| are identical. Forbidden transitions (Δs < 0 in certain cases) suppress the corresponding classical observables by predictable powers of S. Additionally, for aligned spin configurations, the leading-order scattering angle vanishes, and the impulse becomes purely longitudinal.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends the understanding of spin absorption effects in post-Minkowskian scattering to general compact, spinning bodies. By deriving explicit expressions for the impulse and scattering angle in terms of spin transitions, it reveals universal patterns and scaling laws with spin magnitude S, providing a comprehensive framework for future studies on spin dynamics in scattering processes.

Abstract: We describe an on-shell, amplitudes-based approach to incorporating radiation absorption effects in the post-Minkowskian scattering of generic, compact, spinning bodies. Classical spinning observables are recovered by extrapolating to large spin, results calculated with finite quantum spin-$s$ particles using the properties of spin universality and Casimir interpolation. At leading-order our results give a completely general and non-redundant parametrization of absorptive observables in terms of a finite number of Wilson coefficients associated with 3-particle mass and spin-magnitude changing on-shell amplitudes. We denote these semi-fictitious microscopic processes: \textit{classical spin transitions}. Explicit results for the leading-order impulse due to the absorption of scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational radiation, for spin transitions $Δs = 0,\pm 1, \pm 2$ are given in a fully interpolated form up to $\mathcal{O}\left(S^2\right)$, and Casimir independent contributions given up to $\mathcal{O}\left(S^4\right)$. Our explicit results reveal some surprising universal patterns. We find that, up to identification of Wilson coefficients, the Casimir independent contributions to the impulse for spinning-up and spinning-down by the same magnitude $|Δs|$ are identical. For processes where the quantum $Δs<0$ transition is forbidden, the corresponding classical observable is suppressed in powers of $S$ by a predictable amount. Additionally we find that, while for generic non-aligned spin configurations there is a non-zero scattering angle at leading-order, for aligned spin, similar to non-spinning absorption, the scattering angle vanishes and the impulse is purely longitudinal.

Abstract: In this paper, we have discovered a new avenue of fibre inflation in perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS) due to the redefinition of the base modulus. pLVS offers a novel regime where large volume of the internal space is guaranteed without the need of non-perturbative effects. In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data \cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim} and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\lesssim r\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $α^{\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.

Abstract: We construct and study the supersymmetry properties of the weighted projective spaces $\mathbb{WCP}^2$ and $\mathbb{WCP}^3$. These are topologically $\mathbb{CP}^n$ with $n+1$ orbifold singularities and as such are higher dimensional analogues of the ``spindle'' or $\mathbb{WCP}^1$. We use these to construct interesting supersymmetric orbifolds of canonical near horizon geometries of relevance to the AdS/CFT correspondence. Interestingly, for certain tunings of their integer weights, and unlike the spindle, round $\mathbb{WCP}^{2}$ and $\mathbb{WCP}^{3}$ are compatible with supersymmetry beyond the realm of gauged supergravity. This allows one to construct interesting supersymmetric solutions in type II supergravity such as AdS$_5\times\mathbb{WCP}^{2}\times\text{S}^1$ and AdS$_4\times \mathbb{WCP}^3$ via duality. We also leverage our results to construct a supersymmetric AdS$_3$ solution containing a topological $\mathbb{T}^{(1,1)}$ space with 4 orbifold singularities.

Abstract: Quantum field theory exhibits rich spatial correlation structures even in the vacuum, where entanglement entropy between regions scales with the area of their shared boundary. While this vacuum structure has been extensively studied, far less is understood about how localized particle excitations influence correlations between field values in different spatial regions. In this work, we use the Schrödinger representation to study the Rényi mutual information between complementary spatial regions for a localized single-particle excitation of a free massless scalar field in $(d+1)$ dimensions. We find that the mutual information in this excited state includes both a vacuum term and an excitation-induced contribution. To obtain quantitative results, we specialize to $1+1$ dimensions and evaluate the Rényi-2 mutual information between the negative and positive halves of the real line.
  We find that the excitation generates finite, positive correlations that are maximized when the wave packet sits at the boundary and decrease with its distance from it, at a rate determined by the wave packet's width. Our findings offer a step towards understanding quantum correlations in multiparticle systems from a field-theoretical point of view.

Abstract: We consider the phase space of the Maxwell field as a simplified framework to study the quantisation of holonomies (Wilson line operators) on lightlike (null) surfaces. Our results are markedly different from the spacelike case. On a spacelike surface, electric and magnetic fluxes each form a commuting subalgebra. This implies that the holonomies commute. On a lightlike hypersurfaces, this is no longer true. Electric and magnetic fluxes are no longer independent. To compute the Poisson brackets explicitly, we choose a regularisation. Each path is smeared into a thin ribbon. In the resulting holonomy algebra, Wilson lines commute unless they intersect the same light ray. We compute the structure constants of the holonomy algebra and show that they depend on the geometry of the intersection and the conformal class of the metric at the null surface. Finally, we propose a quantisation. The resulting Hilbert space shows a number of unexpected features. First, the holonomies become anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. Second, for pairs of Wilson lines, the commutation relations can continuously interpolate between fermionic and bosonic relations. Third, there is no unique ground state. The ground state depends on a choice of framing of the underlying paths.

Motivation: Mathematical physicists are always exploring the deep connections between quantum field theories and string theories. This paper seems to be focused on the categorical perspective of large N limits, linking matrix models to string duals. It might be specialized for those already familiar with category theory and topological field theories. The abstract mentions a review of categorical aspects, which suggests clarity on higher category theory structures in these theories. The goal of deriving a string theory dual from a QFT using a specific strategy indicates a systematic approach, potentially essential for more complex models. It seems that this could be of interest to researchers working on holographic principles or AdS/CFT correspondences, particularly in the large N limit.

Conclusion: The paper presents a focused technical work on the categorical aspects of 't Hooft's large N expansion and its relation to string theory. The proposed method to derive the string theory dual to a given QFT at leading order in the large N expansion is systematic and potentially applicable to various systems. The abstract seems to suggest that the authors have reviewed several systems for which a rigorous analysis along these lines is or should be possible, indicating progress or applicability in specific cases. Overall, the paper contributes to the understanding of the interplay between large N limits and string theory duals from a categorical perspective.

Abstract: We review categorical aspects of 't Hooft's large $N$ expansion, which is expected to map any Quantum Field Theory of large matrices to a string theory. Our goal is to describe a general strategy to derive the string theory dual to given QFT, at least at the leading order in the 't Hooft expansion. The basic idea is to characterize the underlying worldsheet theory of the dual string theory as an extended two-dimensional differential graded Topological Field Theory (dg-TFT), i.e. present an $A_\infty$-category of boundary conditions ("D-branes"). A basic aspect of the 't Hooft expansion is that D-branes arise from the addition of vector-valued degrees of freedom to the QFT. We propose that formal deformations of such "fundamental modifications" must match the formal deformations of the dual D-branes, which in turn capture the $A_\infty$-category structure and thus the worldsheet dg-TFT. We discuss several systems for which a rigorous analysis along these lines is or should be possible.

Method: 通过分析双标量模型和超对称鱼骨模型的Yangian对称性，论文提出了当且仅当非零对偶的Coxeter数时，Yangian对称性及其完整可积性在平面QFT中不会出现。

Result: 在双标量模型中，只有当Coxeter数为零时，Yangian对称性才能延伸到一般量子相关函数，而当Coxeter数不为零时，Yangian对称性不成立。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，平面量子场论中的Yangian对称性和完整可积性可能与双标量模型的Coxeter数相关，只有当Coxeter数为零时，这些性质才有可能存在。

Abstract: We investigate Yangian symmetry for the equations of motion and the action of the classical bi-scalar and supersymmetric fishnet models in four spacetime dimensions, and we subsequently discuss its applicability to planar correlation functions. We argue that Yangian symmetry is classically realised in these models subject to specific evaluation parameter patterns. Curiously, Yangian invariance does not extend to generic quantum correlation functions in the bi-scalar model beyond the well-established classes of Yangian invariant correlators. We present several concrete counter-examples of bi-scalar correlators given by sums of Feynman graphs and of bi-scalar graphs with octagon-shaped loops. This finding underlines the notion that a non-zero dual Coxeter number represents an obstacle towards quantum Yangian symmetry and possibly also for complete integrability in planar QFT models.

Abstract: The Landau paradigm is a central dogma for understanding phase and phase transitions in condensed matter systems, yet for decades it has been known that a variety of quantum phases exist beyond the framework. Is there a more general framework that provides a systematic understanding of phase and phase transitions in quantum many-body systems? Recent developments of the notion of generalized symmetry and generalized gauging seem to point to a way to generalize the Landau Paradigm. In this essay, we discuss how `beyond Landau' phases and phase transitions can be captured by a generalized Landau paradigm in terms of the breaking of generalized symmetries, often induced by the generalized gauging procedure facilitated through the topological holography formalism. We also discuss what needs to be understood to make the generalized Landau paradigm useful in the study of quantum phase and phase transitions.

Abstract: As a generalisation of the recent construction by Russo and Townsend, we propose a new approach to generate $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant models for nonlinear electrodynamics. It is based on the use of two building blocks: (i) a fixed (but otherwise arbitrary) model for self-dual nonlinear electrodynamics with Lagrangian $L(F_{μν};g)$ depending on a duality-invariant parameter $g$; and (ii) an arbitrary potential $W(ψ)$, with $ψ$ an auxiliary scalar field. It turns out that the model $\mathfrak{L}(F_{μν};ψ) = L(F_{μν};ψ) + W(ψ)$ leads to a self-dual theory for nonlinear electrodynamics upon elimination of $ψ$. As an illustration, we work out an example in which the seed Lagrangian $L(F_{μν};g)$ corresponds to the Born-Infeld model and a particular potential $W(ψ)$ is chosen such that integrating $ψ$ out gives the ModMaxBorn theory. We also briefly discuss a supersymmetric generalisation of the proposed formulation.

Abstract: We investigate the mass dependence of the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between a localized coherent excitation and the vacuum state of a free scalar quantum field on the $(1+d)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime for $d = 1, 2, 3$. In this context, the relative entropy admits a closed expression in terms of the smeared Pauli-Jordan distribution, whose analytic structure is sensitive to both the mass and the spacetime dimensionality. Prior studies in $(1+1)$ dimensions have shown a monotonic decay of the relative entropy with increasing mass. We extend that analysis to higher dimensions using numerical techniques and elucidate how the interplay between dimensionality and mass controls the behavior of the relative entropy. Our results provide new insights for the study of the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy in QFT and its dependence on physical parameters.

Abstract: The asymptotic analysis for the metric of a generic solution of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet AdS theory is provided by solving the field equations in the Fefferman-Graham frame. Using standard holographic renormalization, the counterterms that render the action finite are found up to seven spacetime dimensions. In the case of 6D, an equivalent formulation that permits a fully covariant determination of the counterterms is introduced, based on the finiteness of conformal invariants. It is shown that both schemes end up in the same holographic stress-energy tensor. Physical properties of six-dimensional topological Boulware-Deser black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-AdS$_6$ gravity, whose boundary has nontrivial conformal features, are worked out in detail. Employing both renormalization prescriptions, finite asymptotic charges are found, and the correct black hole thermodynamics is recovered.

Abstract: We compute the couplings of Ramond-Ramond four-form axions in three ensembles of F-theory compactifications, with up to 181,200 axions. We work in the stretched Kähler cone, where $α'$ corrections are plausibly controlled, and we use couplings to certain non-Abelian sectors as a proxy for couplings to photons. The axion masses, decay constants, and couplings to gauge sectors show striking universality across the ensembles. In particular, the axion-photon couplings grow with $h^{1,1}$, and models in our ensemble with $h^{1,1} \gtrsim$ 10,000 axions are in tension with helioscope constraints. Moreover, under mild assumptions about charged matter beyond the Standard Model, theories with $h^{1,1} \gtrsim$ 5,000 are in tension with Chandra measurements of X-ray spectra. This work is a first step toward understanding the phenomenology of quantum gravity theories with thousands of axions.

Abstract: We consider Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen magnetic vortex strings in 3+1 dimensional Abelian Higgs models. We systematically analyze the giant vortex regime using a combination of analytic and numerical methods. In this regime the strings are infinitely long, axially symmetric, and support a large magnetic flux n along the symmetry axis in their core that causes them to spread out in the transverse directions. Extending previous observations, we show that the non-linear equations governing giant vortices can essentially be solved exactly. The solutions fall into different universality classes, reflecting the properties of the Higgs potential, that become sharply distinct phases in the large-n limit. We use this understanding to shed light on the binding energies and stability of vortex strings in each universality class.

Abstract: At the beginning of the 70's, Baxter introduced a multiparametric generalization of the six-vertex model. This integrable system has been found to exhibit a remarkable variety of critical behaviors. The work is part of a series of papers devoted to their systematic study. We focus on the case when the lattice model possesses an additional ${\cal Z}_r$ symmetry and consider the critical behavior near the so-called free fermion point. Among other things, discussed is the algebra of extended conformal symmetry underlying the universal behavior. The main result of the paper is the class of differential equations that describe the scaling limit of the solutions to the Bethe Ansatz equations. This is an instance of the correspondence between Ordinary Differential Equations and Integrable Quantum Field Theory (ODE/IQFT correspondence).

Abstract: We implement a feedback protocol to suppress the AC Stark shift in a two-photon rubidium optical frequency reference, reducing its sensitivity to optical power variations by a factor of 1000. This method alleviates the tradeoff between short-term and long-term stability imposed by the AC Stark shift, enabling us to simultaneously achieve instabilities of $3\times10^{-14}$ at 1 s and $2\times10^{-14}$ at $10^4$ s. We also quantitatively describe, and experimentally explore, a stability limit imposed on clocks using this method by frequency noise on the local oscillator.

Motivation: 由于传统设计结构简单，低频和高频率范围内的转换效率较低，该研究旨在解决这一挑战性问题，以实现高效且广泛的波转换。

Method: 通过数值模拟研究单行倾斜长缝结构下波转换效率，并分析了刚性块系中的本征微分模式：旋转模式与重 pole模式。

Result: 在自由表面附近布置单行倾斜长缝结构可实现效率超过80%的 broadband转换，在归一化频率范围内0.27至0.74时转换效率保持在高水平。

Conclusion: 该研究为 structural 简单设计条件下实现高效 的宽频转换提供了新的思路，未来可研究其他结构或参数的优化设计以进一步扩展其适用范围。

Abstract: Broadband longitudinal-to-transverse mode conversion under normal incidence remains difficult to achieve, especially with structurally simple designs. Numerical simulations show that a single periodic row of inclined long-slits near a free surface enables high-efficiency broadband conversion, where the conversion rate exceeds 0.8 across a normalized-frequency range of 0.27 to 0.74, corresponding to a 93.1% relative bandwidth. The broadband response originates from two intrinsic deformation modes of the mass blocks between adjacent inclined slits: a rotational mode and a quadrupole mode. The spectral overlap of these two modes sustains a continuous high-efficiency band. The effect is robust against geometric variations, demonstrating that geometric asymmetry alone offers a minimal yet effective route to broadband elastic-wave mode conversion.

Abstract: We study the motion of an impurity under the action of a constant force through a one-dimensional system of weakly-interacting bosons. The interplay of the impurity-boson interaction, the boson-boson interaction, and the driving force gives rise to a rich dynamics. We focus on the influence of a finite external force. Under these far-from-equilibrium conditions, we show that in a wide range of forces, one part of the momentum transferred to the system is periodically channeled into the Bose gas through the emission of dispersive density shock waves, solitons, density waves and the creation of additional phase gradients. As a result, the impurity velocity does not increase indefinitely, but periodically oscillates in time around the drift velocity. We uncover and characterize different dynamical regimes in a wide range of the impurity-boson coupling, the impurity mass and the external force. At a sufficiently large force, the Bloch oscillations cease and the impurity exhibits an unlimited acceleration.

Abstract: The two-species cold atomic Fermi gas with attractive short-range interactions in two spatial dimensions undergoes a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) crossover as a function of $\ln (k_F a)$, where $a$ is the scattering length. However, the nature of this crossover in the strong coupling regime $\ln(k_F a) \sim 1$ remains poorly understood. In this work we use canonical-ensemble auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo methods on discrete lattices to calculate several thermodynamical quantities in the strongly interacting regime, and eliminate systematic errors by extrapolating to continuous time and taking the continuum limit. In particular, we present results for the condensate fraction, spin susceptibility, contact, energy equation of state, and the free energy staggering gap. We identify signatures of a pseudogap regime, in which pairing correlations survive above the critical temperature for superfluidity, in the spin susceptibility and in the free energy staggering gap. These results can be used as a benchmark for future experiments.

Abstract: The Proton Improvement Plan II (PIP-II) project is a vital upgrade to the Fermilab accelerator complex. The magnet pulse rate of the PIP-II Injection system requires an increase from the current rate of 15 Hz to 20 Hz as well as a roughly 30% increase in the magnetic field of the new Orbital Bump (ORBUMP) pulsed dipole magnets in the Booster. The ORBUMP magnet mechanical design is presented in this paper. The ORBUMP magnet is secured in a vacuum box and the core is made up of 0.127 mm thick, low carbon steel laminations with a C-5 inorganic magnesium phosphate coating. The core is clamped using external tie bars welded to the core end plates. ANSYS Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used to evaluate the clamping design to minimize the deflection of the core post welding of the tie bars. The water-cooled, single turn coil, which shapes the magnetic field by acting as the pole tips, is critical for the integrated field homogeneity. The coil manufacturing tolerances and fabrication techniques were evaluated to ensure the magnetic properties of the magnet could be obtained. The coil is electrically isolated from the core using virgin Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) insulating material in the gap. An investigation into the high voltage performance of the virgin PEEK insulator was conducted via partial discharge testing using a 1:1 scale sample.

Abstract: We present an investigation into beam steering and radiation emission by sub-GeV electrons traversing bent silicon crystals. Using 855, 600, and 300~MeV electron beams at the Mainz Microtron (MAMI), we explored orientational coherent effects and particle dynamics in a 15~$μ$m-thick crystal bent along the (111) planes. Combined experimental and simulation analyses enabled the classification and quantitative assessment of the contributions from channeling, dechanneling, rechanneling, and volume capture to both beam deflection and radiation emission. Crystal steering remained effective even at 300~MeV, with measured channeling efficiencies exceeding 50\%, a record at such low energy. Channeling and volume reflection enhanced radiation emission by up to a factor of six compared to the misaligned orientation, highlighting strong orientational coherence effects in the sub-GeV regime. These findings confirm the feasibility of using bent crystals for efficient beam manipulation and high-intensity photon generation at low energies, supporting the development of novel light sources and beam control strategies at accelerator facilities operating in this energy range.

Main category: physics.acc-ph

Motivation: Accurate measurement of transverse emittance is critical for maintaining beam stability at high intensities in accelerator programs like PIP-II. The use of multiple BPMs with quadrupole moments provides a method to improve the precision of these measurements.

Method: The authors utilize multiple 4-plate beam position monitors (BPMs) located in the Fermilab Booster. Each BPM has a small quadrupole moment, and by collecting data from many BPMs, they enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, allowing for more accurate determination of transverse emittance.

Result: The analysis shows that the derived emittances from the composite BPM data are consistent with those from IPM (Inserttion Pixel Monitor) and Multiwire devices. This consistency validates the effectiveness of the BPM-based approach.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that BPMs with quadrupole moments are a viable and valuable tool for emittance measurement in accelerator systems, particularly at high bunch intensities. It complements existing methods and enhances overall beam stability monitoring.

Abstract: For the PIP-II program, transverse emittance in the Fermilab Booster must remain well controlled at higher bunch intensities. 4-plate beam position monitors (BPMs) have a small but measurable quadrupole moment, making it possible to infer transverse emittance. By compositing many BPMs together, it becomes possible to improve the quality of the quadrupole signal. The Fermilab Booster BPM system has been used to measure these quadrupole moments in the past year and derive emittances from them. Recent benchmarks show that the derived BPM emittances show similar emittance evolution and value to IPM and Multiwire data. This approach can both supplement and complement existing non-intercepting emittance monitors in accelerators.

Abstract: In this study, we employ the recently developed recurrence microstate probabilities as features to improve accuracy of several well-established machine learning (ML) algorithms. These algorithms are applied to classify discrete and continuous dynamical systems, as well as colored noise. We demonstrate that the dynamical characteristics quantified by this method are effectively captured in the recurrence microstate space, a space defined solely by the recurrence properties of the signal. This space change reduces dimensions, which also reduces the necessary time to perform calculations and obtain relevant information about the underlying system. Here, we also demonstrate that a few optimal machine learning (ML) algorithms are particularly effective for classification when combined with recurrence microstates. Furthermore, these new machine learning vectors significantly reduce memory usage and computational complexity, outperforming the direct analysis of raw data.
