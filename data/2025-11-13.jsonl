In this work, we demonstrate a scalable, low-damage method to integrate high-quality polycrystalline diamond films on (010) $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD), enabled by dielectric interlayers and polymer-assisted electrostatic nanodiamond seeding. A systematic investigation of processing conditions was conducted to assess their effects on film morphology, grain evolution, sp3-phase purity, and optical characteristics. Diamond films grown at 800 degC exhibit grain sizes up to 126.6 nm, RMS roughness of 16.3 nm, and a sharp diamond Raman peak at around 1332 cm-1 with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 34.98 cm-1. The corresponding sp$^3$-phase purity exceeds 97.5 percent, with an optical bandgap up to 5.13 eV. Deposition time variation from 10 to 60 minutes at 800 degC results in thicknesses from 53 nm to 315 nm and corresponding grain coarsening. Interlayer comparison reveals that SiO2 yields slightly larger grains and higher purity than SiNx under identical conditions. Notably, films with more than 96 percent sp$^3$ content were achieved at temperatures as low as 480 degC, confirming the compatibility of this approach with reduced thermal budgets. These results provide a robust framework for scalable $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond integration in thermally resilient high power and RF device technologies."}

Submitted to \"npj 2D Materials and Applications\" on November 4, 2025", "summary": "Strain fundamentally alters carrier transport in semiconductors by modifying their band structure and scattering pathways. In transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), an emerging class of 2D semiconductors, we show that mobility modulation under biaxial strain is dictated by changes in inter-valley scattering rather than effective mass renormalization as in bulk silicon. Using a multiscale full-band transport framework that incorporates both intrinsic phonon, extrinsic impurity, and dielectric scattering, we find that tensile strain enhances n-type mobility through K-Q valley separation, while compressive strain improves p-type mobility via Γ-K decoupling. The tuning rates calculated from our full-band model far exceed those achieved by strain engineering in silicon. Both relaxed and strain-modulated carrier mobilities align quantitatively with experimentally verified measurements and are valid across a wide range of practical FET configurations. The enhancement remains robust across variations in temperature, carrier density, impurity level, and dielectric environment. Our results highlight the pivotal role of strain in improving the reliability and performance of 2D TMD-based electronics."}

Coherent microwave sources offer a compelling alternative for quantum-secure communication, yet their propagation outside enclosed resonators has remained untested. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature FS transmission of maser signals generated using organic L-band (1-2 GHz) gain media, pentacene doped p-terphenyl (Pc: PTP), and Diazapentacene-doped p-terphenyl (DAP:PTP). Spectral and temporal coherence is preserved over distances up to 25 cm, approximately one wavelength at the masing frequency. Tests included polarisation misalignment, high-humidity conditions, and partial occlusion by foliage to emulate realistic FS reception scenarios. Strong spin-photon coupling was maintained, as confirmed by persistent rabi oscillations and normal-mode splitting. An instantaneous peak output of 4.29 mW (+6.32 dBm) from a 0.01% DAP:PTP gain medium. with a pulse duration of ~4 μs, marks a performance benchmark for directly coupled masers.

Shorter wavelength hard UV-C light ($<$205 nm) may, depending on atmospheric conditions, have reached Earth's surface and ionized and dissociated or otherwise degraded these carbon-based pigment molecules (as probably occurred on Mars after losing most of its atmosphere). Here we assess the possibility for an abiogenesis of life similar to ours through molecular photon dissipative structuring on planets similar to early Earth but orbiting different star types at distances normalized to the solar constant. Emission spectra of star types are analyzed to determine the ratio of integrated photon fluxes in the soft UV-C wavelength (dissipative structuring) to hard UV-C wavelength (degradation) regions. Our analysis suggests that star types favorable to the dissipative structuring of life, potentially evolving towards complex life forms such as bacteria, are only the F, G and high mass K-types, with intelligent life only possible on G-type stars. Low mass K and M-type stars are highly unlikely to harbor life. Biosignatures related to the thermodynamic imperative of photon dissipation are proposed."}

In this work, we discuss the behavior in the pre-asymptotic regime from a first-principles path integral perspective. We demonstrate how the relevant expressions can be evaluated systematically through semi-classical methods in the recently developed steadyon picture. This approach allows one to trace the role of the relevant physical scales, making transparent the underlying assumptions and approximations and offering a clear path to establishing a systematically improvable framework to evaluate tunneling rates non-perturbatively."}

But the HK map is rarely utilized in atomistics, wherein interatomic potentials are defined using the molecular or crystal structure rather than the external potential. As a break from this tradition, we present a field theoretic atomistics framework where the external potential assumes the central quantity. We machine learn the HK energy map while satisfying the thermodynamic limit. Further, we obtain both forces and electron density from the variation of the HK energy map, that are exact relations. Our models attain good accuracy across diverse benchmarks and compete with state-of-the-art machine learned interatomic potentials. Through electron density, we predict accurate dipole and quadrupole moments, otherwise nontrivial for interatomic potentials.

Here, we introduce a compact, snapshot, low-cost, fully vectorial field sensor based on an inkjet-printed nematic liquid crystal droplet array to measure these properties. Polarization and intensity are measured via division-of-wavefront polarimetry, exploiting the droplets' spatially varying birefringence, while the phase is reconstructed by treating each droplet as a microlens in a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor configuration. To demonstrate the system's performance, we characterize aberrated dual-wavelength beams carrying distinct intensity, phase, and polarization information, confirming accurate retrieval of the optical field profiles for both spectral components."}

We compare a simple analytical model for the anomalous phase to numerical solution of both the linear and non-linear Schrodinger equations, finding good agreement. With interactions, the phase does depend on the atomic density, which can be a source of noise. We nonetheless predict that under realistic conditions, the reflection technique can reach sensitivities approaching those obtained with macroscopic objects, and significantly improve the limits on anomalous coupling to atoms."}

We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures.

Its microscopic origin remains debated, partly due to significant sample-dependent variations that hint at uncontrolled experimental parameters. Using SrTiO$_3$ as a model system, we identify disorder and uncontrolled strain as suppressors of a thermal Hall signal. Crystals with high thermal conductivity exhibit a substantial thermal Hall angle $\\nabla T_y / \\nabla T_x$ (up to 0.3\\% at 9 T), whereas the effect is virtually absent in disordered samples. Crucially, annealing (in air atmosphere) these disordered samples partially restores the THE (approximately 0.1\\% at 9 T) with little effect on the longitudinal thermal conductivity. This decoupling reveals that the amplitude of THE is not simply set by the phonon mean free path. Furthermore, measurements performed with metallic and insulating contacts yield identical results on the same sample. This definitively rules out parasitic signals as the effect's origin. Our work, by establishing the phonon THE as an intrinsic property of the crystal lattice and extremely sensitive to disorder, sharply constrains theoretical scenarios."}

In this work, we show that if the field illuminating the object is structured in the azimuthal coordinate--such as a field carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM)--the azimuthal features of the object can be imaged with enhanced imaging resolution. We experimentally demonstrate it with two objects, namely, an azimuthal double-slit and a Siemens star.

Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) is a leading solution, forming a spectrogram by scanning the delay between two pulse replicas and recording the nonlinear signal spectrum. In online settings, however, dense delay-frequency scans are costly or impractical-especially for long pulses, wavelength regimes with limited spectrometer coverage (e.g., UV), or hardware with coarse resolution, yielding severely undersampled FROG traces. Existing reconstruction methods struggle in this regime-iterative algorithms are computationally heavy, convolutional networks blur fine structure, and sequence models are unstable when inputs are discontinuous or sparse. We present a generative diffusion framework tailored to recover ultrafast pulse intensity and phase from incomplete FROG measurements. Our model infers missing spectro-temporal content with high fidelity, enabling accurate retrieval from aggressively downsampled inputs. On a simulated benchmark of FROG-pulse pairs, the diffusion approach surpasses strong CNN and Seq2Seq baselines in accuracy and stability while remaining efficient enough for near real-time deployment."}

However, its performance is critically dependent on the selection of the circuit depth a parameter that must be specified a priori without clear guidance. In this paper, we introduce a variant of QAOA called dynamic depth Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (DDQAOA) that resolves the challenge of pre selecting a fixed circuit depth. Our method adaptively expands circuit depth, starting from p = 1 and progressing up to p = 10, by transferring learned parameters to deeper circuits based on convergence criteria. We tested this approach on 100 instances of the Constrained Shortest Path Problem (CSPP) at 10 qubit and 16 qubit scales. Our DDQAOA achieved superior approximation ratios and success probabilities with fewer CNOT gate evaluations than the standard QAOA for p = 3, 5, 10, and 15. In particular, while standard QAOA at p = 15 achieved results close to our approach, it used 217% and 159.3% more CNOT gates for 10 qubit and 16 qubit instances, respectively. This demonstrates the performance and practical applicability of DDQAOA to solve combinatorial optimization problems on near term devices."}

Typically, one defaults to the Teukolsky formalism, especially when calculating extreme mass ratio inspiral waveforms, and uses the SN formalism when dealing with extended sources, as it offers superior convergence when employing the Green's function method for calculating the inhomogeneous solution. In this work, we present a new scheme for solving the inhomogeneous SN equation, based on integration by parts, that eliminates the extra radial integration step required in the standard formulation to construct the source term for convolution with the SN variable. Our approach enables efficient computations of gravitational waveforms within the SN formalism in all cases, from compact to extended sources.

The formation of a nano-sized gap at a grain boundary facilitated a precisely controllable mechanical bending of the device by application of differential heating currents.

With a suitable change of variables, we derive new differential equations and full analytical solutions for generic tree graphs, making it trivial to take the folded limit and partial-energy limit at a vertex. Our result shows that folded tree graphs generally involve functions of smaller transcendental weights than their nondegenerate counterparts.

In this study, we introduce an alternative approach based on the geometric stability of three-dimensional singularity line shapes, demonstrating that shape-based tracing of singularities outperforms both topological and spectral methods in turbulence. To test this concept, we propose Flower Beams, a novel class of structured optical fields featuring controllable petal-like singularity morphologies. We construct an 81-element optical alphabet and classify these structures after turbulence using deep learning. Our findings reveal that shape-based tracing achieves classification accuracy exceeding 90% in the weaker turbulence regimes and remains highly competitive even in stronger turbulence, significantly outperforming spectral and topology-based approaches.

These systems possess long lived quasinormal modes with extremely small imaginary parts, originating from the effective cavity between the photon sphere and the object's interior. We show that the excitation of such modes is strongly suppressed, scaling with the imaginary part of their frequency, and therefore they contribute to the waveform only at very late times. This hierarchy naturally explains the structure of echo signals: the prompt ringdown is dominated by standard light ring modes, the early echoes arise from moderately damped cavity modes, and only the latest echoes are governed by long lived modes. Based on this, we propose a practical ringdown waveform model based on a superposition of ordinary black hole quasinormal modes and cavity modes, which captures the complexity of the ringdown of horizonless ultracompact objects. We further demonstrate that the combination of small excitation factors and weak damping enhances the robustness of long lived modes against localized perturbations, in contrast to the spectral instabilities affecting standard black hole quasinormal modes. Finally, we extend the analysis of greybody factors to exotic compact objects and wormholes, showing that they remain stable under small deformations of the effective potential and thus represent robust observables. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding excitation, stability, and echoes in ultracompact horizonless objects, with direct implications for their spectral properties and gravitational wave signatures."}

However, such systems introduce significant challenges in construction and demand a large number of readout electronics channels, leading to extremely high costs that are difficult to mitigate. In this article, we propose a paradigm shift in the detection of elementary particles that leads to ultrafast three-dimensional high-resolution imaging in large volumes of unsegmented scintillator. The key enabling technologies are plenoptic systems and time-resolving single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array imaging sensors. Together, they allow us, for the first time ever with a plenoptic camera, the reconstruction of the origin of single photons in the scintillator, thereby facilitating an event-by-event analysis. A case study focused on neutrino detection demonstrates the unique potential of this approach, achieving full event reconstruction with a spatial resolution on the order of two hundred micrometres. This work paves the way for a new class of particle scintillator-based detectors, whose capabilities should be further enhanced through future developments and expanded to Cherenkov light detection and calorimetry at collider neutrino experiments, searches for neutrinoless double beta decay, as well as applications such as medical imaging and fast neutron detection."}

Atomistic $g$-tensor fluctuations are used to construct Redfield quantum master equations that predict the relaxation $T_1$ and dephasing $T_2$ times of copper porphyrin qubits in a crystalline framework. Assuming one-phonon spin-lattice interaction processes, $1/T$ temperature scaling and $1/B^3$ magnetic field scaling of $T_1$ are established using atomistic bath correlation functions. Atomistic $T_1$ predictions overestimate the available experimental data by orders of magnitude.

In this study, we propose a novel spectroscopic approach to directly detect the geometric phase using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) enhanced by strong light-matter interactions within an optical cavity. Focusing on a prototypical pentacene dimer undergoing singlet fission, we model the nonadiabatic wave packet dynamics as it evolves through a CI between electronically excited states. The optical cavity enables dynamic modulation of the coupling between the optical field and molecular vibrational modes, allowing precise control over the wave packet pathways. Importantly, we identify a cancellation in the spectral amplitude, arising from phase differences accumulated along different trajectories, which serves as a clear spectroscopic manifestation of the geometric phase (GP). This cavity-enhanced 2DES framework not only enables direct observation of GP effects but also offers a versatile platform for probing ultrafast nonadiabatic processes. Our results provide fundamental insights into topological effects in molecular dynamics and pave the way for experimental strategies in quantum control, photochemistry, and the design of advanced optoelectronic materials."}

We calculate the entanglement depth, corresponding to the size of the largest cluster of entangled qubits, finding that it scales as a power law with system size in both the phases. The power law exponent is 1 in the volume law phase ($p < p_c$) and continuously decreases to 0 as $p \\to 1$ in the area law phase. We explain this behavior by studying the spatial distribution of entangled clusters.

[Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \\textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \\textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed."}

Thin films of Ti in ohmic contact with Ni were studied using second-harmonic longitudinal and transverse voltage measurements under an applied a.c. current. From these signals, we extract the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). Insertion of a Cu interlayer between the Ni/Ti interface leads to an enhancement of both OHT efficiency and UOMR compared to both Ni/Ti and Ni/Cu bilayers. Furthermore, systematic variation of Ti thickness reveals that both OHT efficiency and UOMR increase with increasing Ti thickness, indicating that the observed phenomena predominantly originate from the bulk orbital Hall effect rather than purely from interfacial mechanisms and Lowering the temperature leads to a clear reduction in both the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). The nearly linear and correlated temperature dependence of both parameters suggests a common underlying mechanism, namely, the orbital Hall effect in the light-metal layer, which governs both the generation of orbital current and its subsequent influence on the ferromagnet through orbital torque and orbital magnetoresistance."}

Scanning the fiber over the nanowire, the change in its resistivity is monitored by lock-in amplifier, mapping the spatial photothermal response correlated to absorption and coupling efficiency. The maximum of the response corresponds to optimal fiber-SNSPD alignment. This method allows for aligning the fiber to the center of the meander with sub-micron precision.

At small bias voltages, the tunneling occurs with conservation of energy and momentum at the points of intersection between two relatively shifted Fermi circles. Here, we experimentally found and theoretically described signatures of electron-hole asymmetric band structure of BLG: since holes are heavier, the tunneling conductance is enhanced at the hole doping due to the higher density of states. Another key feature of BLG that we explore is gap opening in a vertical electric field with a strong polarization of electron wave function at van Hove singularities near the gap edges. This polarization, by shifting electron wave function in one BLG closer to or father from the other BLG, gives rise to asymmetric tunneling resonances in the conductance around charge neutrality points, which result in strong sensitivity of the tunneling current to minor changes of the gate voltages. The observed phenomena are reproduced by our theoretical model taking into account electrostatics of the dual-gated structure, quantum capacitance effects, and self-consistent gap openings in both BLGs."}

The formalism, which also incorporates internal gauge bosons via angular momentum constraints, enables the systematic construction of tree-level amplitudes with arbitrary numbers of Goldstone bosons and gauge bosons in both Abelian and non-Abelian theories, as we demonstrate with explicit examples."}

We find that this single defective site is sufficient to enhance the ballistic spreading of an initially Gaussian wave packet. Extending these results, we implement a time-dependent alternation protocol between two distinct defect configurations, each individually yielding poor propagation of the state. The combination of these two unfavorable configurations improves the transport efficiency of the quantum walker, revealing a manifestation of Parrondo's paradox in CTQWs with delocalized initial states.

[Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \\textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \\textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed."}

The stochastic differential equations (SDEs) sample the positive P phase-space representation by analog complex-valued dynamical variables that are linked to the quantum operators. Statistical average over the stochastic trajectories yields the evolution of the quantum mechanical expectation values. However, numerical implementation of these SDEs for the TCM indicates divergent solutions, also known from other phase-space methods. This limits the applicability of the framework to finite propagation times, that are strongly dependent on the physical parameters and initial conditions of the system. We outline the underlying mathematical reason for these divergences and show that their contribution to the averages are, however, essential. To attempt to regularize the divergences, we transform the SDEs to an equivalent set of SDEs with different noise realisations, thereby pushing the valid time boundary. Quantum collapse and revival of the TCM, however, cannot be recovered by the stochastic trajectory approach, pointing to the general difficulty of the applicability of stochastic phase-space sampling methods to systems with strong quantum features."}

We investigate this competition on a two-leg ladder model with a p-wave-like hybridisation between the legs. This model hosts a symmetry-protected topological phase in its non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix renormalisation group algorithm, we compute the comprehensive quantum phase diagram in the presence of a repulsive inter-leg density-density interaction. Our analysis, based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum, reveals a fascinating dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. We find a non-trivial change in the value of the edge entanglement entropy as we include interaction. Furthermore, we find that the phase boundary separating a trivial insulator phase and a topological one with winding number two remains robustly pinned at its non-interacting location, irrespective of the interaction strength. Variation of the effective conformal field theory's central charge near the critical line explains the robustness of the gap. In contrast, the transition to an insulating phase with winding number one is heavily renormalised, with the critical line shifting significantly as the interaction increases. By successfully mapping the phase diagram and identifying the distinct behaviours of the phase boundaries, our work clarifies how interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a topological phase."}

Resource requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) are daunting, and hence, compilation techniques must be designed to ensure resource efficiency. There is a growing need for compilation strategies tailored to the early FTQC regime, which refers to the first generation of fault-tolerant machines operating under stringent resource constraints of fewer physical qubits and limited distillation capacity. Present-day compilation techniques are largely focused on overprovisioning of routing paths and make liberal assumptions regarding the availability of distillation factories. Our work develops compilation techniques that are tailored to the needs of early FTQC systems, including distillation-adaptive qubit layouts and routing techniques. In particular, we show that simple greedy heuristics are extremely effective for this problem, offering up to 60% reduction in the number of qubits compared to prior works. Our techniques offer results with an average overhead of 1.2X in execution time for a 53% reduction in qubits against the theoretical lower bounds.

We consider a composite quantum system consisting of a principal system, heat bath, memory, and work source, and adopt an autonomous Hamiltonian framework. We derive constraints on the total Hamiltonian that ensure the work source to act as a catalyst preserving its original randomness, namely that the total unitary evolution must have a unitary partial transpose. We show that this requirement is equivalent to the commutativity of operators acting on the joint system of the principal system, bath, and memory, which underlies the Hamiltonian structure. Next, we generalize the quantum speed limit for the joint dynamics of system and memory to the quantum thermodynamic speed limit, from which we obtain a dynamical version of Landauer's bound. More importantly, we also interpret this quantum thermodynamic speed limit in the context of quantum hypothesis testing."}

In this work, we show that if the field illuminating the object is structured in the azimuthal coordinate--such as a field carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM)--the azimuthal features of the object can be imaged with enhanced imaging resolution. We experimentally demonstrate it with two objects, namely, an azimuthal double-slit and a Siemens star.

However, conventional schemes that focus on directly using gravity to induce entanglement suffer from overwhelming environmental decoherence: maintaining entanglement between two oscillators requires an impractically high mechanical quality factor. In this work, we put forward an alternative reservoir-engineered scheme, whose core function is to quantify how gravity modifies (rather than prepares) the steady-state entanglement. Compared to quantum gravity, classical gravity introduces additional dissipative channels, which in turn give rise to distinct entanglement characteristics and thus enable the discrimination between the two types of gravity. Notably, this entanglement difference can still be maintained even when the mechanical quality factor is far below the threshold required by conventional schemes. Moreover, it demonstrates significant robustness against non-gravitational couplings, specifically, those like Casimir and Coulomb forces that are inherent in experimental setups. Our scheme relaxes the experimental requirements for verifying quantum gravity, thereby paving a new path toward its near-term realization."}

The arrival time of the heralding photon, delayed by propagation through a dispersive medium, enables the determination of the probe photon's diffraction direction.

We focus on the analytically tractable linear-$f(\\hat{R})$ subclass and study its cosmological, strong-field, and weak-field regimes.

B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \\textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \\textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories.

Scanning the fiber over the nanowire, the change in its resistivity is monitored by lock-in amplifier, mapping the spatial photothermal response correlated to absorption and coupling efficiency. The maximum of the response corresponds to optimal fiber-SNSPD alignment. This method allows for aligning the fiber to the center of the meander with sub-micron precision.

Experimentally, however, no previous quantum teleportation of single photons has shown a higher survival probability than using direct transmission. To overcome this challenge, here we first propose and demonstrate an all-optical scheme for remote preparation of entangled photons.

Consequently, a snapshot of a moving sphere should remain circular. In this study, we examine the Terrell-Penrose effect with our ray-tracing simulations for two contrasting cases: i) static emission sources in the view of a moving observer, ii) and moving emission sources in the view of a static observer. In flat spacetime, it was believed that the images of the emission sources in these two cases are equivalent due to the relativity of motion. Our simulation demonstrates that although both cases remain apparent shape of the sphere, the apparent distortions of the images are different, and case ii) violates conformality on the observer's celestial sphere. Furthermore, we extended similar situations to a black hole spacetime. For case i), it is found that the conformal transformation induced by the aberration effect also holds in black hole spacetime, and is not restricted to observers in geodesic motion. For case ii), we study the slow-light effect on the moving sources, and show that the gravity introduces additional influence on the snapshots of a moving source."}

Moreover, the thermodynamic behavior closely resembles that of a van der Waals fluid, with the noncommutativity introducing a correction term to the black hole's surface temperature. Our results indicate that the noncommutativity parameter Θ is of the order of the Planck scale and functions as a novel thermodynamic variable within the system."}

We provide mass-radius sequences, mass-compactness, energy density, and pressure profiles, and perform a full stability analysis based on the turning-point criterion, the radial adiabatic index $γ_r$, and the radial and transverse sound speeds $v_r^2$ and $v_t^2$. Our results show that positive $α$ and positive anisotropy $(β> 0)$ systematically increase the maximum mass and radius, enabling then configurations that exceed $2\\,M_\\odot$ while still obeying causality and the modified Buchdahl bound in 4DEGB gravity. A comparison with the latest astrophysical constraints (NICER, GW170817, GW190814, and massive-pulsar measurements) identifies regions of the $(α,β)$ parameter space that are observationally allowable.

Here, we introduce a novel stealth beam steering method that is fundamentally immune to prediction. In a photon pair, the probe photon undergoes diffraction in an unpredictable direction at a grating due to wavelength randomness. The arrival time of the heralding photon, delayed by propagation through a dispersive medium, enables the determination of the probe photon's diffraction direction. Our method successfully detects multiple targets in parallel, demonstrating up to a 1000-fold enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio compared to classical LiDAR.

For smaller values of $|Λ|$, fine-tuning of the Bach parameter is necessary to recover asymptotically (A)dS behaviour, resulting in two distinct two-parameter families of spherically symmetric black holes with (A)dS asymptotics.

To illustrate this phenomenon, we use a Kerr parametric oscillator (KPO) with one- and two-photon drives that, despite the breaking of parity symmetry, may have doubly-degenerate levels. Different realizations of squeezed KPOs convey a great deal of attention, as effective Hamiltonians for driven superconducting circuits and the occurrence of degeneracy in such systems could be of practical interest in their application to obtain protected qubits in parity-breaking setups.

This strategy achieves near-deterministic predictions while maintaining competitive classification accuracy in noisy environments, all with significantly fewer quantum circuit executions. Although this approach entails a slight reduction in performance, it represents a favorable trade-off for improved resource efficiency.

As an application, we demonstrate that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements can effectively distinguish between multi-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and W states. The ordering relations of these entanglement measures are further validated using four-partite star quantum network states and four-qubit Dicke states. Moreover, we find that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements exhibit greater sensitivity than the original concentratable entanglements in detecting certain four-partite star quantum network states."}

However, the generalization performances of such quantum machine learning algorithms can also be positively influenced by a proper level of noise, despite its generally detrimental effects. Here, we propose a pre-training procedure to determine the quantum noise level leading to desirable optimization landscape properties. We show that an optimal quantum noise level induces an ``equalization'' of variational parameters: the least important parameters gain relevance in the computation, while the most relevant ones lose it. We analyse this noise-induced equalization through the lens of the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix, thus providing a recipe that allows to estimate the noise level inducing the strongest equalization. Then, we report on extensive numerical simulations providing evidence of the beneficial noise effects in the neighborhood of the best equalization, often leading to improved generalization."}

This treatment can result in suboptimal decoding performance. In this work, we present a rigorous analytical framework to capture time-dependent Pauli noise, by exploiting the syndrome statistics of quantum error correction experiments. We propose a sliding-window estimation method which allows us to recover the frequency components of the noise, by using optimal window sizes that we derive analytically. We prove the noise-filtering behavior of sliding windows, linking window size to spectral cutoff frequencies, and provide an iterative algorithm that captures multiple drift frequencies. We further introduce an overlapping window algorithm that enables us to capture rapid multi-frequency noise drifts in a single-pass fashion. Simulations for both phenomenological and circuit-level noise models validate our framework, demonstrating robust tracking of multi-frequency drift. The logical error rate obtained from our estimated models consistently align with the ground-truth logical error rate, and we find suppression of logical errors compared to static error models. Our window-based estimation methods and adaptive decoding offer new insights into noise spectroscopy and decoder optimization under drift using only syndrome data."}

The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \\textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect.
