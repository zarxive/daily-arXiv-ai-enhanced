Combining these two facts allows us to determine the asymptotic spectral density of string states contributing to the correlator. This sharply relates the weakly-coupled UV of the gauge theory to the dynamics of highly energetic flux tubes. Then, in a toy integrable setting, we explore how this can bound the scattering data of the Goldstone modes on top of a long string. We derive a bound on the asymptotic behavior of the reflection amplitude of Goldstones against the flux tube boundary sourced by the Polyakov line, and rule out an asymptotically linear phase shift for the S-matrix. Along the way, we discuss how causality can impose bounds on thermodynamic quantities, and show how the positivity of time delays follows from unitarity and analyticity of $2d$ massless elastic S-matrices.

These solutions are generically resonant, entailing both eigenvalues and anti-eigenvalues, or, equivalently, both D-branes and negative-tension D-branes -- but are otherwise intricate to write down, having been previously addressed on a case-by-case approach. This work shows how there is a general and rather compact way to write down all these exact and fully nonperturbative transseries solutions in closed-form, immediately starting from the spectral geometry of the matrix model or string theory at hand, in the form of a discrete Fourier or Zak transform for their partition functions. This structure is inherently associated to the existence of anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes. The validity of these solutions is testable across all values of the parameters -- from weak to strong 't Hooft coupling, from small to large N; equivalently, from semi-classical to deeply quantum regimes -- and many such nonperturbative tests are performed against diverse examples ranging from matrix models to non-critical strings, fully validating our analytical and exact expressions. In particular, anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes are absolutely required to find sharp numerical matches.

The average number of photons radiated by a charged particle passing through a plate made of this metamaterial is obtained. Given the positions of the transition radiation maxima in momentum space for different velocities of a charged particle, the method for reconstruction of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in metamaterials is proposed. Applying this method conversely, one can predict the radiation spectrum and polarization properties of transition radiation by means of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in the metamaterial known, for example, from the effective model. It is shown that the strong spatial dispersion alters qualitatively the properties of transition radiation from a charged particle traversing normally a plate made of the helical metamaterial along its symmetry axis in the paraxial regime, viz., there is a nonzero forward radiation in contrast to transition radiation in media without strong spatial dispersion.

Despite the tremendous progress enabled by technologies such as time-reversal propagation and wavefront shaping, the full control of transmission matrix remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a multi-scattering-based approach to design reflectionless complex media with a unitary transmission matrix of arbitrary structures. As such, the perfect transmission of waves through such a medium performs a unitary operation. Based on this principle, we experimentally demonstrated braiding of multiple waveguide modes in an acoustic waveguide via multiple scattering and showed non-Abelian characteristics arising from the concatenation of distinct complex media. Furthermore, we show that the principle can be extended for realizing arbitrary unitary operations beyond braiding. Our scheme uses generalized Wigner-Smith operators to design the optimal acoustic complex media with near-arbitrary targeted functionalities. The scheme is generally applicable beyond acoustics, with broad implications to other wave types.

We also construct models which generate such NMOs as solutions within the two-scalar theory and scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity inspired by string theory. The orbits of the photon and massive particles are investigated in the background, where there is a negative mass object which realises a kind of effective anti-gravity. It is explicitly found that the bound system consisting of a positive mass object and a negative mass object can be formed in spite that a positive mass object suffers the repulsive force from the NMO.

We show that atoms arranged in chiral geometries can instead exhibit a strong collective chiroptical response mediated entirely by electric-dipole interactions. Using a coupled-dipole framework, we identify a regime of pronounced chiroptical response emerging at subwavelength interatomic separations, which can be tuned by the probe frequency. This enhancement is directly linked to the formation of subradiant collective modes.

The algorithm processes calorimeter trigger cells as graph nodes to perform clustering, feature extraction, and per-cluster signal classification with deterministic latency compatible with the first-level trigger readout system. The model predicts cluster positions and energies and provides a signal classification score, enabling a more flexible clustering strategy than the baseline trigger algorithm. Implemented on an FPGA and integrated into the Belle II trigger chain for synchronous operation, the system sustains the 8 MHz trigger throughput with an end-to-end latency of 3.168 $\u03bc$s. The performance is evaluated using simulated events and collision data. The energy resolution is comparable to the baseline trigger, while the position resolution for high-energy clusters improves by up to 18 percent in the central detector region. Cluster purity increases by up to 20 percent at low energies for isolated clusters, and cluster efficiency improves by up to 20 percent for overlapping clusters. The signal classifier enables additional background suppression at fixed signal retention.

In particular, we show that the Kawai--Lewellen--Tye (KLT) relations can be rediscovered using symbolic regression applied to colour-ordered Yang--Mills amplitudes with Mandelstam invariants as input features. Using standard feature-selection techniques, specifically column-pivoted QR factorisation, we simultaneously recover the Kleiss--Kuijf and Bern--Carrasco--Johansson (BCJ) relations, identifying a minimal basis of partial amplitudes without any group-theoretic input. We obtain the tree-level KLT relations with high numerical accuracy up to five external legs, using only minimal theoretical priors, and we comment on the obstacles to generalising the method to higher multiplicity. Our results establish symbolic regression as a practical tool for exploring the analytic structure of the scattering-amplitude landscape, and suggests a general data-driven strategy for uncovering hidden relations in general theories. For comparison, we benchmark this general approach with a recently introduced neural-network based method.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The analysis is carried out within the framework of the lowest-order constrained variational (LOCV) approach, which allows for a non-perturbative treatment of strong interspecies correlations while retaining analytical transparency. The BF interaction is modeled by a properly regularized attractive contact potential, enabling the exploration of both the attractive and repulsive energy branches. We determine the minimal BB repulsion required to ensure mechanical stability of the mixture by evaluating the inverse compressibility matrix over the full range of BF coupling strengths, within the domain of validity of the LOCV approximation. The interaction contribution to the energy is benchmarked against available experimental data and Quantum Monte Carlo results in the single-impurity limit, showing good agreement. Our analysis reveals how the critical BB coupling depends on interaction strength, density imbalance, and mass ratio. In particular, we find that mixtures with equal boson and fermion masses exhibit enhanced stability, requiring the smallest BB repulsion to prevent mechanical instability. In this case, a relatively small BB interaction is sufficient to stabilize attractive mixtures for all values of the BF interaction. These results provide a theoretical framework for assessing stability conditions in experimentally realizable two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures with tunable interactions.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, systematic materials screening has, hitherto, been computationally prohibitive. Here, we introduce a two-stage high-throughput screening strategy that directly computes proton diffusion coefficients, enabled by machine-learned interatomic potentials fine-tuned to ab initio data. Starting from more than six million materials, our screening -- based on structural motifs rather than empirical descriptors -- identifies $27$ high-performing proton conductors, including over ten previously unexplored compounds. These include sustainable and commercially available materials, candidates that have not yet been synthesized, organic systems that fall outside conventional design rules, and known proton conductors that validate our approach. Importantly, our findings reveal a universal oxygen--oxygen distance of approximately $2.5$~\u00c5 at the moment of proton transfer across diverse chemistries, providing mechanistic insight and showing that macroscopic proton conductivity emerges from the interplay between anion rotational dynamics, hydrogen-bond network connectivity, and proton-transfer probability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u7b5b\u9009\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa27\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u77f3\u58a8\u9178\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e9b\u65b0\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6750\u6599\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u77f3\u58a8\u9178\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002\u5728\u7b5b\u9009\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5316\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u952e\u5f62\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6c27-\u6c27\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ea62.5 \u00c5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8d28\u5b50\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u71c3\u6599\u7535\u6c60\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8d28\u5b50\u901a\u5bfc\u6027\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u6750\u6599\u7b5b\u9009\u8017\u65f6\u8d39\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u9ad8\u8d28\u5b50\u901a\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u4e3a\u71c3\u6599\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u7b5b\u9009\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u52bf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u8fdb\u884c\u7b5b\u9009\u3002\u6240\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d28\u5b50\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa27\u79cd\u9ad8\u8d28\u5b50\u901a\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u77f3\u58a8\u9178\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u8bb8\u591a\u65b0\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6750\u6599\u548c\u4e00\u4e9b\u5df2\u7ecf\u88ab\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6750\u6599\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6c27-\u6c27\u8ddd\u79bb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d28\u5b50\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u77f3\u58a8\u9178\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u8d28\u5b50\u5bfc\u7535\u7684\u6750\u6599\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6e29\u5ea6\u71c3\u6599\u7535\u6c60\u4e2d\u7684\u77f3\u58a8\u9178\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b5b\u9009\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d28\u5b50\u5bfc\u7535\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Inspired by the traditional TO techniques which is mostly based on the solid metamaterials with a limited range of tunability, a novel streamline tracing-based transformation optofluidics (STTOF) method is proposed to manipulate the light path by analytically designating the light-carrying streamlines of the flow in a two-dimensional circular bounded domain. A dipole flow model is built to analytically calculate the streamlines of the flow field inside the domain which allocates the optical/fluidic source and sink pairs at arbitrary positions. Liquid core/liquid cladding (L2) configuration is used in the experiment to trace the light via a specific streamline. Experimental results verify that the light paths agree well with the theoretical predictions, and demonstrate that a good range of tunability can be achieved by adjusting the flow rates and the source-sink positions of optical/fluidic source and sink pairs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Such manipulation can be reached even at the nanoscale level; however, probing and understanding the properties of optical fields well below the diffraction limit requires an adequate technique. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) with orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based electron state sorting has been suggested as a suitable candidate, but to date, no conclusive experiments have been performed. We, therefore, theoretically explore the emergence of dichroism in EELS for a canonical single-twist helix nanostructure and present a detailed analysis of the optimal parameters to obtain a robust signal.

However, challenges in the growth of thick, high quality GeSn limit the device absorber thickness, making it impossible to ascertain the performance limit of GeSn photodiodes. An in-depth understanding of their device physics and a clear optimization pathway towards commercial-grade devices remain elusive. This work presents a systematic empirical study of GeSn photodiodes with thick absorber (2 to 8% Sn content, up to 2630 nm thick), showing high responsivity up to 0.59 A.W-1 at 1.55 \u03bcm and 0.43 A.W-1 at 2 \u03bcm wavelengths, low dark current density down to 2 x 10-2 A.cm-2, and high detection cutoff wavelengths up to 2.1 and 2.5 \u03bcm at 5% and 8% Sn, respectively. Using specific doping design (P-i-N and N-i-P), an in-depth analysis is presented on the impact of junction position, p-type background carrier concentration, bulk/ surface defects and photocarrier diffusion length - on photodetection performance. Different optimization strategies for GeSn photodiodes, in particular at high Sn content, are proposed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u539a\u9517\u9521\uff08GeSn\uff09\u5149\u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u6027\u3001\u4f4e\u6697\u6d41\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u9ad8\u622a\u6b62\u6ce2\u957f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9517\u9521\u6750\u6599\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u9517\u9521\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5149\u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u63ba\u6742\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u7ed3\u70b9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u6742\u8d28\u542b\u91cf\u53ca\u5149\u8f7d\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u957f\u5ea6\u7b49\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9517\u9521\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5149\u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u57281.55 \u03bcm\u548c2 \u03bcm\u6ce2\u957f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u54cd\u5e94\u5ea6\uff080.59 A\u00b7cm\u00b2/W\u548c0.43 A\u00b7cm\u00b2/W\uff09\uff0c\u4f4e\u6697\u6d41\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08\u22642\u00d710\u207b\u00b2 A\u00b7cm\u00b2\uff09\u53ca\u9ad8\u622a\u6b62\u6ce2\u957f\u8fdc\uff082.1 \u03bcm\u548c2.5 \u03bcm\uff09\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u9521\u542b\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u539a\u9517\u9521\u5149\u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u4ea7\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The spacetimes considered are static, spherically symmetric, and nonsingular, and they include Bardeen-like, and Hayward-like regular black-hole limits as spacial cases. We characterize the horizon structure and thermodynamics properties, and we compute key optical observables by determining the photon-sphere location and the corresponding shadow size as seen by distant observers, including controlled perturbative limits and full numerical solutions. Using angular-size constraints for SgrA* and M87* from the Event Horizon Telescope and the GRAVITY collaboration, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to infer the admissible parameter ranges of the model and to quantify degeneracies among the black-hole mass and nonlinear-electrodynimcs parameters. On the quantum side, we develop the near-horizon reduction relevant for HBAR, showing that the dominant sector governing the detector response exhibits conformal behavior and leads to a thermal excitation spectrum governed by the horizon temperature. We formulate a Lindblad master-equation description of the radiation field, identify the thermal steady state, and derive an HBAR entropy-energy relation consistent with a Clausius-type first law. Finally, we establish a Wien-type displacement law for the HBAR spectrum, expressing the peak wavelength in terms of the horizon thermodynamics, thereby providing an additional observable link between nonlinear electrodynamics, regularity, and near-horizon quantum radiation.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) and optical signatures for regular black holes sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics.

Integrating out matter fields to quadratic order yields an explicit Ioffe-Larkin composition rule for the full resistivity tensor, showing how longitudinal channels add in series while Chern-Simons terms generate Hall response. To obtain the DC limit in the quantum critical fan, we develop a controlled large-N expansion where both fermion flavors and Chern-Simons levels scale with $N$, and solve a quantum Boltzmann equation at leading nontrivial order $1/N$.

Using black-hole thermodynamics for static spherically symmetric horizons, we compare two implementations: (A) energy-independent background with local-frame MDR, and (B) energy-dependent rainbow metric.\n  When the same prescription is used for the deformation energy scale $E_\\star$, both approaches yield identical Hawking temperatures: \\begin{equation} T(E_\\star)=T_0\\,\\frac{g(E_\\star/E_{\\rm Pl})}{f(E_\\star/E_{\\rm Pl})}\\,,\\qquad T_0=\\frac{\u03ba_0}{2\u03c0}\\,, \\end{equation} where $\u03ba_0$ is the classical surface gravity.\n  This $g/f$ scaling holds for examples such as Amelino--Camelia-type MDRs (leading correction $\\propto E p^2/E_{\\rm Pl}$, giving $T(E_\\star)\\simeq T_0(1-\\frac\u03b7{2}E_\\star/E_{\\rm Pl})$ for $\u03b7>0$) and the Magueijo--Smolin invariant ($f=g$, so $T(E_\\star)=T_0$).\n  Further DSR effects on evaporation (thresholds, phase space, greybody factors, composition laws) are discussed.

Ba4Ir3O10 has a quasi-2D structure composed of buckled sheets, which constitute corner-connected Ir3O12 trimers containing three distorted face-sharing IrO6 octahedra. The Ir atoms are distributed over two symmetrically inequivalent sites: the center of the trimer (Ir1) and its two tips (Ir2). The Ir1 - Ir2 distance within the trimer is quite small and equals to 2.58 A at low temperature. As a result, the clear formation of bonding and antibonding states at the Ir1 site occurs. The large bonding-antibonding splitting stabilizes the dyz-orbital-dominant antibonding state of t2g holes and produces a wide energy gap at the Fermi level. However, the energy gap opens up only with taking into account strong Coulomb correlations at the Ir2 site. Therefore, we have quite a unique situation when the insulating state is driven by both the dimerization at the Ir1 site and Mott insulating behavior at the Ir2 one.

We begin by embedding the physical qubit subspace into the space of holomorphic functions that are homogeneous of degree one in each Schwinger boson pair $(z_{a_{j}}, z_{b_{j}})$. Within this framework, we derive explicit closed-form differential operator representations for a universal set of quantum gates--including the Pauli operators, Hadamard, CNOT, CZ, and SWAP--and demonstrate that they preserve the physical subspace exactly. Restricting to unit-magnitude variables ($|z| = 1$) reveals a toroidal space $\\mathbb{T}^{2N}$, on which quantum gates act as canonical transformations: Pauli operators generate Hamiltonian flows, the Hadamard gate induces a nonlinear automorphism, and entangling gates produce correlated diffeomorphisms that couple distinct toroidal factors. Beyond the torus, the full Segal--Bargmann space carries a natural Kaehler geometry that governs amplitude dynamics.

The formulation employs a Lagrangian approach and explicitly removes null-space contributions in the coupled perturbed equations to ensure numerically stable gradients. For twisted-pyramidalized ethylene, both SACIS and SAECIS qualitatively reproduce the correct conical intersection topology, in sharp contrast to conventional CIS and ECIS. Benchmark calculations on twelve MECXs demonstrate that both methods reproduce geometries with mean RMSDs below 0.1~\u00c5 relative to high-level reference methods. SACIS captures the essential degeneracy through variational orbital relaxation, which alleviates ground-state Hartree--Fock (HF) orbital bias and effectively incorporates static correlation through localization effects; notably, spin projection is found to be non-essential for the qualitative description of these intersections. Overall, SACIS and SAECIS provide qualitatively reliable CX descriptions at mean-field computational cost in a black-box manner.

Here, we investigate the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the effective transition matrix and the scattering matrix of periodic metasurfaces within a parameter range where the metasurface sustains a BIC. Our analysis yields general and practically applicable conditions on the singular values and singular vectors that enable BIC formation. At the BIC eigenfrequency, the inverse of the largest singular value of both matrices vanishes, and the corresponding left (right) singular vector is orthogonal to outgoing (incoming) plane waves that propagate in the directions of open diffraction orders. Our SVD-based approach predicts the spectral position of the BIC and provides detailed information about its properties, including the expansion coefficients in the multipole and plane-wave bases, as well as its behavior under perturbations that transform the BIC into a quasi-BIC. The approach is numerically validated by considering both symmetry-protected and accidental BICs in arrays of scatterers supporting electromagnetic or acoustic multipole resonances.

This work extends previous studies, which have predominantly focused on models with either symmetric bounces or asymmetric bounces restricted to homogeneous dust configurations. Our analysis emphasises the phenomenological implications of the model through a combination of analytical and numerical investigations, with particular attention to singularity resolution and the formation of trapped surfaces. As in symmetric bounce models, the central curvature singularity inside the collapsing dust cloud is resolved. However, in contrast to the symmetric case, we find that a singularity emerges in the polymerised vacuum region during the bounce phase. This singularity can be identified as a shell-crossing singularity and exhibits the expected power-law behaviour of curvature scalars. Furthermore, likewise to the symmetric bounce models, we find a critical mass threshold governing the formation of inner and outer horizons in the pre-bounce phase.

However, the practical deployment of inverse-designed PICs is bottlenecked by manufacturability: their irregular, subwavelength geometries are highly sensitive to fabrication variations, leading to large performance degradation, low yield, and a persistent gap between simulated optimality and fabricated performance. Unlike electronics, photonics lacks a systematic, flexible mask optimization flow. Fabrication deviations in photonic components cause large optical response drift and compounding error in cascaded circuits, while calibrating fabrication models remains costly and expertise-heavy, often requiring repeated fabrication cycles that are inaccessible to most designers. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRISM, a photonics-informed inverse lithography workflow that makes photonic mask optimization data-efficient, reliable, and optics-informed.

State-of-the-art microwave sources, however, are fundamentally constrained by trade-offs between frequency tunability and spectral purity. Electro-optic frequency division (eOFD) is an emerging technique for dividing down the purity of optical sources to the microwave domain. Previously reported eOFD-based synthesizers generally have limited tunability due to feedback stabilization requirements. Here we demonstrate a feed-forward eOFD architecture in which the frequency tunability of a microwave source is preserved while optical spectral purity is divided through feed-forward cancellation, without any downstream electronic frequency synthesis. By canceling the phase noise of the microwave source without feedback, this eOFD approach removes loop bandwidth and source noise constraints observed in prior eOFD architectures. We achieve octave-spanning tunability, including the entire X-band, with phase noise below -140 dBc/Hz at kilohertz offsets and a high-frequency noise floor between -155 dBc/Hz and -145 dBc/Hz for carrier frequencies from 8 to 16 GHz. This performance corresponds to single-femtosecond integrated timing jitter, enabling, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of coherent, optically referenced microwave synthesis under wide tuning with this level of spectral purity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5fae\u6ce2\u5408\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5149\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5272\uff08eOFD\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7eaf\u5ea6\u5149 sources \u4e0b\u7684\u5fae\u6ce2\u5408\u6210\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5408\u6210\u5668\u5177\u6709\u5bbdband tunability \u548c\u6781\u9ad8\u7684 spectral purity\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u96f7\u8fbe\u3001\u5149\u8c31\u5b66\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u9891\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u5fae\u6ce2\u6e90\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u5fae\u6ce2\u6e90\u7684\u7eaf\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u8c03\u8303\u56f4\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u5149\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5272\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5fae\u6ce2\u5408\u6210\u5668\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u524d\u5411 feed-forward eOFD \u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u9988\u53d6\u6d88\u65b9\u5f0f\u53bb\u9664\u5fae\u6ce2\u6e90\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6d88\u9664\u53cd\u9988\u73af\u5e26\u548c\u6e90\u566a\u97f3\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece8 GHz\u523016 GHz\u7684\u5168 octave \u8c03\u8c10\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u76f8\u4f4d\u566a\u58f0\u5728khz \u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6bcf\u8d6b\u5179 -140 dBc\uff0c\u9ad8\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u4e0a\u9650\u5728\u6bcf\u8d6b\u5179 -155 \u4e0b\u9650\u5728 -145 dBc\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u5355 Femtosecond \u79ef\u5206\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u65f6\u6296\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5149\u53c2\u8003\u5fae\u6ce2\u5408\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411 feed-forward eOFD \u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7eaf\u5ea6\u5149\u53c2\u8003\u5fae\u6ce2\u5408\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5fae\u6ce2\u6e90\u7684\u8c03\u8c10\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

The evaporation process is examined in the high-frequency regime, leading to modified evaporation times and emission rates relative to the vacuum Schwarzschild case. We further study absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves employing a partial-wave analysis, computing phase shifts, partial and total cross sections, and assessing the impact of the Hernquist scale radius and density on these observables.

Suspended TMD monolayers provide an effective route to minimizing substrate-induced disorder. Here we demonstrate the spatially uniform excitonic spectrum from high-quality WSe2 suspended monolayers fabricated by gold-assisted exfoliation directly onto an Au contact electrode of a gate-tunable device. The resulting membranes span narrow suspended regions up to ~80 um and show spatially uniform photoluminescence at cryogenic temperatures with neutral-exciton linewidths as low as ~4.5 meV, comparable to the narrowest values reported for high-quality monolayers. Spectral reproducibility across the suspended regions supports an intrinsic optical response, while gate-dependent measurements resolve multiple excitonic species. This approach provides a practical route to electrically tunable potential landscapes in suspended TMD monolayers with a highly uniform excitonic response.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Ovcharenko and J. Podolsky, Phys. Rev. D 112 (2025) 064076]. We show that such exact solutions split into two main subclasses that (after a suitable re-parametrization) can be interpreted as either the uncharged Schwarzschild or C-metric in the external Bertotti-Robinson (BR) spacetime with geometry ${\\mathrm{AdS}_2\\times\\mathrm{S}_2}$, or as the charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the external BR electromagnetic field. The distinction between these two subclasses is determined by the parameter $r_0$ that encodes relations between the external Maxwell field (given by the non-aligned components of the Faraday tensor ${\u03a6_0=\u03a6_2}$) and the Maxwell field created by the charge of the black hole (given by the aligned component $\u03a6_1$). Namely, if ${r_0=0}$ then the electromagnetic field is fully determined by ${\u03a6_0=\u03a6_2}$, and one gets the C-metric in the BR universe (including also the non-accelerating Schwarzschild-BR black hole). But if ${r_0\\neq 0}$ then the electromagnetic field is independently determined by both the external BR field and the field of a black hole itself, and this can be interpreted as the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. Even though such an interpretation of the spacetime family is quite simple, it contains a lot of subtleties (e.g. the no-charge limit of the RN-BR spacetime, the non-trivial dependence on the signs of the mass and charge of a black hole, extreme black holes, and others) which we carefully investigate in this work.

Due to its small ionization energy (large electron affinity), deposited Cs atoms (C$_{60}$ molecules) are expected to provide a solid surface with electrons (holes). Upon dosing the dopants to Mott-insulating Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, we found a new Ru $3d$ photoemission peak emerging on the lower binding-energy side, suggesting the creation of a core-hole screening channel associated with coherent Ru $4d$ states around the Fermi level. For both the Cs and C$_{60}$ dosing, this change occurred without an appreciable chemical potential jump. The coherent state, therefore, develops within the Mott gap through hybridization with the impurity level of the dopants.

In this paper, we propose a high-dimensional superdense coding protocol using energy-time entangled states. These states are biphoton frequency combs, an example of entangled time-frequency Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (TFGKP) states or time-frequency grid states. Inspired by GKP codes, our protocol involves discretizing the continuous time and frequency degrees of freedom and encoding information by time-frequency displacements. This approach leverages the inherently large Hilbert space found in quantum frequency combs, with resilience against both temporal and spectral errors. In addition to describing the theoretical structure of the protocol, we propose an experimental implementation using standard telecommunication components, time-resolving single-photon detectors and a frequency beamsplitter. We also analyze the effect of experimental noise and errors on the channel capacity of the protocol. We demonstrate that for realistic experimental parameters, contemporary technologies satisfy the prerequisites for superdense coding with biphoton frequency combs, achieving a transmission rate of approximately 8.91 bits per transmitted photon (equivalent to 481 distinguishable messages with asymptotically vanishing errors). This more than doubles the previously highest transmission rate of 4 bits achieved by the Kwiat-Weinfurter scheme, while also having competitive optical loss. Furthermore, our results beat the rate achievable using a single-photon frequency comb with identical parameters by 4.6 times. Our protocol thus represents an experimentally feasible application of time-frequency grid states to entanglement-assisted communication, contributing to the active fields of continuous-variable and high-dimensional quantum information.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a high-dimensional superdense coding protocol using energy-time entangled states, specifically biphoton frequency combs, which offer a significant improvement in transmission rate compared to previous protocols.", "motivation": "The motivation behind this research is to enhance the efficiency and applicability of quantum communication by leveraging high-dimensional entanglement resources, with a particular focus on practical implementation using current technology.", "method": "The method employed in this paper involves the use of biphoton frequency combs, which are examples of entangled time-frequency Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (TFGKP) states or time-frequency grid states.

The topological analysis independently confirms the existence of critical points and classifies the system within the universal topological scheme for black hole thermodynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u66f2\u7387\u6807\u91cf\u7684\u56db\u7ef4\u53cd\u5fb7\u897f\u7279\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u53d8", "motivation": "\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u5f3a\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u7535\u8377\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u6027\u8d28\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u6001\u76f8\u201d", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfb\u627e\u542b\u6709\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u6807\u91cf\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u53cd\u5fb7\u897f\u7279AdS4\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u7f3a\u9677\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u7c7b\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7ecf\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u5206\u5f62\u56fe\u5448\u73b0'\u878d\u5316'\u548c'\u51dd\u56fa'\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7c7b\u76f8\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u7c7b\u5207\u56fe\u76f8\u7b26", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u7c7b\u76f8\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u4e0e\u76f8\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u76f8\u53d8\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301"}}

While this enhanced scaling is known to appear in several settings, it is generally believed to be forbidden in Wigner-Jordan integrable spin chains charged via quantum-quench protocols. Here, we show that an extended cluster-Ising model, despite belonging to the above category, exhibits super-extensive charging power over wide ranges of system sizes, reaching up to a thousand spins, in proper parameter regimes. This remarkable anomalous scaling is due to a corresponding super-extensive growth of the stored energy, implying that it occurs at large but finite size and cannot persist in the thermodynamic limit. This phenomenon appears robust against finite-temperature effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u5c55\u96c6\u7fa4-ising\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8d85\u5927\u5bb9\u91cf\u5145\u7535\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u6301\u4e45\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u8d85\u5927\u5bb9\u91cf\u5145\u7535\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u96c6\u7fa4-ising\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5145\u7535\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6269\u5c55\u96c6\u7fa4-ising\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8d85\u5927\u5bb9\u91cf\u5145\u7535\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5c55\u96c6\u7fa4-ising\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u9884\u671f\u5145\u7535\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002"}}

The presence of the wave pulse in such a black hole is modeled via a function $H(u)$ appearing in a restricted version of a generic Bondi-Sachs type line element. Choosing a sech-squared profile for $H(u)$, we first study (numerically) geodesic separation and geodesic deviation in a flat background. Thereafter, similar investigations are carried out in the presence of the black hole, but in regions far away from the vicinity of the horizon. Our results suggest the presence of a distinct displacement memory effect, which depends on the value of the regularisation parameter $g$ as well as the pulse height. Between different types of regular black holes, one notices parameter-dependent changes in the net displacement memory. Further, a clear difference in the magnitude of displacement memory (at large $u$) in regular and singular black holes is also visible in our numerical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6b63\u5219\u9ed1\u6d1e\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u6d4b\u5730\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u53c2\u6570g\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6b63\u5219\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6709\u6240\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5728\u8fdc\u79bb\u89c6\u754c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6b63\u5219\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u5947\u5f02\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u5927\u5c0f\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u95ee\u5019\uff1a\u60a8\u597d\uff01\u6211\u662f\u60a8\u7684\u52a9\u7406\uff0c\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\u6211\u5c06\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002\u60a8\u95ee\u7684\u662f\uff1a\u95ee\u5019\uff1a\u60a8\u597d\uff01\u6211\u662f\u60a8\u7684\u52a9\u7406\uff0c\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\u6211\u5c06\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002\u60a8\u95ee\u7684\u662f\uff1a\u95ee\u5019\uff1a\u60a8\u597d\uff01\u6211\u662f\u60a8\u7684\u52a9\u7406\uff0c\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\u6211\u5c06\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u6ce2\u8109\u51b2\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u4f4d\u79fb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u6b63\u5219\u53c2\u6570g\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6709\u5173\uff1b2. \u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6b63\u5219\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b3. \u6b63\u5219\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u5947\u5f02\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u8fdc\u79bb\u89c6\u754c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6b63\u5219\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4ea7\u751f\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e5f\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u6b63\u5219\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5bf9\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

By applying the combined coherent potential approximation (CPA) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for a ferromagnetic state, we uncover a disordered Fermi-liquid regime for the majority-spins and a low energy scale which controls the transport of the minority-spin carriers, both induced by the magnetic impurities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u80f6\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0LaAlO3/SrTiO3\u8d85\u6676\u683c\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u754c\u9762\u5c42\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6c27\u7f3a\u4f4d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u7684 onsite\u52bf\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u5fc3\u4ea4\u6362\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528between correlated carriers and\u78c1\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u88ab\u7eb3\u5165\u8003\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408coherent \u58f0\u5e26\u8fd1\u4f3c(CPA)\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba(DMFT)\uff0c\u5bf9\u94c1\u78c1\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u8981\u78c1\u6781\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u6db2\u4f53\u5236 regimes \u4ee5\u53ca\u5c11\u6570\u78c1\u6781\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u884c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u5230\u78c1\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8d85\u6676\u683c\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6c27\u7f3a\u9677\u5f15\u5165\u540e\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u80f6\u7740\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86coherent \u58f0\u5e26\u8fd1\u4f3c(CPA)\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba(DMFT)\u6765\u5206\u6790\u94c1\u78c1\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5f97\u5bf9\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u8f93\u8fd0\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u8981\u78c1\u6781\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u6db2\u4f53\u5236\u7ef4\u6301\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u5c11\u6570\u78c1\u6781\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u884c\u4e3a\u53d7\u5230\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LaAlO3/SrTiO3\u8d85\u6676\u683c\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u6c27\u5316\u6001\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u529f\u80fd\u68af\u5ea6\u6750\u6599\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Building on the framework introduced in Gunn et al., Phys. Rev. B 111, 115110 (2025), we extend the analysis from abelian and class-2 nilpotent groups to all finite nilpotent groups. For any such symmetry group $G$, we construct explicit protocols composed of $G$-symmetric circuits and measurements with feedforward that transform symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states into the trivial phase and vice versa using a finite number of measurement rounds determined by the nilpotency class of $G$. Although these transformations are approximate, we prove that their success probability converges to unity in the thermodynamic limit, establishing asymptotically deterministic equivalence. Consequently, all SPT phases protected by finite nilpotent groups collapse to a single phase once symmetric measurements and feedforward are allowed. We further show that the same holds for non-normal MPS with long-range correlations, including GHZ-type states. The central technical ingredient is a hierarchical structure of irreducible representations of nilpotent groups, which enables a recursive reduction of non-abelian components to abelian ones.

We show that although a generalized two-alternative three-photon interference setup based on CPDC or TOPDC involves eight different length parameters, the interference can be fully characterized in terms of only three independent parameters. The first parameter is the three-photon path-length difference, which has a direct analog in the one-photon and two-photon cases, and the other two parameters quantify the path-asymmetry length. Unlike two-photon interference, which requires only one parameter to quantify path-asymmetry, two independent parameters are needed in three-photon interference. This results in a broader class of nonclassical three-photon effects, including three-photon HOM-type effects.

We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schr\u00f6dinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $\u03b6$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6d4b\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001QPO\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u6270urbation\u3001\u7070\u4f53\u56e0\u5b50\u3001\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86QPO\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001ISCO\u5206\u79bb\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u8272\u6d1e\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u7684Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m_metzm\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d4b\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u6270urbation\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7070\u4f53\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86QPO\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001ISCO\u5206\u79bb\uff1b\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6270\u52a8\u52bf\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u5438\u6536\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u5bf9\u5c0f\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6Bekenstein-Hawking\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u6709\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7QPO\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ea6\u675f\u8be5\u53c2\u6570\u3002"}}

Together with a recent efficient quantum Hermite transform, which allows us to map the computational basis states to the eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator, this allows us to implement these irreps efficiently.

We derive the key thermodynamic quantities, including the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity, and analyze how the geometric parameters influence these physical quantities. The first law of thermodynamics and the corresponding Smarr formula are explicitly verified. Furthermore, we study the thermodynamic criticality of the system by deriving the critical points and examining the effects of the space-time geometric parameters.

Based on the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, combined with the Tulczyjew spin supplementary condition, we derive the orbital dynamic equations for spinning particles moving in the equatorial plane and impose a timelike constraint to exclude unphysical superluminal trajectories. By comparing with the classical Schwarzschild black hole, we systematically analyze the effects of the nonlocal gravitational parameters $\u03b6$ and $b$ on the effective potential governing the radial motion of particles and the innermost stable circular orbit. In addition, gravitational waveforms exhibit significant phase differences: an increase in $\u03b6$ induces a phase delay, whereas an increase in $b$ results in a phase advance. A one-year simulation of the orbital evolution of an extreme mass ratio inspiral demonstrates that when $b=2$ and $\u03b6\\approx10^{-6}$, the mismatch between the gravitational waveforms predicted for the nonlocal gravity black hole and those for the Schwarzschild black hole reaches the distinguishable threshold ($\\mathcal{M}=0.0125$), providing a basis for observational discrimination between general relativity and nonlocal gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u91cd\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u5468\u671f\u8f68\u9053\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eMathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408Tulczyjew\u81ea\u65cb\u8865\u5145\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u81ea\u65cb\u7c92\u5b50\u7ed5\u9759\u6b62\u5bf9\u79f0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u6392\u9664\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u8d85\u97f3\u901f\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178 Schwarzschild \u9ed1\u6d1e\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u5f15\u529b\u53c2\u6570 \u03b6 \u548c b \u5bf9\u7c92\u5b50\u5f84\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u548c\u6700\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u76f8\u4f4d\u76f8\u5dee\u663e\u8457\uff1a\u03b6 \u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u4f4d\u6ede\u540e\uff0c\u800c b \u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u4f4d\u8d85\u524d\u3002\u4e00\u5e74\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53 b=2 \u548c \u03b6\u224810^{-6} \u65f6\uff0c\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u5f15\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e Schwarzschild \u9ed1\u6d1e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u8fbe\u5230\u663e\u8457\u8fa8\u522b\u9608\u503c\uff08\u6570\u5b66\u4e3a 0.0125\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e0e\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u5f15\u529b\u89c2\u6d4b\u9274\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u6211\u4eec\u66f4\u6df1\u523b\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u529b\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u91cd\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528 Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon \u65b9\u7a0b\u548c Tulczyjew \u81ea\u65cb\u8865\u5145\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u81ea\u65cb\u7c92\u5b50\u7ed5\u5bf9\u79f0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u6392\u9664\u8d85\u97f3\u901f\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178 Schwarzschild \u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u5f15\u529b\u53c2\u6570 \u03b6 \u548c b \u5bf9\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\uff0c\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u5f15\u529b\u53c2\u6570 \u03b6 \u548c b \u5bf9\u7c92\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u03b6 \u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u76f8\u4f4d\u6ede\u540e\uff0c\u800c b \u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u4f4d\u8d85\u524d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u671f\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53 b=2 \u548c \u03b6\u224810^{-6} \u65f6\uff0c\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u5f15\u529b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e Schwarzschild \u9ed1\u6d1e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u8fbe\u5230\u663e\u8457\u8fa8\u522b\u9608\u503c\uff08\u6570\u5b66\u4e3a 0.0125\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u9274\u522b\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e0e\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u5f15\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u91cd\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178 Schwarzschild \u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5229\u7528\u5730\u57fa\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\uff08\u5982 LIGO\uff09\u7b49\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u9274\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We initiate the study of timelike bounce hypersurfaces in spherical symmetry: scenarios in which an incoming beam of charged null dust changes direction along a timelike surface $\\mathcal{B}$, which is the (free) boundary of an interacting 2-dust region. We identify a novel decoupling of the equations of motion in this region. First, it is shown that every timelike curve segment $\u03b3$ in the spherically symmetric quotient of Minkowski or Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m spacetimes arises as the bounce hypersurface $\\mathcal{B}$ of a charged null dust beam incident from past null infinity $\\mathcal{I}^-$. We construct a spacetime $(\\mathcal{M},g_{\u03bc\u03bd})$ describing the full trajectory of the beam, which includes gluing to Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m and Vaidya regions. Across $\\mathcal{B}$ the metric has regularity $g_{\u03bc\u03bd}\\in C^{2,1}$ and satisfies Einstein's equation classically, while $C^\\infty$ gluing may be achieved across all other interfaces. We also obtain examples of timelike bounce hypersurfaces terminating in a null point. Since these constructions are teleological, we secondly consider a given charged incoming beam from past null infinity. We formulate and solve a free boundary problem which represents the formation of a timelike bounce hypersurface. The result is conditional, applying only in the exterior region of a Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m spacetime, and subject to a technical regularity condition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u7684\u5149\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 bounce \u7ee7\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86 timelike bounce \u666e\u9002\u6027 Hypersurface \u5728\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u6761 timelike \u66f2\u7ebf\u4f5c\u4e3a bounce \u6444\u9762 $\text{B}$ \u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u7a7a $(\text{M}, g_{\text{\u03bc\u03bd}})$\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ee1\u8db3\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5149\u6ed1\u7ec4\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728 [Ori91] \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e26\u7535\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u5931\u53bb\u6240\u6709 4-\u52a8\u91cf\u540e\u56e0\u9759\u7535\u6392\u65a5\u53d1\u751f\u77ac\u95f4\u8f6c\u5411\uff08bounce\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790 charged null dust \u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8 bounce \u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u9759\u6001\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4f59\u7ef4\u4e3a 1 \u7684 Hypersurface \u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u6761 timelike \u66f2\u7ebf\u4f5c\u4e3a bounce \u6444\u9762\u3002\u901a\u8fc7.gluing \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m \u548c Vaidya \u533a\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8be5\u533a\u57df\u5185\u90e8\u53d6\u5f97\u5149\u6ed1\u89e3\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u5165\u5c04 beam\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u7531\u8fb9\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a bounce Hypersurface\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m \u5916\u90e8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86 timelike bounce \u6444\u9762\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u89e3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86 bounce \u6444\u9762\u7ec8\u7ed3\u4e8e null \u70b9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86 bounce \u6444\u9762\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u53ef\u5bb9\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5165\u5c04 beam \u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790 [Ori91] \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u675f\u5728\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684 bounce \u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5f97\u51fa\u5728 Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m \u5916\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7531\u8fb9\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86 bounce \u6444\u9762\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5e26\u7535\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Our results demonstrate that both the charging energy and ergotropy of the quantum batteries can be significantly enhanced within the ultra-strong coupling regime and across a broader temperature range in transient time. A unidirectional energy flow is achieved by controlling the system's initial state through its two-mode squeezed ground state. Furthermore, we show that the steady-state stored energy, along with its corresponding ergotropy, can be enhanced at larger temperatures and stronger coupling strengths. Notably, a purely beam-splitter or two-mode squeezing interaction yields zero ergotropy. These findings indicate that the enhanced stored energy and ergotropy of the quantum battery arises principally from the combined effects of beam-splitter and parametric amplification (squeezing) couplings. In addition, the presence of the squared electromagnetic vector potential term can prevent a phase transition and achieve a significant charging energy and high ergotropy in the deep-strong coupling regime.

When embedded within extended matter distributions such as prolate, shell-like halos, they give rise to complex gravitational fields that often drive nearby particles into chaotic orbits. The inherently nonlinear nature of such motion, shaped by general relativity, makes direct analysis highly challenging. To overcome this, pseudo-Newtonian potentials are used to approximate relativistic effects within a Newtonian framework. In this study, we model the central SMBH using the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov (1996) potential to mimic the rotational effects of a Kerr-like black hole. The surrounding prolate halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution, represented through a multipole expansion including dipole and quadrupole components.

The explicit form of the double elementary braiding matrices (DEBMs) in these models are derived from the F-matrices and R-symbols obtained via the q-deformed representation theory of SU(2). Using these EBMs, standard single-qubit gates are synthesized up to a global phase by a Genetic Algorithm-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev Algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA), achieving the accuracy required for fault-tolerant quantum computation with only 2-level decomposition. For two-qubit entangling gates, Genetic Algorithm (GA) yields braidwords of 30 braiding operations that approximate the local equivalence class [CNOT]. Theoretically, we demonstrate that performing double-braiding in a three-anyon (six-anyon) encoding of single-qubit (two-qubit) is topologically equivalent to a protocol requiring the physical manipulation of only one (three) anyons to execute arbitrary braids. Our numerical results provide strong evidence that double-braiding in SU(2)k anyons models is capable of universal quantum computation.

Here we introduce a method for constructing self-dual qLDPC codes by stacking non-self-dual qLDPC codes. Leveraging this methodology, we develop double-chain bicycle codes, double-layer bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, double-layer twisted BB codes, and double-layer reflection codes, many of which exhibit favorable code parameters. Additionally, we conduct numerical calculations to assess the performance of these codes as quantum memory under the circuit-level noise model, revealing that the logical failure rate can be significantly reduced with high pseudo-thresholds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u5bf9\u5076qLDPC\u7801\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7801\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u5bf9\u5076qLDPC\u7801\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f Knights \u8def\u5f84\u7801\u7b49\u81ea\u5bf9\u5076 Ark\u7801\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5806\u53e0\u975e\u81ea\u5bf9\u5076qLDPC\u7801\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u5bf9\u5076qLDPC\u7801\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u5806\u53e0\u800c\u975e\u81ea\u5bf9\u5076qLDPC\u7801\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u94fe\u5f0f\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u7801\u3001\u53cc\u91cd\u5c42\u4e8c\u5143\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\uff08BB\uff09\u7801\u3001\u53cc\u91cd\u5c42\u626dBB\u7801\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u5c42\u53cd\u5c04\u7801\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7801\u7684\u6784\u9020\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0crun\u65cf\u7801\u7684\u7801\u957f\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u5bf9\u5076qLDPC\u7801\u5728\u7535\u8def\u7ea7\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u7801\u957f\u3001\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u8f83\u5feb\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u9608\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u5bf9\u5076qLDPC\u7801\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5806\u53e0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u81ea\u5bf9\u5076qLDPC\u7801\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7801\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

A key finding is that continuous coupling, unlike discrete coupling at finite points, breaks the constant phase difference condition, thereby weakening the interference effects in giant atom-waveguide systems. In addition, a key technical advantage of the SSE approach is that auto- and cross-correlation functions can directly reflect the complex photon emission/absorption processes and time-delay effects in giant atom-waveguide systems. Moreover, the SSE approach also naturally handles multiple excitations, without increasing equation complexity as the number of excitations grows. This feature enables the investigation of multi-excitation initial states of the waveguide, such as thermal and squeezed initial states. Overall, our approach provides a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of giant atoms coupled to waveguide, particularly for continuous coupling and multi-excitation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, in this paper, we present the chaotic behavior that is completely attributed to the non-linear back-reaction of non-Markovian environment. To be specific, we derive the dynamical equations of an optomechanical system and demonstrate that the non-linearity (cause of chaos) in the equations arises entirely from the time-domain convolutions (TDCs) induced by non-Markovian corrections. Under Markovian conditions, these TDCs are reduced into constants, thereby losing the nonlinearity and ultimately leading to the disappearance of chaos. Furthermore, we also observe chaos generation in the absence of optomechanical couplings, which further confirms that the non-Markovian effect is the sole inducement of chaos and the environmental parameters play important roles in the generation of chaos. We hope these results may open a new direction to investigate chaotic dynamics purely caused by non-Markovian environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Based on a non-Markovian master equation, we show that the cat state can be transferred purely through the memory effect of the non-Markovian common environment, even without any direct couplings between neighbor cavities. The mechanism of the environment induced cat state transfer is analyzed both analytically and numerically to demonstrate that the transfer is a unique phenomenon in non-Markovian regime. From this example, the non-Markovian environment is shown to be qualitatively different from the Markovian environment reflected by the finite versus zero residue coherence. Besides, we also show the influence of environmental parameters are crucial for the transfer. We hope the cat state transfer studied in this work may shed more light on the fundamental difference between non-Markovian and Markovian environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We also introduce weak and strong notions of antidistinguiahbaility ($x$-antidistinguishability) depending on whether all states or all $x$-tuples are exhaustively eliminated. Our results reveal striking differences between state exclusion and the more familiar task of state discrimination. In particular, we show that LOCC antidistinguishability of multipartite product states is symmetric with respect to the initiating party but this symmetry breaks down for higher-order $x$-antidistinguishability. Most notably, we establish a manifestation of \\emph{nonlocality without entanglement} in the context of state exclusion: we prove that three bipartite product states can be globally antidistinguishable while failing to be LOCC antidistinguishable, demonstrating that three is the minimal number of states required for this phenomenon. We further extend this separation to $2$-antidistinguishability and present example exhibiting the same type of nonlocality. At last, we provide an antidistinguishable tripartite product states that are not LOCC antidistinguishable across any bipartition, which ensures the phenomenon of \\emph{genuine nonlocality without entanglement} in this framework.", "AI": {"tldr":

In this work, we address the Drone Delivery Packing Problem via a hybrid quantum-classical framework leveraging a neutral-atom quantum processing unit (QPU). We reformulate the optimization task as a graph-partitioning problem based on the independent sets (ISs) of a scheduling graph that encodes delivery incompatibilities. Each partition corresponds to deliveries assigned to a single drone, with the objective of minimizing the total number of partitions. While the ISs represent time-feasible schedules, battery-duration constraints are enforced through a classical post-processing routine. This methodology enables the recovery of optimal delivery schedules, provided a sufficient number of samples is collected from the QPU to resolve the solution space.

Leveraging the well defined three-qubit structure with the four nested entanglement classes (S, B, W, and GHZ), we construct three distinct witness models ($\\mathcal{M}_{B}$, $\\mathcal{M}_{W}$, and $\\mathcal{M}_{GHZ}$) that sequentially discriminate between these classes. The proposed Cascaded model achieves an overall classification accuracy of $95\\%$ on a comprehensive dataset of mixed states. The framework's robustness and generalization capabilities are confirmed through rigorous testing against out-of-distribution (OOD) entangled states and various quantum noise channels, where the model maintains high performance. A key contribution of this research is an optimization protocol based on systematic feature importance analysis. This approach yields a tunable framework that significantly reduces the number of required features, while maintaining reliable model accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In particular, the role of the self-generated magnetic field arising from electron motion and the feasibility of coherent spin control without disrupting diffraction coherence have not been quantitatively investigated. In this article, a self-consistent Maxwell-Pauli framework is developed to study spin-resolved electron diffraction from nanogratings in the presence of magnetic fields. The model incorporates geometric confinement, image-charge interactions, self-generated magnetostatic fields, and externally applied magnetic fields. Numerical simulations show that the intrinsic magnetic self-field produced by the electron probability current is several orders of magnitude too weak to induce measurable spin mixing, demonstrating that nanogratings act as spin-conserving beam splitters under field-free conditions. When a uniform magnetic field is applied upstream of the nanograting, coherent Larmor precession enables controlled spin rotation without modifying the diffraction geometry or degrading coherence. The magnetic field required for a $\u03c0$ spin rotation scales inversely with the interaction length and electron de Broglie wavelength $\u03bb_{dB}$. Furthermore, a downstream nonuniform magnetic field applied after the nanograting imparts a spatially varying Zeeman phase, producing opposite transverse momentum shifts for the two spin components. The spin-dependent transverse dynamics is analyzed using Husimi Q-function phase-space maps, which visualize spin-dependent population redistribution and momentum separation. The proposed approach enables tunable spatial separation of spin-resolved free electron beams and establishes an all-magnetic route for coherent spin rotation, control, and interferometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "A theoretical framework for spin-resolved electron diffraction from nanog gratings is established, accounting for self-generated magnetic fields.

A multi-connected Jaynes--Cummings lattice is a one-dimensional lattice constructed from alternating qubits and resonators with different left and right couplings. The nearest-neighbour interaction or cross-Kerr coupling is implemented dispersively through ladder-type qutrits between each nearest neighboring pair of resonator modes. Projecting onto the lower-polaritonic manifold, we derive an extended two-mode (bipartite) Bose--Hubbard-like model featuring on-site and attractive nearest-neighbor interactions. Employing a continuum bosonization approach, we express the Hamiltonian in terms of symmetric ($+$) and antisymmetric ($-$) collective modes. In the regime where the ($-$) sector acquires a finite gap, one can reduce the system to an effective single-component Luttinger liquid model for the $+$ sector.

However, successful networked entanglement swapping relies on generating indistinguishable pairs of photons and preserving them over deployed fibers. This has limited most previous demonstrations to laboratory settings or relied on sophisticated methods to maintain the necessary indistinguishability. Here, we demonstrate a scalable entanglement swapping experiment using naturally indistinguishable entanglement sources based on warm atomic vapor cells. Without sharing lasers or optical frequency references between nodes, nor the need for pulsing the sources, we achieve a swapping rate of nearly 500 pairs/s while maintaining the CHSH parameter above 2. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method by maintaining the quality of the entanglement swapping on 17.6-km of deployed fibers in NYC, relying on commercially available SPADs at the spoke nodes, SNSPDs at the hub and standard time-synchronization techniques.

These quantum states form an important subclass of bosonic states arising in the study of indistinguishable particles. We introduce a tensor-based parametrization where the diagonal entries of these states are encoded as a symmetric tensor, enabling a direct translation between entanglement properties and well-studied convex cones of tensors. Our results bridge multipartite entanglement theory with semialgebraic geometry and the theory of completely positive and copositive tensors. This dictionary maps separability to completely positive tensors, the PPT property to moment tensors, entanglement witnesses to copositive tensors, and decomposable witnesses to sum of squares tensors. Using this framework, we construct explicit PPT entangled states in three or more qutrits. In this class of states, we establish that PPT entanglement exists for all multipartite systems with three qutrits or more, disproving a recent conjecture in [J. Math. Phys. 66, 022203 (2025)]. We also show that, for mixtures of Dicke states, the PPT condition with respect to the most balanced bipartition implies PPT with respect to any other bipartition. We further connect bosonic extendibility of mixtures of Dicke states to the duals of known hierarchies for non-negative polynomials, such as the ones by Reznick and Polya. We thus provide semidefinite programming relaxations for separability and entanglement testing in the Dicke subspace.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper offers a mathematical framework for understanding the entanglement properties of Dicke states, a class of bosonic quantum states, dissecting separability, PPT, and entanglement witnesses through the lens of tensors and convex geometry.", "motivation": "Entanglement characterization in multipartite quantum systems is crucial but complex.
