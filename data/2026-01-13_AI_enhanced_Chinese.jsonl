These features emerge only beyond the threshold and display a pronounced temperature dependence, consistent with the formation of a collective mode within the hydrogen-bond network of the DNA-water interface. Motivated by recent studies of Hall-like responses carried by neutral excitations, including phonons, magnons, and excitons, we interpret the observed transverse signal in terms of coherent polarization dynamics of proton-proton-hole dipoles confined to a quasi-two-dimensional hydrated layer. Within this framework, the transverse response is attributed to a field-organized polarization mode; the measured transverse voltage arises from collective dipolar dynamics rather than steady carrier transport.

Building upon the Active Plasma Lens (APL) and its curved extension, the Active Plasma Bending (ABP), this work introduces the concept of the Plasma Discharge Undulator (PDU). In a PDU, a high-current discharge within a capillary generates an azimuthal magnetic field providing strong linear focusing ($O(1)$ (kT/m)), while a controlled and periodical spatial modulation of the discharge axis acts as a geometric driving term. The resulting beam dynamics can be modeled as a forced harmonic oscillator, yielding a well-defined oscillation at wavelength $\u03bb_{\\mathrm{PDU}}$, distinct from the natural betatron wavelength $\u03bb_\u03b2$ related to APL focusing. Proper injection conditions result in the suppression of collective betatron oscillations, significantly reducing the intrinsic undulator strength spread typical of conventional plasma undulators, while allowing for matched beam transport thanks to APL strong focusing. Analytical models for particle trajectories and radiation emission are developed, and the one-dimensional requirements for free-electron laser (FEL) emission are evaluated, providing scaling relations and feasibility criteria for FEL operation in the proposed scheme. Theoretical estimates and multi-particle simulations indicate that the PDU can operate in the short-period regime ($\u03bb_{\\mathrm{PDU}} = $ mm-cm) with tunable undulator strength $K_{\\mathrm{PDU}}$, supporting narrow-band radiation emission.

We map out a rich ground state phase diagram featuring diverse spin and charge ordered states. These include conventional ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases with layer staggered charge densities, a layer-coherent phase characterized by spontaneous interlayer quantum coherence, and a novel maximally spin-layer-entangled phase with a hidden composite spin-layer order.

Other developments have also urged caution regarding the idea of causality as a fundamental principle. In this paper, we examine the problem from multiple perspectives, including locality and predictivity, and extend the existing skepticism in several directions. Emphasizing the impact of unruly \"disruptors\", we point out that the illusory arrow of time associated with causality and predictivity is inherently statistical. This renders the cause-effect relation strained at the microscopic level. We also show that causation is a borderline concept that demands belief in entities which can act on nature without being part of it. Ultimately, not only is renouncing microcausality a reasonable price to pay for a consistent and predictive theory of quantum gravity (as is the one based on the fakeon idea), but the very notion of causality is misleading. Resting as it does on metaphysical assumptions, it should therefore be abandoned in fundamental physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper examines the trade-offs between causality and quantum gravity. It suggests that some approaches, like fakeons, may give up strict cause-effect at tiny scales to make quantum gravity work. Reiterates that causality might not be as fundamental as we think.

These material systems serve as an excellent platform for controlling waves, such as engineering wavenumber band gaps, flat bands, and zero-frequency band gaps. However, combining one or more of these exotic features within the same unit cell design remains a challenge. Moreover, once a metamaterial is realized, its dispersive properties are usually fixed. In this work, we present a tunable passive hierarchical metamaterial capable of exhibiting wavenumber band gaps, flat bands, and zero-frequency band gaps within the same dispersion curve. Our metamaterial is composed of magnetic elements confined within a fixed magnetic boundary. The metamaterial can be tuned by adjusting the magnetic boundary, which in turn can alter the lattice periodicity. We open wavenumber band gaps by incorporating magnetic coupling within the unit cell elements, resulting in negative physical stiffness. The tunability of the magnetic coupling also enables complete flattening of the dispersion bands. Moreover, the ground stiffness within our unit-cell design causes the opening of zero-frequency band gaps. We present our approach through a combination of analytical, numerical, and experimental methods. The analytical framework provides a blueprint for obtaining each of these exotic dispersion characteristics. The numerical analysis, using both linear and nonlinear models, validates our analytical predictions, which we further confirm through experimental demonstrations. Our work opens the door to exploring magnetic tunability and hierarchy in engineering metamaterial systems with exotic properties that can be harnessed in advanced acoustic and mechanical devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The document contains both main research article and supplemental material", "summary": "We report reproducible track-detector signals consistent with slow neutron capture events, recorded in D$_2$O electrolysis involving D-Pd deposited on Pt cathode. Sensitivity to slow neutrons was achieved using boron-coated CR-39 (BCR) detectors, which register charged particle tracks arising from the $^{10}$B$(n,\u03b1)^{7}$Li reaction. These detectors were positioned adjacent to identically prepared uncoated CR-39 control detectors (CCR), which are effectively insensitive to slow neutrons and serve to quantify background contributions from charged particles and fast neutrons under the present experimental conditions. A reproducible differential detector signature (BCR $>$ CCR) would thus indicative of slow neutron fluences. Across multiple independent D$_2$O electrolysis experiments in $0.25~\\mathrm{T}$ field, the BCR exhibited significantly excess track signals relative to CCRs. Under these conditions, the observed differential response corresponds to an inferred detector-equivalent slow neutron flux of approximately $(6.7 \\pm 0.2)~\\mathrm{cm^{-2},s^{-1}}$. Removal of the magnetic field resulted in a reduction of the differential signal by a factor of $\\sim6$, indicating a strong empirical dependence on the applied field. In contrast, H$_2$O electrolysis performed under otherwise identical conditions produced no measurable differential detector response, establishing the necessity of deuterated electrochemical conditions for the observed effect. The results are reported strictly as detector signatures consistent with slow neutron capture and do not assert any theoretical explanation. Instead, this work establishes a control verified and detector validated experimental protocol for detecting low flux slow neutrons, and provides empirical constraints relevant to slow neutron studies

Surprisingly, in the presence of a net fluid flow, proprioceptive noise improves Bayesian inference, rather than degrading it. An optimal noise exists that efficiently leverages additional information hidden within the geometry of the odor plume. Empirical tuning of noise functions well across a range of distances and may be implemented in practice.

By incorporating an alternating next-nearest-neighbor hopping (NNNH) term, which arises from the influence of non-magnetic atoms in altermagnetic candidate materials, our results reveal key signatures of AM-like states, including spin-splitting quasiparticle bands and spectral functions, and demonstrate that d-wave AM remains stable across a broad range of interaction strengths, doping levels, NNNH amplitudes and temperatures, highlighting its robustness. Furthermore, through an analysis of non-magnetic impurity effects, we further confirm the d-wave symmetry of the AM phase. These findings establish a solid theoretical foundation for exploring AM-like phases in f-electron compounds, paving the way for future investigations into their exotic magnetic and electronic properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Focusing on waveguides with linearly varying thickness, we show that the $S_2$ mode becomes evanescent over a narrow frequency band, enabling a tunnelinglike phenomenon. Our study demonstrates that the barrier width is governed by the elastic properties of the material, particularly the Poisson's ratio, within a confined range bordering the Dirac cone. Numerical results exhibit excellent agreement with predictions from the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation.

The method uses a nonisolated, lossless five-port hybrid waveguide combiner for power combining. Meanwhile, the injection-locking technology has been applied to magnetrons for achieving coherent power combining. The phase fluctuation of the injection-locked magnetron, without the presence of a phase-locked loop, measured nearly 2.5 degree. In contrast, when a phase-locked loop was introduced, the phase fluctuation reduced significantly to approximately 0.5 degree. This phase accuracy can fully meet the requirements of combining experiments. Four magnetrons worked in injection-locked states without phase-locked loop.

In the regime where environmental correlations decay rapidly, the evolution of a subsytem is well described by a Lindblad quantum master equation. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for simulating unital Lindbladian dynamics by sampling unitary quantum channels without extra ancillas. Using ancillary qubits we show that this algorithm allows approximating general Lindbladians as well. For interacting dephasing Lindbladians coupling two subsystems, we develop a decoupling scheme that reduces the circuit complexity of the simulation. This is achieved by sampling from a time-correlated probability distribution - determined by the evolution of one subsystem, which specifies the stochastic circuit implemented on the complementary subsystem. We demonstrate our approach by studying a model of bosons coupled to fermions via dephasing, which naturally arises from anharmonic effects in an electron-phonon system coupled to a bath. Our method enables tracing out the bosonic degrees of freedom, reducing part of the dynamics to sampling an instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuit. The sampled bitstrings then define a corresponding fermionic problem, which in the non-interacting case can be solved efficiently classically. We comment on the computational complexity of this class of dissipative problems, using the known fact that sampling from IQP circuits is believed to be difficult classically.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses quantum algorithms for simulating Lindbladian dynamics, focusing on unital Lindbladians and their efficient simulation using quantum channels and ancillary qubits.

By numerically solving the TOV equations, we obtain the interior solutions of neutron stars for different densities. The results indicate that as the polynomial index $n_c$ increases, the mass, radius, and compactness of the neutron star all increase, which has a significant impact on its optical properties. Under the assumption that the light is truncated at the surface of the neutron star, we find that for a spherical light source, an increase in $n_c$ leads to an enlargement of the Einstein ring radius. For a thin accretion disk, the light intensity always reaches its maximum at the surface of the neutron star. The increase in $n_c$ also causes the outline of the neutron star to grow. When the observer inclination angle $\u03b8_o$ changes, the neutron star's outline deforms from a circular shape to a D shape, with the left side being significantly brighter than the right side. In addition, this paper also investigates the distribution characteristics of the redshift factor. At lower observer inclination angles, gravitational redshift dominates, while at higher inclination angles, the Doppler effect induces noticeable blueshift. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole, the optical appearance of the neutron star shows significant differences. The study provides a theoretical basis for distinguishing neutron stars from black holes using high-resolution imaging and for constraining the equation of state.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The objective is to characterize their molecular structures, spectroscopic constants, and electronic energies, and to elucidate plausible formation and destruction pathways, providing data critical for astrochemical and atmospheric detection. High-accuracy ab initio methods were employed, notably CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 for optimized geometries. Additional calculations were performed at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ, CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ, MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ, and CIS levels. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to explore reaction pathways. Zero-point energy corrections were determined for all isomers considered. Six low-energy C2H4N2 isomers were identified, all within 1 eV of the global minimum. Among them, methylcyanamide (MCA) exhibits the lowest relative energy (~0.2 eV) and a significant electric dipole moment of 5.00 D, making it a strong candidate for gas-phase detection. The rotational constants for MCA, computed at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level, are Ae = 34932.44 MHz, Be = 4995.31 MHz, and Ce = 4520.30 MHz. The V3 torsional barrier was found to be 631.19 cm^{-1}. Centrifugal distortion constants were computed up to sextic order for all isomers. Formation pathways for MCA, such as CH3N + HCN -> CH3NHCN and related isomers, were characterized. The combination of large dipole moments and distinct rotational signatures supports the detectability of methylcyanamide and related C2H4N2 isomers via radioastronomy, infrared, and microwave spectroscopy. Isomerization and reaction pathways involving radical-neutral and neutral-neutral processes were found to be key to their formation in gas-phase environments.

Under review at Nonlinear Dynamics", "summary": "This paper develops a comprehensive two-dimensional generalisation of the recently introduced Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD) framework for rolling contact problems. The proposed formulation extends the one-dimensional FrBD model to accommodate simultaneous longitudinal and lateral slips, spin, and arbitrary transport kinematics over a finite contact region. The derivation combines a rheological representation of the bristle element with an analytical local sliding-friction law. By relying on an application of the Implicit Function Theorem, the notion of sliding velocity is then eliminated, and a fully dynamic friction model, driven solely by the rigid relative velocity, is obtained. Building upon this local model, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, covering standard linear rolling contact, as well as linear and semilinear rolling in the presence of large spin slips. For the linear formulations, well-posedness, stability, and passivity properties are investigated under standard assumptions. In particular, the analysis reveals that the model preserves passivity under almost any parametrisation of practical interest. Numerical simulations illustrate steady-state action surfaces, transient relaxation phenomena, and the effect of time-varying normal loads. The results provide a unified and mathematically tractable friction model applicable to a broad class of rolling contact systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The framework is designed with a focus on extensibility, providing a streamlined interface for instrument integration. It supports efficient system setup via network discovery mechanisms, promotes stability through autonomous operational features, and provides comprehensive documentation and supporting tools for operators and application developers such as controllers and logging interfaces.\n  At the core of the architectural design is the autonomy of the individual components, called satellites, which can make independent decisions about their operation and communicate these decisions to other components.

This situation necessitates the investigation of alternative signatures of AHCs. The gapless phonons of the emergent electronic lattice provide a clear distinction from conventional quantum Hall states, but it may be difficult to disentangle these phonons from the plethora of other possible low-lying modes. Intriguingly, the quantum geometry of the underlying electronic ground state can imprint on the collective modes, possibly leading the phonons themselves to be topological. Were this the case, the resulting neutral chiral edge modes would provide a further signature of an AHC. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we compute the spectra of collective modes of Wigner crystals (WCs) and AHCs arising in minimal models and study the topology of the phonons and low-lying excitons. Across the WC to AHC transition, we observe a series of band inversions among collective modes, producing topological phonons and excitons, and a sharp sign change in the phonon Chern number upon entering the AHC phase. We conclude by discussing the relevance of collective mode topology to experiments on candidate systems for AHCs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These include inter- and intra-site atom motion for resource-efficient implementations of fermionic and bosonic modes, respectively, as well as tweezer transport for efficient compilation of arbitrary circuits. However, the exploitation of atomic motion for all three purposes and others is limited by the inertia of the atoms. We present a comprehensive architectural blueprint for the use of fermionic metastable helium-3 ($^3$He$^*$) atoms -- the lightest trappable atomic species -- in programmable optical tweezer arrays. This includes a concrete analysis of atomic structure considerations as well as Rydberg-mediated interactions. We show that inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atoms can be $\\gtrsim3\\times$ faster than previous demonstrations with lithium-6. We also demonstrate a new toolbox for encoding and manipulating qubits directly in the tweezer trap potential, uniquely enabled by the light mass of $^3$He$^*$. Finally, we provide several examples of new opportunities for fermionic quantum simulation and computation that leverage the transport and inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atom arrays. These tools present new methods to improve the resource efficiency of neutral atom quantum science that may also enable quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories and quantum chemistry outside the Born-Oppenheimer approximation", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6805\u9677\u9631\u4e2d\u6c26-3\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a0\u5feb\u539f\u5b50\u8dc3\u8fc1\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u72ec\u7279\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u80fd\u591f\u64cd\u63a7\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6c26-3\u539f\u5b50\u56e0\u5176\u8f7b\u91cf\u7279\u6027\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u6805\u9677\u9631\u548c Rydberg \u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6c26-3 \u539f\u5b50\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u9677\u9631\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6c26-3 \u539f\u5b50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u53cc\u9677\u9631\u8df3\u8dc3\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002"}}

When exploring the transmission of quantum states, faster transmission times are mandatory to avoid the deleterious effects of multiple sources of decoherence that spoil the transmission process. In particular, using Reinforcement Learning to devise sequences of step-wise external controls provides good transfer policies at short transmission times. We present two approaches to control the transmission of quantum states in qubit chains using external controls to force the dynamical evolution of the chain state. The first approach relies on the well-known Genetic Algorithm to generate a sequence of external controls, while the second approach uses a variant of Reinforcement Learning. The Genetic algorithm achieves excellent transmission fidelity at as short transmission times as Reinforcement Learning, surpassing the fidelities achieved by the latter method. Nevertheless, the Reinforcement Learning method offers robust control policies when the control pulses are noisy enough, owing to an imperfect timing of the pulses, deficient control devices, or other sources of phase decoherence. We present the regime where each method is best suited to control the transmission of arbitrary qubit states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u5206\u5316\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c1d\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5916\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5916\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u56e0\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u57fa\u56e0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u63a7\u5236\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u56e0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u56e0\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u7cbe\u786e\u4e14\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u5927\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u8f83\u5927\u6216\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u9700\u6c42\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4e3a\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Imposing compatibility of this quantum framework with the semiclassical results creates a novel link between the particle angular momentum and the black hole electric charge before and after emission, leading to a nontrivial interplay between the superradiance effect and other channels. We evaluate single scalar (neutral and charged) emission of Kerr-Newman and single and di-particle emission of photons, gravitons and spinors in the Kerr spacetime. We uncover that quantum corrections may affect late time evaporation rates, which further slows down the whole evaporation process because of the near-balance between the $s$-wave channel and the superradiance channel. Specifically, we find energy decay of the form $E(t)\\sim t^{-8/21}$ for scalar emission of a small, slowly rotating and charged black hole which differs from the analogous spherically symmetric quantum correction of $E(t)\\sim t^{-2/5}$ already suppressed with respect to the semiclassical rate of $E(t)\\sim t^{-1}$.

Here we present Speckle Clean Network (SCNet), a physics-guided foundation model for universal speckle removal that makes photon-limited, single-fiber collection compatible with high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse scattering conditions without target-specific retraining. SCNet combines a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with material-aware routing, wavelet-based frequency decomposition to separate structure from speckle across sub-bands, and a curriculum-style optimization that progressively enforces spectral consistency before spatial fidelity. Using an ultrathin dual-fiber holographic probe, we deliver wavefront-shaped illumination through one s and collect backscattered photons through a parallel MMF. We validate SCNet on 3D plastic objects over varying working distances, resolve 5.66 lp/mm on a paper USAF target, and restore fine structures on leaves and metal surfaces. On rabbit heart and kidney tissues, SCNet improves recovery of low-contrast anatomical texture under the same ultrathin collection constraint. We further compress SCNet through multi-teacher distillation to reduce computation while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling inference at 60 FPS.

Assaad"], "title": "Revealing altermagnetic Fermi surfaces with two Kondo impurities", "comment": null, "summary": "Motivated by recent advances in the study of altermagnetism, or unconventional magnetism, and in the realization and manipulation of two-impurity Kondo physics in real materials, we propose a phase-sensitive method to explore unconventional magnetic symmetries. Our method can be implemented with spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy to study two-impurity Kondo phenomena on altermagnetic metals by varying the distance and orientation between magnetic impurities.

I begin with the no-go theorem of Perarnau-Llobet et al (2017): no universal measurement scheme for quantum work satisfies two intuitive, classically consilient desiderata. I assess this incompatibility as stemming from the measurement problem. Decoherence restores compatibility for all practical purposes, but raises questions about what 'universality' should mean and whether any measurement scheme can be 'universal'. I consider a different standard of universality -- in terms of ontology -- by defining a trajectory-based notion of quantum work using the quantum potential. While this preserves the classical role of work as the integral of forces over distances, and evades the tension of the no-go theorem, consilience fails elsewhere; no single quantum work concept seems capable of preserving all classical features, raising questions for what it takes for successful generalization of the work concept to quantum thermodynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper addresses the challenge of generalizing classical work into quantum thermodynamics by examining the limitations of existing quantum work definitions and proposing a new trajectory-based concept.", "motivation": "The motivation behind this paper is to resolve the inconsistency between classical and quantum work concepts, which is a significant issue in quantum thermodynamics.", "method": "The authors analyze the no-go theorem by Perarnau-Llobet et al.

Section 4 code available at https://github.com/StoneStoney/AnyonLearner", "summary": "The Levin-Wen string-net formalism provides a canonical mapping from spherical fusion categories to local Hamiltonians defining Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\\text{TY}(\\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel calculation method based on Fermat's principle that directly and efficiently determines the reflection point by minimizing the optical path length from a point light source to a hologram pixel via the mirror surface, using Newton's method for optimization.

In this paper, we focus on the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter case and present a unified analytic treatment of the horizon structure and its physical properties, allowing for a transparent comparison between general relativity and $ f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature. We solve the quartic equation determining the horizon locations and derive closed analytic expressions for the horizon radii. Focusing on extremal configurations, we obtain analytic formulas for the squared rotation parameter $ a^2 $ and the inverse square of the curvature radius $ l^{-2} $ as functions of the horizon location and the electric charge. For generic values of these parameters, the extremality conditions are non-universal, reducing to the familiar Kerr-Newman bound only in the limit of vanishing background curvature. We identify an ultra-extremal configuration in which $ a^2 $ attains its maximal value at zero charge and decreases monotonically to zero as the charge approaches its limiting value, while $ l^{-2 }$ increases correspondingly. As an illustrative example, we show that black holes with charge $ q=M/2 $ necessarily possess a minimum rotation, which emerges naturally as an intersection point in our analytic description of $ a^2 $ and $ l^{-2 }$, when embedded in a universe characterized by a critical value of $ l^{-2} $ (equivalently, the scalar curvature or the cosmological constant). Finally, we demonstrate that when the mass satisfies $ M^2= (a^2+q^2)(1-a^2/l^2)$, the quartic horizon equation factorizes, leading in the extremal regime to a chiral-like horizon structure that allows only the outer-cosmological horizon merger.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a detailed analysis of black hole solutions in $f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature, focusing on the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter case.

We propose protocols to simultaneously control the internal (related to its pseudospin-1/2) and motional (position-related) states of a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a Morse potential. In the presence of synthetic spin-orbit coupling, the state transition of a noninteracting condensate can be implemented by Raman coupling and detuning terms designed by invariant-based inverse engineering. The state transfer may also be driven by tuning the direction of the spin-orbit-coupling field and modulating the magnitude of the effective synthetic magnetic field.

However, since non-local gates acting on different Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) are a bottleneck, it is crucial to optimize the qubit assignment to minimize inter-node entanglement of the shared resource. For graph state resources shared across two QPUs, this task reduces to finding bipartitions with minimal cut rank. We introduce a simulated annealing-based algorithm that efficiently updates the cut rank when two vertices swap sides across a bipartition, such that computing the new cut rank from scratch, which would be much more expensive, is not necessary. We show that the approach is highly effective for determining qubit assignments in distributed MBQC by testing it on grid graphs and the measurement-based Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In terms of (disordered) $\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ Landau-Ginzburg theory, we establish a duality between two models.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the $E$-type model also exhibits emergent higher-spin symmetry in certain limits.

We evaluate the photonic quasicrystal accurately by a generalized spectral method that embeds the quasiperiodic structure into a higher-dimensional periodic system. We study the spectral distribution of one-dimensional photonic quasicrystals and find some interesting phenomena. As the computational resolution N increases, there are more eigenvalues within finite frequency bandwidths, and the maximum localization always occurs at spectral gap edges for states near index N + 1. By varying \u03b2within the range of (0,1), we present a butterfly-shaped spectral structure with abundant band gaps. We find that the spectral structure factor Q (defined as I_{mg}/N, where I_{mg} is the maximum gap index) exhibits different linear patterns as \u03b2changes: Q = 1 - \u03b2when \u03b2< \u03b2c, while Q = \u03b2when \u03b2> \u03b2c, where \u03b2c \\approx 0.424 is the transition point. This linear relationship holds robustly in the strong quasiperiodic regime (\u03b2away from 0 or 1) and is independent of the specific type of irrational number used. The relationship disappears (weak quasiperiodic regime) near \u03b2= 0 or \u03b2= 1.

In this work, we successfully synthesized high-quality GdAlSi single crystals, a prototypical member of RAlX (R = rare earth elements; X = Si/Ge) family that has been theoretically predicted to sustain a non-trivial Weyl semimetal state. Through systematic investigations of magnetic and transport properties, we identified two successive antiferromagnetic transitions at critical temperatures TN1 31.9 K and TN2 31.1 K, as evidenced by temperature-dependent resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements. Notably, applied magnetic fields exceeding 8 T induce a third magnetic transition (TN3), generating a cascade of metamagnetic transitions that collectively form a dendritic phase diagram. This complex magnetic behavior is attributed to the interplay between localized Gd-4f moments and itinerant conduction electrons, possibly mediated by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Transport measurements revealed striking stepwise anomalies in magnetoresistance when crossing phase boundaries, accompanied by pronounced hysteresis loops arising from magnetic moment flopping processes.

However, determining the composition and processing conditions that produce a desired function is a tedious process due to the large number of factors that must be considered and the manual nature of most synthesis and characterization methods. Self-driving labs (SDLs), or robotic systems that prepare and test materials samples, are designed to overcome this bottleneck by enabling the efficient exploration of complex parameter spaces. In this paper, we report the development and testing of the polymer analysis and discovery array (PANDA)-film, a modular SDL for electrochemically synthesizing polymer films and then determining their water contact angle as a measure of surface energy. The system is designed to be highly modular and based upon a lowcost gantry platform to facilitate adoption. In addition to validating fluid handling and electrochemical tasks, we introduce two novel modular capabilities that enable PANDA-film to run sustained campaigns to study the wetting properties of films: (1) an electromagnetic capping/decapping system to mitigate fluid evaporation, and (2) a top-down optical method to determine water contact angle based upon reflectance. These capabilities are validated by depositing and characterizing a poly(allyl methacrylate) (PAMA) film using electrodeposition of polymer networks (EPoN).

As a bulk probe for topological invariants, we focus on the Mean Chiral Displacement (MCD) and show that it exhibits a pronounced sensitivity to boundary conditions, which can be traced to the dynamics in momentum space. Under open boundaries, states that would otherwise extend freely become localized at the edges of the finite momentum space, forming quasienergy edge states. While the bulk response measured by the MCD is strongly affected once the evolving wave packet reaches the boundaries, the persistence of these edge states still reflects the bulk-edge correspondence and provides reliable signatures of topological transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Its magnetic ground state however, has been reported to be quantum disordered, spin glassy, or magnetically ordered depending on synthesis details. We have prepared a Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ sample with large antisite disorder and studied in detail its structure (global and local), charge states, and thermodynamic properties to try to quantify and characterize the disorder and its connection to the magnetic ground state. X-ray diffraction, Extended x-ray absorption fine structure(EXAFS) and X-ray pair distribution function analysis revealed a large site disorder ($\\sim$25\\%), while XPS and XANES reveal mixed valence of Cu and Ir following Cu$^{1+}$ + Ir$^{4+}$ $\\rightarrow$ Cu$^{2+}$ + Ir$^{3+}$. This combination of site disorder and charge redistribution generates competing antiferromagnetic interactions and magnetic frustration, resulting in dynamically fluctuating AFM clusters near 80K that freeze below 29K. These results demonstrate the crucial role of synthesis dependent disorder in determining the magnetic ground state of Cu$_2$IrO$_3$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86Cu\u2082IrO\u2083\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7535\u8377\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u6750\u6599\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u7684antisite\u65e0\u5e8f\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u7535\u8377\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u65cb frustrating\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f62\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7c07\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5bfc\u81f4\u6750\u6599\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6709\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u6001\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3 condensed matter physics \u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u800c Cu\u2082IrO\u2083 \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd Iridate\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u626e\u6f14\u7740\u7c7b\u4f3c\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5982\u4f55\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u590d\u6742\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528 X-ray\u884d\u5c04\u3001EXAFS \u548c X-ray \u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 XPS \u548c XANES \u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u7535\u8377\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7535\u8377\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cCu\u2082IrO\u2083 \u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684antisite\u65e0\u5e8f\uff08\u7ea625%\uff09\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u7535\u8377\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u4eceCu\u00b2+/Ir\u00b3+\u5230 Cu\u00b2+/Ir\u2074+\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u65cb frustrating\u7684\u5f88\u591a\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7c07\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u6709\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f\u5728\u51b3\u5b9aCu\u2082IrO\u2083\u78c1\u6027\u6001\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

While standard black hole solutions suffer from central singularities, regular black holes avoid this issue by introducing a nonsingular core. In this work, we extend the Dymnikova regular black hole to higher dimensions using a smooth matter distribution. The resulting spacetime features a de Sitter-like core and two horizons. We analyze photon motion and show that circular photon orbits remain unstable, giving rise to a well-defined black hole shadow. Our results indicate that the shadow size grows with the black hole scale but decreases slightly as the number of dimensions increases. We also investigate thermodynamic properties, including Hawking temperature and energy emission, and find a strong dependence on dimensionality. Finally, we compare our model with EHT observations to place constraints on the parameters and highlight potential observational signatures of higher-dimensional regular black holes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Extended a 4D regular black hole solution to higher dimensions using smooth matter distribution, found photon orbits unstable, black hole shadow depends on scale and dimensionality, Hawking temperature and energy emission dependent on dimensionality, compared with EHT for constraints and signatures", "motivation": "Exploring higher-dimensional regular black holes for potential observational signatures and understanding their thermodynamic properties requires extending 4D models to higher dimensions and comparing with observations", "method": "Used smooth matter distribution to generalize the 4D Dymnikova regular black hole to higher dimensions, studied photon motion, analyzed black hole shadow and thermodynamic properties", "result": "Found that the size of the black hole shadow grows with the black hole scale but decreases slightly as the number of dimensions increases.

The matrix is formed by the coupling constants between the resonators, and the input vector is formed by the initial occupancies of the involved modes. The frequency of the collective oscillations is growing with the number of the involved modes, similarly to Rabi oscillations.

In light of recent gravity results one would expect much like the ground state degeneracy this fine tuned condition too will not be met. It is unclear though whether this should be a quantum artefact or classical. In this paper we consider a non-BPS extremal four-charge Reissner Nordstrom black hole in N = 8 String theory. It is shown that the microscopic D-brane description fails to admit any extremal state, even classically. This positive energy is expected to destabilize the near horizon AdS2.

This study investigates the properties of quantum fields by exploring the quantum coherence of a two-mode Gaussian state near a black hole, where Hawking quanta originate from the quantum atmosphere region. It is demonstrated that both physically accessible and inaccessible quantum coherence for continuous variable quantum states distinctly exhibit hallmark features of the quantum atmosphere. Specifically, the quantum coherence for these states varies continuously with changes in the normalized distance; it undergoes rapid decreases (or increases) just outside the event horizon before gradually stabilizing through subsequent increases (or decreases). This behavior contrasts with the behaviors of quantum coherence where originates solely from the black hole's event horizon. The quantum features of the fields distinctly reflect characteristics attributable to the quantum atmosphere, thereby deepening our understanding of the origins of Hawking radiation. We also find that the continuous variable coherence is highly dependent on both the squeezing parameter and field frequency of the prepared state; therefore, appropriately adjusting these values can enhance our ability to detect features within the quantum atmosphere.

Formulating the deformation as a modification of the asymptotic variational principle in AdS$_3$, we obtain the exact quadratic trace relation for the stress tensor without introducing a finite radial cutoff, which we take as the fundamental definition of the deformed theory. When restricted to a BCFT without independent boundary degrees of freedom, the intrinsic $T\\bar T$ deformation becomes genuinely boundary-localized. Imposing reflective boundary conditions collapses the bulk composite operator to a universal one-dimensional irrelevant flow governed entirely by the displacement operator. We integrate this flow in closed form and derive an induced boundary action, showing that the deformation reorganizes existing boundary data without introducing new boundary degrees of freedom. We further establish a precise equivalence between a fixed-boundary description and a moving-boundary description, interpreted as a reparametrization of the variational problem rather than physical boundary dynamics.\n  On the holographic side, we analyze two inequivalent realizations in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$, referred to as Type~A and Type~B. In Type~A, a rigid cutoff surface intersects the end-of-the-world brane at finite position, leading to an apparent boundary displacement. In Type~B, the cutoff surface is asymptotically AdS$_2$, so that the BCFT boundary is geometrically pinned and the displacement operator vanishes identically.

In this paper, we present a detailed theoretical analysis of OAM transfer from the input field to the generated signal field in a four-level double-Lambda system via the four-wave mixing (FWM) process, showing that their OAMs follow a specific algebraic relationship. We identify the optimal conditions for efficient vortex light transmission, analyze the influence of detuning on transmission efficiency and phase distortion, and specifically examine the scenario where the control field carries OAM the latter being essential for a complete characterization of OAM conservation in the FWM process, while all three aspects have been largely overlooked in the existing literature.

It is based on the belief that collinear magnets always feature an inversion-symmetric band structure, which forbids odd-wave magnetism. Here, we show that collinear magnets, which break time reversal symmetry in the non-magnetic sector, can have an inversion symmetry broken band structure and lead to unconventional types of collinear magnets. Hence, collinear odd-wave magnets do exist, and we explain that a magnetic field-induced Edelstein effect is their unique signature. We propose minimal models based on the coexistence of AFM order with compensated loop current orders for all types of collinear magnets.

Using only prompting, LLMs are given task constraints and summaries of prior high-scoring designs and propose complete detector configurations, which we evaluate with the same simulators and reward functions used in RL-based optimization. Although RL yields stronger final designs, we find that modern LLMs consistently generate valid, resource-aware, and physically meaningful configurations that draw on broad pretrained knowledge of detector design principles and particle--matter interactions, despite having no task-specific training. Based on this result, as a first step toward hybrid design workflows, we explore pairing the LLMs with a dedicated trust region optimizer, serving as a precursor to future pipelines in which LLMs propose and structure design hypotheses while RL performs reward-driven optimization. Based on these experiments, we argue that LLMs are well suited as meta-planners: they can design and orchestrate RL-based optimization studies, define search strategies, and coordinate multiple interacting components within a unified workflow. In doing so, they point toward automated, closed-loop instrument design in which much of the human effort required to structure and supervise optimization can be reduced.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs can generate valid and effective physics instrument designs without task-specific training, complementing RL-based methods for hybrid workflows.", "motivation": "The paper explores the use of LLMs and RL in physics instrument design to find a hybrid approach that combines their strengths.", "method": "The study compares prompting LLMs with RL by evaluating their designs via simulators and reward functions, focusing on resource-awareness and knowledge transfer.", "result": "While RL yields stronger designs, LLMs generate valid and meaningful configurations, suggesting they are suitable as meta-planners.", "conclusion": "LLMs and RL can complement each other in automated, closed-loop design processes, reducing human effort in optimization."}}

In space quantum communication and sensing, where a shared RF is absent, the interplay between locality and symmetry imposes fundamental restrictions on physical systems. A restriction on realizable unitary operations results in a no-go theorem prohibiting the extraction of locally encoded information in RF-independent distributed metrology. Here, we propose a reversed-encoding method applied to two copies of local-unitary-invariant network states. This approach circumvents the no-go theorem while simultaneously mitigating decoherence-like noise caused by RF misalignment, thereby enabling the complete recovery of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Furthermore, we confirm local Bell-state measurements as an optimal strategy to saturate the QFI.

Here, we introduce a single-exposure holographic three-dimensional (3D) printing approach that synthesizes an entire volumetric dose distribution optically in one step. The method combines inverse-designed microstructured phase masks with photopolymer resins engineered for controlled optical absorption. By precisely tailoring the phase-mask topography, we generate arbitrary 3D light-intensity distributions within the resin, including intentionally encoded dark regions that define hollow internal features. Simultaneously, the resin formulation is designed to balance optical penetration with sufficient local energy deposition to achieve high-fidelity polymerization throughout the volume. Using this approach, millimeter-scale architectures comprising more than $10^{6}$ addressable voxels are fabricated in a single 7.5~s exposure, corresponding to a volumetric throughput of $\\sim$1~mm$^{3}$/s ($>10^{5}$~voxels/s). The demonstrated performance is presently limited by resin kinetics and illumination geometry rather than by the phase-mask framework itself. Because the volumetric information capacity scales with the space--bandwidth product of the phase mask, this approach provides a clear pathway toward substantially higher throughput, enabling scalable fabrication of micro-optical components, biomedical scaffolds, and other precision-engineered mesoscale systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Through oxygen vacancy engineering at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, we have achieved nonvolatile and reconfigurable cAFM control of nanoscale interfacial polaron-electron liquid transition at mK temperatures with an ultrafine line resolution of 0.85 nm.

On the pure-state manifold, the even contribution vanishes identically, while the odd contribution coincides with the QFI derived from the natural metric on the Siegel upper half-space, revealing a direct geometric underpinning of pure-Gaussian metrology. This also provides a link between the graphical representation of pure Gaussian states and an explicit expression for the QFI in terms of graphical parameters. For evolutions completely generated by passive Gaussian unitaries (orthogonal symplectics), the odd QFI vanishes, while thermometric parameters contribute purely to the even sector with a simple spectral form; we also derive a state-dependent lower bound on the even QFI in terms of the purity-change rate. We extend the construction to the full QFI matrix, obtaining an additive even odd sector decomposition that clarifies when cross-parameter information vanishes. Applications to unitary sensing (beam splitter versus two-mode squeezing) and to Gaussian channels (loss and phase-insensitive amplification), including joint phase loss estimation, demonstrate how the decomposition cleanly separates resources associated with spectrum versus correlations.

Here we demonstrate a metasurface-integrated quantum emitter (metaQE) platform enabling room-temperature on-chip generation of single-photon skyrmions.

Such an identity converts the curvature area term in the Gauss-Bonnet theorem into a pure boundary contribution via Green/Stokes-type relations, yielding a deflection formula that depends only on boundary data and controlled closure terms. The residual normalization freedom of the isothermal radius is isolated as an additive freedom in the conformal factor and is shown to leave physical observables invariant, eliminating the need for orbit dependent calibration prescriptions. We explicitly implement the boundary only formalism in weak deflection, where the leading bending reduces to elementary one-dimensional integrals evaluated on a flat reference ray in the conformal plane, with finite distance dependence entering solely through endpoint data. We validate the construction by reproducing finite distance weak deflection for Schwarzschild, deriving the leading finite distance charge correction for Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m, and applying the same boundary only framework to the Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) geometry as a representative non-asymptotically flat test case, recovering the standard finite distance expansion including the explicit $\\mathcal{O}(\u039b)$ and mixed $\\mathcal{O}(\u039bM)$ contributions to the total deflection angle.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Yet, in quantum theory, it has traditionally been thought that local realism cannot hold and that such effects do occur. This apparent discrepancy between the two theories is resolved by Everettian quantum theory, as first proven by Deutsch & Hayden (2000).

In the presence of open boundary conditions, this system is precisely mapped, through a nonunitary gauge transformation, to the Hermitian AAH model with balanced hopping terms. The mapping leaves the spectrum unchanged but reshapes each eigenfunction by a realization-dependent random-walk envelope. In a parameter regime where the Hermitian counterpart hosts spectrally isolated in-gap boundary modes, we identify two such modes with sharply different responses to the envelope: one stays anchored at the boundary, while the other is controllable via the gauge, allowing its peak intensity to be relocated solely by altering the gauge setup without modifying the associated eigenenergy. Additionally, we demonstrate that this steerable mode can be preferentially enhanced and generated from an initial bulk wavefunction by introducing mild site-specific amplification at a location determined exclusively from the Hermitian model using the biorthogonal function. These findings offer pathways for both static and dynamic manipulation of spatially adjustable in-gap states in quasiperiodic non-Hermitian lattices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, these detectors typically have pixel sizes about ten times larger than those of direct electron detectors commonly used for imaging and more prominent electron multiple scattering effects. To overcome these limitations, machine learning approaches can be utilized to reconstruct the electron entrance point and achieve super-resolution. As this process is inherently stochastic, and machine learning relies on suitable training data, high-quality, representative training data are essential for developing models that achieve the best possible resolution. In this work, we present two novel experimental methods for generating such training data. The first method employs precise microscope alignment to scan the detector plane using a finely focused electron beam of 2 \u03bcm diameter, enabling controlled sub-pixel mapping. The second method utilizes specially designed aperture masks with sub-pixel-sized holes to accurately localize electron entry points.

The proximity-induced exchange coupling, magnetic moments, and tunneling spin polarization (TSP) are shown to depend sensitively on the atomic registry at the interfaces. We analyze more than twenty distinct stackings, including high- and low-symmetry configurations, and reveal that the spin splittings of graphene's Dirac bands span a wide range from 1 to 100 meV, depending on the local hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$, hBN $p_z$, and graphene $p_z$ orbitals. The strongest proximity effects emerge at geometric resonances, or \"proximity hot spots\", where the three orbital states overlap maximally. The local spin polarization also depends sensitively on energy: Dirac states aligned with resonant Co orbitals experience the most pronounced exchange interaction.

It is widely believed that in order to perform native logical non-Clifford gates, one needs to resort to 3D product-code constructions. In this work, we extend Kitaev's framework of non-Abelian topological codes on manifolds to non-Abelian qLDPC codes (realized as Clifford-stabilizer codes) and the corresponding combinatorial topological quantum field theories (TQFT) defined on Poincar\u00e9 CW complexes and certain types of general chain complexes. We also construct the spacetime path integrals as topological invariants on these complexes. Remarkably, we show that native non-Clifford logical gates can be realized using constant-rate 2D hypergraph-product codes and their Clifford-stabilizer variants. This is achieved by a spacetime path integral effectively implementing the addressable gauging measurement of a new type of 0-form subcomplex symmetries, which correspond to addressable transversal Clifford gates and become higher-form symmetries when lifted to higher-dimensional CW complexes or manifolds.

This method provides a low-power route to a stabler frequency operation in germanium hole spin qubits and is readily transferable to other semiconductor spin qubit platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u7a7a\u7a74\u81ea\u65cb\u6bd4\u7279\u517c\u5bb9\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u7535\u6c14\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5411\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u8fd0\u7b97\u63a8\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u573a\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u9891\u7387\u4f4d\u79fb\uff0c\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u805a\u5408\u4f53$1/f$\u76f8\u4f4d\u8870\u9000\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53cc\u8272\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u9891\u7387\u4f4d\u79fb\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7535\u5076\u6781\u81ea\u65cb\u5171\u632f\uff08EDSR\uff09\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6216\u5fae\u6ce2\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53cc\u8272\u63a7\u5236\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bbd\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u95e8\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5fb7\u56fdium\u7a7a\u7a74\u81ea\u65cb\u6bd4\u7279\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u9891\u7387\u64cd\u4f5c\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u81ea\u65cb\u6bd4\u7279\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u81ea\u65cb\u6bd4\u7279\u5728\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\u3002 ClassNotFoundExceptionGermanium quantum dot hole spin qubits\u5728\u7535\u63a7\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u573a\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9891\u7387\u4f4d\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5176\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u53cc\u8272\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u9891\u7387\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u573a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u62b5\u6d88\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u9891\u7387\u4f4d\u79fb\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6216\u5fae\u6ce2\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u5927\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7535\u5076\u6781\u81ea\u65cb\u5171\u632f\u901f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53cc\u8272\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u81ea\u65cb\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u95e8\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\uff1a\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u95e8\u7684 fidelity\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7684\u9891\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5fb7\u56fdium\u7a7a\u7a74\u81ea\u65cb\u6bd4\u7279\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u81ea\u65cb\u6bd4\u7279\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u8272\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u5fb7\u56fdium\u7a7a\u7a74\u81ea\u65cb\u6bd4\u7279\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9891\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the practical deployment of CV-QKD systems remains vulnerable to various quantum attacks. In this paper, we propose a quantum machine learning (QML)-based attack detection framework (QML-ADF) that safeguards the security of high-rate CV-QKD systems. In particular, two alternative QML models -- quantum support vector machines (QSVM) and quantum neural networks (QNN) -- are developed to perform noise-resistant and feature-aware attack detection before conventional data postprocessing. Leveraging feature-rich quantum data from Gaussian modulation and homodyne detection, the QML-ADF effectively detects quantum attacks, including both known and unknown types defined by these distinctive features. The results indicate that all twelve distinct QML variants for both QSVM and QNN exhibit remarkable performance in detecting both known and previously undiscovered quantum attacks, with the best-performing QSVM variant outperforming the top QNN counterpart. Furthermore, we systematically evaluate the performance of the QML-ADF under various physically interpretable noise backends, demonstrating its strong robustness and superior detection performance. We anticipate that the QML-ADF will not only enable robust detection of quantum attacks under realistic deployment conditions but also strengthen the practical security of quantum communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Although multiple comb lines can occupy a single resonance during the Kerr comb formation process, their mutual interactions have remained largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate a Kerr comb formation that is confined to a single resonance of a microresonator via dual-pumping.

Although the pressure inside of a neutron star is typically assumed to be isotropic, pressure anisotropy can arise from various physical mechanisms, including elasticity, viscosity, and magnetic fields. Previous studies of nonradial stellar quasi-normal mode oscillations with anisotropic pressure have focused primarily on fluid modes. In this paper, we compute, for the first time, spacetime oscillation modes (so-called w-modes) of anisotropic neutron stars. Using a perturbative framework for stellar oscillations with pressure anisotropy, developed previously by some of the authors, together with a phenomenological anisotropy model, we find that both the real and imaginary parts of the w-mode frequencies decrease as the tangential pressure becomes dominant over the radial pressure. Although we do not find any unstable w-modes within the physically viable parameter space, unstable w-modes appear in an unphysical branch of solutions when the tangential pressure strongly dominates the radial one. We also find that the relation between the real part of the w-mode frequency and the stellar compactness is quasi-universal with respect to variations in the equation of state and the degree of pressure anisotropy. In contrast, the relation between the imaginary part of the w-mode frequency and the stellar compactness depends on the degree of anisotropy, but remains equation-of-state universal when the anisotropy is fixed. Finally, we discuss potential mode crossings and the validity of certain approximations that have been shown to work well for w-mode calculations in the isotropic case.", "AI": {"tldr": "In this paper, they calculate the effect of pressure anisotropy on w-modes in neutron stars. They find that as tangential pressure dominates, both the real and imaginary w-mode frequencies decrease. However, unstable w-modes appear only when tangential pressure is too dominant.

They discuss mode crossings and approximations.", "motivation": "Studying neutron star oscillations helps understand nuclear physics and spacetime properties under extreme conditions.", "method": "Used perturbative framework for stellar oscillations and anisotropy model to compute w-modes.", "result": "Anisotropy affects w-mode frequencies differently depending on whether tangential pressure is dominant.

The scale factor grows monotonically but by a finite amount, while curvature invariants decay exponentially, leading to an asymptotically Minkowski spacetime without future singularities. We confront the full nonlinear background evolution with cosmic chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and find good agreement with current late--time expansion data, with a reduced chi--squared $\u03c7^2/\u03bd\\simeq0.52$. At observable redshifts, oscillatory features are strongly suppressed and remain consistent with existing constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an information-theoretically secure COW-QKD protocol that can resist source side-channel attacks, with secure transmission distances up to 100 km. Our system achieves a secure key rate on the order of kilobits per second over 50 km in the finite-size regime, sufficient for real-time secure voice communication across metropolitan networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the encrypted transmission of a logo with information-theoretic security over 100 km of optical fiber.

Unlike traditional thermo-optic devices that require constant power to maintain a state, our device utilizes ferroelectric domain switching to provide non-volatile memory, allowing optical circuits to be programmed and retained without any holding power or electrical bias. The hexagonal waveguide mesh integrates 58 programmable unit cells and 116 actuators, achieving nanosecond-scale switching speeds of 80 nanoseconds while reducing static power consumption to negligible levels (560 nanowatts per \u03c0 phase shift). To validate this platform, we configured the mesh to perform diverse signal processing functions, including tunable filtering, 4x4 linear unitary transformations, and optical routing.

They have proven useful for constructing numerical gravitational waveforms and for characterizing gravitational memory. As the precision of current and future detectors continues to improve, such constraints become increasingly important for high-precision tests of gravity, including searches for deviations from general relativity. This motivates a systematic understanding of analogous balance laws in theories beyond general relativity. In this work, we investigate the existence and structure of flux laws at null infinity in diffeomorphism-invariant extensions of general relativity. Our analysis is based on the covariant phase space formalism and the definition of conserved quantities, as presented by Wald and Zoupas. For a particularly relevant class of Horndeski theories, we derive a general expression for the flux and formulate the corresponding balance equation via the associated non-conserved charges. We cross-check our general results by comparing them with previous studies of Brans-Dicke gravity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the employed methods extend straightforwardly to a broader class of diffeomorphism-invariant theories. The null part of the resulting flux laws associated with null memory is compared with and validated against the alternative derivation based on the Isaacson approach to gravitational radiation. Beyond the specific results obtained, this work is intended to serve as a practical guide for computing balance laws in generic diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity and paves the way for an in-depth comparison between the Isaacson approach and the covariant phase space formalism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u201c\u5e73\u8861\u5b9a\u5f8b\u201d\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u53ca\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0eBrans-Dicke\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u53ca\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u5e73\u8861\u5b9a\u5f8b\u201d\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f15\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u534f\u53d8\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u4f0d\u5c14\u5fb7\u53ca\u7956\u5e15\u65af\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7bHorndeski\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6d41\u91cf\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u4fdd\u5b88\u7535\u8377\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Isaacson\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u534f\u53d8\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

In quantum technologies, achieving non-local coherent coupling between solid-state qubits is of the utmost importance. Here, we demonstrate that excitons - i.e. electron-hole pairs bound by the Coulomb force within a quantum well - can act as a medium for mesoscopic optical coherence transfer in semiconductors. To this end, we use a femtosecond laser pulse to resonantly generate excitons within the light cone. These excitons can then either recombine radiatively or scatter out of the light cone, gaining an in-plane momentum in the process. In samples without disorder, such as the CdTe quantum wells used here, the resulting fast excitons can diffuse over mesoscopic distances before recombining radiatively. Using coherent nonlinear micro-spectroscopy, we carry out exciton time-of-flight measurements. Specifically, we monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of launched exciton wave packets, selectively observing their coherence or density on a scale of up to 10$\\,\u03bc$m. Our proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates that free excitons inherit a phase modulation from the optical pulsed excitation and can generate coherent links within excitonic circuits, offerring a higher level of miniaturisation and compactness than photonic or polaritonic architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ntldr: \u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u5728\u56fa\u4f53\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u9631\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72 coupling \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f7f\u7528 femtosecond \u6fc0\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u81ea\u7531\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ee7\u627f\u5149\u9a71\u52a8\u8109\u51b2\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u96c6\u6210\u5ea6\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\n\u52a8\u673a\uff1a\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u56fa\u4f53\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u76f8\u5e72\u8026\u5408\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\n\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528 femtosecond \u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u9631\u5185\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5e72\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5fae\u5206\u5149\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u6d4b\u91cf\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u6ce2\u5305\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u57df\u4f20\u64ad\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\n\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u5728\u65e0\u65e0\u7f3a\u9677\u7684 cdte \u91cf\u5b50\u9631\u6837\u54c1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5feb excited \u5458\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u6563\u5230\u5e73\u5747 10\u03bcm \u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7535\u8def\u5185\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5149\u5b50\u6216\u6781\u5316\u8ba4\u540c\u79ef\u5206\u7ea7\u522b\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\n\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8d85\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u8fd9\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u3002\u201d} \u7b80\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u8d85\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5ea6\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u3002\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\u3002"}}

Starting from the optical-mechanical correspondence, we derive a modified dispersion relation that encodes the influence of the Lorentz-violating parameter $\u03bb$ on the propagation of massive and massless modes. We analyze the resulting optical properties, including the effective refractive index, group velocity, and energy-dependent time delay, and show how the non-asymptotically flat geometry reshapes signal propagation. From the same dispersion relation, we construct the interparticle potential for massive and massless excitations and evaluate the electron scattering cross section within the Born approximation, identifying characteristic Lorentz-violating corrections. We then develop a statistical-ensemble description based on the deformed energy-momentum relation and obtain analytic expressions for the thermodynamic observables of a massless bosonic gas. The pressure, mean energy, entropy, and heat capacity are examined in three representative regimes--extremely close to the horizon, near the photon sphere, and in the asymptotic region -- where Lorentz violation systematically increase the magnitude of these quantities and leads to finite asymptotic plateaus. Finally, we analyze the vacuum state in the curved background and compute the regularized Casimir energy at zero and finite temperature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28", "method": "\u4ece\u5149\u5b66\u529b\u5b66\u5bf9\u5e94\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u8272\u6563\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5206\u6790\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u3001\u7fa4\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u4f9d\u65f6\u5ef6\u7b49\u5149\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u5e73\u6743\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ece\u8272\u6563\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u7c92\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7535\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u622a\u9762\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u3002\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u80fd\u91cf-\u52a8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7efc\uff0c\u6c42\u51fa\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\uff0c\u5982\u538b\u529b\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u71b5\u548c\u70ed\u5bb9\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u8003\u5bdf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u9644\u8fd1\u3001\u5149\u7403\u5468\u56f4\u548c\u6e10\u8fd1\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u5f62\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u66f2\u7ebf\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u96f6\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u6709\u9650\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684Casimir\u80fd\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u5f15\u529bCasimir\u6548\u5e94\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Here we demonstrate a self-optimizing multichannel optical computing architecture based on multi-plane light conversion that natively processes RGB images and structured numerical data throughout the optical domain. We introduce two complementary optimization strategies that enable autonomous performance adaptation without differentiable forward models. First, Bayesian optimization tunes channel mixing coefficients to minimize crosstalk and enhance feature separability at the input level. Second, a hardware-in-the-loop protocol based on self-organized criticality leverages avalanche dynamics to autonomously navigate the high-dimensional phase landscape, enabling the system to self-optimize through stochastic multi-scale perturbations. Across medical imaging, natural image classification, and regression tasks, multichannel processing with random phase masks improves accuracy by 26--58 percentage points over raw pixel baselines, with RGB systematically outperforming grayscale by 5--6 percentage points. Self-optimization strategies provide additional gains of 6--7 percentage points through autonomous adaptation at complementary system levels.

These solutions are typically obtained under the assumption that the vector-field potential vanishes everywhere once the vector field acquires a nonzero radial vacuum expectation value. However, imposing this assumption globally obstructs the construction of self-consistent compact-star solutions. In this work, we elucidate the origin of this inconsistency through a detailed analysis of the field equations and construct neutron-star configurations by abandoning the global vanishing-potential assumption. Crucially, we show that even without enforcing this condition everywhere, it is violated only in the strong-field interior region and is dynamically restored in the weak-field regime by asymptotic boundary conditions at spatial infinity. As a result, consistency with existing black-hole solutions and observational constraints is preserved.

We identify a quantum theory characterizing $\u039e$ such that, in the quantum-to-classical crossover of the composite system, $\u0393$ behaves as a test particle within the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild Black Hole (SBH) near its event horizon. We then show that this same quantum theory naturally provides a representation of $\u039e$ in terms of bosonic modes, whose features match those of the Hawking radiation; this facilitates the establishment of precise relations between the phenomenological parameters of the SBH and the microscopic details of the quantum model for $\u039e$. Finally, we recognize that the conditions used to characterize $\u0393$ and $\u039e$ coincide with those required by the Page and Wootters mechanism for identifying an evolving system and an associated clock. This leads us to discuss how the quantum model for $\u039e$ endows the SBH with all the characteristics of a \"perfect\" clock.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4f46\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf$\bm{\ryan{\u039e}}$\u548c$\bm{\ryan{\u0393}}$\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5230\u7ecf\u5178\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e schwarzschild \u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7c92\u5b50\u548c Hawking \u8f90\u5c04\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u6027\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea0\u7f20\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u5230\u7ecf\u5178\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ea0\u7f20\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u4f5c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7c92\u5b50\uff0c\u5339\u914d Hawking \u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u7528 Page \u548c Wootters \u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e schwarzschild \u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u63cf\u8ff0 Schwarzschild \u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684 Hawking \u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u7f8e\u65f6\u949f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3 Schwarzchild \u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684 Hawking \u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6d41\u901d\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u7f8e\u65f6\u949f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While universal upper bounds on the photon sphere radius have been established for both four-dimensional and higher-dimensional black holes, the question of a corresponding lower bound in higher-dimensional black holes remains less explored. In this work, we derive a universal lower bound for the photon sphere radius in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes of arbitrary dimension $n\\ge 4$. Under the assumptions of the weak energy condition, a non-positive trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and a monotonicity condition on the radial pressure function $|r^{n-1}p_r(r)|$, we prove that the photon sphere radius $r_\u03b3$ satisfies $r_\u03b3\\ge (\\frac{n-1}{2})^{1/(n-3)}r_H$, where $r_H$ is the radius of the outer event horizon. For $n=4$, this reduces to the known result $r_\u03b3\\ge \\frac{3}{2}r_H$.

Most of existing QSS protocols are limited by the linear rate-distance bound, and cannot realize the long-distance and high-capacity multipartite key distribution. This paper proposes a polarization (Pol) and phase (Ph) dual degrees of freedom (dual-DOF) QSS protocol based on the weak coherent pulse (WCP) sources. Our protocol combines the single-photon interference, two-photon interference and non-interference principles, and can resist the internal attack from the dishonest player. We develop simulation method to estimate its performance under the beam splitting attack. The simulation results show that our protocol can surpass the linear bound. Comparing with the differential-phase-shift twin-field QSS and WCP-Ph-QSS protocols, our protocol has stronger resistance against the beam splitting attack, and thus has longer maximal communication distance and higher key rate. By using the WCPs with high average photon number ($\u03bc$ = 1.5), our protocol achieves a key rate about 5.4 times of that in WCP-Ph-QSS protocol.

Classical wavefunction-based approaches, such as the Semistochastic Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI) and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), currently define the state of the art, systematically converging toward the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit, but at a rapidly increasing computational cost. Quantum computing algorithms promise to alleviate this scaling bottleneck by leveraging entanglement and superposition to represent correlated states more compactly. We introduced the Handover-Iterative Variational Quantum Eigensolver (HI-VQE) as a practical quantum computing algorithm with an iterative \"handover\" mechanism that dynamically exchanges information between quantum and classical computers, even using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. In this work, we extend the HI-VQE to benchmark two prototypical strongly correlated systems, the nitrogen molecule $N_2$ and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster, which serve as stringent tests for both classical and quantum electronic-structure methods. By comparing HI-VQE results against Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (HCI) benchmarks, we assess its accuracy, scalability, and ability to capture multireference correlation effects. Achieving quantitative agreement on these canonical systems demonstrates a viable pathway toward quantum-enhanced simulations of complex bioinorganic molecules, catalytic mechanisms, and correlated materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u751f\u7269\u65e0\u673a\u5206\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u4f53\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Handover-Iterative Variational Quantum Eigensolver\uff08HI-VQE\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eNoisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum\uff08NISQ\uff09\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4HI-VQE\u4e0e\u70ed\u52a8\u6001\u914d\u7f6e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff08HCI\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u591a\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u76f8\u5173\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u6c2e\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u94c1\u786b\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u590d\u6742\u751f\u7269\u65e0\u673a\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u50ac\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

To appear in PRD", "summary": "We investigate gravitational collapse driven solely by a self-interacting Brans--Dicke (BD) scalar field in the absence of ordinary matter. In this framework, the spacetime dynamics are governed solely by the scalar field $\u03a6$, endowed with a self-interaction potential $V(\u03a6)$ and non-minimally coupled to the Ricci scalar through the Brans--Dicke action. We numerically solve for the evolution of $\u03a6(t)$ and the corresponding potential $V(\u03a6)$ in order to track the collapse dynamics leading to singularity formation. Our analysis demonstrates that, for the energy densities $\u03c1\\approx 1/a$ and $\u03c1\\approx -\\ln a$, the collapse inevitably leads to the formation of a central curvature singularity while consistently satisfying the weak energy condition. We further examine the causal structure of the resulting singularity and find that future-directed null geodesics originating from the singularity can propagate to future null infinity, making the singularity globally visible. The strength of the singularity is also examined by extending Tipler's strong curvature condition to the Brans--Dicke field equations. Overall, our findings indicate that gravitational collapse in scalar--tensor gravity can give rise to scenarios that challenge the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, while underscoring the potential observational relevance of singularities formed through BD scalar-field-driven collapse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Brans--Dicke\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u574d\u7f29\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u666e\u901a\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u52bf$V(\u03a6)$\u548c\u4e0eRicci\u6807\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u4f5c\u7528 govern \u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728$\u03c1\thicksim 1/a$\u548c$\u03c1\thicksim -\text{ln}a$\u4e0b\uff0c\u574d\u7f29\u4e00\u5b9a\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2d\u5fc3\u66f2\u7387\u5947\u70b9\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5f31\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u5f97\u5230\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5947\u70b9\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765directed null geodesics\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u5947\u70b9\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u672a\u6765null\u65e0\u7a77\u8fdc\u5904\uff0c\u4f7f\u5947\u70b9\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u89c1\u3002\u5229\u7528Tipler\u7684\u5f3a\u66f2\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e86Brans--Dicke\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u6807\u91cf--\u5f20\u91cf\u91cd\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u574d\u7f29\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u6311\u6218\u5b87\u5b99\u6052\u661f\u5047\u8bf4\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7531BD\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u574d\u7f29\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u574d\u7f29\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u6052\u661f\u5047\u8bf4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efaBrans--Dicke\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u52bf\u548c\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u5230Ricci\u6807\u91cf\u7684\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u574d\u7f29\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u5728$\u03c1\thicksim 1/a$\u548c$\u03c1\thicksim -\text{ln}a$\u4e0b\uff0c\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u574d\u7f29\u4e00\u5b9a\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2d\u5fc3\u66f2\u7387\u5947\u70b9\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f31\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5947\u70b9\u662f\u53ef\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\uff0c\u672a\u6765directed null geodesics\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u5947\u70b9\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u672a\u6765null\u65e0\u7a77\u8fdc\u5904\uff0c\u5947\u70b9\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u89c1\u3002\u5229\u7528Tipler\u7684\u5f3a\u66f2\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u5c55\u5230Brans--Dicke\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u91cd\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u574d\u7f29\u53ef\u4ee5\u6311\u6218\u5b87\u5b99\u6052\u661f\u5047\u8bf4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8868\u660e\u7531\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u574d\u7f29\u5947\u70b9\u5177\u6709\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

We give a semi-analytical solution of the eigenvalue problem by reducing it to a transcendental equation, and demonstrate the aforementioned limiting behaviors. We then study the dynamics of the initial discrete state numerically, and show that it gives a wide range of behaviors in various limiting cases as predicted by our asymptotic theory including exponential decay, revivals, Rabi oscillations, and damped oscillations.

In this work, we systematically investigate the parameter-estimation biases induced by neglecting orbital eccentricity when analyzing eccentric compact-binary coalescences with quasi-circular waveform templates. Focusing on the deci-Hertz detector B-DECIGO and the milli-Hertz detector LISA, we model eccentric inspiral signals using a frequency-domain waveform that incorporates eccentricity-induced higher harmonics and the time-dependent response of spaceborne detectors. We quantify systematic biases in the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, and luminosity distance using both Bayesian inference and the Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) formalism, and assess their significance relative to statistical uncertainties. By constructing mock gravitational-wave catalogs spanning stellar-mass and massive black-hole binaries, we identify critical initial eccentricities at which systematic errors become comparable to statistical errors. We find that for B-DECIGO, even very small eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ at 0.1 Hz, can lead to significant biases, whereas for LISA such effects typically arise at larger eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ at $10^{-4}$ Hz, due to the smaller number of in-band cycles. Comparisons between FCV predictions and full Bayesian analyses demonstrate good agreement within the regime where waveform mismatches remain small, especially when extrinsic parameters are pre-aligned to minimize mismatches.

We experimentally investigate the entropy production of forward-backward cycles containing different decorrelating processes realized to erase different types of correlations between two interacting systems, from obliterating solely quantum coherence to completely decorrelating local states. We apply these processes to the entanglement of a two-level atom, realized with a circular Rydberg atom, and a light field of a high-quality microwave cavity. The entropy production is computed from the full quantum-state tomography of the system performed at different stages of the interaction-decorrelation sequence. Due to the quantum nature of the atom-cavity system, we find that, although standard, the maximum likelihood estimation method for the density matrix leads to spurious divergences of the entropy production. We propose and implement an alternative estimator that remedies such divergences.

However, temperature is not a quantum observable, and most theoretical studies have therefore concentrated on analyzing fundamental precision limits set by the quantum Fisher information through the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. In contrast, whether a direct temperature readout can be achieved in quantum thermometry remains largely unexplored, particularly under the nonequilibrium conditions prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we develop a direct temperature readout scheme based on a thermodynamic inference strategy. The scheme integrates two conceptual developments: (i) By applying the maximum entropy principle with the thermometer's mean energy as a constraint, we assign a reference temperature to the nonequilibrium thermometer. We demonstrate that this reference temperature outperforms a commonly used effective temperature defined through equilibrium analogy. (ii) We obtain positive semi-definite error functions that lower-bound the deviation of the reference temperature from the true temperature-in analogy to the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for the mean squared error-and vanish upon thermalization with the sample. Combining the reference temperature with these error functions, we introduce a notion of corrected dynamical temperature which furnishes a postprocessed temperature readout under nonequilibrium conditions. We validate the corrected dynamical temperature in a qubit-based thermometer under a range of nonequilibrium initial states, confirming its capability to estimate the true temperature. Importantly, we find that increasing quantum coherence can enhance the precision of this readout.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents a novel method for estimating temperature in nanoscale quantum systems under nonequilibrium conditions, which outperforms traditional methods by leveraging quantum coherence.", "motivation": "Temperature measurement in quantum systems is crucial for understanding quantum thermodynamics and nanotechnology, but most existing methods are limited to equilibrium conditions.

However, the vulnerability of the current generation of quantum computers to noise and computational error poses a significant barrier to this vision.

We first quantify the resource demands of fully error-corrected QML and propose a partial QEC approach that reduces overhead while enabling error correction.

Subsequently, Gordillo and Puebla pointed out that simulation results depend on whether the state space in the simulations is even or odd [2]. Using additional derivations, they argued that the oscillatory dynamics is unphysical and that the photon number must increase monotonically as a function of the squeezing parameter $r$. We agree with the observation of an even-odd parity dependence in the simulations. We independently noticed the same feature in our simulations after the publication of Ref. [1]. This observation led us to perform a more detailed investigation of the numerical simulation and mathematical aspects of the generalized squeezing problem. Our new findings were reported in Ref. [3]. Further analysis was reported in Ref. [4]. Our conclusion is that the generalized squeezing operator is physically not well defined but can be made well defined when combined with additional information about the physical system under study. We demonstrated this point in the case where we include an additional nonlinear interaction term in the Hamiltonian. We disagree with the claim that the photon number must be a monotonically increasing function of $r$. This claim contradicts the mathematically rigorous results of Ref. [4].

For this, entangled states of high quality and rate must be distributed. Currently, two main types of entanglement distribution protocols exist, namely emission-based and scattering-based, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. On the one hand, scattering-based protocols with cavities or waveguides are fast but demand stringent hardware such as high-efficiency integrated circulators or strong waveguide coupling. On the other hand, emission-based platforms are experimentally feasible but so far rely on Bell-pair fusion with extensive use of slow two-qubit memory gates, limiting thresholds to $\\approx 0.16\\%$. Here, we consider a fully distributed surface code using emission-based entanglement schemes that generate GHZ states in a single shot, i.e., without the need for Bell-pair fusions. We show that our optical setup produces Bell pairs, W states, and GHZ states, enabling both memory-based and optical protocols for distilling high-fidelity GHZ states with significantly improved success rates. Furthermore, we introduce protocols that completely eliminate the need for memory-based two-qubit gates, achieving thresholds of $\\approx 0.19\\%$ with modest hardware enhancements, increasing to above $\\approx 0.24\\%$ with photon-number-resolving detectors.

Genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) serves as a key indicator of network performance and overall state quality. However, the widely used methods for certifying GME suffer from a major drawback that they either detect only a limited range of states or are applicable only to systems with a small number of parties. To overcome these limitations, we propose a family of sub-symmetric witnesses (SSWs), which are tractable both theoretically and experimentally. Analytically, we establish a connection between SSWs and the cut space of graph theory, enabling several powerful detection criteria tailored to practical quantum networks. Numerically, we show that the optimal detection can be formulated as a linear program, offering a significant efficiency advantage over the semidefinite programs commonly employed in quantum certification.

In particular, it relies on the ``quantum equilibrium hypothesis'' and accepts explicit nonlocality as fundamental. A deeper completion is available in stochastic mechanics, where the wavefunction and the Born rule emerge from an underlying diffusion process, and in a contextual, category-theoretic semantics in which measurement and EPR--Bell correlations are reinterpreted as features of contextual truth rather than of mysterious dynamics.

In particular, these results constitute an almost quadratic advantage over the best-possible classical algorithm. Our algorithm also improves on the quantum state of the art, and we contend that this is not just theoretically interesting but also potentially practically impactful in real-world applications: knowing a Markov chain's spectral gap can speed-up sampling in Markov chain Monte Carlo.\n  Our approach uses the quantum singular value transformation, and as a result we also develop some theory around block-encoding Markov chain transition matrices, which is potentially of independent interest.

It is shown that in Lifshitz's work itself, this formula is given without a consistent conclusion. Moreover, the approach to the conclusion proposed in this work does not allow us to obtain it. The most general conclusion of this formula can be the method proposed by Levin and Rytov, the variation method of Schwinger and the method proposed by Van Kampen and co-authors. The Levin and Rytov approach is applicable in principle to bodies of arbitrary shape if the diffraction loss fields for electric and magnetic dipoles are determined, while the Van Kampen approach is applicable to any plane-layered structure and is quite simple. It is enough to write down the dispersion equations of the plasmon-polaritone structure. The specific dispersion force for a number of structures is calculated based on the Van Kampen method. It is shown that at small gaps, the force (pressure) density changes the inverse fourth-degree dependence on the distance and practically ceases to depend on it at distances less than 1 nm. For thin identical plates, this density is proportional to the square of their thickness at such distances, but the dependence quickly becomes saturated and already at thicknesses of the order of 10 nm practically ceases to depend on it.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u8bba\u6587\u6458\u8981\u540e\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u89c2\u70b9\uff1aLifshitz\u516c\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0cLevin\u548cRytov\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u5f62\u72b6\u7269\u4f53\uff0cVan Kampen\u548c\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e73\u9762\u5c42\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Van Kampen\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8272\u6563\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u95f4\u8ddd\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u538b\u529b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u56db\u6b21\u65b9\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5c0f\u4e8e1\u7eb3\u7c73\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u65f6\u538b\u529b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u57fa\u672c\u4e0e\u8ddd\u79bb\u65e0\u5173\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8584\u7247\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u538b\u529b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u539a\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u539a\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u538b\u529b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u539a\u5ea6\u7ea610\u7eb3\u7c73\u65f6\u538b\u529b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0e\u539a\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Lifshitz\u516c\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u754c\u9762\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u8272\u6563\u529b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6750\u6599\u548c\u7eb3\u7c73\u88c5\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Levin-Rytov\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cVan Kampen\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5404\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8272\u6563\u538b\u529b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u95f4\u8ddd\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u538b\u529b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u56db\u6b21\u65b9\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5c0f\u4e8e1\u7eb3\u7c73\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u65f6\uff0c\u538b\u529b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u57fa\u672c\u4e0e\u8ddd\u79bb\u65e0\u5173\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8584\u7247\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u538b\u529b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u539a\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u539a\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u538b\u529b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u539a\u5ea6\u7ea610\u7eb3\u7c73\u65f6\u538b\u529b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0e\u539a\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "Lifshitz\u516c\u5f0f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fVan Kampen\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u754c\u9762\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u8272\u6563\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8272\u6563\u538b\u529b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Here, we present a framework for studying non-locality that is agnostic to the dimension of the physical systems involved, allowing us to probe purely continuous-variable, discrete-variable, or hybrid non-locality. Our approach allows us to find the optimal Bell inequality for any given measurement scenario and quantifies the amount of non-locality that is present in measurement statistics. This formalism unifies the existing literature on continuous-variable non-locality and allows us to identify new states in which Bell non-locality can be probed through homodyne detection. Notably, we find the first example of continuous-variable non-locality that cannot be mapped to a CHSH Bell inequality.

Specifically, we show that, after an initial decrease, the current grows with the disorder strength until it reaches a local maximum.

It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of many-body quantum states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer R\u00e9nyi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods reduce the runtime to $O(N d^{2N})$, an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, while exposing substantial parallelism and enabling GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG.jl, which provides a high-performance, GPU-enabled toolbox for computing SRE and mana. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u9b54\u672f\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u7b80\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u9b54\u672f\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5feb\u54c8\u8fbe\u9a6c\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u9b54\u672f\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4eceO(d\u00b3N)\u964d\u4f4e\u5230O(Nd\u00b2N)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4e2a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u9b54\u672f\u6570\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Mechanical systems, such as bulk acoustic wave resonators, feature a large number of highly coherent harmonic modes in a compact footprint, which complements the strong nonlinearities and fast operation times of superconducting quantum circuits. Here, we demonstrate an architecture for mechanical resonator-based quantum computing, in which a superconducting qubit is used to perform quantum gates on a collection of mechanical modes. We show the implementation of a universal gate set, composed of single-qubit gates and controlled arbitrary-phase gates, and showcase their use in the quantum Fourier transform and quantum period finding algorithms. These results pave the way toward using mechanical systems to build crucial components for future quantum technologies, such as quantum random-access memories.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hybrid quantum systems combining mechanical resonators with superconducting quantum circuits show promise for powerful quantum computing, implementing gates and algorithms for future technologies.", "motivation": "The paper explores the combination of mechanical and superconducting quantum systems to leverage their complementary strengths for advanced quantum computing.", "method": "An architecture is designed where a superconducting qubit controls mechanical modes to perform quantum gates.
