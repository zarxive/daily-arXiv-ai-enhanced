The primary aim of this work is to integrate the S-S PCM into\nhollow bricks used in building envelopes and to evaluate their thermal inertia\nthrough both experimental testing and numerical simulation. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that the integration of the PCM effectively delays and\ndecreases the indoor temperature peak. The simulation results also show that\nthe incorporation of the S-S PCM into hollow bricks gives rise to a phase shift\nof 7 hours and a decrement factor of 0.38. In comparison with the thermal\nbehavior of the building envelopes (hollow brick) without PCMs, our results\nprovide convincing evidence of the important thermal inertia of these\nstructures incorporating the PCMs, revealing their significant potential in\nreducing energy consumption of building.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 S-S \u78c1PCM\u52a0\u586b\u5fc3 Empty bricks \u53ef\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5ba4\u5185\u6e29\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5cf0\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5f97\u51fa\u76f8\u79fb 7 \u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u51cf\u901f\u56e0\u5b50 0.38\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf Empty bricks\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4fdd\u6e29\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u5efa\u7b51\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u9ad8\u6548\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u67d0\u79cd\u6750\u6599\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u7b51 envelope\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 S-S \u78c1PCM\u52a0\u586b\u5fc3 Empty bricks \u4f5c\u4e3a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u70ed\u60ef\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u52a0\u5165 S-S \u78c1PCM\u7684 Empty bricks \u80fd\u591f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u5ba4\u5185\u6e29\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5cf0\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u76f8\u79fb 7 \u5c0f\u65f6\u3001\u51cf\u901f\u56e0\u5b50\u4e3a 0.38 \u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6750\u6599\u5728\u4fdd\u6e29\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u51fa\u52a0\u5165 S-S \u78c1PCM \u7684 Empty bricks \u62e5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u70ed\u60ef\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5ba4\u5185\u6e29\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5cf0\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u5efa\u7b51\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, the effect is usually based on dipole resonances\nin the particles. Recently, it has been shown that quadrupole and octupole\nresonances can exhibit comparable, or even higher near-field enhancement. In\nthis work, we focus on the near-field enhancement by a metasurface composed of\ngold-disc dimers arranged in a rectangular array. We find that, owing to an\noctupole plasmon resonance coupled to a surface lattice resonance,\nexceptionally high near-field enhancement in the dimer gaps can be achieved in\nthe visible spectral range. To gain insight into the effect, we develop an\nanalytical model for the effective dipole and octupole polarizabilities of the\nparticles in an array, and discover, that at decreasing array periods, the\ndipole polarizability tends to vanish, while the octupole polarizability\nrapidly increases. Hence, octupole resonances can find applications in\nhigh-density arrays of plasmonic resonators.

By systematically analyzing, we demonstrate that the\nentire $K$-symmetry hierarchy collapses into a finite-dimensional module over\nthe field of wave parameters, spanned by elementary center-translation\ngenerators. Higher order $K$-symmetries are explicitly reconstructed as linear\ncombinations of these basis vectors. In contrast, $\\tau$-symmetries resist such\ndecomposition on pure soliton backgrounds, however, they become\nfinite-dimensional once the underlying solution space is extended to the full\nmulti-wave manifold, which carries more independent wave parameters. We\nconstruct an explicit basis consisting of four fundamental symmetry vector\nfields, two lowest $K$-symmetries and two primary $\\tau$-symmetries, in terms\nof which all higher $\\tau$-symmetries are uniquely expressible as linear\ncombinations of these symmetry vector fields. These findings not only clarify\nthe algebraic structure of infinite symmetries on special solution, but also\nprovide an algorithmic framework for deriving exact multi-wave solutions of\nintegrable systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

A localized induction-cell perturbation produced\na negative density pulse that evolved into a leading soliton-like peak followed\nby an expanding train of oscillations. The leading peak satisfied soliton\nscaling laws for width^2 vs inverse amplitude and velocity vs amplitude, while\nthe total wave-train width increased linearly with time, consistent with\nKorteweg--de Vries (KdV) predictions. Successive peaks showed decreasing\namplitude and velocity toward the trailing edge, in agreement with dispersive\nshock ordering.

To achieve quick and accurate estimation, we\ndevelop 3D adaptive grid systems and an active learning strategy to effectively\ncapture the nonlinear interactions between complex system geometries and\nmagnetic fields. By training a regression model, our approach achieves magnetic\nfield computation with sub-second latency and with an average error of less\nthan 6% when validated against independent electromagnetic simulation results.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

It is demonstrated that averaging has a significant\neffect on both Nusselt number and ampacity, and the effect exhibits a strong\nangular dependency on the relative angle of the wind to the line. Therefore,\ntwo limit cases are studied: in the case of parallel wind, averaged data\nunderestimates the ampacity, and there is a significant amount of cases where\nthe underestimation is larger than 10 %.

We demonstrate that the proton reduction rate in defect-free graphene\ncan be enhanced by an order of magnitude by the introduction of nanoscale\ncorrugations in its lattice, and that the substitution of protons for deuterons\nresults both in lower potentials for the hydrogenation process and in a more\nstable compound.

The GZ models consist of abelian gauge fields coupled to a neutral\nsector, typically including a set of scalars, whose equations of motion are\nclassically invariant under a continuous group $\\mathscr{G}$ acting on the\nelectric and magnetic field strengths via symplectic transformations. The\nstandard lore holds that, at the quantum level, these symmetries are broken to\nan integral subgroup $\\mathscr{G}_\\mathbb{Z}$. We show that, in fact, a much\nlarger subgroup $\\mathscr{G}_\\mathbb{Q}$ survives, albeit through\nnon-invertible topological defects. We explicitly construct these defects and\ncompute some of their fusion rules. As illustrative examples, we consider the\naxion-dilaton-Maxwell model and the bosonic sector of a class of\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravities of the kind that appear in type II Calabi-Yau\ncompactifications.

However, generating such benchmarks is often hindered by\nthe massive computational resources required for exact diagonalization or\nquantum Monte Carlo simulations, particularly at finite temperatures. In this\nwork, we propose a new algorithm for obtaining thermal pure quantum states,\nwhich allows efficient computation of both mechanical and thermodynamic\nproperties at finite temperatures. We implement this algorithm in our\nopen-source C++ template library, Physica. Combining the improved algorithm\nwith state-of-the-art software engineering, our implementation achieves high\nperformance and numerical stability.

Our approach combines\nreal-space sampling of tensor-network-bridged quantum circuits with symmetric\nsubspace measurements, effectively constraining the wavefunction within a\nsubstaintially reduced Hilbert space for efficient and scalable simulations of\nversatile target states. The system is partitioned into equal-sized subsystems,\nwhere quantum circuits capture local entanglement and tensor networks reconnect\nthem to recover global correlations, thereby overcoming partition-induced\nlimitations. Symmetric subspace measurements exploit point-group symmetries\nthrough a many-to-one mapping that aggregates equivalent real-space\nconfigurations into a single symmetric state, effectively enhancing real-space\nbipartition entanglement while elimilating redundant degrees of freedom. The\ntensor network further extends this connectivity across circuits, restoring\nglobal entanglement and correlation, while simultaneously enabling generative\nsampling for efficient optimization. As a proof of concept, we apply the method\nto the periodic $J_1\\!-\\!J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in one and two\ndimensions, incorporating translation, reflection, and inversion symmetries.\nWith a small matrix product state bond dimension of up to 6, the method\nachieves an absolute energy error of $10^{-5}$ for a 64-site periodic chain and\na $6\\times6$ torus after bond-dimension extrapolation. These results validate\nthe accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid eigensolver and demonstrate its\nstrong potential for scalable quantum simulations of strongly correlated\nsystems.", "AI": {"tldr":

Independently, studies of correlation functions reveal an infrared\nbehavior characterized by massive-like scales. Yet, an open issue is how such\ncorrelators can arise in a confining regime characterized by a linearly rising\npotential rather than a Yukawa one.

A particular emphasis is placed on the Rarita-Schwinger\nspin-$\\tfrac{3}{2}$ case. Both massive fields and gauge fields are considered,\nand their relation to the representation theory of $SO(4,1)$ is discussed. In\nLorentzian signature, we study properties of the Bunch-Davies mode functions,\nand the late time structure of their two-point functions. For the\nRarita-Schwinger gauge field, we consider a quantisation procedure based on the\nMinkowskian limit of the field operator. In Euclidean signature, the fields are\nplaced on a four-sphere and the Euclidean path integral is computed at\none-loop. The resulting Euclidean partition function is expressed in terms of\nunitary Lorentzian group characters with edge corrections.

For good qLDPC codes, the time overhead is minimized and\nreaches $O(d^{1+o(1)})$. In contrast, code surgery based on gauging measurement\nand brute-force branching requires a time overhead of $O(dw^{1+o(1)})$, where\n$d\\leq w\\leq n$. Thus, our scheme is asymptotically faster for all codes with\n$a < 2$.
