### [1] [Theoretical Analysis of Resource-Induced Phase Transitions in Estimation Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10184)
*Takehiro Tottori,Tetsuya J. Kobayashi*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: 该论文研究了由于资源限制导致生物系统中估计策略发生相变的现象，并揭示了这种相变的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作为生物系统中的重要研究方向，探索资源限制如何影响信息处理机制，具有重要意义。

Method: 通过数学建模和理论分析方法，研究了估计策略在资源限制下的行为变化。

Result: 发现当资源有限制时，估计策略会发生相变，呈现非线性、非单调性和无标度行为。

Conclusion: 资源限制是生物系统中估计策略变化的关键因素，为理解信息处理机制提供了新的理论依据。

Abstract: Organisms adapt to volatile environments by integrating sensory information with internal memory, yet their information processing is constrained by resource limitations. Such limitations can fundamentally alter optimal estimation strategies in biological systems. For example, recent experiments suggest that organisms exhibit nonmonotonic phase transitions between memoryless and memory-based estimation strategies depending on sensory reliability. However, an analytical understanding of these resource-induced phase transitions is still missing. This Letter presents an analytical characterization of resource-induced phase transitions in optimal estimation strategies. Our result identifies the conditions under which resource limitations alter estimation strategies and analytically reveals the mechanism underlying the emergence of discontinuous, nonmonotonic, and scaling behaviors. These results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how limited resources shape information processing in biological systems.

Abstract: Protein structure determination has long been one of the primary challenges of structural biology, to which deep machine learning (ML)-based approaches have increasingly been applied. However, these ML models generally do not incorporate the experimental measurements directly, such as X-ray crystallographic diffraction data. To this end, we explore an approach that more tightly couples these traditional crystallographic and recent ML-based methods, by training a hybrid 3-d vision transformer and convolutional network on inputs from both domains. We make use of two distinct input constructs / Patterson maps, which are directly obtainable from crystallographic data, and ``partial structure'' template maps derived from predicted structures deposited in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database with subsequently omitted residues. With these, we predict electron density maps that are then post-processed into atomic models through standard crystallographic refinement processes. Introducing an initial dataset of small protein fragments taken from Protein Data Bank entries and placing them in hypothetical crystal settings, we demonstrate that our method is effective at both improving the phases of the crystallographic structure factors and completing the regions missing from partial structure templates, as well as improving the agreement of the electron density maps with the ground truth atomic structures.

### [3] [Interspecific information use facilitates species coexistence in ecosystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10520)
*Wei Tao,Ju Kang,Wenxiu Yang,Yiyuan Niu,Xin Wang*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper explains how competing species can coexist by relaxing the competitive exclusion principle through the use of interspecific social information by predators, allowing more species to exist than the number of resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the discrepancy between the competitive exclusion principle (CEP) and the observed diversity in natural ecosystems, particularly the plankton paradox.

Method: The authors developed a model incorporating predation dynamics and interspecific information use to replicate two classical experiments conflicting with the CEP.

Result: The model demonstrates that predators using social information can coexist with more species than the number of resources available, matching natural coexistence patterns.

Conclusion: This mechanism provides a general explanation for biodiversity maintenance in ecological communities by relaxing CEP constraints through predator social behavior.

Abstract: Explaining how competing species coexist remains a central question in ecology. The well-known competitive exclusion principle (CEP) states that two species competing for the same resource cannot stably coexist, and more generally, that the number of consumer species is bounded by the number of resource species at steady state. However, the remarkable species diversity observed in natural ecosystems, exemplified by the paradox of the plankton, challenges this principle. Here, we show that interspecific social information use among predators provides a mechanism that fundamentally relaxes the constraints of competitive exclusion. A model of predation dynamics that incorporates interspecific information use naturally explains coexistence beyond the limits imposed by CEP. Our model quantitatively reproduces two classical experiments that contradicts the CEP and captures coexistence patterns documented in natural ecosystems, offering a general mechanism for the maintenance of biodiversity in ecological communities.

TL;DR: HAMscope是一款用于实时、无标签分子成像的紧凑便携式双光谱自fluorescence miniscope，能够对多种生物系统进行成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在开发一种高效、便携的双光谱成像设备，以适用于生物学广泛的领域，包括植物学、神经科学等。

Method: HAMscope通过集成微纤维增强的聚丙烯光幕到广域微影像设备，并采用概率性深度学习框架，实现了对单帧的光谱编码和30信道的超光谱图的重建，或直接推断分子组成图。采用多通路的U-Net架构，结合自注意力机制和逐像素不确定度估计，确保了高空间-光谱分辨率（均方误差约为0.0048）以视频率操作。

Result: 通过实验证明，HAMscope在各种生物组织中均能工作，包括未处理的木材，且能推广到神经活动映射、代谢分析和 histopathology。系统支持无需光谱分解的直接分子成像。

Conclusion: HAMscope提供了一种基于紧凑光学和先进的深度学习的通用框架，适用于实时生物化学成像，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We introduce HAMscope, a compact, snapshot hyperspectral autofluorescence miniscope that enables real-time, label-free molecular imaging in a wide range of biological systems. By integrating a thin polymer diffuser into a widefield miniscope, HAMscope spectrally encodes each frame and employs a probabilistic deep learning framework to reconstruct 30-channel hyperspectral stacks (452 to 703 nm) or directly infer molecular composition maps from single images. A scalable multi-pass U-Net architecture with transformer-based attention and per-pixel uncertainty estimation enables high spatio-spectral fidelity (mean absolute error ~ 0.0048) at video rates. While initially demonstrated in plant systems, including lignin, chlorophyll, and suberin imaging in intact poplar and cork tissues, the platform is readily adaptable to other applications such as neural activity mapping, metabolic profiling, and histopathology. We show that the system generalizes to out-of-distribution tissue types and supports direct molecular mapping without the need for spectral unmixing. HAMscope establishes a general framework for compact, uncertainty-aware spectral imaging that combines minimal optics with advanced deep learning, offering broad utility for real-time biochemical imaging across neuroscience, environmental monitoring, and biomedicine.

*Weijia Zhao,Linlin Li,Kaiqi Kuang,Lin Yang,Claudio Bruschini,Jiaming Cao,Edoardo Charbon,Wuwei Ren*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 此研究评估了三种开源模拟器在非接触式散射介质中光传播建模中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STM开发团队需要准确的前向模型来模拟光在复杂介质中的传播，现有模拟器缺乏实验验证，尤其是非接触式、斜入射场景。

Method: 研究方法包括：统一网格、点源照明、应用虚拟光源修正（VSC）到FEM求解器，使用时域 resolved DOI系统和32×32 SPAD阵列对16种标准化 Phantom进行光传输数据采集，参数包括吸收系数 μ_a 和散射系数 μ_s'。评估指标包括空间域、时间域精度、斜入射光束精度、计算速度和网格独立性。

Result: MMC 在空间域和时间域精度上表现优异，具有良好的鲁棒性；NIRFASTer 和 Toast++ 总体性能相当。MMC 适用于需要高时间精度的 TD-DOI 应用，而 NIRFASTer 和 Toast++ 适用于需要高速度且散射系数较大场景。使用 VSC 后，非接触式建模误差减少超过 34%。此研究首次系统性地在非接触、使用 SPAD 阵列下的临床相关散射介质中验证 TD-模拟器，填补了生物医学光模拟标准中的空白。

Conclusion: 本研究为 TD-DOI 系统的开发提供了模拟器选择的指南。研究首次系统性验证了 TD 模拟器在非接触、基于 SPAD 数组的临床相关散射介质中的表现，填补了模拟器验证标准中的空白。

Abstract: Objective: Time-domain diffuse optical imaging (DOI) requires accurate forward models for photon propagation in scattering media. However, existing simulators lack comprehensive experimental validation, especially for non-contact configurations with oblique illumination. This study rigorously evaluates three widely used open-source simulators, including MMC, NIRFASTer, and Toast++, using time-resolved experimental data. Approach: All simulations employed a unified mesh and point-source illumination. Virtual source correction was applied to FEM solvers for oblique incidence. A time-resolved DOI system with a 32 $\times$ 32 single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array acquired transmission-mode data from 16 standardized phantoms with varying absorption coefficient $μ_a$ and reduced scattering coefficient $μ_s'$. The simulation results were quantified across five metrics: spatial-domain (SD) precision, time-domain (TD) precision, oblique beam accuracy, computational speed, and mesh-density independence. Results: Among three simulators, MMC achieves superior accuracy in SD and TD metrics, and shows robustness across all optical properties. NIRFASTer and Toast++ demonstrate comparable overall performance. In general, MMC is optimal for accuracy-critical TD-DOI applications, while NIRFASTer and Toast++ suit scenarios prioritizing speed with sufficiently large $μ_s'$. Besides, virtual source correction is essential for non-contact FEM modeling, which reduced average errors by > 34% in large-angle scenarios. Significance: This work provides benchmarked guidelines for simulator selection during the development phase of next-generation TD-DOI systems. Our work represents the first study to systematically validate TD simulators against SPAD array-based data under clinically relevant non-contact conditions, bridging a critical gap in biomedical optical simulation standards.

Abstract: Advanced geometrical nanometrology is critical for process control in semiconductor manufacturing, supporting applications in, e.g., photonic integrated circuits, nanoelectronics, and emerging quantum and optoelectronic technologies. Widefield interferometric approach provide a cost-effective, non-destructive solution for characterizing semiconductor optical waveguides, which are fundamental to nanophotonic devices. This work presents a Bayesian inference framework, implemented using Dynamic Nested Sampling, for estimating geometric parameters - such as width and height - of a semiconductor optical waveguide from a single widefield interferogram. The proposed framework reduces the need of leveraging near field scanning microscopy methods for measurements. The notable advantage is that Bayesian statistics not only provide the estimated parameter values but also quantify the uncertainty of the inference results and the fitness of the used model. The proposed full-field, single-shot interferometric approach, supported by Bayesian-based data analysis, achieves high accuracy and sensitivity - down to successful measurement of 8 nm rib waveguide - while remaining resilient to noise. Thus, the demonstrated methodology provides a cost-effective, robust, and scalable tool for semiconductor fabrication monitoring and process verification, as confirmed by both numerical simulations and experimental validation on optical waveguides. This method contributes to high-precision nanometrology by integrating advanced statistical modeling and inference techniques.

Conclusion: Excitonic 光子散射在二维纳米光子设备中起关键作用，且低温环境中性能提升，为光子工程开辟新方向。

Abstract: Monolayer 2D semiconductors, such as WS2, exhibit uniquely strong light-matter interactions due to exciton resonances that enable atomically-thin optical elements. Similar to geometry-dependent plasmon and Mie resonances, these intrinsic material resonances offer coherent and tunable light scattering. Thus far, the impact of the excitons temporal dynamics on the performance of such excitonic metasurfaces remains unexplored. Here, we show how the excitonic decay rates dictate the focusing efficiency of an atomically-thin lens carved directly out of exfoliated monolayer WS2. By isolating the coherent exciton radiation from the incoherent background in the focus of the lens, we obtain a direct measure of the role of exciton radiation in wavefront shaping. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of exciton-phonon scattering by characterizing the focusing efficiency as a function of temperature, demonstrating an increased optical efficiency at cryogenic temperatures. Our results provide valuable insights in the role of excitonic light scattering in 2D nanophotonic devices.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this article, we present novel and effective methods for reducing chromatic aberrations in
  cemented lens systems. We derive an analytical solution coined the pentachromat, which
  corrects five distinct colors. This method can naturally be extended to accommodate
  an arbitrary number of lenses and to correct for a customized selection of spectral lines.
  Since correcting for specific rays rather than the entire residual spectrum
  can overconstrain the system, we introduce a variational formulation. This approach
  tames the residual spectrum by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional
  designs like the superachromat, while giving theoretical guarantees to reach the
  optimal solutions.
  Furthermore, this innovative methodology opens up previously uncharted design
  possibilities, such as multiple-focal-length achromatic systems. This allows for the
  selection of specific optical powers paired with desired bandwidths, enabling the
  design of highly specialized and tailored optical systems.
  Finally, we couple our variational framework with a combinatorial search, allowing to
  find the type of glasses and their geometry such that it reaches the best residual spectrum
  over an available catalogue.

Abstract: Quantum phase imaging enables the analysis of transparent samples with thickness and refractive index variations in scenarios requiring precise measurements under low-light conditions. Recent advances in nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact solutions for quantum light generation and manipulation. Here, we present a compact quantum phase imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. The LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with angularly dispersed, tunable emission, while the Si metasurface employs a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) to differentiate phase and extract phase gradients via spatial quantum correlations. This dual-metasurface enabled combined ghost imaging and all-optical scanning protocols with quantum light achieves phase gradient reconstruction without mechanical tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup. In addition, theoretically, it is confirmed that the resolution of the system is primarily limited by the quality factor of the compact design, leveraging nonlocal resonances and quantum correlations, establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR. This work highlights the application of metasurface in both generating and detecting quantum states.

TL;DR: Ultraprecision machining enables the design of crystalline microresonators with tailored dispersion characteristics, enabling the creation of advanced optical frequency combs, though fabrication challenges limit their widespread use. The key motivation is the potential for precise control and engineering of waveguide geometries, which can significantly improve the performance of microresonator frequency combs. The method involves using precision machining techniques to shape the resonators, which results in high precision and suppressed spatial mode interactions, facilitating the generation of smooth Kerr soliton combs and broadband frequency combs beyond the telecommunication C-band.

Abstract: Ultraprecision machining offers a powerful route to dispersion control in crystalline microresonators, allowing the design of waveguide geometries for tailoring the spectrum of microresonator frequency combs. By precisely designing the geometry, both group-velocity and higher-order dispersions can be engineered across a broad wavelength range. However, despite their promising features, such advantages have remained largely unexplored due to fabrication challenges.

Abstract: Spectrally selective absorbers that maximize solar absorption and minimize thermal radiation loss are crucial for efficient solar thermal energy harvesting. However, limitations imposed by the intrinsic properties of conventional materials hinder the fabrication of interference-based absorbers with desired optical properties. Herein, a high-performance solar absorber with a Dallenbach-type dielectric-metal tandem structure was fabricated using an ultrathin, subquarter-wavelength thickness single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) membrane with tailored optical spectra as the absorbing layer. By mixing multiple SWCNT chiral structures, the optical response of the absorbing layer was tailored to approximate a theoretical complex refractive index spectrum of dielectrics; therefore enabling high solar absorptance, low infrared emittance, and a low angular dependence with a simple bilayer structure. The fabricated proof-of-concept 1 cm$^2$ absorber exhibited excellent spectral selectivity (solar absorptance/infrared emittance of 0.84/0.03), and an equilibrium temperature of $\approx 190^\circ$C ($270^\circ$C) under nonconcentrated ($2\times$ concentrated) sunlight, considerably outperformed a blackbody-like absorber. This study presents a high-performance solar absorber with a simple planar structure and proposes a concept of designing dielectric with the desired optical properties by mixing various types of structure-sorted SWCNTs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Enhanced beam shifts mediated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at metal-dielectric interfaces have been widely investigated. However, research on the associated Imbert-Fedorov or spin Hall shifts, driven by the spin-orbit interaction of structured light in structured interfaces, has been comparatively scarce and limited. We explore the reflection characteristics of generic polarized, non-paraxial light beams from a corrugated silver (Ag) interface, since surface corrugation can naturally couple the incident radiation modes to the surface excitations. In the vicinity of SPR, we report a significant enhancement in the beam shifts, attributed to the rapid variation of the specular reflection coefficient near its minima, resulting in amplified weak values. By carefully selecting the incident and projected polarization states of the beam, we achieve a pronounced spatial spin Hall effect. We also investigate vortex-induced beam shifts within this resonant regime, revealing distinctive signatures of the angular momentum of the beam. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis is also presented for the conical diffraction geometry, wherein polarization conversions between p and s states are fully incorporated. Our work establishes the interplay of the spin-orbit interaction of light and the weak measurement approach as an important methodology in amplifying SPR effects, which may have important connotations in applications involving light at nanoscales.

Abstract: Fast, volumetric imaging that integrates multiple imaging modalities is essential for probing dynamic, heterogeneous soft and biological matter. Here, we present the M3Scope, a simple yet versatile multiplane microscope that extends widefield detection with a modular multimode cube to enable dual color fluorescence, polarization-resolved, and correlative brightfield fluorescence imaging while (i) preserving simultaneous 3D acquisition at high frame rates (100 fps) and (ii) requiring minimal realignment. We demonstrate its potential by investigating polymer dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales. In an acrylamide type polymerizing network, dual color tracking of 100 nm and 300 nm fluorescent probes revealed size dependent viscosities diverging from 15 mPa.s to 40 mPa.s after gelation. Polarization resolved rotational tracking of gold bipyramids yielded viscosities within 10 percent of theoretical values in 80 to 95 percent glycerol and remained accurate in the high-viscosity regime (bigger than 400 mPa.s) where translational motion is undetectable. Fluorescence brightfield imaging correlated structural changes during poly(isopropyl acrylamide) (pNIPAM) phase separation as well as variations in tracer diffusivity, linking morphology and dynamics in 3D. Taken together, these results show that the M3Scope delivers high speed volumetric imaging with flexible modality switching, providing a powerful platform for studying dynamic, heterogeneous systems across disciplines, from polymer physics to cell mechanobiology.

Abstract: Curved and conformal optics offer significant advantages by unlocking additional geometric degrees of freedom for optical design. These capabilities enable enhanced optical performance and are essential for meeting non-optical constraints, such as those imposed by ergonomics, aerodynamics, or wearability. However, existing fabrication techniques such as direct electron or laser beam writing on curved substrates, and soft-stamp-based transfer or nanoimprint lithography suffer from limitations in scalability, yield, geometry control, and alignment accuracy. Here, we present a scalable fabrication strategy for curved and conformal metasurface optics leveraging thermoforming, an industry-standard, high-throughput manufacturing process widely used for shaping thermoplastics. Our approach uniquely enables wafer-scale production of highly curved metasurface optics, achieving sub-millimeter radii of curvature and micron-level alignment precision. To guide the design and fabrication process, we developed a thermorheological model that accurately predicts and compensates for the large strains induced during thermoforming. This allows for precise control of metasurface geometry and preservation of optical function, yielding devices with diffraction-limited performance. As a demonstration, we implemented an artificial compound eye comprising freeform micro-metalens arrays. Compared to traditional micro-optical counterparts, the device exhibits an expanded field of view, reduced aberrations, and improved uniformity, highlighting the potential of thermoformed metasurfaces for next-generation optical systems.

Abstract: Time-modulated media offer powerful opportunities for controlling light, yet extending such concepts to optical frequencies has remained challenging. Here we propose a different route to photonic spacetime crystals based on modulation of the anomalous velocity in low-symmetry conductors, particularly Weyl semimetals. We show that when driven by a strong optical pump, the anomalous velocity of Bloch electrons induces an ultrafast spacetime modulation that propagates with a superluminal phase velocity relative to the dielectric background. This self-induced modulation enables unidirectional light transport below the optical gap and, near the epsilon-near-zero point, gives rise to collective parametric resonance and stimulated emission of volume plasmons. These findings identify Weyl semimetals as a promising platform for realizing optical spacetime crystals and open a pathway toward active and nonreciprocal photonic systems governed by quantum geometric effects.

Abstract: Optical matter (OM), composed of optically bound metallic particles, can be rotated by transferring the spin angular momentum (SAM) of chiral light to the assembly. Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) microscope (OCM) uses a high-numerical-aperture objective to achieve cellular-level lateral resolution. However, its practical imaging depth range is limited by the depth of focus (DOF). Although computational refocusing can potentially provide sharp images outside the DOF, signal reduction by the confocal effect still limits the imaging depth in practice in point-scanning OCT. In addition, standard OCT cannot visualize intra-tissue activities. To overcome these limitations, we demonstrated a spatially coherent full-field OCM (SC-FFOCM) with computational refocusing. In addition, a repetitive acquisition protocol was designed to visualize intra-tissue activities (i.e., dynamic OCT imaging). The in-focus lateral resolution is 1.4 um, and the axial resolution is 6.5 um (in air) at full-width at half-maximum intensity. Three-dimensional structure and the dynamic OCT imaging using SC-FFOCM with computational refocusing was applied to human breast adenocarcinoma spheroids (MCF-7 cell line). Volumetric dynamic imaging with cellular-level lateral resolution was demonstrated over the full depth of the spheroid.

Abstract: Harnessing a beam of slow free electrons in artificial photonic structures offers a powerful, tunable platform for generating nonclassical light without the need for heavy physical equipment. Here we present a theory of nonclassical lasing, demonstrating how incoherent electrons in photonic crystal cavities can coherently emit photons through collective dynamics. When photon emission rate exceeds cavity losses, nonclassical lasing with sub-Poissonian photon statistics emerges, driven by multi-photon Rabi oscillations. At specific coupling strengths, quantum state trapping effect emerges, producing high-fidelity Fock states at room temperature (e.g. nearly 90%-fidelity of four photon Fock state). Notably, the frequency of the emitted photons can be readily tuned via the velocity of the injected electrons to match cavity modes. This approach supports photonic integration and offers a scalable, energy-efficient platform for room-temperature quantum light sources and advanced studies in quantum electrodynamics.

This phase is naturally represented on a recently introduced `electric-magnetic' sphere.

Abstract: Ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy provides unique access to the structural dynamics of molecules, spin-valley relaxation in semiconductors, and the non-equilibrium optical response of chiral nanophotonic systems. Yet, because chiral signals are intrinsically weak and time-resolved spectroscopy probes small photoinduced changes, transient chiro-optical responses are often difficult to isolate from parasitic achiral contributions. Here, we introduce a broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy technique that integrates a birefringent common-path interferometer with an optical polarization bridge to sensitively detect photoinduced changes in the polarization state of light. Phase-sensitive self-heterodyned detection enables simultaneous measurement of transient circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion across a broad spectral range with ultrafast temporal resolution. Balanced detection suppresses excess laser noise, enabling exceptional sensitivity (<50 $μ$deg) close to shot-noise limit. We demonstrate this approach on an array of gold nano-helicoids, supported by a full-wave time-resolved model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of plasmonic non-equilibrium carriers and their associated optical nonlinearities. The model traces the system's transient chiro-optical response back to photoinduced modulations of the electric-magnetic dipole interaction in the nano-helicoid, elucidating the connection of near- and far-field dynamics in the non-equilibrium regime. We further investigate spin excitation, thermalization, and relaxation in a lead halide perovskite, establishing a novel approach to broadband time-resolved Faraday rotation. The simplicity, sensitivity, and wide applicability of this detection scheme provide a powerful platform for broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy, opening new opportunities in biochemistry, solid-state physics, and nanophotonics.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new experimental method to measure the quantum phase of electron wavefunctions in quantum materials, which has been a major obstacle in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the phase of electron wavefunctions is crucial for grasping the behavior of quantum materials, including phenomena like topological insulators and Dirac cones, which have unique electronic properties.

Method: The researchers developed a quantum-path electron interferometer using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. This allows for simultaneous measurement of energy and momentum resolution to reconstruct the phase of electronic states.

Result: The interferometer successfully resolved the phase of the Dirac electronic band in a topological insulator. They observed a phase jump associated with a resonance and a helicity-dependent inversion in the Dirac cone, demonstrating the interferometer's ability to capture fine phase information.

Conclusion: This method provides a powerful, model-independent tool to measure the phase of electronic states, opening new avenues for studying quantum materials and their electronic properties experimentally.

Abstract: The electronic wavefunction is at the heart of physical phenomena, defining the frontiers of quantum materials research. While the amplitude of the electron wavefunction in crystals can be measured with state-of-the-art probes in unprecedented resolution, its phase has remained largely inaccessible, obscuring rich electronic information. Here we develop a quantum-path electron interferometer based on time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that enables the reconstruction of the phase of electronic states in quantum materials - with energy and momentum resolution. We demonstrate the scheme by resolving the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a prototypical topological insulator and observe a resonance-associated phase jump as well as a momentum and phase synchronized inversion revealing the helicity of the Dirac cone. We show the interferometer can be optically controlled by the polarization of the absorbed light, allowing a differential measurement of the phase - a crucial component for extracting phase information from an interferogram. This photo-electron-interferometer is a purely experimental scheme and does not rely on any specific theoretical model. It can be extended to a variety of materials, opening up the phase dimension in quantum materials research.

Abstract: Superdiffusion is an anomalous transport behavior. Recently, a new mechanism, termed the ``nodal mechanism," has been proposed to induce superdiffusion in quantum models. However, existing realizations of the nodal mechanism have so far been proposed on fine-tuned, artificial Hamiltonians, posing a significant challenge for experimental observation. In this work, we propose a broad class of models for generating superdiffusion potentially realizable in condensed matter systems across different spatial dimensions. A robust nodal structure emerges from the hybridization between the itinerant electrons and the local impurity orbitals, protected by the intrinsic symmetry and topology of the electronic band. We derive a universal scaling law for the conductance, $G \sim L^{-γ}$, revealing how the exponent is dictated by the dimensionality of the nodal structure ($D_{\text{node}}$) and its order $n$, and the dimensionality of the system $(D)$ at high temperatures or that of the Fermi surface ($D^F$) at low temperatures. Through numerical simulations, we validate these scaling relations at zero temperature for various models, including those based on graphene and multi-Weyl semimetals, finding excellent agreement between our theory and the computed exponents. Beyond the scaling of conductance, our framework predicts a suite of experimentally verifiable signatures, notably a new mechanism for linear-in-temperature resistivity ($ρ\sim T$) and a divergent low-frequency optical conductivity ($σ(ω) \sim ω^{γ-1}$), establishing a practical route to discovering and engineering anomalous transport in quantum materials.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了基于格林函数的方法在预测受驱超导体-半导体杂化物Floquet拓扑相中的有效性，并强调了正确处理自能对于观察这些相的重要性。

Abstract: We bring forward a Green function approach for the prediction of Floquet topological phases in driven superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. Although it is common to treat the superconducting component as a mere Cooper-pair reservoir, it was recently pointed out that such an approximation breaks down in the presence of driving, due to the emergence of level broadening. Here, we go beyond these recent works and prescribe how to construct the Floquet topological invariants for such driven hybrids. Specifically, we propose to first obtain the midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and, subsequently, read out the respective level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part of the self-energy onto the quasi-energy eigenvectors. We exemplify our approach for a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field. Using our method, we obtain the Floquet band structure, the respective level broadenings, and the topological invariants. Our analysis reinforces the need to properly account for the self-energy, and corroborates that broadening effects can hinder the observation of the Floquet topological phases and especially of those harboring Majorana $π$ modes.

### [25] [Impact of Contact Gating on Scaling of Monolayer 2D Transistors Using a Symmetric Dual-Gate Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09762)
*Victoria M. Ravel,Sarah R. Evans,Samantha K. Holmes,James L. Doherty,Md Sazzadur Rahman,Tania Roy,Aaron D. Franklin*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that contact gating can significantly enhance on-state performance of 2D FETs by about 2x-5x depending on scaled dimensions, with a notable 70% reduction in transfer length when contact gating is present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to understand how contact gating affects the performance of 2D field-effect transistors (FETs), particularly in monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) channels. Previous studies of contact gating often rely on indirect methods, so this paper aims to quantify its impact by introducing a symmetric dual-gate structure.

Method: The researchers employ a symmetric dual-gate structure with independently addressable back and top gates. They fabricate long-channel devices (50 nm channel and 30 nm contact length) and use this structure to directly measure the impact of contact gating on the device's performance. They introduce a 'contact gating factor' to quantify the phenomena.

Result: The results show that contact gating significantly enhances the on-state performance of 2D FETs. Specifically, in long-channel devices, the on-state performance improves by a factor of 2x-5x, and the transfer length decreases by 70% when contact gating is present. This represents an amplification of the impact observed in previous studies.

Conclusion: The findings establish contact gating as a critical determinant of device performance in 2D FETs. The symmetric dual-gate structure used in this study provides a robust method to quantify and understand the effects of contact gating, which was previously overlooked or underappreciated in the literature.

Abstract: The performance and scalability of two-dimensional (2D) field-effect transistors (FETs) are strongly influenced by geometry-defined electrostatics. In most 2D FET studies, the gate overlaps with the source and drain electrodes, allowing the gate potential to modulate the 2D semiconductor underneath the electrodes and ultimately effect carrier transport at the metal-semiconductor interface - a phenomenon known as contact gating. Here, a symmetric dual-gate structure with independently addressable back and top gates is employed to elucidate the impact of contact gating on a monolayer MoS2 channel. Unlike previous studies of contact gating, this symmetric structure enables quantification of the phenomena through a contact gating factor, revealing a 2x enhancement in on-state performance in long-channel devices. At scaled dimensions (50 nm channel and 30 nm contact length), the influence of contact gating becomes amplified, yielding a 5x increase in on-state performance and a 70% reduction in transfer length when contact gating is present. Since many reported record-performance 2D FETs employ back-gate geometries that inherently include contact gating, these results establish contact gating as a critical and previously underappreciated determinant of device performance in the 2D FET landscape.

Motivation: Understanding topological phases and transitions is key in material science for predicting novel properties and functionalities.

Method: The study employs nonlocal quantum geometric markers as correlation functions to analyze and distinguish topological transitions.

Result: Nonlocal markers showed distinct spatial signatures even within the same symmetry class, offering a refined probe of topological stability.

Conclusion: This approach provides a powerful method to understand and predict topological phase transitions, enhancing material design and innovation.

Abstract: Spatially resolved local quantum geometric markers play a crucial role in the diagnosis of topological phases without long-range translational symmetry, including amorphous systems. Here, we focus on the nonlocality of such markers. We demonstrate that they behave as correlation functions independently of the material's structure, showing sharp variations in the vicinity of topological transitions and exhibiting a unique pattern in real space for each transition. Notably, we find that, even within the same Altland-Zirnbauer class, distinct topological transitions generate qualitatively different spatial signatures, enabling a refined, class-internal probe of topological stability. As such, nonlocal quantum geometric indicators provide a more efficient and versatile tool to understand and predict the stability of topological phase transitions.

Motivation: The study of dynamic properties of van der Waals materials under different stimuli, such as mechanical strain, is crucial for advancing nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices.

Method: The research employed piezoelectric substrates, NbSe₃ nanowires, and surface acoustic wave devices. They measured differential resistance using rf current and analyzed the Shapiro steps at the SAW resonant frequency.

Result: Strain induced by SAWs leads to distinct Shapiro steps in NbSe₃ nanowires, unlike those caused by rf currents, emphasizing the role of mechanical effects on CDW properties.

Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of mechanical strain in understanding and controlling CDW dynamics in van der Waals materials, opening new avenues for strain-induced device applications.

Abstract: Recent development in nanotechnology has enabled us to investigate the dynamic properties of van der Waals materials on a piezoelectric substrate. Here we report on the dynamics of charge density wave (CDW) in NbSe$_{3}$ nanowires induced by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). Clear peaks in the differential resistance were observed at the resonant frequency of the SAW device. These peaks known as Shapiro steps are typically observed by applying an rf current to NbSe$_{3}$ nanowires. We found that the Shapiro steps induced by SAWs show several distinct features from the ones induced by an rf current. Our detailed study revealed that a strain induced by SAWs plays a significant role in the Shapiro steps. The result clearly demonstrates the importance of the strain in CDW materials and paves the way for strain-induced device applications.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop advanced magnonics for low-power and quantum technologies through on-chip magnonic transducers.

Method: The method involves finite-element simulations to compute vector near-fields of antennas and import these into micromagnetic solvers to model wave propagation and driving fields.

Result: The results validate the framework against experimental AEPSWS on a 48 nm YIG film, showing agreement in dispersion ridges, group velocities, and spectral peaks.

Conclusion: The antenna acts as a tunable k-space filter for on-chip magnonic transducers, relevant for low-power and quantum magnonics applications.

Abstract: The excitation and detection of propagating spin waves with lithographed nanoantennas underpin both classical magnonic circuits and emerging quantum technologies. Here, we establish a framework for all-electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy (AEPSWS) that links realistic electromagnetic drive fields to micromagnetic dynamics. Using finite-element (FE) simulations, we compute the full vector near-field of electrical impedance-matched, tapered coplanar and stripline antennas and import this distribution into finite-difference (FD) micromagnetic solvers. This approach captures the antenna-limited wave-vector spectrum and the component-selective driving fields (perpendicular to the static magnetisation) that simplified uniform-field models cannot. From this coupling, we derive how realistic current return paths and tapering shapes, k-weighting functions, for Damon-Eshbach surface spin waves in yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) films are, for millimetre-scale matched CPWs and linear tapers down to nanometre-scale antennas. Validation against experimental AEPSWS on a $48\,nm$ YIG film shows quantitative agreement in dispersion ridges, group velocities, and spectral peak positions, establishing that the antenna acts as a tunable k-space filter. These results provide actionable design rules for on-chip magnonic transducers, with immediate relevance for low-power operation regimes and prospective applications in quantum magnonics.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the thermoelectric (TE) properties of semiconductor nanowires with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an applied Zeeman field, demonstrating that tuning the misalignment angle φ between spin-orbit directions can significantly control TE properties, including Seebeck coefficient and ZT figure of merit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of TE properties in advanced semiconductor materials, particularly nanowires with spin-orbit coupling, is crucial for developing efficient thermoelectric devices. This paper contributes to enhancing our understanding of how to manipulate these properties for practical applications.

Method: The authors employ a scattering-matrix approach within a tight-binding model to analyze the TE properties of the nanowires under different conditions, specifically varying the misalignment angle φ between spin-orbit directions.

Result: The key findings include the prediction of a significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law and a strong enhancement of both the Seebeck coefficient and the ZT figure of merit in the Dirac paradox configuration, where RSOC vectors are antiparallel. Additionally, the Zeeman gap is shown to determine the optimal energy window for doping and temperature applications.

Conclusion: This research opens new avenues for tuning and optimizing the TE response in quantum-coherent semiconducting NW devices through the control of spin-orbit field directions, possibly achieved via wrap gates.

Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), when exposed to a suitably applied Zeeman field, exhibit one-dimensional helical channels with a spin orientation locked to the propagation direction within the magnetic energy gap. Here, by adopting a scattering-matrix approach applied to a tight-binding model of the NW, we demonstrate that the thermoelectric (TE) properties can be widely controlled by tuning the misalignment angle $φ$ between the spin-orbit directions of two NW segments. In particular, when the RSOC vectors are antiparallel (Dirac paradox configuration) we predict a significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, and a strong enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and the $ZT$ figure of merit. We also show that the Zeeman gap determines the optimal energy window for doping and temperatures. These results suggest that controlling the spin-orbit field direction, which can be achieved with suitably applied wrap gates, is a promising alternative for tuning and optimizing the TE response in quantum-coherent semiconducting NW devices.

This paper reports the successful creation of insulating states in a 1D vdW heterostructure by aligning an armchair single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) with a hBN substrate. The emergence of insulating behaviors at specific charge points and full moiré fillings suggests a strong 1D moiré effect. DFT and tight-binding calculations support these findings, showing expanded band gaps at certain points. While one-body theory doesn't fully explain all insulating behaviors, electron correlation and interaction effects likely play a role. This work opens a new avenue for exploring interaction-induced quantum phases in 1D systems.

Motivation: The paper addresses a significant challenge in materials science—extending moiré engineering from 2D to 1D systems. This has implications for developing new electronic materials with precise control over quantum states, which is crucial for advancing nanotechnology and materials-based technologies.

Method: The research employs a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. The experimental part involves crystallographically aligning an armchair SWNT with a hBN substrate and performing low-temperature electrical transport measurements to observe the insulating behaviors. The theoretical part uses density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding calculations to model the band structures and identify the regions responsible for the observed insulating states. Theoretical predictions are then compared with experimental results to validate the findings.

Result: The study successfully demonstrates that 1D vdW heterostructures can exhibit insulating states under specific conditions. When the armchair SWNT is aligned with the hBN substrate, the electronic system shows pronounced insulating behaviors at the charge neutrality point (CNP) and full and half moiré fillings. These behaviors are not observed in untreated armchair SWNT devices, providing strong evidence for the importance of the 1D moiré effect. Theoretical calculations further explain these observations by showing that the combination of nanotube partial flattening and in-plane lattice reconstruction stabilizes specific electronic configurations with open band gaps, potentially explaining the insulating behavior.

Conclusion: This research establishes a new and promising moiré engineering route for 1D vdW materials. The discovery of interaction-induced insulating states at specific charge points opens exciting avenues for further exploring and controlling quantum phases in 1D systems. This work not only advances our understanding of moiré-induced electronic phenomena but also provides a foundation for the development of new electronic and photonic devices based on 1D vdW heterostructures.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) moiré superlattices have provided a powerful knob to engineer a plethora of new quantum states. However, extending such moiré engineering to one-dimensional (1D) vdW systems has remained challenging. Here we report the moiré-engineered electronic insulating states in a new 1D moiré superlattice, by crystallographically aligning an armchair single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) to 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Remarkably, we observe the emergence of pronounced insulating states at charge neutrality point (CNP), full and half moiré fillings in lattice-aligned armchair SWNT/hBN heterostructures by low-temperature electrical transport measurements. In strong contrast, armchair SWNT devices without hBN alignment do not show any of these insulating behaviors, providing compelling evidence for the significant 1D moiré effect. Our density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding calculations reveal that synergetic nanotube partial flattening and in-plane lattice reconstruction at 1D moiré interface expand the most stable AB' stacking regions (carbon on top of boron) and open sizable band gaps at both CNP and full moiré fillings at the single-particle level. Our one-body theory predicts no band gaps at half moiré fillings, suggesting that electron correlation and/or electron-phonon interaction may give rise to these emergent insulating behaviors in our 1D moiré systems. Our work establishes a new and definite moiré engineering route for 1D vdW materials and opens an exciting avenue for exploring interaction-induced quantum phases in 1D.

TL;DR: This paper investigate the magnetotransport properties of a two-dimensional electronic system with unconventional Rashba spin-orbit coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the magnetotransport properties of two-dimensional systems with Rashba spin-orbit coupling is important for potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing.

Method: The authors derive analytical expressions for the Landau levels and compute the longitudinal conductivity and quantum Hall conductivity using the Kubo formalism.

Result: They find that the usual Shubnikov-de Haas (SDH) oscillations in longitudinal conductivity can be made purely spin-polarized by adjusting the Fermi level. Additionally, the intra-spin branches exhibit a beating pattern in SDH oscillations due to the superposition of SDH oscillations from two bands in each spin branch.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate distinct behavior of SDH oscillations in this unconventional Rashba system compared to conventional Rashba systems. The double jump in the Hall conductivity at precise Fermi level positions indicates interesting transport properties that merit further investigation.

Abstract: We study the magnetotransport properties of a two-dimensional electronic system with unconventional Rashba spin-orbit coupling in which the system is described by a pair of chiral spin texture in each spin branch, and the chirality is opposite in two spin branches. We obtain the Landau levels analytically and find that intra-spin and/or inter-spin Landau level crossing occurs. We compute the longitudinal conductivity and quantum Hall conductivity using the Kubo formalism based on linear response theory. We find that the usual Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation in longitudinal conductivity appears that can be made purely spin polarized by adjusting the Fermi level suitably. We observe a beating pattern in the Shubnikov-de Hass oscillation in the intra-spin branches, which arises due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to two bands in each spin branch. This is contrary to the conventional Rashba system, where such beating is due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to the two spin-branches. On the other hand, we note that quantum-Hall conductivity exhibits usual quantization in units of $e^2/h$ corresponding to each spin dependent Landau level. However, the Landau level crossing gives rise to the double jump in the Hall conductivity if the Fermi level is placed precisely at the crossing point.

Abstract: Materials are commonly distinguished by their magnetic response into diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and magnetically ordered (ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnetic) phases. Diamagnets and paramagnets lack spontaneous long-range order, whereas ordered magnets develop such order below their Curie or Néel temperature and support single spin-wave excitations (magnons). Magnons have found applications in radio-frequency technologies and computation, magneto-optics, and foundational quantum experiments. Above the Curie/Néel temperature, long-range order is lost and the material transitions to a paramagnetic phase, with localised spin alignment in small patches, producing paramagnons with only short-range propagation. Here we show that long-range coherence is preserved in the organic free radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl above the Néel temperature using all-electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy in external magnetic fields. We observe coherently excited low-energy paramagnon-polaritons up to $\mathbf{23\,\mathrm{GHz}}$ , propagating over $\mathbf{8\,\mathrm{mm}}$ at supersonic group velocities exceeding $\mathbf{100\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}}$. Using free radicals as magnon carriers integrates organic materials with spintronics and opens the way to organic electronics, dense information storage, and quantum technologies.

Abstract: The measurements of Hanle and polarization recovery effects for localized charge carriers are the basic tools for determining parameters of the spin dynamics, such as strength of the hyperfine interaction, for example, in quantum dots. We describe the dependence of the spin polarization of localized electrons on transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields taking into account the interplay between electron hopping and measurement back action. We show that these two have a qualitatively similar effect in the Faraday geometry, but compete in the Voigt geometry. This allows one to describe a broad range of the experimental results and study the fundamental effects of quantum measurements.

Abstract: Point defects or impurities can give rise to sharp local modifications in the structure and electronic properties of two-dimensional metals, serving as an intriguing atomic-level solid-state model for both fundamental and application research. In this work, we investigated atomic-scale defects in a two-dimensional silver monolayer intercalated at the interface between epitaxial graphene and SiC using a scanning tunneling microscope. Distinct dark and bright defects are identified as in-plane vacancies and substitutional impurities within the silver monolayer, each hosting a localized electronic state induced solely by the defect. Remarkably, under excitation of tunneling electrons assisted by a negative bias voltage, the defects can hop inelastically which is reminiscent of the hydrogen switching in the cavity of an organic molecule. The hopping can be reversibly controlled by the scanning tunneling microscope tip, allowing the defects to function as atomic-scale two-level conductance switches. Defect hopping further allows us to gain a deeper understanding of their origins and the relationship between dark and bright defect species. This study constitutes a pathway toward understanding and controlling defects in two-dimensional metals with atomic precision, revealing previously unexplored dynamic behavior with potential applications in nanoelectronics.

Abstract: The performance and reliability of spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory (STT-MRAM) can be compromised by anomalous switching behavior, especially during high-speed operations. One such anomaly, known as the "ballooning effect" is characterized by an unexpected non-monotonic increase in the write error rate (WER) with increase in STT current at specific current pulse durations. In this study, we systematically investigate the role of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on such WER anomaly using micromagnetic simulations of 20 nm and 50 nm magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). We show that DMI promotes incoherent magnetization reversal, prolongs the switching time and creates intermediate multidomain states that result in incomplete reversal. At high DMI values, these states persist even under large switching current densities, reproducing ballooning-like anomalies reported experimentally. In contrast, longer pulses overcome these effects by allowing the system sufficient time to reach a stable state. Our findings show that interfacial DMI can play a role in the ballooning effect and point to interfacial engineering as a practical strategy for improving the reliability of next-generation STT-MRAM.

Abstract: Topologically secure spin configurations, such as skyrmions and bimerons, offer a compelling alternative to conventional magnetic domains, potentially enabling high-density, low-power spintronic devices. These pseudo-particles, characterized by their swirling spin textures and nontrivial topological charges, are prevalent and notably influence their electronic, magnetic, and mechanical traits. This paper provides an in-depth overview of the interaction between a screw dislocation within a distorted magnetic lattice, exploring possible coupling mechanisms and establishing a promising link between two disparate topics in materials science: topological magnetism and topological elasticity. We first provide a classical analysis of skyrmion motion that reveals the dislocations as shallow traps on the magnetic texture. Afterwards, we provide an analysis of the quantized motion of the skyrmion and identify its quantum states. We conclude by illustrating how the ideas in our paper can be implemented in simple yet compelling devices based on the shallow traps from an array of dislocations acting as frets in a race-track, controlling the motion with a low current activation mechanism.

Abstract: Crystalline symmetries determine the linear and nonlinear response of materials to external stimuli such as mechanical pressure and electromagnetic fields, governing phenomena such as piezoelectricity, optical activity, and multiple wave mixing with wide ranging technological applications. Altermagnets present a new class of materials with magnetic crystalline order where specific crystal symmetry operations connect antiferromagnetic sublattices, leading to non-relativistic spin-splitting of the electronic band structure. Hence, the electric material properties of altermagnets should uniquely mirror these underlying symmetry properties, potentially giving rise to novel phenomena in response to external driving fields. Here, we report the discovery of a broadband third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in altermagnetic CrSb at room temperature. The comparison of our observations with symmetry analyses and model calculations shows that this nonlinear Hall response is induced by the nonlinear electric susceptibility of a Berry curvature quadrupole, which exists within the spin-split band structure of CrSb and is characterized by the underlying crystalline and magnetic symmetries. We then utilize this third-order nonlinear electric susceptibility of CrSb to realize a multiple wave mixing device with pronounced four wave mixing output, which could, in principle, be extended to THz frequencies. Our study discovers that the crystalline magnetic order of altermagnets determines their nonlinear electric material properties, which could facilitate applications in high-frequency electronics, THz generation, communication networks, and energy harvesting.

Abstract: In addition to topological lattice defects such as dislocations and disclinations, crystals are also accompanied by unavoidable ordinary defects, devoid of any non-trivial geometry or topology, among which vacancies, Schottky defects, substitutions, interstitials, and Frenkel pairs are the most common. In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can nonetheless serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands, and any change in the local topological environment in an otherwise normal insulator in terms of mid-gap bound states in their vicinity. We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices.

Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials provide unique structural features, such as physical gaps between their layers that are only connected through van der Waals (vdW) forces. These vdW gaps can guide the migration of intercalated ions and thus regulate filament growth in resistive switching (RS) devices. Vertically aligned 2D materials and their heterostructures provide vdW gap-mediated ion transport in memristor crossbars, providing great potential for high-density integration and reliable RS performance. Nevertheless, the fundamental switching mechanisms and their contributions to the RS remain inadequately understood. In this work, we investigate silver (Ag) filament-based threshold switching (TS) in heterostructures comprising vertically aligned 2D molybdenum disulfide (VAMoS${_2}$) grown via sulfurization and silicon oxide (SiO${_x}$). Compared to SiO${_x}$-only devices, the SiO${_x}$/VAMoS${_2}$ devices exhibit TS with higher on-threshold and hold voltages, each approximately 0.4 V, faster switching times down to 356 ns under a 4 V pulse, and a lower cycle-to-cycle on-current variability of 3.0%. A physics-based, variability-aware model reveals that confined Ag ion migration within the vdW gaps in VAMoS${_2}$ forms ultrathin seed filaments, which guide filament growth in the SiO${_x}$ layer. These findings establish SiO${_x}$/VAMoS${_2}$ heterostructures as a promising concept for reliable TS in vertical device architectures for emerging memories and neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: Measurement of the magnetization in the bulk of thin-film or two-dimensional materials is important for understanding their intrinsic properties without the complications from edges or domain walls. However, the stray fields from the bulk vanish or are very weak, which limits the application of direct measurement methods. Here, we develop a non-destructive approach to directly measuring the stray fields from the bulk of thin-film magnets at arbitrarily designatable locations, with nanoscale spatial resolution. We employ nano-indentation to induce the leakage of stray fields from the materials and use nano-diamond magnetometers to measure them. We apply the method to iron thin films and determine the intrinsic magnetization in the bulk of the materials. This work provides direct access to the intrinsic magnetic properties of thin-film and low-dimensional materials, as well as a method to study the mechanical effects on magnetization in nanomaterials.

Abstract: Bandwidth is a widely known concept and tool used in structural dynamics to measure an oscillator's capacity to dissipate energy over time, for example when used in half-power damping estimation of structural modes. Root Mean Square (RMS) Bandwidth is a generalization of bandwidth that overcomes some of the limitations encountered with conventional bandwidth, including the prerequisite of linearity, single-mode response, and light damping. However, its mathematical form does not reveal much about the physics behind it. In this paper, we extend RMS Bandwidth to multiple degree-of-freedom, linear, time-invariant, classically damped systems by deriving an Analytical Root Mean Square (ARMS) Bandwidth in terms of a system's modal parameters and initial modal energy distribution. We demonstrate that ARMS Bandwidth reliably and accurately computes a single measure for a practical structure's dissipative capacity. Also, a purely data-driven methodology for assessing the modal energy distribution is developed. We apply ARMS Bandwidth to single and multiple degree-of-freedom systems and an experimental model aircraft to demonstrate its broad applicability. Future work will address the effects of non-classical damping distribution, time-varying parameters, and nonlinearities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper builds on existing work by generalizing the Wigner function formalism to Fermi-Dirac statistics, aiming to maintain thermodynamic consistency and macroscopic current relations.

Method: The authors generalize the Wigner function from the Boltzmann local equilibrium case for spin-1/2 particles to Fermi-Dirac statistics using suitable functionals of the distribution function. They derive the normalization conditions of the mean polarization vector and generalize thermodynamic relations involving spin.

Result: The resulting Wigner function ensures correct normalization of the mean polarization vector and aligns with generalized thermodynamic relations previously derived.

Conclusion: The framework can be cast as a divergence-type theory, with macroscopic currents expressible as derivatives of a generating function with respect to Lagrange multipliers, providing a systematic approach for further studies.

Abstract: A recently proposed Boltzmann local equilibrium Wigner function for massive spin-1/2 particles is generalized to the case of Fermi-Dirac statistics. The resulting formula ensures the correct normalization of the mean polarization vector and reproduces the generalized thermodynamic relations with spin that were obtained in earlier studies. Moreover, we show that the macroscopic currents constructed from the Fermi-Dirac Wigner function can be obtained as derivatives of a suitably defined generating function with respect to the Lagrange multipliers (temperature, hydrodynamic flow, and chemical potentials). The identified generating function also indicates that the underlying framework can be classified as a divergence-type theory.

*E. Novais*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the decoherence of a π-junction qubit encoded by two co-located Majorana modes, finding that while quantum frustration helps mitigate certain types of noise, it is insufficient against 1/f noise, leading to catastrophic decoherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is relevant to understanding the robustness of Majorana-based qubits against environmental noise, which is a critical concern in quantum computing.

Method: The authors model the qubit's interaction with different environmental noise spectra and experimentally observe the effects on qubit decoherence.

Result: The study reveals that quantum frustration provides partial protection against Ohmic and sub-Ohmic noise but fails against 1/f noise, which is prevalent in many experimental settings.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the challenges of maintaining qubit coherence in realistic environments and emphasize the need for alternative strategies to enhance fault-tolerant Majorana qubits.

Abstract: I analyze the decoherence of a $π$-junction qubit encoded by two co-located Majorana modes. Although not topologically protected, the qubit leverages distinct spatial profiles to couple to two independent environmental baths, realizing the phenomenon of quantum frustration.This mechanism is tested against the threat of quasiparticle poisoning (QP). I show that frustration is effective against Ohmic noise ($s=1$) and has some protection for $0.76<s<1$ sub-Ohmic noise. However, the experimentally prevalent $1/f$ noise ($s\to0$) falls deep within the model's localized phase, where frustration is insufficient. This causes Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and catastrophic decoherence. The qubit's viability depends on what is the effective environment that these local Majorana wave functions experience.

Abstract: We analyze a simple and efficient experimental protocol to cool the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model to low temperatures. The protocol utilizes local couplings between two copies of an SYK model to create a gapped adiabatic path, between a high temperature product state and a low temperature thermofield double state. By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model. We support these predictions-and demonstrate fast cooling to the low-temperature gravitational regime-via exact numerical solutions to the large-N equations of motion that govern the ground state and dynamical properties of the coupled system. Finally, we present a theoretical framework based upon eigenstate thermalization that provides a microscopic explanation for the efficacy of the cooling protocol; intriguingly, this suggests that the protocol may be applicable for cooling strongly-interacting quantum Hamiltonians more broadly.

Abstract: Quantum superposition famously manifests as spatial interference, epitomized by the double-slit experiment. Its less explored temporal analogue, Stückelberg interference, arises in driven systems where phases accumulated along distinct time-domain pathways recombine. Extending this phenomenon to large interacting systems introduces a new complexity as delicate phase relationships are disrupted by many-body interactions. Here we experimentally achieve controllable vacuum-state freezing in programmable Rydberg arrays of up to 100 atoms through many-body Stückelberg interference, with visibility exceeding $70\%$ and excitation suppression to $1\%$ despite periodic driving that would typically induce heating. Comparing single and dual-frequency protocols across multiple geometries, we show that simultaneous modulation of detuning and Rabi frequency dramatically enhances interference-driven freezing. Finite-range interaction tails play a decisive role, producing interference patterns which constrained $PXP$ models cannot capture. Our results establish temporal interference as a scalable microscopic mechanism for Floquet control, enabling predictive many-body state engineering in large-scale platforms.

Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is of central importance in both theory and practice. Yet, most provable guarantees for quantum algorithms rely exclusively on Grover-type methods that cap the possible advantage at only quadratic speed-ups, making the search for approaches that surpass this quadratic barrier a key challenge. In this light, this work presents a rigorous worst-case runtime analysis of a recently introduced measurement-driven quantum SAT solver. Importantly, this quantum algorithm does not exclusively rely on Grover-type methods and shows promising numerical performance. Our analysis establishes that the algorithm's runtime depends on an exponential trade-off between two key properties: the spectral gap of the associated Hamiltonian and the success probability of the driving measurements. We show that this trade-off can be systematically controlled by a tunable rotation angle. Beyond establishing a worst-case runtime expression, this work contributes significant algorithmic improvements. First, we develop a new readout routine that efficiently finds a solution even for instances with multiple satisfying assignments. Second, a measurement parallelization scheme, based on perfect hash families, is introduced. Third, we establish an amplitude-amplified version of the measurement-driven algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: By suitably scheduling the algorithm's parameters, we show that its runtime collapses from exponential to polynomial on a special class of SAT instances, consistent with their known classical tractability. A problem we leave open is to establish a non-trivial lower bound on the spectral gap as a function of the rotation angle. Resolving this directly translates into an improved worst-case runtime, potentially realizing a super-quadratic quantum advantage.

Abstract: We introduce a non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump realized by a transitionless geometric quantum drive--a time-dependent Hamiltonian supplemented by a counterdiabatic term generated by a prescribed trajectory on a smooth control manifold--that coherently transports states within a degenerate subspace. When the coordinates of the trajectory are independently addressable by external drives, the net energy transferred between drives is set by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor. The trajectory-averaged pumping power is separately controlled by the initial state and by the Hamiltonian topology through the Euler class. We outline an implementation with artificial atoms, which are realizable on various platforms including trapped atoms/ions, superconducting circuits, and semiconductor quantum dots. The resulting energy pump can serve as a quantum transducer or charger, and as a metrological tool for measuring phase coherences in quantum states.

Abstract: Bipartite entanglement purification is the conversion of copies of weakly entangled pairs shared between two separated parties into a smaller number of strongly entangled shared pairs using only local operations and classical communication. Choosing between different entanglement purification protocols generally involves weighing up a trade-off between the ratio of strongly entangled pairs produced to weakly entangled pairs consumed, which we call the rate of the protocol, and the degree of the entanglement of the strongly entangled pairs, typically measured by the fidelity of those pairs to maximally entangled states. By randomly choosing a protocol according to a probability distribution over a list of protocols for each pair we want to produce, we can achieve rates and fidelities not achieved by any of the original protocols. Here, we show how to choose this distribution to maximise the rate at which we produce qubit pairs with a given fidelity to a Bell state or, equivalently, to maximise the fidelity to a Bell state of the qubit pairs produced at a given rate. We investigate both the asymptotic case, where the number of initial pairs goes to infinity, and the finite-size regime, where protocols are restricted to a finite number of weakly entangled pairs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Hypergraph product (HGP) codes are one of the most popular family of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Circuit-level simulations show that they can achieve the same logical error rate as surface codes with a reduced qubit overhead. They have been extensively optimized by importing classical techniques such as the progressive edge growth, or through random search, simulated annealing or reinforcement learning techniques. In this work, instead of machine learning (ML) algorithms that improve the code performance through local transformations, we impose additional global symmetries, that are hard to discover through ML, and we perform an exhaustive search. Precisely, we focus on the hypergraph product of two cyclic codes, which we call CxC codes and we study C2 codes which are the product a cyclic code with itself and CxR codes which are the product of a cyclic codes with a repetition code. We discover C2 codes and CxR codes that significantly outperform previously optimized HGP codes, achieving better parameters and a logical error rate per logical qubit that is up to three orders of magnitude better. Moreover, some C2 codes achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a smaller qubit overhead than state-of-the-art LDPC codes such as the bivariate bicycle codes, at the price of a larger block length. Finally, leveraging the cyclic symmetry imposed on the codes, we design an efficient planar layout for the QCCD architecture, allowing for a trapped ion implementation of the syndrome extraction circuit in constant depth.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a fundamental task in quantum information science, enabling detailed characterization of correlations, entanglement, and electronic structure in quantum systems. However, its exponential measurement and computational demands limit scalability, motivating efficient alternatives such as classical shadows, which enable accurate prediction of many observables from randomized measurements. In this work, we introduce a bi-objective semidefinite programming approach for constrained shadow tomography, designed to reconstruct the two-particle reduced density matrix (2-RDM) from noisy or incomplete shadow data. By integrating $N$-representability constraints and nuclear-norm regularization into the optimization, the method builds an $N$-representable 2-RDM that balances fidelity to the shadow measurements with energy minimization. This unified framework mitigates noise and sampling errors while enforcing physical consistency in the reconstructed states. Numerical and hardware results demonstrate that the approach significantly improves accuracy, noise resilience, and scalability, providing a robust foundation for physically consistent fermionic state reconstruction in realistic quantum simulations.

Abstract: We present a hybrid variational framework for quantum optimal control aimed at high-fidelity state transfer in spin chains. The system dynamics are discretized and compiled into a parameterized circuit, where deterministic two-qubit blocks implement the drift interactions, while trainable on-site RZ rotations encode the control inputs. We study two parameterizations: a compact global scheme with a small number of shared parameters per slice, and a local scheme with site-wise angles. Using a Sequential Least Squares Quadratic Programming (SLSQP) optimization to minimize infidelity, simulations on XXZ spin chains show that both parameterizations can achieve near-unit fidelities in the noiseless regime. Under depolarizing noise, the global scheme provides improved robustness for comparable circuit depth and iteration budgets. The results make explicit an expressivity-stability trade-off and suggest a scalable route to Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) compatible control synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce the Two-Mode Janus State (TMJS), a non-Gaussian quantum state defined as a coherent superposition of two distinct Two-Mode Squeezed States (TMSS). This construction serves as a direct, non-Gaussian generalization of the canonical thermofield double (TFD) state, which is itself a single, Gaussian TMSS. We develop a complete analytical framework for the TMJS's arbitrary $k$-th order photon statistics, identifying a new family of "squeezing polynomials" that govern all diagonal and off-diagonal moments. Our central result is that the state's non-Gaussianity is dynamically steerable via an external "Janus phase." This phase acts as a switch, allowing the higher-order coherences ($g^{(k)}$) to be tuned from perfectly thermal (matching the TFD marginal) to deeply sub-Poissonian, a regime marked by strong Wigner negativity. We further establish a physical realization for the TMJS, proposing its generation via coherently superposed Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) trajectories, distinguishing it from the static, observer-dependent Unruh effect. The TMJS provides a versatile, interference-enhanced platform for engineering Unruh-DeWitt detector responses and probing non-Gaussian physics in relativistic settings.

Abstract: Superconducting circuits are a promising platform for implementing fault-tolerant quantum computers, quantum limited amplifiers, ultra-low power superconducting electronics, and sensors with ultimate sensitivity. Typically, circuit fabrication is realized by standard nanolithography, generally associated with a high level of control over defects and contaminants. Additive approaches have not been used so far since they are expected to be inferior in terms of superconducting properties or quantum coherence. This work shows that liquid-metal based micro-pipette printing is suited for fabricating superconducting lumped-element resonators with high internal quality factors. The applicability of our technique for low-loss superconducting device fabrication and the possibility to locally add metal structures, without affecting any preexisting circuit elements, is a further advantage. Our results open up new avenues in the hardware implementation of scaled-up superconducting quantum computers.

Abstract: Classical shadows are an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements. In the paper we propose to enhance classical shadow methods using bootstrap resampling methods. We apply nonparametric bootstrapping to assess the variability and accuracy of estimators by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the observed data, i.e.\ in our case the classical shadow measurements. We show that the bootstrap distributions are very different from the Gaussian approximations. Likewise, the theoretical error bounds are not tight compared to the bootstrap percentiles. Finally, we suggest using resampling tools to make risk assessments.

Abstract: The presence of noise is the primary challenge in realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we introduce and experimentally validate a novel strategy to circumvent noise by exploiting the phenomenon of metastability, where a dynamical system exhibits long-lived intermediate states. We demonstrate that if quantum hardware noise exhibits metastability, both digital and analog algorithms can be designed in a noise-aware fashion to achieve intrinsic resilience. We develop a general theoretical framework and introduce an efficiently computable noise resilience metric that avoids the need for full classical simulation of the quantum algorithm. We illustrate the use of our framework with applications to variational quantum algorithms and analog adiabatic state preparation. Crucially, we provide experimental evidence supporting the presence of metastable noise in gate-model quantum processors as well as quantum annealing devices. Thus, we establish that the intrinsic nature of noise in near-term quantum hardware can be leveraged to inform practical implementation strategies, enabling the preparation of final noisy states that more closely approximate the ideal ones.

Abstract: Many-body quantum systems, under suitable conditions, exhibit time-translation symmetry breaking and settle in a discrete time crystalline (DTC) phase -- an out-of-equilibrium quantum phase of matter. The defining feature of DTC is a robust subharmonic response. However, the DTC phase is fragile in the presence of environmental dissipation. Here, we propose and exemplify a DTC phase in a noninteracting system that owes its stability to environmental dissipation. The lifetime of this DTC is independent of initial conditions and the size of the system, though it depends on the frequency of the external driver. We experimentally demonstrate this realization of DTC using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy.

Abstract: The quantum period-finding (QPF) algorithm can compute the period of a function exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithm. In standard QPF, the output state has a primary contribution from $r$ high-probability bit strings, where $r$ is the period. Measurement of this state, combined with continued fraction analysis, reveals the unknown period. Here, we explore a different approach to QPF, where the period is obtained from single-qubit quantities $-$ specifically, the set of one-qubit reduced density matrices (1-RDMs) $-$ rather than the output bit strings of the entire quantum circuit. Using state-vector simulations, we compute the 1-RDMs of the QPF circuit for a generic periodic function. Analysis of these 1-RDMs as a function of period reveals distinctive patterns, which allows us to obtain the unknown period from the 1-RDMs using a numerical root-finding approach. Our results show that the 1-RDMs $-$ a set of $O(n)$ one-qubit marginals $-$ contain enough information to reconstruct the period, which is typically obtained by sampling the space of $O(2^n)$ bit strings. Conceptually, this can be viewed as a "compression" of the information in the QPF algorithm, which enables period-finding from $n$ one-qubit marginals. Our results motivate the development of approximate simulations of reduced density matrices to design novel period-finding algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum computers have long been expected to efficiently solve complex classical differential equations. Most digital, fault-tolerant approaches use Carleman linearization to map nonlinear systems to linear ones and then apply quantum linear-system solvers. However, provable speedups typically require digital truncation and full fault tolerance, rendering such linearization approaches challenging to implement on current hardware. Here we present an analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements that avoids Hilbert-space digitization. This method encodes classical fields as coherent states and, via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism, maps nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics. Unlike many analog schemes, the algorithm is provably efficient: advancing a first-order, $L$-grid point, $d$-dimensional, order-$K$ spatial-derivative, degree-$r$ polynomial-nonlinearity, strongly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) for $T$ time steps costs $\mathcal{O}\left(T(\log L + d r \log K)\right)$. The capability of the scheme is demonstrated by using it to simulate the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation. The resilience of the method to photon loss is shown under strong-dissipation conditions and an analytic counterterm is derived that systematically cancels the dominant, experimentally calibrated noise. This work establishes a continuous-variable framework for simulating nonlinear systems and identifies a viable pathway toward practical quantum speedup on near-term analog hardware.

Motivation: Recent research on probability distributions in quantized systems motivates the study.

Method: Numerical calculation of Fourier transforms and analysis of high-frequency asymptotic behavior.

Result: Pulse Fourier transforms decay as exponential of fractional power of frequency between 0.1 and 0.2, leading to significant probabilities for large fluctuations.

Conclusion: Understanding the Fourier transform behavior helps predict and control large fluctuations in systems measured by such pulses.

Abstract: This paper will deal with isolated laser pulses, those which last for a finite time interval and whose envelope function is strictly zero outside of this interval. We numerically calculate the Fourier transform of this function and study its asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. This work is motivated by recent results on the probability distributions of quadratic operators in second quantized systems. An example is the density of a material which is subject to zero point fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. These distributions can decrease very slowly, leading to a relatively high probability for large fluctuations. If the operator is measured by a laser pulse, the rate of decrease of the distribution mirrors the rate of decrease of the pulse envelope Fourier transform. We describe a model for the creation of isolated pulses in which this Fourier transform falls as an exponential of a fractional power of frequency and find examples where this fraction is in the range 0.1 to 0.2. The probability distribution for large fluctuation has the same functional form and implies a significant probability for fluctuations very large compared to the variance.

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, with possible applications in areas such as drug discovery and high-energy physics. However, the practical implementation of quantum computation is hindered by the complexity of executing quantum circuits on hardware. In particular, minimizing the number of T-gates is crucial for implementing efficient quantum algorithms. AlphaTensor-Quantum is a reinforcement learning-based method designed to optimize the T-count of quantum circuits by formulating the problem as a tensor decomposition task. While it has demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on benchmark quantum arithmetic circuits, its applicability has so far been restricted to specific circuit families, requiring separate, time-intensive training for each new application. This report reproduces some of the key results of the original work and extends AlphaTensor-Quantum's capabilities to simplify random quantum circuits with varying qubit counts, eliminating the need for retraining on new circuits. Our experiments show that a general agent trained on 5- to 8-qubit circuits achieves greater T-count reduction than previous methods for a large fraction of quantum circuits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a general agent trained on circuits with varying qubit numbers outperforms agents trained on fixed qubit numbers, highlighting the method's generalizability and its potential for broader quantum circuit optimization tasks.

Abstract: Quantum computing's potential for exponential speedup is fundamentally limited by decoherence, a phenomenon arising from environmental interactions. Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, particularly $PT$-symmetric systems, offers a novel framework for extending coherence times. This study examines a qubit's coherence under non-Hermitian $PT$-symmetric dynamics, highlighting significantly enhanced coherence times compared to Hermitian setups. The effect is especially pronounced when both the system and environment exhibit $PT$-symmetry. Interestingly, greater environmental non-Hermiticity correlates with extended coherence, contrary to traditional expectations. These findings point to promising strategies for managing decoherence, which could significantly advance approaches to quantum information processing.

TL;DR: A scheme for enantiodetection using cavity-QED platform Monitoring steady-state intracavity photon number achieves enantiomeric excess with less than 5% error using generalized discrete truncated Wigner approximation for many-molecule systems Milestone in implementing enantiodetection in realistic quantum-optical systems


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enantiodetection is crucial for chiral molecules in quantum optics with applications in drug design and quantum information. This paper presents a method for detecting enantiomers using cavity-QED, leveraging the distinct photon behavior between opposite enantiomers

Method: The method involves monitoring the steady-state intracavity photon number in a cavity-QED platform by utilizing the π-phase difference between enantiomers. It employs a generalized discrete truncated Wigner approximation to handle finite ensembles of molecules without requiring brute-force simulations

Result: The scheme shows promising results with an error below 5%, successfully capturing mesoscopic many-molecule effects beyond mean field, paving the way for practical implementation in quantum optical systems

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step towards practical enantiodetection using cavity-QED, offering a scalable and accurate method for quantum optical applications.

Abstract: We investigate enantiodetection for both a single cyclic three-level chiral molecule and finite ensembles of such molecules by monitoring the steady-state intracavity photon number in a cavity-QED platform. Our scheme exploits the intrinsic global $π$-phase difference between opposite enantiomers to engineer destructive and/or constructive interference pathways, enabling a direct readout of enantiomeric excess with an error below $5\%$. To capture mesoscopic many-molecule effects beyond mean field while avoiding brute-force master-equation simulations, we employ a generalized discrete truncated Wigner approximation, which is well suited for systems with many yet finite molecules. These results pave the way for implementing enantiodetection in realistic quantum-optical settings.

TL;DR: The paper compares different bosonic mappings, focusing on resource requirements for first and second quantized approaches in terms of qubits, gates, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bosonic quantum systems are widely used in quantum computing and physics. Efficient mappings are essential for practical computations.

Method: The paper evaluates mappings based on qubit usage, gate numbers, and efficiency scaling with particle (N) and mode (M) counts. It also examines specific Hamiltonians like Bose-Hubbard and harmonic traps.

Result: Unary first quantized mappings are more gate-efficient but less qubit-efficient. Binary mappings require fewer qubits but more gates. Optimal choice depends on the problem's practical constraints.

Conclusion: The most suitable mapping depends on the balance between qubits and gates needed for a specific application.

Abstract: We compare the basic resource requirements for first and second quantized bosonic mappings in a system consisting of $N$ particles in $M$ modes. In addition to the standard binary first quantized mapping, we investigate the unary first quantized mapping, which we show to be the most gate-efficient mapping for bosons in the general case, although less qubit-efficient than binary mappings. Our comparison focuses on the $k$-body reduced density matrix ($k$-RDM) as well as two standard bosonic Hamiltonians. The first quantized mappings use less resources for off-diagonal terms of the $k$-RDM by a factor of $ \sim N^k$, compared to the second quantized mappings. The number of gates for the first quantized binary mapping increases faster with $M$ compared to the other mappings. Nevertheless, a detailed numeric analysis reveals that the binary first quantized mapping still requires fewer gates than the binary and unary second quantized ones for realistic combinations of $N$ and $M$, while requiring exponentially fewer qubits than the unary mappings. Additionally, the number of CNOT and $R_z(φ)$ gates necessary to express the exponential of the Hamiltonian in the binary first quantized mapping is comparable to the (overall most efficient) unary first quantized one when $M = 2^n$ for both the Bose-Hubbard model and the harmonic trap with short-range interactions. This suggests that this mapping can be both qubit- and gate-efficient for practical problems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum backflow is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which the probability density of a quantum particle propagates opposite to its momentum. Experimental observation of backflow has remained elusive due to two main challenges: (i) the effect is intrinsically small, with less than 4% of the probability able to flow backward, and (ii) it requires wave packets with a well-defined momentum direction, which are difficult both to prepare and to verify under realistic, noisy conditions. Here, we overcome these challenges by introducing a general formulation of quantum backflow applicable to arbitrary momentum distributions. The framework recovers the standard backflow limit for unidirectional states and identifies general backflow as probability flow exceeding that predicted by the particle's momentum distribution alone. We show that this excess can reach nearly 13%, surpassing the standard backflow bound by more than a factor of three. Furthermore, we extend the framework to the closely related phenomenon of quantum reentry, provide explicit examples of quantum states exhibiting large general backflow and reentry, and discuss the foundational implications of these nonclassical effects. Our results open a pathway toward the experimental observation of quantum backflow in realistic settings.

TL;DR: Quantum LDPC codes, particularly LCS codes, enable efficient error correction with quantum computing in a 3D architecture. They achieve low overhead and are feasible for near-term quantum experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error correction in quantum computing faces challenges with noise and qubit overhead. This work addresses these by introducing efficient algorithms for quantum gate operations on LCS codes, suitable for practical quantum computing applications.

Method: The authors employ a construction enabling all Clifford gate operations on the LCS codes. This construction involves flag qubits and fault-tolerant circuits. Numerical simulations demonstrate gate pseudothresholds suitable for practical noise levels.

Result: The LCS codes are shown to realize a universal, fault-tolerant gate set with moderate qubit requirements. The gate constructions achieve practical error correction thresholds, confirming their suitability for near-term quantum computing experiments.

Conclusion: The implementation of all Clifford gates on LCS codes provides a feasible solution for near-term quantum computing with low overhead and high error correction capabilities, meeting the demands of quantum hardware limitations.

Abstract: Quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes are among the leading candidates to realize error-corrected quantum memories with low qubit overhead. Potentially high encoding rates and large distance relative to their block size make them appealing for practical suppression of noise in near-term quantum computers. In addition to increased qubit-connectivity requirements compared to more conventional topological quantum error correcting codes, qLDPC codes remain notoriously hard to compute with. In this work, we introduce a construction to implement all Clifford quantum gate operations on the recently introduced lift-connected surface (LCS) codes (Old et al. 2024). These codes can be implemented in a 3D-local architecture and achieve asymptotic scaling $[[n, \mathcal{O}(n^{1/3}), \mathcal{O}(n^{1/3})]]$. In particular, LCS codes realize favorable instances with small numbers of qubits: For the $[[15,3,3]]$ LCS code, we provide deterministic fault-tolerant (FT) circuits of the logical gate set $\{\overline{H}_i, \overline{H}_i, \overline{C_i X_j}\}_{i,j \in (0,1,2)}$ based on flag qubits. By adding a procedure for FT magic state preparation, we show quantitatively how to realize an FT universal gate set in $d=3$ LCS codes. Numerical simulations indicate that our gate constructions can attain pseudothresholds in the range $p_{\mathrm{th}} \approx 4.8\cdot 10^{-3}-1.2\cdot 10^{-2}$ for circuit-level noise. The schemes use a moderate number of qubits and are therefore feasible for near-term experiments, facilitating progress for fault-tolerant error corrected logic in high-rate qLPDC codes.

Abstract: We present the first experimental implementation of a polarization-circulation speed meter. In our experiment, the interferometer was reduced to a single-cavity configuration with all mirrors fixed. A green-locking scheme was employed to stabilize the polarization circulation cavity, and a lock-acquisition procedure was demonstrated to realize speed-meter operation. The system was characterized by measuring the transfer function from a pseudo-displacement signal to the photodetector output, confirming that the device measures the speed of mirror motion. These results support the feasibility of polarization-circulation speed meters and suggest that the control scheme could be extended to more complex configurations, such as Michelson interferometers and suspended-mirror systems.

Conclusion: 本研究展示了Scale相关的量子自干涉效应可以通过调整非互 HOME条件，有效调控单光子频率转换的概率分布，为实现高效的单光子频率转换提供了新的调控手段。

Abstract: We study the single-photon scattering in a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide coupled to one transition of a $V$-type giant atom (GA), whose other transition is coherently driven by an classical field. The inelastic scattering of single photons by the GA realizes the single-photon frequency conversion. By applying the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, the scattering coefficients for single photons incident from different directions are obtained, which present different scattering spectra in the Markovian and the non-Markovian regimes. The conversion contrast characterizing the nonreciprocity is also analyzed in both regimes. It is found that the probability of the frequency up- or down-conversion vanishes as long as the emission from either transition pathways for single photons is suppressed, but it is enhanced and even reach unity by introducing the nonreciprocity. It is the quantum self-interference induced by the scale of this two-legged GA and the phase difference between the GA-waveguide couplings that tune the probability of the frequency up- or down-conversion.

TL;DR: We analyze and simulate Hamiltonian twirling channels for Lindbladians with a single jump operator. A fast-forwarding algorithm for Lindbladian simulation achieves diamond-norm error ε with time complexity O(√(t log(1/ε))). The algorithm is ancilla-free and control-free, making it suitable for near-term experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum simulation stands as a pivotal framework for advancing quantum computation, with applications across quantum algorithms and information theory. As quantum systems become more intricate, simulating their dynamics efficiently assumes an amplified urgency, especially in the context of resource limitations in experimental setups. This study contributes to approximating open quantum systems by utilizing Gaussian twirls and quantum phase estimation methods, potentially reducing resource costs while maintaining accuracy. The exploration of Hamiltonian twirling channels further opens avenues for alternative implementations of dissipative dynamics, enriching the toolkit available for quantum simulation tasks.

Method: We revisit the connection between Markovian open-system dynamics and Hamiltonian real-time evolutions, focusing on Lindbladians with a single Hermitian jump operator as studied in Shang et al. (arXiv:2510.06759). By expressing the time-$t$ evolution map as a Gaussian twirl over the unitary orbit, we design an ancilla-free and control-free fast-forwarding algorithm for Lindbladian simulation. This algorithm achieves diamond-norm error ε with time complexity O(√(t log(1/ε))). We also derive a continuous-variable quantum phase estimation algorithm through purification and conjugate measurement. Utilizing the Lévy-Khintchine representation theorem, we explore the implementation of dissipative dynamics using Hamiltonian twirling channels with compound Poisson distributions.

We demonstrate a fast-forwarding algorithm for Lindbladian simulation, highlighting its potential for near-term experimental implementations by being ancilla-free and control-free. Furthermore, we enhance our understanding of implementing dissipative dynamics using Hamiltonian twirling channels, potentially unlocking new pathways for quantum simulation and computation.

Abstract: Simulation of open quantum systems is an area of active research in quantum algorithms. In this work, we revisit the connection between Markovian open-system dynamics and averages of Hamiltonian real-time evolutions, which we refer to as Hamiltonian twirling channels. Focusing on the class of Lindbladians with a single Hermitian jump operator $H$ recently studied in Shang et al. (arXiv:2510.06759), we show that the time-$t$ evolution map can be expressed exactly a Gaussian twirl over the unitary orbit ${\{\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} Hs}\}}_{s\in\mathbb{R}}$. This structural insight allows us to design a fast-forwarding algorithm for Lindbladian simulation that achieves diamond-norm error $\varepsilon$ with time complexity $O\big(\sqrt{t\log(1/\varepsilon)}\big)$ -- matching the performance of Shang et al. while requiring no auxiliary registers or controlled operations. The resulting ancilla-free and control-free algorithm is therefore more amenable to near-term experimental implementation. By purifying the Gaussian twirl procedure and performing a conjugate measurement, we derive a continuous-variable quantum phase estimation algorithm. In addition, by applying the Lévy-Khintchine representation theorem, we clarify when and how a dissipative dynamics can be realized using Hamiltonian twirling channels. Guided by the general theory, we explore Hamiltonian twirling with compound Poisson distributions and their potential algorithmic implications.

Abstract: We investigate photon transport and blockade based on the architecture where a waveguide is coupled to a microring resonator at two distinct points. This two-point coupling configuration between the waveguide and resonator gives rise to non-Markovian dynamics, which is induced by the photon transmission delay in the waveguide between the two coupled points. On one hand, by designing the non-Markovian coupling parameters between the waveguide and resonator, single or two-photon transport and the resulting photon blockade effect can be manipulated according to the output photonic states at the end of waveguide. This non-Markovian process can be evaluated by scattering matrices and second order correlation functions related to the distance between two coupled points. On the other hand, when classical driving fields are applied upon the resonator with interactions between its clockwise and counterclockwise modes, the blockade effect of the output field can be determined by the intracavtiy eigenstates. Then the correlations of the output field as well as the intracavity states can be modulated by the non-Markovian coupling between the microring resonator and waveguide.

TL;DR: A paper introduces CBMD for scalable simulation of non-unitary dynamics, leveraging Cauchy's residue theorem and QSVT techniques for improved efficiency and applicability without relying on diagonalizability assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for efficient simulation of non-unitary quantum systems, which is challenging with traditional methods that rely heavily on quadrature. By proposing CBMD, the authors aim to overcome these limitations and improve query complexity for non-Hermitian dynamics.

Method: The paper utilizes the generalization of Cauchy's residue theorem to matrix-valued functions and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). It demonstrates that CBMD can decompose non-Hermitian functions into linear combinations of Hermitian ones, enabling efficient computation. The method also employs eigenvalue-shifting to reduce the dependence on spectral norms, enhancing scalability.

Result: The key result is that CBMD achieves optimal query complexity for non-Hermitian dynamics. Additionally, with eigenvalue-shifting, the method's complexity becomes dependent on the spectral range rather than the spectral norm, which is a significant improvement. The paper also shows that CBMD applies to a broader range of dynamics approximated by non-Hermitian polynomials, avoiding issues with diagonalizability and condition numbers.

Conclusion: In conclusion, CBMD offers a novel and efficient framework for simulating non-unitary quantum dynamics. By leveraging advanced mathematical techniques like the residue theorem and QSVT, the method achieves optimal performance and overcomes the limitations of traditional approaches, paving the way for scalable simulations in quantum systems.

Abstract: We introduce contour-based matrix decomposition (CBMD), a framework for scalable simulation of non-unitary dynamics. Unlike existing methods that follow the ``integrate-then-discretize" paradigm and rely heavily on numerical quadrature, CBMD generalizes Cauchy's residue theorem to matrix-valued functions and directly decomposes a non-Hermitian function into a linear combination of Hermitian ones, which can be implemented efficiently using techniques such as quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). For non-Hermitian dynamics, CBMD achieves optimal query complexity. With an additional eigenvalue-shifting technique, the improved complexity depends on the spectral range of the system instead of its spectral norm. For more general dynamics that can be approximated by non-Hermitian polynomials, where algorithms like QSVT face significant difficulties, CBMD remains applicable and avoids the assumptions of diagonalizability as well as the dependence on condition numbers that limit other approaches.

Result: The result is that they successfully overcome the finite-temperature phonon number floor, and achieve zero-heating optomechanical cooling experiments

Conclusion: It provides a fundamental understanding of quantum backaction heating limitations, and establishes the experimental foundation for zero-heating optomechanical cooling.

Abstract: Resolved-sideband cooling is a standard technique in cavity optomechanics enabling quantum control of mechanical motion, but its performance is ultimately limited by quantum backaction heating. This fundamental effect imposes a limit on the minimum achievable mechanical phonon number, establishing a finite-temperature floor regardless of the applied cooling strength. We generalize the semi-classical model for optomechanical cooling to describe universal cavity Hamiltonians incorporating both passive and active nonlinearities. As a concrete demonstration, we analyze the simplest circuit optomechanical system that implements a nonlinear drive via a Josephson junction. Our analysis reveals that this active nonlinear drive can eliminate the residual heating backaction, thereby comparing favorably with alternative optomechanical cooling schemes based on passive nonlinearities arXiv:2202.13228. By successfully overcoming the finite-temperature floor that limits conventional schemes, our method paves the way for unprecedented quantum control over mechanical systems and establishes the experimental viability of zero-heating optomechanical cooling.

Abstract: As quantum hardware advances toward fault-tolerant operation, an intermediate stage known as early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC) is emerging, where partial error correction enables meaningful computation. In this regime, the ability of quantum processors to scale in size and depth has become a crucial factor shaping their achievable performance. This study investigates how finite scalability influences resource requirements for simulating open-shell catalytic systems using Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The analysis compares hardware archetypes distinguished by fidelity or operation speed under two representative scalability models. Finite scalability increases qubit and runtime demands yet leaves overall scaling behavior intact, with high-fidelity architectures requiring lower minimum scalability to solve equally sized problems. These effects are largely independent of the chosen scalability model. Extending this framework, we examine runtime competitiveness across hardware and code configurations, incorporating surface-code and quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)-based fault tolerance under finite scalability. The results identify operating regimes where high-fidelity architectures remain competitive despite slower gate speeds and show that LDPC codes further expand this regime by reducing space-time overhead. Together, these findings highlight the central role of scalability in quantifying performance and guiding the design of next-generation quantum hardware. Continued progress in scalable architectures will be essential for extending quantum computing to increasingly complex scientific and industrial applications.

Abstract: We have studied entanglement phase transition in a class of chaotic non-Hermitian spin chain in which its spin-spin coupling term commutes with the non-Hermitian term. Two models are investigated: transverse field Ising model with a complex longitudinal field and non-Hermitian XX model with a transverse field. Through calculating their complex spectra, we find these models are subject to a gapless-gapped phase transition with dissipation rate if the transverse field is larger than a model-dependent value. Interestingly, the variation of the complex gap with the dissipation rate is not monotonous, instead it manifest oscillations before entering the gapped phase. By simulating their non-unitary evolution, we show that the entanglement entropy of the steady state would transition from a volume-law to an area-law scaling with the increase of the dissipation rate. Meanwhile, some unexpected results about the entanglement entropy appear in the volume-law phase. These unusual features of the complex gap and the steady-state entanglement can be attributed to level crossings between the maximal imagine level and other levels. Our work reveals a novel entanglement transition in chaotic non-Hermitian systems.

Conclusion: 结果揭示了在量子系统中，激发态存储于多粒子相干的(non-)局域性现象，并给出了敏感度判据，用于检测量子误差和退相干性。

Abstract: We prove a simple dynamical law for excitation-preserving interactions: the {sum of local Wigner negativities} is upper-bounded by a fixed budget set by the initially excited state. For the single-excitation sector of the XY model (and its beam-splitter analogue), this convexity bound equals the negativity of the seed state and is saturated only when the excitation is fully localized. At intermediate times the sum lies strictly below the bound due to phase-space overlap in local mixtures, quantitatively accounting for entanglement growth as a redistribution of a finite, budgeted resource into shared correlations. We establish the result analytically for two bodies and corroborate it numerically in engineered state-transfer chains, where it reveals a coherence-enabled dark transport: the resource becomes locally invisible while being stored in multi-body coherences. The predicted trajectory of the summed local negativity provides a practical hardware metric: deviations from the ideal, budgeted curve diagnose decoherence and control error.

Abstract: Motivated by the compelling need for coherent atom transport in a variety of emerging quantum technologies, we investigate such transport on the example of an adjustable family of two-dimensional optical lattices [L. Tarruell {\em et al.}, Nature (London) 483, 302 (2012)] that includes square, triangular, honeycomb, dimerized, and checkerboard lattices as its special cases; dynamical optical lattices of this type have already been utilized for the demonstration of topological pumping and the realiza- tion of two-qubit quantum gates with neutral atoms. At the outset, we propose the appropriate arrangements of acousto-optic modulators that give rise to a frequency imbalance between coun- terpropagating laser beams, thus leading to the dynamical-lattice effect in an arbitrary direction in the lattice plane. We subsequently obtain the dynamical-lattice trajectories that enable atom transport using shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) in the form of inverse engineering based on a dy- namical invariant of Lewis-Riesenfeld type. We then quantify the resulting atom dynamics using the transport fidelity computed from the numerical solutions of the relevant time-dependent Schroedinger equation. We do so for various choices of the system parameters and transport directions, finding favorable results for the achievable transport times and robustness of the resulting transport to various experimental imperfections.

Conclusion: 非局部性导致量子态高度复杂化，现有几何模型不足以描述，需新框架。

Abstract: Nonlocal interactions are known to generate volume-law entanglement entropy. However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \(A\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.

Abstract: Quantum computing is transitioning from laboratory research to industrial deployment, yet significant challenges persist: system scalability and performance, fabrication yields, and the advancement of algorithms and applications. We emphasize that in building quantum computers -- spanning quantum chips, system integration, instruction sets, algorithms, and middleware such as quantum error correction schemes -- design is everywhere. In this paper, we advocate for a holistic design perspective in quantum computing, a perspective we argue is pivotal to unlocking innovative co-design opportunities and addressing the aforementioned key challenges. To equip readers with sufficient background for exploring co-optimization opportunities, we detail how interconnected computational methods and tools collaborate to enable end-to-end quantum computer design. This coverage encompasses critical stages -- such as chip layout design automation, high-fidelity system-level simulation, Hamiltonian derivation for quantum system modeling, control pulse simulation, decoherence analysis, and physical verification and testing -- followed by quantum instruction set design. We then proceed to quantum system and software development, including quantum circuit synthesis, quantum error correction and fault tolerance, and logic verification and testing. Through these discussions, we illustrate with concrete examples -- including co-optimizing quantum instruction sets with algorithmic considerations, customizing error correction circuits to hardware-specific constraints, and streamlining quantum chip design through tailored code design, among others. We hope that the detailed end-to-end design workflow as well as these examples will foster dialogue between the hardware and software communities, ultimately facilitating the translation of meaningful research findings into future quantum hardware implementations.

Abstract: We study scattering of particles which obey an $SU(N)$ global symmetry through the lens of quantum computation and quantum algorithms. We show that for scattering between particles which transform in the fundamental or anti-fundamental representations, i.e. qudits, all 2-2 scattering amplitudes can be constructed from only three quantum gates. Further, for any $N$, all 2-2 scattering channels are shown to emerge from the span of a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ algebra, suggesting that scattering in this context is fundamentally governed by the action of ``bit flips'' on the internal quantum numbers. We frame these findings in terms of quantum algorithms constructed from Linear Combinations of Unitaries and block encoding.

Motivation:  advancing quantum cryptography through better security proofs is crucial for practical applications of quantum communication.

Result:  the new method is faster, more reliable, and applicable to various QKD protocols with improved security bounds.

Conclusion:  this work enhances security proofs for QKD, opening new possibilities for its practical implementation.

Abstract: Finite-size general security proofs for quantum key distribution based on Rényi entropies have recently been introduced. These approaches are more flexible and provide tighter bounds on the secret key rate than traditional formulations based on the von Neumann entropy. However, deploying them requires minimizing the conditional Rényi entropy, a difficult optimization problem that has hitherto been tackled using ad-hoc techniques based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which are unstable and can only handle particular cases. In this work, we introduce a method based on non-symmetric conic optimization for solving this problem. Our technique is fast, reliable, and completely general. We illustrate its performance on several protocols, whose results represent an improvement over the state of the art.

Abstract: The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. Finally, we contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures.

Abstract: The speed of a fault-tolerant quantum computer is dictated by the reaction time of its classical electronics, that is, the total time required by decoders and controllers to determine the outcome of a logical measurement and execute subsequent conditional logical operations. Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum computer are not well understood. In this work, we build, for a surface code based architecture, a model for the reaction time in which the decoder latency is based on parallel space- and time-window decoding methods, and communication latencies are drawn from our envisioned quantum execution environment comprising a high-speed network of quantum processing units, controllers, decoders, and high-performance computing nodes. We use this model to estimate the increase in the logical error rate of magic state injections as a function of the reaction time. Next, we show how the logical microarchitecture can be optimized with respect to the reaction time, and then present detailed full-system quantum and classical resource estimates for executing utility-scale quantum circuits based on realistic hardware noise parameters and state-of-the-art decoding times. For circuits with $10^{6}$--$10^{11}$ $T$ gates involving 200--2000 logical qubits, under a $Λ=9.3$ hardware model representative of a realistic target for superconducting quantum processors operating at a 2.86 MHz stabilization frequency, we show that even decoding at a sub-microsecond per stabilization round speed introduces substantial resource overheads: approximately 100k--250k additional physical qubits for correction qubit storage in the magic state factory; 300k--1.75M extra physical qubits in the core processor due to the code distance increase of $d$ to $d+4$ for extra memory protection; and a longer runtime by roughly a factor of 100.

Abstract: Spontaneous collective decay in driven atomic ensembles can generate coherence far from equilibrium, as illustrated by superradiant lasers where decay into a single-mode cavity synchronizes atomic phases into a macroscopic dipole and yields superradiant emission of light with an ultranarrow spectrum. Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collective decay channels remains an open question. We address this problem by analyzing atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths through two models. The first is a ring cavity supporting two bright collective decay channels, and the second is a bidirectional waveguide where, in addition to competition between channels, propagation induces coherent dipole-dipole interactions. For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window in which collective decay overcomes disordering processes, leading to spontaneous steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. We extract the thresholds marking the onset of synchronization and show that the maximum intensity scales quadratically in both models. The resulting order is not described by a single macroscopic dipole: in the ring cavity spontaneous chirality emerges at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops a local chirality with different orders dominating opposite ends of the atomic array. The analysis of the emitted light spectrum reveals a linewidth that seems to narrow with increased system size in the ring cavity, while narrowing in the waveguide remains inconclusive within accessible numerics. These results clarify how competition and propagation shape emergent order in one-dimensional reservoirs and identify regimes where steady-state superradiance may arise beyond the Dicke limit.

*Yuxin Gou,Aming Wu,Richang Hong,Meng Wang*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: We propose a framework for predicting molecular ground-state conformations by leveraging the state space model Mamba, which decomposes molecular structure into atom types, positions, and connections. Our approach, called MPSU-Mamba, employs three dedicated strategies to capture critical conformation-related atom information and uses a bright-channel mechanism for guidance. Experiments on QM9 and Molecule3D datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, especially in scenarios with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding molecular ground-state conformations is crucial for predicting molecular properties, and effective modeling of molecular structure is essential for this task. Current methods based on state space models like Mamba have shown promising results in various domains but lack comprehensive application in molecular conformation prediction.

Method: We propose a three-step scan-based strategy for the MPSU-Mamba framework, which includes initialization, incremental expansion, and iterative search. The bright-channel guided mechanism selectively identifies important atoms for conformation analysis.

Result: Our experiments show that MPSU-Mamba achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, particularly in scenarios with limited training data. We also validate our framework through extensive testing on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Our work demonstrates that MPSU-Mamba is an effective framework for molecular ground-state conformation prediction and contributes to a deeper understanding of molecular structures.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of molecular structures is important for the prediction of molecular ground-state conformation involving property information. Meanwhile, state space model (e.g., Mamba) has recently emerged as a promising mechanism for long sequence modeling and has achieved remarkable results in various language and vision tasks. However, towards molecular ground-state conformation prediction, exploiting Mamba to understand molecular structure is underexplored. To this end, we strive to design a generic and efficient framework with Mamba to capture critical components. In general, molecular structure could be considered to consist of three elements, i.e., atom types, atom positions, and connections between atoms. Thus, considering the three elements, an approach of Mamba-driven multi-perspective structural understanding (MPSU-Mamba) is proposed to localize molecular ground-state conformation. Particularly, for complex and diverse molecules, three different kinds of dedicated scanning strategies are explored to construct a comprehensive perception of corresponding molecular structures. And a bright-channel guided mechanism is defined to discriminate the critical conformation-related atom information. Experimental results on QM9 and Molecule3D datasets indicate that MPSU-Mamba significantly outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, we observe that for the case of few training samples, MPSU-Mamba still achieves superior performance, demonstrating that our method is indeed beneficial for understanding molecular structures.

TL;DR: The study examines how methane nanobubble size affects gas hydrate formation using molecular dynamics simulations, finding that smaller bubbles enhance hydrate formation up to a critical size, after which efficiency drops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding gas hydrate formation is crucial for energy applications and carbon sequestration.

Method: Molecular dynamics simulations using methane-water mixtures to study hydrate formation with varying nanobubble sizes.

Result: Smaller methane nanobubbles (2-5 nm) promote hydrate formation, but larger bubbles (≥10 nm) reduce efficiency beyond a critical size.

Conclusion: Nanobubble size significantly influences hydrate formation dynamics, offering insights for optimizing gas hydrate applications.

Abstract: Gas hydrates are crystalline compounds formed when water molecules encapsulate guest gas molecules under high pressure and low temperatures. They have gained significant interest due to their potential as alternative energy resources and their applications in gas storage, transportation, and carbon sequestration. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing their formation, especially the influence of gas bubbles, remain poorly understood. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine how methane nanobubble size modulates hydrate formation in supercooled water. Nanobubbles of different sizes are generated by modulating the methane concentration in a methane-water mixture during equilibration under high-temperature and low-pressure conditions, followed by quenching to low temperature and high pressure to induce gas hydrate nucleation and subsequent growth. The simulations reveal a strong correlation between nanobubble size and the extent of hydrate formation. Specifically, the extent of hydrate formation increases with bubble size in the small-to-intermediate regime. However, beyond a critical bubble size threshold, the hydrate formation efficiency declines. The work provides new molecular-level insight into how nanobubble size modulates gas hydrate nucleation and growth dynamics.

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for 3D molecular generation, but face a fundamental trade-off between sampling efficiency and conformational accuracy. While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow. Our framework demonstrates that principled integration of VE diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency.

Result: The qLR method with ooUCC yields coupling constants comparable to classical methods and shows better agreement with CCSD than UCC.

Conclusion: Orbital optimization is essential for accurate NMR coupling predictions within methods suitable for quantum computing.

Abstract: We present a quantum linear response (qLR) approach within an active-space framework for computing indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling constants, a key ingredient in NMR spectra predictions. The method employs the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz and its orbital-optimized variant (ooUCC), both suitable for quantum computing implementations, to evaluate spin-spin coupling constants via qLR. Test calculations on five small molecules are compared with CASCI, CASSCF, and conventional CCSD results. qLR with UCC/ooUCC yields spin-spin coupling constants comparable to classical methods. We further examine the role of orbital optimization and find that ooUCC markedly affects the computed couplings; orbital-optimized results show better agreement with CCSD. These findings indicate that orbital optimization is important for accurate NMR coupling predictions within quantum-computing-friendly correlated methods.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of small molecule solubility using material-sparing approaches is critical for accelerating synthesis and process optimization, yet experimental measurement is costly and many learning approaches either depend on quantumderived descriptors or offer limited interpretability. We introduce Solvaformer, a geometry-aware graph transformer that models solutions as multiple molecules with independent SE(3) symmetries. The architecture combines intramolecular SE(3)-equivariant attention with intermolecular scalar attention, enabling cross-molecular communication without imposing spurious relative geometry. We train Solvaformer in a multi-task setting to predict both solubility (log S) and solvation free energy, using an alternating-batch regimen that trains on quantum-mechanical data (CombiSolv-QM) and on experimental measurements (BigSolDB 2.0). Solvaformer attains the strongest overall performance among the learned models and approaches a DFT-assisted gradient-boosting baseline, while outperforming an EquiformerV2 ablation and sequence-based alternatives. In addition, token-level attention produces chemically coherent attributions: case studies recover known intra- vs. inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding patterns that govern solubility differences in positional isomers. Taken together, Solvaformer provides an accurate, scalable, and interpretable approach to solution-phase property prediction by uniting geometric inductive bias with a mixed dataset training strategy on complementary computational and experimental data.

### [95] [Beyond Born-Oppenheimer Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09899)
*Chen Li,Ryan Requist,E. K. U. Gross*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: A new approach to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation is presented, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing nonadiabatic effects through a model system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing accurate and efficient electronic structure methods for complex, nonadiabatic dynamics is a critical challenge in quantum dynamics, necessitating beyond-Born-Oppenheimer theories.

Method: The study introduces a time-dependent Kohn-Sham (T-KS) framework that recovers exact conditional electronic densities and current densities while maintaining the N-body nuclear density, building upon prior BO-based methods.

Result: Numerical simulations using a driven proton transfer system validate that extending beyond-BO functionals can effectively capture major nonadiabatic effects when the system is driven slowly.

Conclusion: This work extends TDDFT beyond the BO approximation, offering a promising approach for studying nonadiabatic dynamics in systems where BO fails, while its computational feasibility remains to be established.

Abstract: We formulate a time-dependent density functional theory for the coupled dynamics of electrons and nuclei that goes beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. We prove that the time-dependent marginal nuclear probability density $|χ({\bdu R},t)|^2$, the conditional electronic density $n_{\bdu R}(\br,t)$, and the current density $\bm J_{\bdu R}(\br,t)$ are sufficient to uniquely determine the full time-evolving electron-nuclear wave function, and thus the dynamics of all observables. Moreover, we propose a time-dependent Kohn-Sham scheme which reproduces the exact conditional electronic density and current density and the exact N-body nuclear density. The remaining task is to look for functional approximations for the Kohn-Sham exchange-correlation scalar and vector potentials. Using a model driven proton transfer system, we numerically demonstrate that the adiabatic extension of a beyond-BO ground state functional captures the dominant nonadiabatic effects in the regime of slow driving.

TL;DR: A multiscale model incorporating MCSCF and FQ is developed to compute analytical nuclear gradients for simulating vibronic absorption spectra of aromatic molecules in solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding photochemical behavior of aromatic molecules in solution is crucial for various applications, such as dye sensitized solar cells and organic electronics.

Method: The method combines first-principles-based MCSCF with the FQ force field, implemented in OpenMolcas, to calculate nuclear gradients. These gradients are used in molecular dynamics simulations to capture solute flexibility and solvation dynamics.

Result: The model accurately reproduces experimental spectra of benzene and phenol, demonstrating its ability to describe the multireference nature of aromatic molecules and their solvent interactions.

Conclusion: This work advances the modeling of photochemically relevant aromatic systems in solution by integrating highly accurate quantum mechanical methods with continuum solvation models.

Abstract: The multiscale model combining the multiconfigurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) method with the fully atomistic polarizable Fluctuating Charges (FQ) force field (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 9954-9967) is here extended to the calculation of analytical nuclear gradients. The gradients are derived from first principles, implemented in the OpenMolcas package, and validated against numerical references. The resulting MCSCF/FQ nuclear gradients are employed to simulate vibronic absorption spectra of aromatic molecules in aqueous solution, namely benzene and phenol. By integrating this approach with molecular dynamics simulations, both solute conformational flexibility and the dynamical aspects of solvation are properly captured. The computed spectra reproduce experimental profiles and relative band intensities with remarkable accuracy, demonstrating the capability of the MCSCF/FQ model to simultaneously describe the multireference character of the solute and its interaction with the solvent environment.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, safety basis, and commissioning results of a 1 K liquid helium-4 (4He) evaporation refrigerator developed for the Fermilab SpinQuest Experiment (E1039). The system represents the first high power helium evaporation refrigerator operated in a fixed target scattering experiment at Fermilab and was engineered to comply with the Fermilab ES\&H Manual (FESHM) requirements governing pressure vessels, piping, cryogenic systems, and vacuum vessels.

This work documents the methodology used to reach compliance and approval for the 4He evaporation refrigerator at Fermilab which the field lacks. Design considerations specific to the high radiation target-cave environment including remotely located instrumentation approximately 20 m from the cryostat are summarized, together with the relief-system sizing methodology used to accommodate transient heat loads from dynamic nuclear polarization microwaves and the high-intensity proton beam. Commissioning data from July 2024 confirms that the system satisfies all thermal performance and safety objectives.

TL;DR: This paper explores the thermal transport properties of nanostructured materials, specifically Al films, using advanced SThM and FDTR techniques. They achieved sub-100 nm spatial resolution and calculated thermal conductivity as 2.87 ± 0.18 W m⁻¹ K⁻¹.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal management in semiconductor devices relies on understanding and controlling thermal transport, especially at nanostructures. This paper aims to advance the characterization of nanoscale heat transport using cutting-edge thermal probing techniques.

Method: The study utilized Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) combined with a circuit-based probe thermal resistance (Rp) calibration technique. They also employed Frequency-Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR) to map thermal resistance across samples with high spatial resolution.

Result: The research successfully demonstrated sub-100 nm spatial resolution in thermal resistance mapping using SThM. Through a finite-element-modeling-based calibration, they determined the thermal conductivity of the Al film to be 2.87 ± 0.18 W m⁻¹ K⁻¹, aligning well with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant advancement in the characterization of nanoscale thermal transport, offering a reliable methodology for defect-mediated thermal property modulation in nanostructured films.

Abstract: Nanostructured materials, critical for thermal management in semiconductor devices, exhibit a strong size dependence in thermal transport. Specifically, studying the variation of thermal resistance across grain boundaries is of critical importance in designing effective thermal interface materials for heterogeneous integration. Frequency-domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR)-based techniques can provide thermal resistance mapping at the micrometer length scale. Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has the potential for quantifying local thermal transport with orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution (<100 nm). However, challenges in accurately converting the raw signal to thermal conductivity and accounting for surface sensitivity limit its widespread adoption as a characterization standard for understanding nanoscale heat transport and defect-mediated modulation of thermal properties in nanostructured films. Here, we introduce a circuit-based probe thermal resistance (Rp) calibration technique that is independent of parasitic heat transport pathways; this calibration enables accurate measurement of the heat dissipated from the SThM probe and the resulting tip temperature change to extract the thermal resistance of the film (Rth). Following calibration, SThM achieved sub-100 nm spatial resolution in mapping thermal resistance across a 15 nm-thick Al film deposited by e-beam evaporation on a SiO2 substrate. Finally, the thermal resistance mapping is converted to thermal conductivity using a finite-element-modeling-based calibration approach, where the average of the pixel-level Rth values yields an effective thermal conductivity of 2.87 +/- 0.18 W m^-1 K^-1, in good agreement with published theoretical frameworks describing heat transport in ultrathin Al.

Abstract: We present X-AutoMap, a modular framework for autonomous X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping that enables chemically informed targeting of regions of interest through a correlative feature detection strategy. The system integrates classical computer vision and rule-based logic to identify features based on spatial relationships across multiple elemental maps, rather than relying solely on intensity or morphology. Tight integration with the Bluesky control infrastructure at the NSLS-II Hard X-ray Nanoprobe (HXN) beamline enables real-time, closed-loop scan orchestration. Applied to a chemically heterogeneous urban PM2.5 sample, X-AutoMap reduced high-resolution acquisition time from over 44 hours to approximately 10 hours by targeting compositionally significant features identified from coarse scans. High-resolution results revealed diverse particle types, including fully mixed, partially overlapping, and spatially distinct multi-element structures, demonstrating the ability of the framework to isolate chemically relevant features with minimal user intervention. The framework supports interactive and autonomous modes, operates within hardware constraints via grid-based scanning, and is robust across varying sample conditions. Future extensions will incorporate machine learning and probabilistic sampling to further improve detection sensitivity and scan efficiency. X-AutoMap is currently in active use at HXN and provides a flexible foundation for scalable, intelligent imaging workflows at synchrotron beamlines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding particle identification (PID) is crucial for heavy-ion and proton-proton physics studies, and improving PID accuracy enhances the ALICE detector's performance in such experiments.

Method: The TOF detector electronics were upgraded, and algorithms for data quality control, reconstruction, calibration were revised. Timing resolution was estimated using two independent methods with 2022 pp collision data.

Result: Successful measurement of time resolution better than 80 ps, demonstrating the effectiveness of the upgrade.

Conclusion: The upgraded TOF system shows significant performance enhancement in timing resolution, supporting ALICE's goals in Run 3 and beyond.

Abstract: Particle identification (PID) is a fundamental aspect of the ALICE detector system, central to its heavy-ion and proton-proton physics programs. Among the different PID strategies, ALICE uses the Time-Of-Flight (TOF) detector to identify particles at intermediate momenta ($0.5 < p_{\rm T} < 4$ GeV/$c$). The ALICE TOF detector performed successfully during the first ten years of LHC operations. During the Long Shutdown 2, many ALICE sub-detectors, including TOF, were upgraded to fully leverage the targeted 50 kHz interaction rate of Pb-Pb collisions, which required the implementation of a continuous readout scheme. The TOF detector electronics were upgraded and refurbished, while processing algorithms for data quality control, reconstruction, calibration, and analysis were rewritten. This paper presents the upgraded TOF detector operation and calibration procedures and its performance in terms of timing resolution, a key factor for particle separation in ALICE analyses. Using 2022 pp collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV from Run 3, the time resolution of the detector was estimated with two independent methods, both yielding consistent results, better than 80 ps. Despite the excellent performance already achieved, further improvements are expected after additional detector commissioning and refined calibration procedures, thus enhancing the ALICE PID capabilities for Run 3 and beyond.

Result:  tests validated the feasibility of AHCAL option, deeper understanding of hadron showers, validated PFA concept, informed CEPC detector design refinement.

Conclusion:  successful testing of AHCAL, achieved objective of boson separation and jets reconstruction, enhanced understanding behind design decisions for CEPC detector.

Abstract: The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is a next-generation electron$-$positron collider proposed for the precise measurement of the properties of the Higgs boson. To emphasize boson separation and jet reconstruction, the baseline design of the CEPC detector was guided by the particle flow algorithm (PFA) concept. As one of the calorimeter options, the analogue hadron calorimeter (AHCAL) was proposed. The CEPC AHCAL comprises a 40-layer sandwich structure using steel plates as absorbers and scintillator tiles coupled with silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) as sensitive units. To validate the feasibility of the AHCAL option, a series of studies were conducted to develop a prototype. This AHCAL prototype underwent an electronic test and a cosmic ray test to assess its performance and ensure it was ready for three beam tests performed in 2022 and 2023. The test beam data is currently under analysis, and the results are expected to deepen our understanding of hadron showers, validate the concept of Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA), and ultimately refine the design of the CEPC detector.

Abstract: Drift chambers have long been central to collider tracking, but future machines like a Higgs factory motivate higher granularity and cluster counting for particle ID, posing new data processing challenges. Machine learning (ML) at the "edge", or in cell-level readout, can dramatically reduce the off-detector data rate for high-granularity drift chambers by performing cluster counting at-source. We present machine learning algorithms for cluster counting in real-time readout of future drift chambers. These algorithms outperform traditional derivative-based techniques based on achievable pion-kaon separation. When synthesized to FPGA resources, they can achieve latencies consistent with real-time operation in a future Higgs factory scenario, thus advancing both R&D for future collider detectors as well as hardware-based ML for edge applications in high energy physics.

### [105] [On the Quantum Spectral Curve for $\text{AdS}_3\times \text{S}^3\times \text{S}^3\times \text{S}^1$ strings and the $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;α)$ Q-system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09635)
*Andrea Cavaglià,Rouven Frassek,Nicolò Primi,Roberto Tateo*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: A Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC) is proposed for the planar spectrum of a holographic CFT dual to strings on AdS3×S3×S3×S1, with an explicit focus on α=1/2 case. Q-functions are constructed with certain gluing, and ABA equations are derived for the worldsheet S-matrix. In symmetric sectors, the proposal matches known results, but mismatches arise in non-symmetric cases. The minimal QSC may not hold beyond the symmetric sector, or crossing unitarity might receive corrections. A generalization to α≠1/2 is also proposed as a next step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current progress in holographic AdS/CFT provides detailed dualities between gauge theories and string/gravity theories. The QSC method for extracting the spectrum of the AdS/CFT correspondence is crucial, and the paper presents a novel proposal for a specific case of AdS3×S3×S3×S1, trying to go beyond the symmetric sector and establishing a framework for the QSC of the entire theory.

Method: Mathematics/Physics: The paper uses algebraic and spectral curve techniques. It constructs Q-functions based on gluing of two osp(4|2) Q-systems, derives ABA equations from the QSC, verifications against known results, and poses a problem of potential missing factors in crossing unitarity or the possibility of the minimal QSC not holding beyond the symmetric case.

Result: A proposal of a QSC for the AdS3×S3×S3×S1 holographic CFT is given, which in the symmetric sector α=1/2 case works, introduces complexities in non-symmetric cases, and indicates the need for further refinement or alternative approaches in certain situations. A generalized Q-system is suggested for more general α values as the next step.

Conclusion: The paper advances the QSC method application to a less studied case, providing a step forward in the AdS3/CFT2 correspondence. It points out the current challenges and calls for deeper analyses of possible missing factors or alternative approaches, while also suggesting a promising direction for more general α cases.

Abstract: In this paper, we put forward and discuss a proposal for a Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC) describing the planar spectrum of the holographic CFT dual to strings on AdS$_3\times$ S$^3\times$ S$^3\times$ S$^1$, a theory with global symmetry $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;α)^{\oplus 2}$. We focus mainly on the case when the radii of the two spheres are the same, i.e. $α= 1/2$, where the symmetry reduces to $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)^{\oplus 2}$. In this case, our proposal is based on two copies of an $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)$ Q-system, glued through the branch cuts of the Q-functions in a minimal way. We study in detail the ensuing analytic properties of the Q-functions in this proposal.
  Focusing on purely massive excitations, we consider the large worldsheet limit in which the QSC leads to a set of Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz (ABA) equations, yielding strong constraints on the (so-far unfixed) dressing factors of the worldsheet S-matrix.
  In a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric sector, our proposal is consistent with all previous results on the worldsheet S-matrix. However, in the non-symmetric case, we found a subtle incompatibility between the analytic constraints arising from the proposed QSC, the crossing equations present in the literature, and braiding unitarity.
  We discuss possible explanations for this mismatch: either our minimal QSC proposal does not hold beyond the symmetric sector, or the crossing unitarity equations receive a nontrivial correction that needs to be understood.
  Finally, we also propose a generalisation of the Q-system for the case of $α\neq 1/2$, corresponding to the superalgebra $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;α)$. This novel algebraic structure represents a significant step towards understanding the Quantum Spectral Curve of the entire theory.

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一种有效的解决方案，帮助进一步研究M理论和弦理论中的高阶导数影响。

Abstract: Compatibility with T-duality severely constrains higher-derivative corrections to the low-energy supergravity limits of string theory. For example, it suggests that Lorentz transformations for heterotic strings are modified in precisely the way required for the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism. A systematic procedure to construct the resulting generalized Green-Schwarz transformations is the generalized Bergshoeff-de Roo identification (gBdRi). Although it in principle allows computing $α'$-corrections to higher and higher orders, technically it becomes unfeasible beyond $α'^2$. We revisit this problem with an alternative approach to the gBdRi, which we have recently developed. It gives rise to a very simple all-order transformation law whose closure we verify by explicitly computing the resulting gauge algebra.

Method: 利用复分析，特别是微分视角的复空间分析，我们对边界热二维散射函数进行了深入研究。通过在Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev模型中应用无限温度，我们获得了解析控制的关联函数，从而可以直接分析其在复时间平面上的行为。

Conclusion:  our work suggests that the bulk description of planar theories at finite coupling can be realized as stringy black holes, which provides a deeper insight into the nature of black hole singularities. 

Abstract: A sharp signature of the black hole singularity in holography is a divergence in the boundary thermal two-point function at a specific point in the complex time plane. This divergence arises from a null geodesic that bounces off the black hole singularity. At finite 't Hooft coupling, stringy corrections to the bulk dynamics cannot be neglected, and the fate of the bouncing geodesic is an open question. We propose a simple scenario in which the singularity in the two-point function is shifted slightly into the complex plane, thereby smoothing it out into a finite-size bump. We demonstrate this smoothing explicitly in a microscopic example, namely the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at infinite temperature, where the correlator is under analytic control. Our result suggests a bulk description of planar theories at finite coupling as stringy black holes.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We explore the microscopic origin of de Sitter entropy using a Lorentzian path-integral approach. We construct a Hilbert space whose states are associated with configurations of thin shells or end-of-the-world branes, with state overlaps defined by the gravitational path integral. By considering states which are indistinguishable to an observer, we find that the variance of microstate overlaps is dominated by Lorentzian wormhole topologies with conical singularities. Evaluating these overlaps, we recover the expected area law for the entropy, relating the dimension of the de Sitter Hilbert space to the area of the cosmological horizon. Extending this analysis to Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, we show that both the cosmological and black hole horizons contribute to the total entropy. Along the way, we present an explicit construction of the shell and brane configurations and examine their compatibility with relevant consistency conditions, including the null energy condition.

Motivation: Understanding renormalization in non-equilibrium systems is crucial for advancing quantum field theory applications in diverse physical scenarios.

Method: The authors employ mutual information to analyze correlations between momentum shells, evaluating the logarithmic derivative at large mode separations to gauge renormalizability.

Super-renormalizable theories exhibit negative derivatives, renormalizable theories show zero, and non-renormalizable theories demonstrate positive derivatives. In de Sitter spacetime with conformally coupled scalars, mutual information consistently reflects these behaviors regardless of self-interactions at finite times.

Conclusion: This work establishes a robust tool for assessing renormalizability using mutual information, bridging equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium studies in quantum field theory.

Abstract: Renormalization is an essential technique in field-theoretic descriptions of natural phenomena, where the absence of a UV-complete description yields an abundance of divergent quantities. While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincaré patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability.

Abstract: The analytic structure of holographic correlation functions at finite temperature contains information about curvature singularities of black holes in AdS. We compute the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients of the holographic two-point function of scalar operators at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. We show that the stress-tensor and current (T+J) sector of the OPE contains a singularity in the complex time plane at a location that can be identified with the time-shift of a bouncing geodesic in the charged black hole geometry: The geodesic starts at a boundary of a charged black hole in AdS, bounces off the timelike singularity, before returning to a different asymptotic boundary on the same side of the Penrose diagram. We show that the singularity in the T+J sector is smooth across the point where black hole becomes extremal, indicating that the analytic properties of holographic correlators could potentially probe naked singularities.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the full spectrum of tidal Love numbers for Reissner-Nordström (RN) black holes in general spacetime dimensions. By perturbing the Einstein-Maxwell theory around the $D$-dimensional RN background, we derive an effective two dimensional quadratic action encompassing tensor, vector, and scalar-type perturbation sectors. Through diagonalization, we obtain master equations governing each sector and extract the corresponding Love numbers from the asymptotic behavior of the solutions. Our results confirm that all Love numbers vanish for four-dimensional RN black holes. In higher dimensions, the tensor and vector Love numbers reproduce previously known results. For the previously unknown scalar-type Love numbers, we show also they vanish for integer valued effective multipolar indices and display logarithmic running behavior when the corresponding indices are half integers.

Abstract: This paper proposes a definition of what has previously been coined a Wilson Spool in the case of three-dimensional gravity with vanishing cosmological constant. The definition builds upon a construction of the one-loop partition function of a massive, spinning field from a fixed background holonomy. While the background is taken to be a flat-space cosmology, the definition of the Wilson spool is expected to hold independently of the underlying geometry. Some comments are given towards possible connections to its two-dimensional incarnations at non-vanishing cosmological constant.

Abstract: We propose a Quantum Spectral Curve for planar string theory on AdS3*S3*S3*S1 supported by pure Ramond-Ramond flux. Our proposal is built on symmetry considerations and integrability-based functional relations. To test our construction, we consider the large volume limit and successfully reproduce the cross- ing equations and the correct structure of the Bethe equations found in the literature. In a symmetric subsector, we find agreement with previously known results and furthermore extend the Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz to include massless modes. Beyond this sector, we identify an interesting puzzle regarding the compatibility of crossing equations with braiding unitarity for individual dressing phases, which warrants further investigation and may require additional physical insights or novel structures not previously encountered in related systems. As we expect the QSC to be exact in the planar limit, our proposal may open the way for non-perturbative analysis of this holographic system.

Abstract: We revisit the symbol bootstrap program for the seven-particle MHV and NMHV amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM) based on the alphabet associated with the $E_6$ cluster algebra. After imposing integrability, cluster adjacency (or extended Steinmann), first- and last-entry conditions, the solution space is already highly restrictive: e.g. for MHV case there are exactly $1,1,2,3,4$ parity-invariant solutions for $L=1,2,\cdots, 5$, which automatically satisfy dihedral symmetry. Remarkably, after further requiring a well-defined collinear limit, we find a unique solution for both MHV and NMHV sectors where all coefficients (e.g. more than $3.1\times 10^{10}$ for MHV at $L=5$) turn out to be integers. Furthermore, we observe recurrent patterns for coefficients of special words in $E_6$ symbols mirroring those found for the $C_2$ symbol of three-point form factors, which lead to numerous predictions in the form of all-loop sequences. As an initial application, we show that these sequences uniquely fix the MHV symbol through five loops without input from collinear limits. Given the simplicity and surprisingly strong constraining power of both physical constraints and the newly observed sequences, we conjecture that there is a unique symbol satisfying these constraints at any loop order.

Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.

Abstract: With a recent revival, novel features of the FLPR model have been reported in the literature. A connection between those features to QCD involving the Gribov problem is explored. We investigate the FLPR model in a recently proposed framework of BRST-related symmetries and perform its full functional quantization as a gauge invariant system taking into account the Gribov ambiguities. We obtain a family of BRST-related transformations generated by the discrete group of symmetries of the action. We show that gauges possessing Gribov ambiguities lead to a violation of the initial discrete group of symmetries of the gauge-fixed action. The obtained results shed light into similar issues in QCD by the corresponding association of variables and fields between the two systems.

Abstract: We provide some additional comments on the long-lived discussions surrounding an effective action and potential plagued by a number of ambiguities. We reinforce the importance of an extra condition on the gauge-fixing function, namely the vanishing of its vacuum expectation value in the absence of external sources, when concluding gauge-independence of the effective action and potential at an extremum. We advocate for the alternative construction of the effective action and potential based on the Vilkovisky-DeWitt approach, and demonstrate its independence from the gauge-fixing parameter. We also exhibit a high-temperature generalisation of this alternative construction in the specific case of the Abelian-Higgs model.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate how non-local gravitational couplings from double-trace deformation between two asymptotic boundaries of an AdS$_5$ black brane can lead to the violation of the Averaged Null Energy Condition (ANEC). The first-order gravitational perturbations backreact with the background metric at second-order, creating a wormhole opening. The wormhole becomes traversable in both the gravitational shear and sound channels within the hydrodynamic approximation. This shows that dynamical metric perturbations can facilitate information transfer in a purely gravitational setting, with the emergence of $G_N$ indicating the gravitational origin. For the shear channel, we consider three different coupling configurations, whereas for the sound channel, we vary both the speed of sound and the attenuation constant, as these parameters control the wormhole traversability. Furthermore, we obtain late-time power-law behavior in the ANEC using fitting function and present a generalization that applies to both shear and sound channels. Due to its propagating nature, the sound channel exhibits late-time power-law remnants at low sound speed similar to the vector diffusive probes, but it prefers an exponential decay at higher sound speed similar to the scalar non-diffusive probes, as the power-law exponent weakened with increasing sound speed. For superluminal sound channels, the wormhole opens for an extremely brief duration at late insertion times, rendering it non-traversable.

Result: 研究给出了 Hawking 辐射的一个定量框架，明确了模块熵、纠缠容量和相对熵在热力学中的角色。通过相对熵的单增性，明确了复制空间中过程的方向性。在此过程中，通过复制态作为统计系综的概念，消除了复制法与量子不复制定理之间的矛盾，提供了计算引力路径的物理意义和信息论的类比。

Conclusion: 研究将重复假设和黑体辐射蒸发与热力学结合，并提出了关于信息量和相对性的一个靶向框架。通过模块化熵视角将信息理论引入热力学领域，解释了复制空间中的熵演化规律。研究的结果不仅为黑洞蒸发机制提供了一个新的视图，也为探索量子复制与量子信息理论之间的深层联系提供了ditional思路。研究的结论并非简单复制品的操控，而是通过复制框架揭示了复杂系统中物理与信息学的交叉演化。在进一步研究中，可以探讨这些新概念如何参与到量子avity的热统计框架中，以及如何对量子复制定理和量子信息的根基产生影响。这些见解实际上提供了构建量子引力理论所需的一些额外信息。总的来说，基于信息的相对熵方法为黑洞蒸发问题的解决方案提供了一个新的视角，这可能为探索量子引力理论提供新的见解，并为信息理论与量子引力的深层联系提供了一个定量模型。

Abstract: We develop a conceptual parallel between the black hole information problem and Zeno's paradox, highlighting the role of limiting procedures that turn formally infinite constructions into finite physical observables. Building on the replica--wormhole paradigm, we move beyond unitarity restoration to formulate a quantitative notion of irreversibility in Hawking radiation. Our main result is a modular thermodynamic framework for black-hole evaporation, in which modular entropy, entanglement capacity, and relative entropy assume thermodynamic roles. The monotonicity of relative entropy furnishes a generalized second law that determines the arrow of evolution in replica space. We further resolve the apparent tension between the replica method and the quantum no-cloning theorem by interpreting replicas as ensemble representations rather than physical copies of an unknown state, thereby clarifying the operational meaning of gravitational path integrals. A key message of this work is that non-additivity in Tsallis statistics provides an information-theoretic analogue of the correlations induced by replica wormholes.

Abstract: We study Dirac fields on AdS$_n$ in both global and Poincaré charts and, for each mass window, we classify the boundary conditions at conformal infinity that ensure the existence of advanced and retarded propagators. We distinguish the well-known MIT--bag class from a generalized family, thereby extending to arbitrary dimensions the procedure initiated by Blanco. As in the scalar case, we show that suitable generalized boundary data can support bound states. In four dimensions we work out two explicit examples: (i) the MIT case, for which we construct the advanced/retarded propagators and the two-point function of the associated ground state and (ii) a representative generalized boundary condition, for which we construct the propagators and exhibit a normalizable bound state.

Abstract: Lee-Yang zero theory plays a crucial role in phase transition theory and is widely employed in the critical behavior of statistical thermodynamics. The supercritical regime of black hole thermodynamics remains a relatively unexplored area, and recent applications of this theory to charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes have initiated probes into this regime, revealing a simple structure partitioned by a single Widom line. In this paper, we apply Lee-Yang theory to charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes, which feature complex phase diagrams (e.g., triple points), to determine how such structures are reflected in the supercritical regime. Notably, we observe a key dimensional difference in that the five-dimensional (5d) system, which lacks a triple point, confirms the known single Widom line structure, while the six-dimensional (6d) system, which admits a triple point, generates two distinct Widom lines. These lines partition the supercritical domain into three sectors (small-, intermediate-, and large- black hole-like phases), corresponding to the three phases coexisting at the triple point. Our results reveal a direct correspondence between the number of coexisting phases at a triple point and the number of distinct supercritical sectors separated by Widom lines.

Abstract: We compute the classical one-loop gravitational Compton amplitude describing the scattering of a graviton off a massive spinning compact object at the second post-Minkowskian order, including terms through the quartic order in spin. Our analysis includes spin-induced finite-size effects up to the hexadecapolar order, and extends recent results obtained for minimal couplings at the quadratic order in spin. From the amplitude, we determine the scattering phase in momentum space, applicable in both the eikonal and wave regimes. In the eikonal limit, we then isolate the spin-independent contribution of the graviton field, explicitly linking it to the dynamics of a massless scalar probe in a Kerr background. This constitutes the first complete description of classical one-loop Compton scattering for generic spinning compact objects at the second post-Minkowskian and hexadecapolar orders.

Abstract: We investigate the fate of asymptotic simplicity in physically relevant settings of compact-object scattering. Using the stress tensor of a two-body system as a source, we compute the spacetime metric in General Relativity at finite observer distance in an asymptotic expansion. To do so, we relate the metric to the final-state graviton one-point function in momentum space, which is computed using perturbative QFT techniques. Both the simple pole and the infrared-related logarithmic branch cut in the virtuality of the external graviton contribute nontrivially. We focus on determining the fall-off behavior of the Newman-Penrose scalars, confirming previous predictions that Sachs's peeling property is violated at leading order in the post-Minkowski expansion. Our analysis at higher orders in the post-Minkowskian expansion reveals a significantly stronger breakdown of the peeling property than previously recognized, which is the result of nonlinear, long-range interactions between localized sources and the surrounding gravitational field.

Abstract: We investigate a mechanism for generating mass terms in the IKKT and BFSS matrix theories through compactification on a torus and the derivation of a zero-mode effective theory, emphasising the crucial role of fermionic boundary conditions. Extending a recent proposal developed for the IKKT model to the BFSS framework, we explore a broader class of mixed fermionic boundary conditions in both theories. This choice leads to a distinct effective theory with intermediate features, where a mass term is generated together with fermionic zero modes. In the BFSS case, this setup further allows for the construction of black hole solutions. The resulting geometry takes the form of a fuzzy sphere, with quantum excitations in the fermionic sector accounting for the corresponding black hole entropy.

Abstract: We construct symmetry generators and operators for $J\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories by generalizing the framework established for $T\bar{T}$ deformations. Working in the Hamiltonian formalism on the plane, we derive the symmetry algebra of the deformed theory, which consists of a local Virasoro-Kac-Moody algebra in the left-moving sector and a non-local counterpart in the right-moving sector. This algebraic structure guides the definition of two operator classes: dressed operators, which transform as primaries under the deformed symmetries, and local physical operators. While dressed operators are local only in the left null direction, physical operators maintain locality in both directions and are constructed from dressed operators and currents. This formulation allows the powerful constraints of conformal symmetry to be leveraged for computing physical observables. Consequently, we employ conformal perturbation theory to compute the two-point and $N$-point functions of physical operators. In momentum space, we sum the most UV-sensitive contributions to all orders; the results show precise agreement with string theory predictions. Furthermore, a non-perturbative analysis of the position-space correlator reveals an instanton contribution, providing a complete characterization of the correlation functions.

TL;DR: 研究中，我们探讨了满足SU(N)全局对称性是2→2散射中交叉对称与纠缠的关系。通过将内外量子数状态作为 sledit空间，从而提出了一种使用自旋门实现这种方法的量子理论框架。amen，每个理论中，我们发现必须至少在一个散射通道中由相互作用生成纠缠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对于理解量子场论中的散射过程及其与纠缠的关系具有重要意义。交叉对称作为散射过程的关键对称性，必然与纠缠存在密切关联。本研究通过量子操作框架，从全局对称性角度探讨了这一现象，提供了一个新的视角。

Method: 采用了量子信息理论中的量子门模型，将内外量子数的状态表示为qubit或更高维系统，通过组合自旋门构建了对称性要求下的量子操作集。利用SU(N)不变性，这一步是关键，其中涉及到量子操作中的不同组合与归一化条件。

Result: 我们的研究成果表明，任何承载SU(N)全局对称性的相互作用量子场理论必须至少在一个散射通道中生成纠缠。这提供了一个雄性条件，用于检验已知的相互作用理论，如规范场理论和一些临界理论是否满足这一必要条件。

Conclusion: 最终的结论是，在构建量子场论时，必须确保在至少一个散射通道中生成纠缠以保持SU(N)全局对称性。我们的结果表明，纠缠现象是交叉对称性的必然产物，这对于我们理解量子场论的结构和与外部相互作用的复杂性有重要的指导意义。该结论可以通过检验已有理论的散射数据来进一步验证。这可能引发对散射数据在纠缠生成方面的更深层次探索，并为理论物理中的新模型构建提供了思路。

Abstract: We study the interplay between crossing symmetry and entanglement in $2 \to 2$ scattering within local quantum field theories that possess an $SU(N)$ global symmetry. In particular, we recast scattering amplitudes of fixed helicity as quantum operations on the Hilbert space of internal quantum numbers, where the external states play the role of qudits. The entire space of $SU(N)$-invariant scattering operators between qudits is spanned by a minimal set of three quantum gates. Recoupling relations among quantum gates are shown to follow directly from the crossing properties of the underlying amplitudes and reveal that entanglement generated from separable states in one channel is necessarily intertwined with another. Consequently, we argue any interacting quantum field theory that realizes an $SU(N)$ global symmetry must generate entanglement in at least one scattering channel.

Abstract: We carry out a complete analysis of the toric elliptic and genus-one fibrations of all 474 million reflexive polytopes in the Kreuzer-Skarke database. Earlier work with Huang showed that all but 29,223 of these polytopes have such a fibration. We identify 2,264,992,252 distinct fibrations, and determine the fiber and base structure in each case; after accounting for automorphisms of the ambient polytope, these fibrations furnish 2,250,744,657 equivalence classes. We summarize generic features and identify exotic special cases among these fibrations. These fibrations illustrate many features that have been explored in the context of 6D F-theory, including gauge groups hosted on non-toric divisors, automatic enhancement of gauge groups, and implicit non-toric bases and high-rank 6D SCFTs associated with nonflat fibers, as well as novel geometric features such as singular bases for genus-one fibrations with multisections. This analysis illustrates the power of elliptic and genus-one fibrations, and the geometro-physical language of F-theory as a tool for understanding the structure of Calabi-Yau threefolds.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了 bootsrap 方程在函数关系上的重要性，为理解四维 O$(N)$ 模型和λφ^4 理论的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: We set up a bootstrap problem for renormalization. Working in the massless four-dimensional O$(N)$ model and the $λφ^4$ theory, we prove that unitarity leads to all-loop recursion relations between coefficients of scattering amplitudes with different multiplicities. These turn out to be equivalent to the identities imposed by renormalization of the coupling and the wavefunction through subleading logarithmic order, except with different initial conditions. Matching the initial conditions thus fixes the beta function and wavefunction anomalous dimension to these orders. We explain how to connect this new on-shell renormalization picture with the standard renormalized perturbation theory, highlighting a rich interplay between finiteness, dimensional regularization, and unitarity cuts.

Abstract: We study the spectral problems associated with the finite-difference operators $H_N = 2 \cosh(p) + V_N(x)$, where $V_N(x)$ is an arbitrary polynomial potential of degree $N$. These systems can be regarded as a solvable deformation of the standard Schrödinger operators $p^2 + V_N(x)$, and they arise naturally from the quantization of the Seiberg-Witten curve of four-dimensional, $\mathcal{N} = 2$, SU($N$) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Using the open topological string/spectral theory correspondence, we construct exact, analytic eigenfunctions of $H_N$, valid for arbitrary polynomial potentials and describing both bound and resonant states. Our solutions are entire in $x$ for generic values of the energy, and become $L^2$-normalizable only at a discrete set of energies. An interesting feature of these Hamiltonians is the existence of special loci in the parameter space of the potential, the so-called Toda points. The eigenfunctions exhibit enhanced decay at these points, leading to spectral degeneracies for confining potentials and to a real energy spectrum for unbounded ones. Our results provide a rare example of a quantum-mechanical spectral problem that is exactly solvable, admitting explicit, analytic eigenfunctions for both bound and resonant states.

We show explicitly how the measurement of time-extended observables back-reacts on itself and induces correlations between other measurements in its causal future. Our framework is fully compositional in spacetime and extends previous results on the measurement of instantaneous observables.

Conclusion: 该分析为教学提供了方便，大大简化了Koehler实验的复杂性。

Abstract: We revisit Koehler's experiment, a clever modification of Ruchardt's experiment designed to measure the ratio of specific heats of gas. The theory of self-sustained oscillations in Koehler's experiment was provided by Koehler (1950). However, its lengthy and dense analysis may pose challenges to readers due to the complexity of the calculations. Following Koehler's approximation for pressure changes, we explicitly present the model equations as piecewise linear differential systems and qualitatively analyze the periodic solutions from a geometric perspective. This concise and transparent approach addresses a fundamental question about Koehler's experiment: why is the oscillation frequency nearly equal to the Ruchardt frequency? Our analysis avoids intricate calculations and will be particularly helpful for teachers and students who encounter Koehler's experiment in general physics laboratory classes.

Abstract: The Lorentzian path integral for the wave function of the Universe is only conditionally convergent and thus requires a well-defined prescription. The Picard-Lefschetz approach ensures convergence through contour deformation, but it has been argued that this leads to unsuppressed perturbations due to relevant saddle points residing in the region ${\rm Im}N>0$. As an alternative, we propose a simple regulator for the lapse integral in minisuperspace. Specifically, we impose the vanishing initial size of the Universe via a delta function, represented as a narrow Gaussian of width $σ$, and take the limit $σ\to 0$ only after performing the functional integrations. This regulator has a clear physical interpretation: it corresponds to a vanishingly small quantum uncertainty in the initial size of the Universe. For any fixed $σ> 0$, the lapse integral is absolutely convergent along (or slightly below) the real axis, and no excursion into the region ${\rm Im}N>0$ is required. We further argue that the initial wave function for scalar and tensor perturbations should be incorporated in the Lorentzian path integral formalism, and we show that these perturbations are then appropriately suppressed. A purely Lorentzian path integral thus yields the tunneling wave function with suppressed perturbations. We also demonstrate that the Hartle-Hawking wave function can be reproduced by choosing a contour for the lapse integral extending from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ that passes below the singularity near the origin.

*Alexandre M. Pombo,Lorenzo Pizzuti,Alessandra di Giacomo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that rotating scalar Q-balls can potentially replicate the rotation curves of disk galaxies, providing a viable dark matter model with specific mass constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the observation that Q-balls, which are stable scalar solitons, resemble the structures of galaxies. The motivation stems from the potential of Q-balls to serve as a dark matter candidate and the need to explain galaxy rotation curves using alternative physics models.

Method: The paper employs a hybrid numerical framework combining a high-accuracy pseudo-spectral method and a physics-informed neural network approach to model both static and rotating Q-balls. The method also involves fitting these models to observed rotation curves from the SPARC catalogue to assess their viability as dark matter halos.

Result: The results show that the simplified model successfully replicates the rotation curves of disk galaxies. An average constraint on the scalar field particle mass is found to be around $10^{-27}$ eV, aligning with other galactic-scale soliton solutions.

Conclusion: This finding supports the idea that scalar Q-balls could function as dark matter halos, offering an alternative to traditional models. The results enhance our understanding of galaxy dynamics and the potential of Q-balls as a dark matter candidate.

Abstract: Can a dynamically robust (\textit{aka} stable) $Q$-ball reproduce the rotation curve of a disk galaxy? In an astrophysical environment, $Q$-balls are non-topological solitons that are transparent and only perceived by their gravitational effects. Traditionally, scalar $Q$-balls are modelled with a polynomial potential, but axion-like periodic potentials are also expected to support such solitonic configurations. In the presence of angular momentum, $Q$-balls acquire a toroidal structure with a central density void, qualitatively resembling the structure of disk galaxies. Motivated by this similarity, we investigate whether rotating scalar $Q$-balls can reproduce the observed galactic rotation curves. In this work, we use a recently developed hybrid numerical framework that combines a high-accuracy pseudo-spectral method with a physics-informed neural network approach to construct both static and rotating $Q$-ball solutions. We then assess their ability to act as the dark matter halos in galaxies by fitting the observed rotation curves of a sample of disk galaxies from the SPARC catalogue. Our simplified model provides an overall good agreement with observational data; we have further found an average constraint on the scalar field particle's mass $m\sim 10^{-27}$ eV, in agreement with similar galactic-scale soliton solutions.

Abstract: Gravitational waves from comparable-mass binary-black-hole mergers are often described in terms of three stages: inspiral, merger and ringdown. Post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories are used to model the inspiral and ringdown parts of the waveform, respectively, while the merger phase has been modeled most accurately using numerical relativity (NR). Nevertheless, there have been several approaches used to model the merger phase using analytical methods. In this paper, we adapt a hybrid approximation method that applies post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories at the same times in different spatial regions of a binary-black-hole waveform (and which are matched at a boundary region with prescribed dynamics). Prior work with the hybrid method used leading post-Newtonian theory and the perturbation theory of nonrotating black holes, which led to errors during the late inspiral and disagreement with the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency extracted from NR simulations during the ringdown. To obtain a better match with NR waveforms of binary-black-hole mergers, we made several phenomenological modifications to the hybrid method. Specifically, to better capture the inspiral dynamics, we use the effective-one-body method for modeling the trajectory of the boundary between the two spatial regions. The waveform is determined by evolving a Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type equation for an effective black-hole perturbation theory problem with a modified Poschl-Teller potential. By tuning the potential to match the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency of the remnant black hole and also optimizing the boundary data on the matching region, we could match NR waveforms from nonspinning, comparable-mass binary black holes with mass ratios between one and eight, with a relative error of order $10^{-3}$.

### [138] [Photon counting readout for detection and inference of gravitational waves from neutron star merger remnants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09656)
*Ethan Payne,Lee McCuller,Katerina Chatziioannou*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Post-merger gravitational waves hold promise for learning about dense matter, but detection is rare. Quantum noise in high-frequency detectors limits this, prompting exploration of alternative readout schemes like photon-counting. Simulations show that photon counting can detect weak signals and improve measurements of neutron star properties, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding dense matter through gravitational waves requires detecting low-amplitude signals. Traditional methods struggle in high-frequency, low-sensitivity regimes. Photon-counting offers a new approach to extract information from these challenging signals.

Method: Simulated data was used to evaluate photon-counting as a readout scheme in quantum-noise dominated environments above 1 kHz. The method compared photon-counting to traditional homodyne techniques and measured its effectiveness in detecting weak signals and improving neutron star parameter constraints.

Result: Photon counting demonstrated efficiency in detecting weak signals with a post-merger signal-to-noise ratio of 0.2. It also led to a twofold improvement in measuring the radius of a 1.6 solar mass neutron star when processed over 20,000 signals, equivalent to about 10^-2 to 1.5 years of observation. Reducing classical noise further tightening constraints.

Conclusion: This work suggests that photon-counting readout schemes can successfully detect and analyze low-amplitude gravitational wave signals from neutron star mergers, providing a valuable alternative for future detectors aiming to study dense matter environments.

Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted after neutron star binary coalescences and the information they carry about dense matter are a high-priority target for next-generation detectors. Even though such detectors are expected to observe millions of signals, detectable post-merger emission will remain rare. In this work, we explore post-merger detectability and inference through an alternative detector readout scheme for data dominated by quantum-noise, which is the case above $1$\,kHz: photon-counting. In such a readout, signals and noise become quantized into discrete distributions corresponding to the detection of single photons measured in a chosen basis of modes. Through simulated data, we demonstrate that photon counting can be efficient even for weak signals. We find ${\sim}1$ in 100 signals with a post-merger signal-to-noise ratio of 0.2 can result in a single photon and thus be detected. Furthermore, after $2\times10^4$ signals -- equivalent to $10^{-2}$ to $1.5$ years of observation -- photon counting results in a twofold improvement in the measurement of the radius of a $1.6\,M_\odot$ neutron star. Constraints can be further tightened if the detector classical noise is reduced. Photon counting offers a promising alternative to traditional homodyne readout techniques for extracting information from low signal-to-noise ratio post-merger signals.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents evidence for a strong isotropic gravitational wave background using pulsar timing arrays, attributing it to supermassive black hole binaries. However, current analyses have several simplifying assumptions that limit their accuracy, particularly related to signal modeling and statistical considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper seems to be to improve the understanding of gravitational wave backgrounds by relaxing simplifying assumptions in the analysis, aiming for a more accurate modeling of the signals.

Method: The authors developed analytical and numerical models to study an astrophysical gravitational wave background without previous approximations, focusing on interference effects and their impact on PTA signals. They then compared the statistical properties of the resulting signals to those from a Gaussian-generated signal.

Result: The key result is the detection of non-Gaussian signal features introduced by interference effects, which current PTA analyses do not adequately account for. This suggests that future analyses need to be adjusted to include these non-Gaussianities for improved accuracy.

Conclusion: Currently available data from pulsar timing arrays cannot conclusively distinguish the observed signal as a Gaussian astrophysical gravitational wave background due to the presence of unmodeled interference effects that contribute to non-Gaussian signal characteristics.

Abstract: Strong evidence for an isotropic, Gaussian gravitational wave background (GWB) has been found by multiple pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The GWB is expected to be sourced by a finite population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) emitting in the PTA sensitivity band, and astrophysical inference of PTA data sets suggests a GWB signal that is at the higher end of GWB spectral amplitude estimates. However, current inference analyses make simplifying assumptions, such as modeling the GWB as Gaussian, assuming that all SMBHBs only emit at frequencies that are integer multiples of the total observing time, and ignoring the interference between the signals of different SMBHBs. In this paper, we build analytical and numerical models of an astrophysical GWB without the above approximations, and compare the statistical properties of its induced PTA signal to those of a signal produced by a Gaussian GWB. We show that interference effects introduce non-Gaussianities in the PTA signal, which are currently unmodeled in PTA analyses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the tidal properties of black holes is crucial for gravitational wave physics. Ladder symmetry simplifies these analyses, so demonstrating its necessity and sufficiency is important.

Method: Used parametric deformations and the KRZ parametrization to analyze tidal Love numbers (TLNs).

Result: Striated static scalar TLNs imply breaking Ladder symmetry, conversely, Ladder symmetry ensures zero static scalar TLNs in considered black hole spacetimes.

Conclusion: Ladder symmetry is both necessary and sufficient for static scalar TLN vanishing, providing a direct condition in black hole tidal studies.

Abstract: Black holes in four-dimensional, asymptotically flat general relativity have vanishing static tidal Love numbers (TLNs), a property tied to a hidden symmetry of the perturbation equations. Within the Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) parametrization, a subclass of spacetimes was previously shown to admit such Ladder symmetry, which enforces the absence of static scalar TLNs. In this work, we introduce parametric deformations to such Ladder-symmetric spacetimes and analyze the resultant linear tidal response. Using the parametrized formalism for TLNs, we show that any deviation from a Ladder-symmetric background leads to non-zero static scalar TLNs. This establishes Ladder symmetry as a necessary, as well as sufficient condition, for the vanishing of static TLNs in static, spherically symmetric black holes and in rotating black holes of the KRZ class.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dynamics of periodic orbits and the properties of accretion disks around a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) immersed in a King-type dark matter (DM) halo. Our analysis focuses on how the presence of the King DM halo influences both the behavior of periodic orbits and the radiative characteristics of the accretion disk. We begin by examining time-like periodic geodesic orbits for various configurations characterized by different energy and angular momentum values, represented by the integers $(z, w, v)$. Furthermore, we explore the effects of the King DM halo on time-like periodic geodesics, marginally bound orbits, and innermost stable circular orbits, thereby providing a deeper understanding of how the DM halo environment modifies the behavior of these stable orbits and timelike particle geodesics. Finally, we analyze the null geodesics and the accretion disk properties by studying their direct and secondary images, redshift distributions, and radiation fluxes as observed at infinity for a range of inclination angles. This approach allows us to gain valuable insights into the spacetime geometry of a Schwarzschild-like BH within the King-type DM halo, its physical and radiative properties in the accretion disk, and the corresponding observational implications.

Conclusion: 无 horizon的 veiled singularities 是稳定的，可能为更高阶引力理论中替代黑洞的解决方案提供依据。

Abstract: We investigate a class of horizonless solutions in Einstein-Weyl gravity, corresponding to the so-called attractive naked singularities of the (-2,2) type. In contrast to General Relativity, where naked singularities are generically unstable and excluded by the cosmic censorship conjecture, we show that these configurations are linearly stable under tensor perturbations. By numerically evolving the perturbation equations in the time domain, we find that all modes decay with characteristic oscillatory tails, a behavior consistent with the dynamics of massive field perturbations in quadratic gravity. This establishes that attractive naked singularities in Einstein-Weyl gravity are dynamically stable and can persist as stationary configurations. We argue that these horizonless configurations are observationally concealed, and therefore we refer to them as veiled singularities. Their stability and phenomenological similarity to black holes suggest that they may represent viable horizonless alternatives in higher-derivative theories of gravity, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between singularity resolution, stability, and effective field dynamics beyond Einstein's theory.

Abstract: Based on a comprehensive analysis of recent observational data-a combination of DESI DR1, Planck CMB, and Pantheon+ SN Ia-this study critically evaluates the two dark energy (DE) proposals within Harada's Conformal Killing Gravity (CKG) model. The model in question predicts either a dominant phantom-type effective DE component with EoS $ω= -5/3$ or a hybrid scenario combining a cosmological constant ($ω= -1$) with a subdominant $ω= -5/3$ fluid (around $5\%$) to address the Hubble tension (HT) and late-time acceleration. An analysis based on the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) demonstrates that the pure CKG fluid scenario $ω= -5/3$ is excluded, whereas the hybrid model remains only marginally compatible. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis constrains the effective DE density parameter to $Ω_{\text{eff}} = 0.009^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$ ($68\%$ CL), consistent with zero and ruling out the around $5\%$ contribution required by Harada's CKG. The resulting Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ and effective EoS $ω_{\text{eff}}(z)$ are indistinguishable from those of $Λ$CDM. Bayesian model comparison via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) shows no statistical preference for CKG over $Λ$CDM ($Δ\text{AIC} = +2.6$), disfavoring the additional complexity of the CKG model. The key output of this study is that both DE proposals in Harada's CKG are ruled out by current cosmological data, and HT remains unresolved.

Abstract: We study the bound states of a massive scalar field around a topological star, and show that these are strictly normal modes. This yields a genuine gravitational atom, sharply distinguishing horizonless objects from black holes. It is shown that the modes are controlled by the field's Compton wavelength compared to the size of the star. When the Compton wavelength is large, the field forms a cloud with a hydrogen-like spectrum, while in the opposite regime it localizes along timelike trajectories. When the two scales are comparable the spectrum becomes richer, and we characterize it in detail allowing the field to carry electric charge and Kaluza--Klein momentum.

Abstract: We present a geometric placement algorithm for constructing template banks. We specialize in the case of Gravitational Wave searches, and use autoencoders for non-linear compression of the space of waveforms after these have been represented by a finite number of basis functions using an SVD decomposition. To ensure that the autoencoder is suitable for geometric placement we try to find a coordinate system describing the manifold of SVD coefficients such that distances in the latent and embedding space are equal. We show that the curvature of the banks is negligible and that such a system can be found. We then show that a geometric placement algorithm via a uniform grid in the latent space combined with rejection of unphysical points using a normalizing flow results in templates that, while slightly less in number than the similar construction using random forests of Ref.~\cite{Wadekar:2023kym}, perform slightly better in the effectualness tests, especially for high-mass binary systems. We discuss briefly how these dimensionality reduction techniques might be used in the context of cosmology, and a simple toy example where the periodicity of a flat manifold slightly complicates finding a distance-preserving coordinate system.

Abstract: The physical and mathematical properties of the composed Reissner-Nordström-black-hole-massive-scalar-field system are studied {\it analytically} in the dimensionless large-mass $Mμ\gg1$ regime [here $\{M,μ\}$ are respectively the mass of the central black hole and the proper mass of the scalar field]. It is proved that, for a given value ${\bar Q}\equiv Q/M$ of the dimensionless charge parameter of the central black hole, the system is characterized by the presence of quasi-resonances, linearized perturbation modes with arbitrarily long lifetimes. In particular, using analytical techniques, we determine the black-hole-field critical mass spectrum $\{Mμ_{\text{crit}}({\bar Q})\}$ which characterizes the long-lived resonances of the composed physical system.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of gravitational waveforms from compact binary coalescences remains central to gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. Post-Newtonian (PN) approximations capture the early inspiral dynamics analytically but break down near merger, while numerical relativity (NR) provides the accurate yet computationally expensive waveforms over limited parameter ranges. We develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that learns corrections mapping PN dynamics and waveforms to their NR counterparts. As a demonstration of the approach, we use the TaylorT4 PN model as the baseline, and train the network on hybridized NR surrogate data (NRHybSur3dq8) to learn higher-order corrections to the orbital dynamics and waveform modes for nonspinning noneccentric systems. Physically motivated loss terms enforce known limits and symmetries, such as vanishing corrections in the Newtonian limit and suppression of odd-$m$ modes in equal-mass systems, promoting consistent and reliable extrapolation beyond the training region. We simultaneously incorporate corrections that account for the different meaning of mass parameters in PN and NR descriptions. The learned corrections significantly reduce the phase and amplitude error through the inspiral up to about $200M$ before the merger. This approach provides a differentiable and computationally efficient bridge between PN and NR, offering a path toward waveform models that generalize more robustly beyond existing NR datasets.

Abstract: Interrelationships between the expansion, the shear, and the vorticity -- the kinematical tensors -- on the one hand, and the polarization modes of gravitational waves on the other hand, are studied by considering freely falling test particles. After studying exact relations, we consider slowly moving particles under the influence of a weak gravitational field. Linearized plane waves of metric theories of gravity representative of those determined by a general second order Lagrangian, including General Relativity, are shown to exemplify the following interconnections: between the transverse components of the shear and the transverse tensor polarization mode; between the expansion, and both the transverse scalar and the longitudinal polarization modes; and between the longitudinal-transverse components of the shear and the vorticity, and the vector polarization mode.

Abstract: In this article, the behavior of a straight cosmic string is studied for the linearized version of Horndeski theory in cases where the scalar field is massless or massive. Several physical properties of such solutions are discussed in detail regarding the effects of the scalar field of this theory. The mass of the scalar field induces a screening effect such that, in the massive theory, the string solution approaches to the general relativistic one. We also consider wiggly cosmic strings, obtain the solutions for both massless and massive cases, discuss their properties and observe similar screening effects.

*Neil J. Cornish*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the diagonal approximation for the noise covariance matrix in wavelet domain analyses for gravitational wave detectors, concluding that the WDM wavelet packet basis maintains a nearly diagonal noise correlation matrix under sufficiently slow noise variation in both time and frequency. If the noise varies rapidly, their proposed methods are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave detectors produce datasets that are often non-stationary, making traditional Fourier domain techniques less effective in capturing time-varying noise characteristics. The motivation is to find an alternative analysis framework that can account for this non-stationarity, and the wavelet transform presents a promising approach.

Method: The paper employs mathematical analysis, focusing on the WDM wavelet packet basis, to derive the conditions under which the noise covariance matrix in the wavelet domain remains diagonal. They derive expressions for the off-diagonal terms of this matrix and investigate how they are influenced by the time and frequency derivatives of the dynamic spectral model.

Result: The study finds that slow variation of the noise across wavelet pixels—both in time and frequency—allows the noise covariance matrix to remain diagonal. An accurate approximation of the noise matrix is achieved under these conditions. This result reduces the complexity of processing gravitational wave data and improves the efficiency of signal detection and parameter estimation by leveraging the properties of wavelet transforms.

Conclusion: The WDM wavelet packet basis is well-suited for the diagonal approximation in wavelet domain analyses when the noise variation is sufficiently slow across both time and frequency. For rapidly varying noise, alternative strategies are needed to maintain the accuracy of such approximations.

Abstract: Gravitational wave detectors produce time series of the gravitational wave strain co-added with instrument noise. For evenly sampled data, such as from laser interferometers, it has been traditional to Fourier transform the data and perform analyses in the frequency domain. The motivation being that the Fourier domain noise covariance matrix will be diagonal if the noise properties are constant in time, which greatly simplifies and accelerates the analysis. However, if the noise is non-stationary this advantage is lost. It has been proposed that the time-frequency or wavelet domain is better suited for studying non-stationary noise, at least when the time variation is suitably slow, since then the wavelet domain noise covariance matrix is, to a good approximation, diagonal. Here we investigate the conditions under which the diagonal approximation is appropriate for the case of the Wilson-Daubechies-Meyer (WDM) wavelet packet basis, which is seeing increased use in gravitational wave data analysis. We show that so long as the noise varies slowly across a wavelet pixel, in both time {\em and} frequency, the WDM noise correlation matrix is well approximated as diagonal. The off-diagonal terms are proportional to the time and frequency derivatives of the dynamic spectral model. The same general picture should apply to other discrete wavelet transforms with wavelet filters that are suitably compact in time and frequency. Strategies for handling data with rapidly varying noise that violate these assumptions are discussed.

Abstract: Much of our understanding of gapless many-body quantum systems stems from their low-energy descriptions as conformal field theories. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the associated quantum geometry by considering finite systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry. This is supported by both analytical results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models.

Employing the magnetocaloric effect as a detection method, in conjunction with systematical field-dependent physical properties, we uncover a distinctive 1/2 magnetization plateau phase with significant quantum fluctuations. Our study unveils Nd3ScBi5 as a prototypical model with an emerging phase of enhanced quantum fluctuations triggered by first-order magnetic transitions.

Abstract: Quantum transport phenomena in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at oxide interfaces have garnered significant interest owing to their potential in spintronic and quantum information technologies. Here, we systematically investigate the quantum conductance corrections of spin-polarized 2DEGs formed at the interfaces between two insulating oxides, ferromagnetic EuTiO3 (ETO) films and (111)-oriented KTaO3 (KTO) substrates. The anomalous Hall effect and hysteretic magnetoresistance provide clear evidence for long-range ferromagnetic order in the 2DEGs, which could be attributed to interfacial Eu doping in combination with the magnetic proximity effect of the ETO layer. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry by ferromagnetism in the 2DEGs, and with the assistance of spin-orbit coupling effect, gives rise to a nontrivial Berry phase. This results in a competition between weak localization (WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL) in the quantum transport of Dirac-like fermions at the KTO (111) interfaces. Notably, this competitive behavior can be effectively tuned by optical gating via a photoexcitation-induced shift of the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate a controllable platform based on spin-polarized oxide 2DEGs for quantum transport, opening new avenues for spin-orbitronic and topological electronic applications.

Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators, characterized by symmetry-protected anomalous boundary modes, have been generalized to the strongly correlated regime for both bosonic and fermionic systems. As correlated topological insulators (TI) approach experimental realization in quantum simulators, conventional probes, such as transport measurements, are not easily applicable to these synthetic platforms. In this study, we focus on two examples of correlated TI: a bosonic TI protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2\times U(1)$ symmetry and the fermionic quantum spin Hall insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry. We propose a unified, readily implementable protocol based on measuring the disorder parameter $\langle\exp(\mathrm{i}θ\hat{Q}_A)\rangle$ for a large subregion $A$, with $\hat{Q}_A$ the total charge operator within $A$. Our key finding is that this quantity exhibits non-analytical dependence on $θ$ for correlated TI, a signature robust against decoherence. We establish this diagnostic through both numerical simulations and analytical derivations. This protocol is well-suited for implementation on near-term quantum simulation platforms, providing a direct route to experimentally confirm correlated TI.

Abstract: The tetratrillium lattice has recently been proposed as responsible for the dynamical properties observed in the $S=1$ langbeinite compound K$_2$Ni$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$. Here, we study in detail the classical spin liquid properties of this lattice of tri-coordinated tetrahedra using classical Monte Carlo and large-$N$ theory calculations. In the large-$N$ limit, we find that the system presents a gapped spectrum with flat bottom bands, giving rise to a fragile spin liquid with exponentially decaying correlations according to the classification of classical spin liquids. We confirm that this scenario also holds in the more realistic Ising and Heisenberg cases, for which the system does not exhibit any finite-temperature phase transition, and the low-temperature spin structure factors exhibit excellent quantitative agreement with the large-$N$ theory. We also provide insight into the quantum $S=1/2$ limit by performing pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group calculations at finite temperatures, and discuss the possible phases that can arise in the ground state due to quantum fluctuations.

Abstract: A large variety of materials can be approximately described by means of spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladders. Here, the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm together with a previously established numerical self-consistent mean-field approximation is used to investigate the magnetic properties of spin ladders coupled in a second dimension. The full ground state phase diagram including spin-gapped, antiferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and fully polarized phases is presented as a function of interladder and intraladder coupling and magnetic field. Measurement of the dependence of magnetization on applied magnetic field is shown to enable location of a material on the phase diagram and determination of the Hamiltonian parameters. These results provide a practical route toward identifying and characterizing magnetic materials composed of coupled spin ladders.

Abstract: Quantum theory of geometrically frustrated systems is usually approached as a gauge theory where the local conservation law becomes the Gauss law. Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints.

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a one-dimensional dissipative Bose-Hubbard model using the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (FRG). Each lattice site is coupled to an independent bath, generating long-range temporal interactions that encode non-Markovian dissipation. For a broad class of bath spectra -- ohmic, sub-ohmic, and super-ohmic -- we identify two competing low-energy regimes: a Luttinger-liquid line of fixed points and a dissipative fixed point characterized by finite compressibility, vanishing superfluid stiffness, and universal scaling exponents, separated by a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The FRG framework is essential here, as it provides access to the complete renormalization group flow and all fixed points from a single microscopic action, beyond the reach of perturbative or variational methods. This work establishes a unified and systematically improvable framework for describing dissipative quantum phases in one dimension.

Abstract: We introduce and investigate a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation for two-dimensional (2D) attractive Bose systems. First, we demonstrate that it accurately captures key properties of universal bound states in free space commonly referred to as quantum droplets. We then apply the framework to predict the existence of universal excited states, including vortex configurations, which may be more accessible to experimental investigation than the ground state. Additionally, we investigate breathing modes and quench dynamics in trapped geometries. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for exploring both static and dynamical phenomena in finite 2D Bose systems, offering guidance for the design of future experimental protocols.

Abstract: We describe recent theoretical and experimental developments on mediated interactions in mixtures of bosonic and fermionic atoms. We discuss how particle-hole excitations of a Fermi sea can induce long-range interactions between heavy impurities or atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Conversely, phonon excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate induce interactions between fermionic atoms. These mediated interactions exhibit different short-range and long-range scaling regimes with distance and, if strong enough, can induce fermion superfluidity. We discuss the prospects for observing new phenomena that could arise from mediated interactions. Experimentally, we outline recent studies of the 133Cs-6Li Bose-Fermi mixture, a platform well-suited for investigating fermion-mediated interactions. A Cs Bose-Einstein condensate immersed in a degenerate Li Fermi gas is prepared with tunable interspecies interactions. In the weak-coupling regime, precision measurements of condensate properties reveal fermion-mediated attractions between bosons, matching theoretical predictions. In the strong-coupling regime, we observe suppression and revival of sound modes and novel many-body resonances. Altogether, we aim to highlight both instances where experiment and theory agree well, and promising prospects to engineer long-range interactions in atomic quantum gases.

Abstract: We investigate tetratomic and hexatomic bound states of ultracold molecules dressed by an elliptic microwave field. We show that these bound states can be accurately described by effective one-dimensional (1D) models incorporating high-order angular fluctuations, despite the physical system is in three-dimensional (3D) free space. By comparing with exact solutions of the full 3D system, we identify the validity region of such 1D description in the parameter plane of ellipticity and coupling strength of microwave field. The hard-core character of these effective models enables a duality between bosonic and fermionic molecules in real and spectral space, while their momentum distributions remain distinct. Our results have demonstrated an effective dimension reduction in microwave-shielded molecular systems, which is purely due to the intrinsic interaction anisotropy rather than any external confinement. Extending to large systems, our results suggest a self-bound single-molecule array as the ground state of both bosonic and fermionic molecular gases.

Abstract: We combine numerical and experimental approaches to study how impurities affect the maximum superflow in an annular Bose-Einstein condensate. By tuning the impurity density, we achieve precise control over the stability of persistent currents which increases with the impurity number. In the unstable regime, the complex vortex motion within the impurity landscape, characterized by pinning and unpinning events, governs the timescale of the current decay and its final value. Our work establishes atomic superfluids as a pristine platform for exploring universal mechanisms of superflow stabilization and decay, paving the way for atomtronic quantum technologies.

Abstract: The tension between fermion pairing and magnetism affects numerous strongly correlated electron systems, from high-temperature cuprates to twisted bilayer graphene. Exotic forms of fermion pairing and superfluidity are predicted when attraction between fermions competes with spin doping. Here, we follow the evolution of fermion pairing and charge and spin order in a spin-imbalanced attractive Hubbard gas of fermionic $^{40}$K atoms, covering a wide range of densities, magnetizations, and interactions with single-atom resolution. At low spin imbalance and weak interactions, we find a mixture of nonlocal fermion pairs coexisting with itinerant excess fermions. For stronger interactions an effective hard-core Bose-Fermi mixture emerges. Spin doping drives a crossover from charge-density wave correlations to a Fermi liquid of polarons. Beyond a certain spin imbalance and interaction strength, we find evidence for the onset of combined spin- and pair-density wave order, a possible precursor for the existence of magnetized superfluidity in the attractive Hubbard system.
