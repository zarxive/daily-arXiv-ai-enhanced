Here, we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of 2D stealthy hyperuniform metasurfaces operating at optical frequencies. In agreement with theoretical expectations, we observe a pronounced reduction of elastic scattering around the specular direction in metasurfaces fabricated by electron-beam lithography. However, the measured suppression is substantially weaker than that predicted by structure-factor calculations based on ideal stealthy hyperuniform point-pattern generators.

When a weak continuous-wave component is added to the pulsed pump, the emission becomes deterministic and the build-up time is considerably reduced. The difference between purely pulsed and hybrid excitation regimes points to the influence of pulse-to-pulse timing fluctuations. To elucidate this effect, we perform Langevin-based simulations that reproduce the experimentally observed broadening and confirm that time jitter, originating from spontaneous-emission noise near threshold, dominates the temporal dispersion.

In this work, we propose a general method to tune the interactions between static-field-shielded molecules by applying a microwave field.

Using the same set of laser beams as required for the initial Doppler laser cooling operation, we detune the laser frequencies to produce a narrow two-photon dark resonance. The process achieves a 1/e cooling time constant of 108(8) $\u03bc$s, ultimately reducing the mean thermal axial mode occupation from 72(23) to 1.5(3) in 800 $\u03bc$s as measured by resonantly probing an electric quadrupole transition near 729 nm. A parametric drive is applied to the trap electrodes which coherently exchanges the axial mode occupation with that of each radial mode, allowing for three-dimensional sub-Doppler cooling using only the axially-propagating laser beams. This sub-Doppler cooling is achieved for an axial oscillation frequency of $\u03c9_z = 2\u03c0~\\times~$221 kHz, which places the motion well outside of the Lamb Dicke confinement regime at the Doppler laser cooling limit. Our measured cooling rate and final mode occupation are in good agreement with a semiclassical model which combines a Lindblad master equation solution for ion-photon interactions with classical harmonic oscillator motion of the trapped ion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u4e9a\u5c14\u83ab\u592b\u6fc0\u5149\u51b7\u5374\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u6b65\u9aa4\u4ee5\u8fdc\u79bb\u6fc0\u5149\u51b7\u5374\u7684\u6781\u9650\u6761\u4ef6-real-time measurements\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u9677\u9631\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u6280\u672f\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fd8\u6709\u5f85\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6563\u6b65\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u4e9a\u5c14\u83ab\u592b\u51b7\u5374\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u5bf940Ca+\u79bb\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u51b7\u5374\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u6837\u7684\u6fc0\u5149\u675f\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6fc0\u5149\u9891\u7387\u4ea7\u751f\u4e9a\u5206\u8d1d\u6697\u7eb5\u5411\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u51b7\u5374\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u53c2\u6570\u9a71\u52a8\u6765\u4ea4\u6362\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5360\u636e\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u51b7\u5374\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728800\u00b5s\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\uff0c\u5c06\u8f74\u5411\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u70ed\u5360\u4f4d\u4ece72\u00b123\u51cf\u5c11\u52301.5\u00b13\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u534a\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u4e9a\u5c14\u83ab\u592b\u51b7\u5374\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u543b\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, its fate in non-Hermitian settings is less clear, especially near exceptional points where the Hamiltonian becomes non-diagonalizable. Here we investigate whether a 1+1-dimensional gapless non-Hermitian system can admit a conformal description, focusing on a PT-symmetric free-fermion field theory. Working in the biorthogonal formalism, we identify the conformal structure of this theory by constructing a traceless energy-momentum tensor whose Fourier modes generate a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c=-2$. This yields a non-Hermitian, biorthogonal realization of a logarithmic conformal field theory, in which correlation functions exhibit logarithmic scaling and the spectrum forms Virasoro staggered modules that are characterized by universal indecomposability parameters. We further present a microscopic construction and show how the same conformal data (with finite-size corrections) can be extracted from the lattice model at exceptional-point criticality, thereby supporting the field-theory prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5171\u5f62\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u548c\u53cc\u6b63\u4ea4\u57fa\u5e95\u3002", "motivation": "\u5171\u5f62\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u91cd\u8981\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u9886\u57df\u3002\u4f46\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u884c\u4e3a\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53cc\u6b63\u4ea4\u573a\u8bba\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u57281+1\u7ef4\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5171\u5f62\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u80fd\u6d41\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u6b63\u4ea4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u53cd\u5e38\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8377\u7684\u7ef4\u62c9\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u786e\u5b9a\u5171\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u88ab\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\uff0c\u518d\u4e09\u68c0\u9a8c\u540e\u4ecd\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5171\u5f62\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5171\u5f62\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u7574\u3002"}}

By combining an optimized chemical preparation with pulse-shape analysis (PSA), the technique achieves sensitivities at the level of a few $10^2$ mBq/kg within one week of measurement, using sample masses below 1 g. The method enables the simultaneous identification of the $\u03b2$ decays of $^{210}$Pb and $^{210}$Bi and the $\u03b1$ decay of $^{210}$Po, allowing a direct verification of secular equilibrium within the decay chain.

The present work undertakes to investigate the issue of reality, treading a more fundamental route from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics to the Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics. Motivation for this is a similar approach from the eikonal equation in geometrical optics to the wave equation in electromagnetic theory. We rewrite the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation as a wave equation and seek to generalise de Broglie's wave particle duality by demanding that both particle and light waves have the freedom of being described by any square-integrable function. This generalisation, which allows superposition also for matter wave functions, helps us to obtain the Schrodinger equation, whose solution can be seen to be as much objective as the classical mechanics wave function. Several other equations which one writes in quantum mechanics, including the eigenvalue equations for observables, series expansion of energy states in terms of eigenstates of observables other than energy, etc., can be written in the classical case too. Absence of any collapse of the wave function, entanglement, etc. in the classical realm have their origin in the nonlinearity of the classical wave equation. These considerations indicate that many of the puzzles in quantum mechanics are present also in classical mechanics in a dormant form, which fact shall help to demystify quantum mechanics to a great extent.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper suggests that a quantum state represents classical wave functions and that the apparent contradictions between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics stem from a nonlinear wave equation.", "motivation": "The authors aim to investigate the concept of reality by drawing parallels between the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in classical mechanics and the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics, inspired by similar approaches in other physical theories.", "method": "The authors derive the Schr\u00f6dinger equation by modifying the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation into a wave equation, exploring the implications for wave-particle duality and the objectivity of quantum states.", "result": "The analysis demonstrates that quantum states can be seen as classical wave functions, and that many quantum paradoxes have analogues in classical mechanics.", "conclusion": "This work provides a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics, suggesting that quantum phenomena are not fundamentally different from classical ones but are expressed through nonlinear dynamics."}}

While optical systems provide a controlled setting for studying these phenomena, achieving deterministic control over their generation remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to induce and precisely modulate extreme events in a semiconductor VCSEL using polarization-controlled optical feedback. By integrating a $\u03bb$/2-waveplate into a polarization-selective external cavity, we regulate the nonlinear interaction between TE and TM modes. This setup triggers high-intensity, heavy-tailed fluctuations in the TM mode, exhibiting clear signatures of extreme events. We show that these events arise from deterministic energy exchange between modes, as evidenced by strong bipolar correlations and long-range temporal memory. The waveplate angle serves as an effective external parameter, enabling non-monotonic tuning of the event rate, intensity, and temporal clustering.

Unlike an impenetrable object, a penetrable obstacle does not fully deplete the density. We define an effective diameter D_eff from the Mach-1 contour of the time-averaged irrotational flow around the obstacle, which delineates the local supersonic region where quantized vortices nucleate. Using this flow-defined length scale, we construct a superfluid Reynolds number Re_s = (v0 minus vc) times D_eff divided by (hbar over m), where v0 is the flow speed, vc is the critical velocity, and m is the particle mass. We show that Re_s organizes the wake dynamics across obstacle sizes and strengths: the transition from dipole-row emission to alternating vortex cluster shedding occurs at Re_s around 2, and both the Strouhal number and the drag coefficient collapse onto universal curves when plotted as functions of Re_s. These results extend the concept of dynamic similarity in superfluid flows to penetrable obstacles and demonstrate that the dynamically relevant length scale is determined by the supersonic region rather than by the geometric obstacle size.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We introduce the Spatial Attention mechanism, a minimal and physically interpretable inductive bias for Neural-Network Quantum States, implemented as a single learned length scale within the Transformer architecture. This bias stabilizes large-scale optimization and enables access to thermodynamic-limit physics through highly accurate simulations on unprecedented system sizes within the Variational Monte Carlo framework. Applied to the spin-$\\tfrac12$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on clusters of up to $42\\times42$ sites. The ability to simulate such large systems allows controlled finite-size scaling of energies and order parameters, enabling the extraction of experimentally relevant quantities such as spin-wave velocities and uniform susceptibilities. In turn, we find extrapolated thermodynamic limit energies systematically better than those obtained with tensor-network approaches such as iPEPS. The resulting magnetization is strongly renormalized, $M_0=0.148(1)$ (about $30\\%$ of the classical value), revealing that less accurate variational states systematically overestimate magnetic order. Analysis of the optimized wave function further suggests an intrinsically non-local sign structure, indicating that the sign problem cannot be removed by local basis transformations.

However, acoustic loss fundamentally limits the performance of acoustic devices on TFLN platforms, yet its physical origin remains insufficiently understood. Here, we systematically investigate acoustic propagation loss in various TFLN platforms, including lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI), lithium niobate on sapphire (LNOS), suspended LN thin films, and bulk LN at gigahertz frequencies over temperatures ranging from 4 K to above room temperature. Using a delay-line method, we extract frequency- and temperature-dependent losses for Rayleigh, shear-horizontal, and Lamb modes. We observe an anomalous non-monotonic temperature dependence in LNOI that closely resembles acoustic loss in amorphous materials, indicating a dominant loss channel associated with the buried oxide layer at low temperatures.

When tested on the QM9 dataset, comprising small organic molecules, the proposed model demonstrated superior accuracy compared to both the original EGNN models and the baseline models without PFP-derived descriptors for 11 out of the 12 molecular properties. Furthermore, when evaluated on the tmQM dataset, which encompasses transition metal complexes, notable enhancements in performance were observed across all five target properties, indicating the significance of the local atomic environment surrounding transition metals.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "This report reviews key developments in Carrollian physics with an emphasis on their role in the emerging framework of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We begin by introducing the Carrollian limit, understood as the non-relativistic contraction of the Poincar\u00e9 group obtained by formally taking the speed of light to zero. The geometric structures associated with this limit are described and argued to arise naturally on null hypersurfaces, most notably on null infinity, as well as black hole and cosmological horizons. Building on this, we examine the relation between the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs symmetries governing asymptotically flat gravity and the conformal Carrollian symmetries. Explicit examples of Carrollian field theories are constructed by implementing the limit on well-known relativistic field theories, with particular attention to Carrollian CFTs. We then present the Carrollian holography proposal, according to which gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes is dual to a Carrollian CFT living at null infinity in one lower dimension. In this framework, the massless $\\mathcal{S}$-matrix written in position space at null infinity is naturally reinterpreted in terms of boundary Carrollian CFT correlators, called Carrollian amplitudes. We highlight their relation to celestial amplitudes and show how they naturally emerge from holographic CFT correlators through a correspondence between the flat space limit in the bulk and the Carrollian limit at the boundary. Using this correspondence, we provide strong evidence that flat space holography arises from a controlled and consistent limiting procedure applied to both sides of the AdS/CFT duality. We conclude by outlining future directions and open questions in the program.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4e86 Carrollian \u7269\u7406\u5728\u5e73\u6743\u7a7a\u95f4\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684

Ultraviolet excitation dynamics in these networks are typically modeled with effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. By extending this approach to a Lindblad master equation that incorporates explicit site geometries and dipole orientations, we track how correlations are generated, routed, and dissipated, while capturing both energy dissipation and information propagation among coupled chromophores. We compare localized injections, fully delocalized preparations, and eigenmode-based initial states. To quantify the emerging quantum-informational structure, we evaluate the $L_1$ norm of coherence, the correlated coherence, and the logarithmic negativity within and between selected chromophore sub-networks. The results reveal a strong dependence of both the direction and persistence of information flow on the type of initial preparation. Superradiant components drive the rapid export of correlations to the environment, whereas subradiant components retain them and slow their leakage. Embedding single tubulin units into larger dimers and spirals reshapes pairwise correlation maps and enables site-selective routing. Scaling to larger ordered lattices strengthens both export and retention channels, whereas static energetic and structural disorder suppresses long-range transport and reduces overall correlation transfer. These findings provide a Lindbladian picture of information flow in cytoskeletal chromophore networks and identify structural and dynamical conditions that transiently preserve nonclassical correlations in microtubules.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The model successfully resolves the initial singularity problem by demonstrating a nonsingular bounce, where the universe transitions from a contracting phase $ \\dot{a}(t)<0 $ to an expanding phase ($ \\dot{a}(t)>0 $) at the bouncing point $t \\approx 0.$ Key features include the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) near the bounce and the crossing of the phantom divide line ($\u03c9=-1$) by the equation of state (EoS) parameter, indicating quintom-like behavior. The model exhibits accelerated expansion post-bounce, suggesting an inflationary phase. Stability analysis via the adiabatic index reveals instability near the bouncing point, while energy conditions highlight the dominance of dark energy. Additionally, the study explores scalar fields, showing that quintessence-like kinetic energy becomes negative and phantom-like kinetic energy peaks positively near the bounce, aligning with dark energy dynamics. The Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter, and Hubble radius further validate the bouncing scenario, with the latter displaying symmetric behaviour around the bounce. These results underscore the viability of Weyl-type $f(Q)$ gravity as a framework for nonsingular bouncing cosmologies, offering insights into early universe dynamics and dark energy behaviour.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This effect arises from the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries in the exciton condensate, resulting in direction-dependent critical counterflow currents.

For both continuous and pulsed beams, the beam energy spread is fundamentally limited by the electron source, and is typically a sizable fraction of an electron-volt. In this paper, we present a means to reduce electron beam energy spread after emission to the level of a few 10s of meV rms using femtosecond photoemission and an interaction with laser-derived single- to few-cycle terahertz (THz) radiation. We show analytically and in particle tracking simulations that this interaction can remove energy spread stored in both the transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom. We analytically formulate the limit of energy spread that this technique can achieve, and map the non-ideal affects arising at high frequencies. The interaction is mediated by the beam's passage through a mirror which is reflective to terahertz radiation but allows transmission of the majority of the electron beam (e.g. a wire mesh). This method then only requires beam current losses of a few tens of percent, far smaller than what is achieved in prism and slit-based electron monochromators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u77ed\u8109\u51b2\u6fc0\u5149\u548c\u5149\u81f4\u53d1\u5c04\u6548\u5e94\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u80fd\u6563\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u5c0f\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u7684\u80fd\u6563\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u51e0\u6beb\u7535\u5b50\u4f0f\u7279\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u51cf\u5c0f\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u80fd\u6563\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u77ed\u8109\u51b2\u6fc0\u5149\u4e0e\u5149\u81f4\u53d1\u5c04\u6548\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u4e0e\u6fc0\u5149\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u7684\u80fd\u6563\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u7684\u80fd\u6563\u5230\u51e0\u5341\u6beb\u7535\u5b50\u4f0f\u7279\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e14\u5de5\u4f5c\u9891\u7387\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u8f83\u9ad8\u9891\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u578b\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u590d\u6742\u88c5\u7f6e\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u5c0f\u5e45\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u7535\u6d41\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7535\u5b50\u805a\u7126\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We model wave propagation as a trainable multi-layer network that leverages optimization and deep learning tools to infer the wave velocity distribution.

In molecular spin systems, chemical tunability and atomic-scale resolution are accompanied by a dense, thermally accessible phonon spectrum that introduces efficient spin relaxation pathways. Despite extensive theoretical work, there is little experimental consensus on which vibrational energies dominate spin relaxation or how molecular structure controls spin-phonon coupling (SPC). We present a fully experimental method to quantify SPC coefficients by combining temperature-dependent vibrational spectra from inelastic neutron scattering with spin relaxation rates measured by electron paramagnetic resonance. We apply this framework to two model S = 1/2 systems, copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) and copper(II) octaethylporphyrin (CuOEP). Two distinct relaxation regimes emerge: below 40 K, weakly coupled lattice modes below $50~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ dominate, whereas above 40 K, optical phonons above ~$185~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ become thermally populated and drive relaxation with SPC coefficients nearly three orders of magnitude larger. Structural distortions in CuOEP that break planar symmetry soften the crystal lattice and enhance anharmonic scattering, but also raise the energy of stretching modes at the molecular core where the spins reside. This redistributes vibrational energy toward the molecular periphery and out of plane, ultimately reducing SPC relative to CuPc and enabling room-temperature spin coherence in CuOEP. Although our method does not provide mode-specific SPC coefficients, it quantifies contributions from distinct spectral regions and establishes a broadly applicable, fully experimental link between crystal structure, lattice dynamics, and spin relaxation.", "AI": {"tldr": "CuOEP has enhanced spin coherence at room temperature compared to CuPc due to structural distortions that redistribute vibrational energy away from its spin centers.", "motivation": "Understanding spin relaxation in molecular systems is crucial for developing nanoscale spintronic devices.

We achieve this by obtaining the spread of an initial thermofield double state over the Krylov basis. The associated Lanczos coefficients match those for chaotic motion on the $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ group. By including non-perturbative effects in the path integral, which computes coarse-grained ensemble averages, we find that the complexity saturates at late times.

The metric function combines the magnetic monopole charge from nonlinear electrodynamics, the PFDM logarithmic correction, and the CS parameter that renders the spacetime asymptotically non-flat. We analyze the horizon structure, identifying parameter ranges yielding non-extremal BHs, extremal configurations, and naked singularities. The null geodesics, photon sphere radius, and shadow are computed, revealing that both CS and PFDM enlarge the shadow. For neutral particle dynamics, we derive the specific energy, angular momentum, and innermost stable circular orbit location. Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) are examined through the azimuthal, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies, where notably the azimuthal frequency is independent of the CS parameter. Scalar field perturbations governed by the Klein-Gordon equation yield an effective potential whose peak decreases with both parameters, yet the transmission and reflection probabilities respond oppositely to CS and PFDM variations. The greybody factor bounds are obtained using semi-analytical methods.

While magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene has been widely studied, strain provides an additional and realistic control knob for band engineering. In this work, we first generate a global method to construct commensurate supercells for arbitrary twist and strain. Then, using atomistic tight-binding and strain-extended continuum models to study the commensurate structures, we identify configurations that minimize the bandwidth beyond the magic angle. The results reveal a strong dependence of band narrowing and topology on strain type, magnitude, direction and lattice relaxation. Particularly, shear strain produces a stronger distortion than uniaxial strain. Including electron-electron interactions through a self-consistent Hartree potential shows that strain broadens the bare bands while reducing electrostatic renormalization. Strain also drives topological transitions as the narrow and remote bands hybridize, establishing twisted and strained bilayer graphene as a tunable platform for flat-band and topological phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bilayer graphene under twist and strain exhibits rich electronic phases, and strain can be used to tune these properties effectively.", "motivation": "Understanding the effects of twist and strain on bilayer graphene is important for advancing knowledge of topological and correlated electronic states in two-dimensional materials, which has implications for future electronic devices and materials science applications.", "method": "The researchers developed a global method to construct commensurate supercells for arbitrary twist and strain, combining atomistic tight-binding models with strain-extended continuum models.

This suppression in radiative heat transfer is directly correlated with mode localization, as revealed by the mode decomposition of the transmission coefficient, which serves as evidence of Anderson localization. Furthermore, we elucidate the dependence of radiative thermal conductance reduction on interparticle spacing and material damping rates, uncovering the interplay between intrinsic Ohmic losses, mode localization, and long-range many-body interactions.

While the BCS, Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO), and normal phases occupy different regions on the phase diagram when the parameters are uniform, a spatial change of pairing strength or spin polarization can drive the system from the FFLO phase to a normal gas or from a BCS superfluid to the FFLO phase in real space. The FFLO phase exhibits its signature modulating order parameter at the FFLO momentum due to population imbalance, and the pair correlation penetrates the polarized normal phase and exhibits proximity effects. Meanwhile, the BCS phase tends to repel population imbalance and maintain a plateau of pairing. Interestingly, a buffer FFLO phase emerges when the spatial change attempts to join the BCS and normal phase in the presence of spin polarization. By analyzing the pairing correlations, interfacial properties, and momentum-space spectra of the inhomogeneous structures, relevant length- and momentum- scales and their interplay are characterized.

The model predicts the final detector-grade fraction for each growth and, using SHAP feature-importance analysis, identifies impurity concentration and growth rate as the dominant factors governing yield, consistent with empirical understanding.

While recent experiments have revealed the continuous nature of individual jumps, the crossover from coherent dynamics to measurement-dominated behaviour has remained elusive. Here, we tune the measurement strength of a continuously monitored superconducting qubit, and observe that quantum jumps emerge not through a gradual crossover, but via a cascade of three distinct dynamical transitions. The first transition manifests as an exceptional point where coherent oscillations abruptly cease, giving way to jumps towards a stable eigenstate. The second transition marks the onset of dynamical state freezing, where the qubit's dwell time near the eigenstate diverges. A third threshold signals entry into the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger measurement paradoxically suppresses relaxation. Strikingly, we find that decoherence does not blur these transitions but rather fundamentally restructures the dynamical phase diagram, notably inverting their order. These results map measurement-induced transitions in a monitored qubit, revealing that the interplay between coherent driving, measurement, and decoherence gives rise to a hierarchy of distinct dynamical phases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We study this phenomenon using a two-dimensional interacting and coherently coupled Bose-Bose mixture, a platform that has already been employed experimentally to investigate false vacuum decay in one dimension. In such a mixture, it is possible to define an effective magnetization that acts as a quantum field variable. Using the Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE), we prepare thermal equilibrium states in the false vacuum and extract decay rates from the magnetization dynamics.

However, their design remains constrained by intuitive, iterative methods that lack flexibility, while also facing challenges in multi-objective optimization. Here, we introduce a deep learning-enabled inverse-design framework that overcomes these limitations through a conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). The main contribution of this work is a dual-channel image encoding scheme that jointly represents the geometry and thickness of a Si$_3$N$_4$ meta-layer, facilitating the network to learn the distribution of viable structures for a target optical response. This approach naturally solves the inherent ``one-to-many'' design issue, giving a diverse portfolio of functional candidates from a single input spectrum. The designed absorbers achieve exceptional spectral fidelity, with resonance peak errors below 5 nm, a mean squared error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, and the capacity to produce over 10 distinct, high-performance designs per target. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's robustness under oblique illumination, showing that it can be efficiently fine-tuned to maintain spectral accuracy across incidence angles from $10^\\circ$ to $40^\\circ$ by transfer learning, thus extending its practical utility to non-normal operating conditions. Full-wave simulations confirm that the generated geometries support a hybrid plasmonic-dielectric resonance, leading to near-perfect absorption and strong near-field enhancement.

The standard cosmological model contains a generic initial singularity usually referred to as the {\\em big bang}. Herein, we present a novel idea to extend the description of our Universe beyond this limit. The proposal relies on rewriting physics in a purely Riemannian, {\\em i.e.} locally Euclidean, 4-dimensional space and the emergence of Lorentzian patches owing to the interaction of all matter fields to a clock field that is responsible for a signature change. If our universe is contained within one of these patches, the initial singularity is replaced by a smooth boundary on which the signature of the physical metric flips. In this letter, we first define the model and draw the necessary conditions on its arbitrary functions for solutions to exist. Next, we prove the existence of solutions that lead to an emergent universe with a primordial (almost) de Sitter phase. To finish, we discuss the consequences of this construction for the universe on scales much larger than our observable universe: a large ``Euclidean sea'' in which Lorentzian islands locally emerge and host an expanding universe potentially similar to ours.

Within this framework, we identify Majorana's Butterfly as a fractal topological phase diagram governed by the competition between quasicrystallinity and superconducting pairing.

However, they are essential in providing us with insight into some of the most important and less well-understood phases of the model, such as the pseudogap and strange metal phases at relatively high temperatures, or unconventional superconductivity at lower temperatures, away from the commensurate filling. Here, we use the numerical linked-cluster expansions to compute spin and charge optical conductivities of the model at different temperatures and strong interaction strengths via the exact real-time-dependent correlation functions of the current operators. We mitigate systematic errors associated with having a limited access to the long-time behavior of the correlators by introducing fits and allowing for non-zero Drude weights when appropriate. We compare our results to available data from optical lattice experiments and find that the Drude contributions can account for the theory-experiment gap in the DC spin conductivity of the model at half filling in the strong-coupling region.

Thus, controlling heat flow is essential for their performance. Here we study how non-collinear spin arrangement affects the magnon contribution to thermal conductivity. As a paradigm system, we consider the most basic non-collinear magnet with a spin spiral ground state. Spin noncollinearity leads to anharmonic terms, resulting in magnon fusion and decay processes. These processes determine the magnon lifetime, which can be used to estimate thermal conductivity in a single-mode approximation. However, by solving the full Boltzmann equation numerically, we find a much higher thermal conductivity. This signifies that heat is carried not by individual magnons but by their linear combinations -- relaxons. The thermal conductivity is found to increase with the diminishing spiral pitch, consistent with recent experiments.

Yet enforcing foundry design rules during inverse design remains a major challenge, as optimized devices frequently violate constraints on minimum feature size and spacing. Existing fabrication-constrained approaches typically rely on penalty terms, projection filters, or heuristic binarization schedules, which restrict the accessible design space, require extensive hyperparameter tuning, and often fail to guarantee compliance throughout the optimization trajectory. Here, we introduce a framework for nanophotonic inverse design with intrinsic enforcement of design rules through a generative reparameterization of the design space, restricting optimization to a learned manifold of DRC-compliant geometries. We validate this paradigm by designing representative silicon photonic components including broadband power splitters, spectral duplexers, and mode converters operating across the 1,500-1,600 nm band for both electron-beam lithography and photolithography platforms. Across all devices, the manifold-based formulation reaches state-of-the-art performance metrics with over a 5-fold reduction in computational cost compared to pixel-based representations, while ensuring fabrication-compatible geometries throughout the entire design process. By treating fabrication constraints as a fundamental property of the design representation rather than an external penalty, this work establishes a direct pathway toward broadly applicable, platform-agnostic, and intrinsically DRC-compliant nanophotonics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u5929\u751f coolest \u5149\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5185\u5728\u5730\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u5219\uff0c palladium \u4f26\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6ee1\u8db3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5fae\u5c0f\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5728\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c Compliance \u5728\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u51f8\u663e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9650\u5236\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u8282\u56f0\u96be\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6027\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u9075\u5b88\u5236\u9020\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1 1500-1600 nm \u6ce2\u6bb5\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\u6700\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5149\u523b\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5236\u9020\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5149\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5236\u9020\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fae\u5c0f\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We ask whether a compiler can instead accept simple, structure-aware specifications while providing predictable resource guarantees. We answer this by designing and implementing a quantum state-preparation compiler for regular language states (RLS): uniform superpositions over bitstrings accepted by a regular description, and their complements. Users describe the target state via (i) a finite set of bitstrings, (ii) a regular expression, or (iii) a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), optionally with a complement flag. By translating the input to a DFA, minimizing it, and mapping it to an optimal matrix product state (MPS), the compiler obtains an intermediate representation (IR) that exposes and compresses hidden structure. The efficient DFA representation and minimization offloads expensive linear algebra computation in exchange of simpler automata manipulations. The combination of the regular-language frontend and this IR gives concise specifications not only for RLS but also for their complements that might otherwise require exponentially large state descriptions. This enables state preparation of an RLS or its complement with the same asymptotic resources and compile time. We outline two hardware-aware backends: SeqRLSP, which yields linear-depth, ancilla-free circuits for linear nearest-neighbor architectures via sequential generation, and TreeRLSP, which achieves logarithmic depth on all-to-all connectivity via a tree tensor network. We prove depth and gate-count bounds scaling with the system size and the state's maximal Schmidt rank, and we give explicit compile-time bounds that expose the benefit of our approach.

To extract probabilities, one must use the gravitational path integral (GPI) to compute not only the no-boundary amplitude, but also the norms by which its square is divided. We find that this dramatically alters predictions: the probability for any closed universe is either nearly 1, or exactly 1. That is, in the Hilbert space of closed universes defined by the GPI, the states of interest in cosmology are all nearly parallel to the Hartle-Hawking state up to nonperturbative corrections in $G_N^{-1}$. We also consider a statistical interpretation of the GPI, as an average of arbitrary products of amplitudes. We find that all amplitudes are exactly 1 in this case, consistent with recent arguments that the statistical approach to the GPI with a closed boundary computes an average over one-dimensional Hilbert spaces. As an example, we illustrate the consistent evaluation of the no-boundary proposal in inflationary cosmology.", "AI": {"tldr": "Examines corrections to the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal by considering the gravitational path integral (GPI).", "motivation": "Understanding quantum gravity predictions, particularly for cosmological models.", "method": "Analyzing corrections to amplitude computations in quantum gravity theory.", "result": "Fraudulent probabilities in cosmological models either converge to 1 or near it, affecting Hilbert space states.", "conclusion": "Modifications to the GPI method lead to altered cosmological probability predictions, suggesting new physical insights."}}

A well-known example is Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, where black holes carrying a scalar charge can exist. We find that, within this theory, binary black holes initially described by General Relativity can acquire scalar charges once they reach a critical orbital separation (\"dynamical scalarization\"). We develop a simple semi-analytic model, based on the adiabatic conservation of the total Wald entropy, to estimate the scalar charge evolution during the binary inspiral. We also run fully nonlinear numerical-relativity simulations for different configurations, finding consistent results. The gravitational-wave phase difference between Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet and General Relativity waveforms, which we use to assess detectability, is also computed. We find that dynamical scalarization might be observable in nearly equal-mass binary black hole mergers with third-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, in a narrow range of the

Although topological phononic metamaterials have recently been demonstrated as a promising paradigm for confining and guiding elastic waves through robust bound states, achieving ultrahigh-Q topological resonance with enhanced energy conversion efficiency remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a synthetic-dimensional higher-order topological insulator by engineering the flexural bands of elastic metamaterials, featuring highly localized topological hinge states in the bulk bands. This topological hinge mode stems from the nonzero combination of the bulk polarization and the Chern number in the synthetic-dimensional band structure, thus giving rise to a strong elastic-to-electric energy conversion at the corner of the phononic plate. Through numerical simulations and experimental validations, straightforward evidence of the localized modes with robust protection and consequent abilities in activating the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) array have been demonstrated.

We show here that this is not always the case. For this purpose, we study the quenched dynamics of a continuously monitored Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, described by the Lindblad formalism, coupled to a thermal environment modeled by another SYK maintained at constant temperature. We find that the combined effect of monitoring and the thermal bath drives the system toward a non-thermal steady state independently of the initial conditions. The corresponding retarded Green's function exhibits two stages of exponential decay, with rates that depend non-monotonously on the thermal bath coupling and the monitoring strength. In the limit of weak coupling, the late time decay of the Green's function, computed analytically, is closely related to that of the thermal bath. Strikingly, we identify a range of parameters in which continuous monitoring, despite being a source of decoherence, induces or enhances quantum chaotic dynamics suppressed by the thermal bath. For instance, in the limit of weak coupling to the thermal bath, the Lyapunov exponent increases sharply when monitoring is turned on. For intermediate values of the thermal bath coupling, the Lyapunov exponent exhibits re-entrant behavior: it vanishes at zero or sufficiently weak monitoring strength, and becomes positive again as the monitoring strength is increased. Our results offer intriguing insights on the mechanisms leading to quantum scrambling which paves the way to its experimental control and consequently to a performance enhancement of quantum information devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6d88\u6563\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8026\u5408\u548c\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6d4b\u63a7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u6269\u6563\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u6d88\u6563\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u62c9\u59c6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u70ed\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8428\u5947-\u6768-\u57fa\u5854ev\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62c9\u59c6\u65b9\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u6d4b\u63a7\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u73af\u5883\u8026\u5408\u8f83\u5f31\u4e14\u6d4b\u63a7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0c\u6d4b\u63a7\u589e\u5f3a\u6da8\u843d\u6269\u6563\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f31\u73af\u5883\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\uff0cGreen\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u70ed\u8c31\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u63a7\u589e\u5f3a\u6da8\u843d\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbe\u5907\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

This branch will be populated by stars comprising a quark-matter core and a hadronic-matter envelope, i.e., hybrid stars, which represent ``twin-star'' solutions to equilibria having the same mass but a fully hadronic EOS. While both branches are stable to linear perturbations, it is unclear which of the twin solutions is the ``favoured'' one, that is, which of the two configurations is expected to be found in nature. We assess this point by performing a large campaign of general-relativistic simulations aimed at assessing the response of compact stars on the two branches to perturbations of various strength. In this way, we find that, independently of whether the stars populate the hadronic or the twin branch, their response is characterised by a critical-perturbation strength such that the star will oscillate on the original branch for subcritical perturbations and migrate to the neighbouring branch for supercritical perturbations while conserving rest-mass. Because the critical values are different for stars with the same rest-mass but sitting on either branch, it is possible to define as favoured the part of the branch that has the largest critical perturbation, thus correcting the common wisdom that stellar models on the twin branch are the favoured ones.

Our central proposal is an \\emph{equatorial projection} framework: from a commutant decomposition into commuting rational chiral algebras with categories $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}$, we encode genus-one couplings by a non-negative integer matrix $M$ pairing characters and satisfying modular intertwiner relations. Invertible topological defect lines act directly on this gluing data (Verlinde lines diagonally via $S$-matrix eigenvalues, and anyon-permuting lines by braided-autoequivalence permutations), making modular covariance of defect amplitudes automatic and sharply distinguishing insertions that yield genuine modular invariants from those defining consistent non-holomorphic interfaces. We further show that the \\emph{replacement rules} of \\cite{Hegde:2021sdm, Lin:2019hks} arise as equatorial projections of defect actions, and we extend these constructions beyond two-character examples by systematically treating three-character commutant pairs in the $E_{8,1}$ theory.

Here, we address these issues experimentally by resolving the trajectory-dependent temporal structure of liquid HHG. By optimizing the laser focusing geometry, we achieve clear spatial discrimination of short- and long-trajectory contributions, providing direct evidence for the existence of multiple quantum trajectories in liquids. Using a phase-controlled two-color driving field, we independently retrieve the attochirp associated with each trajectory and demonstrate opposite energy-time correlations for short and long trajectories, establishing a trajectory-resolved energy-time mapping in liquid HHG.

By developing a novel projected submatrix update algorithm, we achieve a significant algorithmic speedup that enables us to access the thermodynamic limit with high precision. We observe that the fermion anomalous dimension and the correlation length exponent converge rapidly, while the boson anomalous dimension exhibits a systematic size dependence that we resolve via linear extrapolation. To validate our analysis, we perform parallel large-scale simulations of the spinless $t$-$V$ model on the honeycomb lattice, which belongs to the Gross-Neveu-Ising class. Our results for the $t$-$V$ model, including the first QMC determination of the fermion anomalous dimension, show agreement with conformal bootstrap predictions, thereby corroborating the robustness of our methodology. Our work provides state-of-the-art critical exponents for the honeycomb Hubbard model and establishes a systematic finite-size scaling workflow applicable to a broad class of strongly correlated quantum systems, paving the way for resolving other challenging fermionic quantum critical phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u4e34\u754c\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5927\u5c0f\u6548\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u5728\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3 strongly correlated \u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u7406\u8bba, \u91cf\u5b50\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df, \u7cbe\u76ca\u6c42\u7cbe\u7b97\u6cd5", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86 Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg \u7c7b\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5171\u5f62 Bootstrap \u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u666e\u9002\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u503c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9879\u76ee\u5f0f\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002"}}

By analyzing the maximal weight projection of amplitudes at the integrand level, we relate their maximally-transcendental parts to prescriptive unitarity integrals. This reveals a novel analytic structure: the prefactors multiplying the functions of maximal transcendentality are identified with the four-dimensional leading singularities of the theory. As a consequence, these prefactors admit a complete classification and can be computed using on-shell diagrams, a formalism originally developed in $\\mathcal{N}{=}4$ super Yang-Mills theory. As a concrete application, we determine the two-loop prefactors for planar MHV gluon amplitudes at arbitrary multiplicity. Combining these prefactors with recent advances in the planar two-loop six-point function space and explicit six-point prescriptive-unitarity input, we construct a complete symbol ansatz and uniquely fix the maximally-transcendental part of the two-loop six-gluon MHV QCD amplitudes by imposing physical constraints. The resulting symbols are expressible in a reduced 137-letter alphabet, suggesting that this alphabet is complete for two-loop six-point massless MHV scattering.

However, direct experimental access to interfacial electronic states with nanometer precision remains a significant challenge. Here, we employ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with nanoscale spatial resolution (nanoARPES) to directly map the epitaxial alignment and valence band evolution across MoSe2-WSe2 LHSs. By combining nanoARPES with spatially resolved photoluminescence, we correlate the evolution of the valence band maximum and exciton features across both atomically sharp and compositionally graded diffusive interfaces. We identified type-II band alignments governed by both material composition and interstitial-induced modifications of band offsets, in close agreement with density functional theory calculations. These results reveal fundamental mechanisms of electronic structure modulation at 1D TMDC heterointerfaces and provide a robust platform for tailored band engineering in van der Waals materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u5c42\u5c42\u72b6\u6a2a\u5411\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\uff08LHS\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5e26\u5bf9\u9f50\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7535\u5b50\u3001\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ea7\u5149\u89e3\u79bb\u80fd resolve \u5149\u8c31\uff08nanoARPES\uff09\u548c\u5149\u751fverted \u5149\u89e3\u79bb\u80fd resolve \u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\u4e86 MoSe2-WSe2 LHS \u4e2d\u7684\u754c\u9762\u7535\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5e26\u6781\u5316\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7c7b\u578b II \u5e26\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7531\u6750\u6599\u7ec4\u6210\u548c\u754c\u9762\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4f4d\u9519\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5355\u5c42 TMDC \u8de8\u754c\u9762\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5e26\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6750\u6599\u754c\u9762\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8de8\u6750\u6599\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u5e26\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u80fd\u9699\u63a7\u5236\u662f\u5173\u952e\u8bae\u9898\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u624b\u6bb5\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236interfaces \u7684\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u88c5\u7f6e\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ea7\u5149\u89e3\u79bb\u80fd resolve \u5149\u8c31\uff08nanoARPES\uff09\u548c\u5149\u751f inverted \u5149\u8c31\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86 MoSe2-WSe2 LHS \u4e2d\u754c\u9762\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5e26\u6781\u5316\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u5728 MoSe2-WSe2 LHS \u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7c7b\u578b II \u5e26\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8de8\u8d8a\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u7ec4\u6210\u548c\u754c\u9762\u6563\u5c04\u4f53\u5bf9\u5e26\u4f4d\u79fb\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5355\u5c42 TMDC \u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u672c\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5355\u5c42 TMDC \u6750\u6599\u7684\u754c\u9762\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282 interfaces \u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u529f\u80fd\u6750\u6599\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5728\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Here, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic properties of trilayer nickelates. In La4Ni3O10, we observe pronounced interorbital hybridization, whereas in Pr4Ni3O10, the flat d_(z^2 ) band becomes markedly incoherent and diminishes in spectral weight. By contrast, the dispersive d_(x^2-y^2 ) bands retain coherence in both compounds. This striking incoherence/coherence dichotomy identifies an orbital-selective Mott phase modulated by the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bonding angle. The depletion of the d_(z^2 ) orbitals further frustrates the interorbital hybridization and influences the density-wave transition in Pr4Ni3O10. Moreover, the density-wave gap is substantially reduced in Pr4Ni3O10, likely due to extra scattering channels provided by the local moments of Pr3+ cations. Our findings elucidate the intricate interplay among lattice, orbital, spin, and electronic degrees of freedom and reveal a feasible structural control parameter for the multi-orbital correlated state in trilayer nickelates, which provide a concrete framework for understanding the emergence of superconductivity under high pressure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u591a\u8f68\u9053\u4f53\u7cfb nickelates \u7684\u7535\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u7ed3\u6784\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8f68\u9053\u4e4b\u95f4\u6fc0\u53d1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8d85\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u8f68\u9053\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8f68\u9053\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u5bf9\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u662f\u5f53\u524d condensed matter \u7269\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u89d2\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u81f4\u7535\u79bb spectroscopy \u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728La4Ni3O10\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u95f4\u6742\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u5728Pr4Ni3O10\u4e2d\uff0cd_(z^2) \u8f68\u9053\u7684\u914d\u4f4d\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u534f\u8c03\u4e14\u6743\u91cd\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u76f8\u53cd\uff0cd_(x^2-y^2) \u8f68\u9053\u4fdd\u6301\u534f\u8c03\u6027\u3002Pr4Ni3O10\u4e2d\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u80fd\u9699\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\u90e8\u5206\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8ePr3+\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u78c1\u77e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6563\u5c04\u6e20\u9053\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8f68\u9053\u95f4\u6fc0\u53d1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u8d85\u5bfc\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8f68\u9053\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6563\u5c04\u4e0e\u7535\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u7b49\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

The second stage leverages a recently proposed windowed-CUSUM algorithm that is known to be asymptotically optimal for quickest change detection with an unknown post-change distribution in the classical setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684 quickest change detection \u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u540e\u9a8c\u72b6\u6001\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u68c0\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "motivation": " quickest change detection \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u540e\u9a8c\u72b6\u6001\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76 focus\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5757 POVM \u548c windowed-CUSUM \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": " \u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u5757 POVM\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u8f93\u51fa\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u4fdd\u7559\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5219\u4f7f\u7528windowed-CUSUM \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5df2\u77e5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u77e5\u540e\u9a8c\u72b6\u6001\u7684 quickest change detection\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u68c0\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "result": " \u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u68c0\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0a\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5 windowed-CUSUM \u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6574\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": " \u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u5b9a\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e2\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u53c8\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Depending on the characteristics of the wave packet, particles may be pushed away from the wave source or pulled toward it.

Accurately describing this process requires fully nonadiabatic electron-lattice dynamics, which is computationally demanding due to the need to resolve fast electronic motion over long time scales. By analyzing the structure of the lattice force during nonequilibrium evolution, we show that the force naturally separates into a smooth quasi-adiabatic component and a residual bath-like contribution associated with fast electronic fluctuations. The quasi-adiabatic component depends only on the instantaneous local lattice configuration and can be efficiently learned using machine-learning techniques, while a minimal Langevin description of the bath term captures the essential features of the recovery dynamics. Combining these elements enables efficient and scalable simulations of long-time nonequilibrium dynamics on large lattices, providing a practical route to access driven correlated systems beyond the reach of direct nonadiabatic approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6fc0\u5149\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u65e0\u65cb\u91cf\u6781\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u957f\u7a0b\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u4e0e\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u7535\u5b50-\u683c\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u975eadiabatic\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9ad8\u7535\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5f88\u5927\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u683c\u5b50\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u529b\u53ef\u5206\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u51c6adiabatic\u6210\u5206\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b8b\u4f59\u7684\u6d74\u6ce2\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4e0e\u5feb\u7535\u5b50\u632f\u8361\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u51c6adiabatic\u6210\u5206\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5c40\u57df\u683c\u5b50\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u800c\u6d74\u6ce2\u63cf\u8ff0\u53ef\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u91cd\u7f6e\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5927\u6676\u683c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a81\u7834\u76f4\u63a5\u975eadiabatic\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u65cb\u91cf\u6781\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5173\u6ce8\u957f\u7a0b\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u4e0e\u91cd\u7f6e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u91c7\u7528 semiclassical \u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 semiclassical \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u683c\u5b50\u529b\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u51c6adiabatic\u6210\u5206\u548c\u6b8b\u4f59\u7684\u6d74\u6ce2\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u6ed1\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u800c\u6d74\u6ce2\u8d21\u732e\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684 Langevin \u63cf\u8ff0\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u957f\u65f6 nonequilibrium \u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5927\u6676\u683c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6adiabatic \u5206\u91cf\u548c\u6280\u672f\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7684 nonequilibrium \u52a8\u529b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Tesseract is a novel Most-Likely-Error (MLE) decoder for QEC that employs the A* search algorithm to explore an exponentially large graph of error hypotheses, achieving high decoding speed and accuracy. This paper presents a systematic approach to optimizing the Tesseract decoder through low-level performance enhancements. Based on extensive profiling, we implemented four targeted optimization strategies, including the replacement of inefficient data structures, reorganization of memory layouts to improve cache hit rates, and the use of hardware-accelerated bit-wise operations. We achieved significant decoding speedups across a wide range of code families and configurations, including Color Codes, Bivariate-Bicycle Codes, Surface Codes, and Transversal CNOT Protocols. Our results demonstrate consistent speedups of approximately 2x for most code families, often exceeding 2.5x. Notably, we achieved a peak performance gain of over 5x for the most computationally demanding configurations of Bivariate-Bicycle Codes. These improvements make the Tesseract decoder more efficient and scalable, serving as a practical case study that highlights the importance of high-performance software engineering in QEC and providing a strong foundation for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces Tesseract, an optimized MLE decoder for Quantum Error Correction that uses A* search to speed up decoding.

In this work, we investigate the effect of cavity induced photon fields on a topological superconductor hosting Majorana bound states (MBS). We model the system using a Peierls substitution of the photonic operator in the kinetic and spin-orbit terms, and utilize an exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian for a finite number of photons to investigate the coupled system. We find that the MBS persist even in the presence of a cavity field and notably appear at finite and tunable energy, in contrast to a usual 1D topological superconductor. The MBS energy is shifted by two processes: the cavity photon energy adds a constant energy shift, while the light-matter interaction induces additional parameter dependencies, such that the MBS experience a pseudo-dispersion as a function of both light-matter interaction and magnetic field. Additionally, we find that the MBS energy oscillations are suppressed with increasing light-matter interaction and that disorder stability is not impacted by the light-matter interaction. Combined, these offer additional tunability and stability of the MBS. As a second result, we establish a modified spectral localizer formalism as an essential tool for topological characterization of quantum matter in a cavity. The spectral localizer allows characterization at arbitrary energies, which is needed for probing different photon sectors. However, hybridization between different photon sectors in the low-frequency regime limits a straightforward application of a standard spectral localizer.

Superconducting qubits are commonly realized using Al/AlO$_{\\text{x}}$/Al Josephson junctions operating in the tunneling regime, where even minor variations in device geometry can lead to substantial performance fluctuations. In this work, we develop a quantitative model for the variability of the Josephson energy $E_{J}$ induced by interface roughness at the Al/AlO$_{\\text{x}}$ interfaces.

Quantum transport is treated using the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation combined with a local thickness approximation. Numerical simulations over $5,000$ Josephson junctions show that $E_{J}$ follows a log-normal distribution. The mean value of $E_{J}$ increases with $\u03c3$ and decreases slightly with $\u03be$, while the variance of $E_{J}$ increases with both $\u03c3$ and $\u03be$.

Integrable singularities (IS) have recently gained attention because they avoid both issues and exhibit finite tidal forces, allowing nondestructive radial infall. First, we present a new BH solution sourced by a string fluid (FS) that exhibits an IS. Motivated by the divergence of the conserved energy in the cloud of strings (CS) model, we introduce an energy density profile based on the screening of the CS energy density within an FS framework, yielding a finite conserved energy. On the other hand, it has been proposed \\cite{Ovalle:2024wtv} that an interior region, rather than a pointlike mass, can generate a Schwarzschild BH exterior region. Secondly, motivated by the variety of BH solutions with singularities in the literature, we establish the conditions that an interior region with an IS must satisfy to represent a generic exterior BH solution, with Schwarzschild being only a particular case of the latter. We derive the junction conditions (JC) between the interior and exterior regions, showing that they lead to temperature continuity at the interface, while discontinuities in tangential pressure lead to phase transitions.

The SHE operates in two steps: first, in the work extraction stage, heat from a thermal energy reservoir is converted into optical work via a two photon Raman transition resonant with close-to energy degenerate spin states; second, the internal spin states are brought back to their initial state via non-energetic information erasure using a spin reservoir. The latter incurs no energy cost, but rather the reset occurs at the cost of angular momentum from a spin bath that acts as the thermal spin reservoir. The SHE represents an important first step toward demonstrating heat engines that operate beyond the conventional paradigm of requiring two thermal reservoirs, paving the way to harness quantum coherence in arbitrary conserved quantities via similar machines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This classification is expressed through the structure of the irrelevant $T\\bar{T}$-like deformations that generate the theories from a Maxwell seed. Using both closed-form and perturbative methods within the Courant-Hilbert (CH) and Russo-Townsend auxiliary field formalisms, we demonstrate a precise correspondence: $\\varphi$-parity-invariant, analytic theories are generated by irrelevant deformations built from integer powers of the energy-momentum tensor scalars, $\\mathcal{O}_\u03bb\\sim \\sum C_m (T_{\u03bc\u03bd}T^{\u03bc\u03bd})^{1-m}({T_\u03bc}^\u03bc{T_\u03bd}^\u03bd)^{m}$.

We prove this result in generality via a perturbative CH framework, showing that $\\varphi$-parity invariance imposes specific constraints on the expansion coefficients of the CH function $\\ell(\u03c4)$ which, in turn, force all half-integer powers in the deformation to vanish. The classification is explicitly verified for known closed-form theories: the analytic generalized Born-Infeld model and the non-analytic examples of the $q=3/4$-deformed and \"no $\u03c4$-maximum\" theories.

In this work, we study the precession of the spherical orbit in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson geometry describing a rotating black hole immersed in a uniform electromagnetic field. Although the timelike geodesics is non-separable, we develop a Hamiltonian approach to investigate the spherical orbits. For sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the study shows that the spherical orbits can only exist within a finite radial range for given orbital inclination. Requiring the existence of the spherical orbits, we obtain an upper bound of the magnetic field, i.e., $B<0.33 M^{-1}$ for prograde and $B<0.0165 M^{-1}$ for retrograde motion. Furthermore, imposing the observed jet precession period, we obtain a significantly tighter constraint, $B\\lesssim 0.0145 M^{-1}$, providing a new constrain on the magnetic field of M87* independent of the shadow.

To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive framework for simulating classes of transport equations, offering both rigorous theoretical guarantees -- including exponential speedups in specific cases -- and a systematic, hardware-efficient implementation.

We observe a robust nonlinear SMOKE signal that scales quadratically with current and persists up to 200 K. Theoretical modeling and scaling analysis indicate that this nonlinear magnetization is dominated by the orbital contribution and is intrinsically linked to the quantum Christoffel symbol.

A specialized paradigm of analogue quantum computing, quantum annealing (QA), has been proposed to solve these problems by encoding optimization problems into physical energy landscapes and solving them by quantum tunnelling systematically through exploration of solution space. This is a critical review that summarizes the current applications of quantum annealing to combinatorial optimization and includes a theoretical background, hardware designs, algorithm implementation strategies, encoding and embedding schemes, protocols to benchmark quantum annealing, areas of implementation, and links with the quantum algorithms implementation with gate-based hardware and classical solvers. We develop a unified framework, relating adiabatic quantum dynamics, Ising and QUBO models, stoquastic and non-stoquastic Hamiltonians, and diabatic transitions to modern flux-qubit annealers (Chimera, Pegasus, Zephyr topologies), and emergent architectures (Lechner-Hauke-Zoller systems, Rydberg atom platforms), and hybrids of quantum and classical computation. Through our analysis, we find that overhead in embedding and encoding is the largest determinant of the scalability and performance (this is not just the number of qubits).

Owing to its integrability, it admits a consistent Bethe Ansatz description and a well-defined thermodynamic limit. Using the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, we analyze the ground state, elementary excitations, and finite-temperature properties.\n  In contrast to the conventional positive spin XXX chain, the negative spin model exhibits a distinct vacuum structure and excitation spectrum, leading to modified TBA equations and unconventional low-temperature behavior. Although the integral equations resemble those of the Lieb-Liniger Bose gas, the thermodynamics and scaling properties are qualitatively different and cannot be continuously connected.\n  We derive the free energy, entropy, and specific heat, and identify a quantum phase transition separating different thermodynamic regimes.

Based on this theoretical foundation, we design a realizable NISQ-friendly pipeline: the Koopman operator functions as a physics-aware \"data distiller,\" compressing waveforms into compact, \"quantum-ready\" features, which are subsequently processed by a modular, parallel quantum neural network. We validated this framework on 4,763 labeled channel sequences from 433 discharges of the tokamak system. The results demonstrate that our model achieves 97.0\\% accuracy in screening corrupted diagnostic data, matching the performance of state-of-the-art deep classical CNNs while using orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable parameters.

Many kinds of closed universe state", "summary": "In this paper we extend recent ideas about observers and closed universes to theories where observers can be fluctuated into existence in the Hartle-Hawking state. This introduces a phenomenon that was not considered in these earlier discussions: the dominant transition from one cosmological state to another can go through a fluctuation that annihilates the universe and creates a new one. We nonetheless argue that the observer decoherence rule allows for the third-quantized description of such a theory to emerge from a factorizing holographic theory with a one-dimensional Hilbert space, without any need for $\u03b1$-parameters. We also point out a close analogy between the observer rule in this context and the coarse-graining of the spectral form factor at late times for AdS black holes. Along the way we clarify several aspects of the relationship between holography, the gravitational path integral, and $\u03b1$-parameters. We also explain why string theory scattering amplitudes do not lead to a one-dimensional Hilbert space on the worldsheet, despite being computed by a gravitational path integral with a sum over topology. Finally we point out that using the path integral to compute integrated local operators conditioned on an observer in the context of a theory with a landscape can lead to rather surprising conclusions.

For many theories, this simplicity can be made manifest using a set of ``cosmological dressing rules'' which uplift flat-space Feynman diagrams to in-in correlators in de Sitter space by attaching auxiliary propagators to the interaction vertices. In this paper, we show that discontinuities of cosmological correlators with respect to internal energy variables can be obtained by applying auxiliary propagators to unitarity cuts of flat space Feynman diagrams. Moreover, discontinuities with respect to external energy variables can be obtained by cutting auxiliary propagators attached to Feynman diagrams. This observation in turn implies highly non-trivial constraints on cosmological correlators in the form of simple sum rules. We illustrate these ideas in a number of examples at tree-level and 1-loop for conformally coupled scalar theories, although they hold more generally. Finally, we show how to reconstruct cosmological correlators from their discontinuities using dispersion relations, providing a powerful new approach to computing cosmological observables by systematically reconstructing them from data uplifted from flat space.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper shows how to compute cosmological correlators in de Sitter space by relating them to flat-space Feynman diagrams, applying auxiliary propagators, and using discontinuities and dispersion relations to reconstruct these correlators.", "motivation": "It's interesting to see connections between de Sitter space physics and flat space QFT, especially using Feynman diagrams for cosmological correlators.", "method": "The method involves applying auxiliary propagators, examining discontinuities, and using dispersion relations to reconstruct correlators from flat-space data.", "result": "They derive simple sum rules and demonstrate the reconstruction approach non-trivially in several examples.", "conclusion": "The paper advances understanding of quantum field theory in cosmological settings, building on flat space methods."}}

The influence of the halo on black hole thermodynamics is analyzed through the mass function, entropy, Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy, allowing us to assess both local and global thermodynamic stability of the black hole-dark matter system. Our results show that the presence of a Dehnen-type halo not only stabilizes the otherwise thermodynamically unstable Schwarzschild black hole but also induces phase transitions. In addition, we study null geodesics to examine photon motion, the shadow radius and the optical appearance of the system. The dark matter halo modifies the effective potential, leading to observable changes in the photon sphere and the apparent size of the shadow. We also explore the instability of circular null geodesics and its relation to quasinormal modes in an eikonal limit.

While simple and effective, this coupling scheme makes it difficult to satisfy competing circuit design requirements such as maintaining large qubit anharmonicity and coherence along with a high degree of qubit connectivity and packing density. Moreover, tunable interactions using linear coupling elements produce dynamical variations in mode hybridization, which can induce non-adiabatic transitions, resulting in leakage errors and limiting gate speeds. In this work we attempt to address these challenges by proposing a junction-based coupling architecture based on SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) couplers with relatively small Josephson energies. SQUID couplers provide intrinsic cross-Kerr interactions that can be controlled by external fluxes and that do not rely on mode hybridization. The small Josephson energies of the coupler maintain the interaction at a perturbative scale, which limits undesired higher-order mixing between coupled elements while achieving a sufficiently strong cross-Kerr interaction originating from diagonal coupling elements. Based on these properties, we show that a SQUID coupler can be used to implement a fast, adiabatic, and high-fidelity controlled-Z gate without introducing extra modes, and the operation is robust against junction asymmetry for high-frequency qubits. Although unconventional crosstalk may arise due to junction asymmetries and parasitic hybridization with spectator qubits, we show that these effects are sufficiently small for realistic circuit parameters. As an example of the utility of such junction-based coupling schemes, we present a scalable tiling strategy for a miniaturized superconducting quantum processor based on merged-element transmon qubits.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The models are confronted with unanchored Pantheon+ Type~Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, compressed Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, and redshift-space distortion data, allowing us to jointly probe the background expansion and the growth of cosmic structures. Two of the three models partially shift the inferred value of $H_0$ towards local measurements, while the third worsens the discrepancy. This behaviour is directly linked to the effective torsional dynamics, with phantom-like regimes favouring higher $H_0$ and quintessence-like regimes producing the opposite effect. A global statistical comparison shows that the minimal $f(T)$ extensions considered here are not favoured over $\u039b$CDM by the combined data. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that late-time torsional modifications can non-trivially redistribute current cosmological tensions among the background and growth sectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c late-time\u5f15\u529b\u4fee\u6539\u5728Teleparallel\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5f53\u524dH0 \u68d8\u624b\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c \u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u589e\u957f\u5c42\u9762\u4e4b\u95f4\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dH0\u77db\u76fe\u662f\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22 late-time\u5f15\u529b\u4fee\u6539\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u4e00\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86f(T)\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86SN Ia\u3001BAO\u3001CMB\u548c\u7ea2\u79fb\u7a7a\u95f4\u7578\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u4e24 \u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u5206\u8c03\u6574\u4e86H0 \u7684\u6700\u4f73\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u7b2c\u4e09\u79cd model \u589e\u5927\u4e86\u77db\u76fe\u3002Phantomlike\u52a8\u6001\u4f7fH0 \u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u800cquintessencelike\u52a8\u6001\u4f7fH0 \u770b\u4e0a\u53bb\u66f4\u5c0f\u3002\u8054\u5408\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u793a\uff0c compared to \u039bCDM\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b f(T) \u5ef6\u8fdf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c late-time torsional\u4fee\u6539\u53ef\u4ee5\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5730\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u77db\u76fe\u5728\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u589e\u957f\u5c42\u9762\u4e4b\u95f4\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u039bCDM\u5728\u8054\u5408\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5e76\u4e0d\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u3002\u4f46\u65e0\u8bba\u600e\u4e48\u6837\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u665a\u65f6\u671f\u671b\u503c\u4fee\u6539\u5982\u4f55\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u3002"}}

Our claim is based on the thorough study of the energy conditions showing the violations of all of them for a FTPR, and only the dominant energy one for an SFS.

Recently, a dissipative diagnostic of chaos has been proposed, in which an infinitesimal coupling to a bath yields a finite Liouvillian gap in chaotic systems, marking the onset of intrinsic relaxation. This raises a conceptual question: what is the minimal departure from Clifford dynamics needed for this intrinsically relaxing behavior to emerge? In this work, we investigate the dynamics under the Floquet two-qubit Clifford circuit interleaved with a finite density of Haar-random single-site gates, followed by a depolarizing channel with strength $\u03b3$. For Floquet Clifford circuits built from an \\textit{i}SWAP-class two-qubit gate, our analysis identifies two distinct regimes for the Liouvillian gap in the thermodynamic limit, exemplified by the undoped and fully doped extreme cases. In both regimes, the dissipative diagnostic signals chaotic behavior, differing only in how the gap scales with system size. In the undoped circuit, the gap scales as $\u0394\\sim \u03b3N$, whereas in the fully doped circuit it remains finite as $N\\to\\infty$. We find that the doping density $p_h$ governs the crossover: as $p_h\\to 0$, any spatial structure remains undoped-like, whereas for finite $p_h$ certain structures can enter a finite-gap regime. These results are analytically established in the strongly dissipative regime $\u03b3\\gg 1$ by deriving lower bounds on the gap as a function of $p_h$ and explicit finite-gap constructions, and their extension toward $\u03b3\\to 0$ is supported by numerics. Importantly, our analytic treatment depends only on the spatial doping structure, so the same gap scaling persists even when the Haar rotations are independently resampled each Floquet period.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u9650\u6b21\u6c2f\u9178\u6839\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u5bf9DNA\u4e0e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u6291\u5236\u5242\u8c03\u8282getter\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u63a7DNA\u4e0e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u67d3\u8272\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "ctrl+alt+delete\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5141\u8bb8\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u63a7\u5236DNA\u4e0e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3DNA\u53d7\u4f53\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u5408\u6210\u548cstructrual biolgy\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684getter\u7c7b\u578b\u6765\u8c03\u8282Cl\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u51c6\u8c03\u8282getter\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728DNA\u53d7\u4f53\u4e2d\u521b\u5efa\u6240\u9700\u8981\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u67d3\u8272\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684getter\u8c03\u63a7\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3aDNA\u4e0e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u64cd\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

A recent paper by Meister et al. [arXiv:2405.07433 (2024)] proposed an efficient method to evaluate soft outputs for cluster-based decoders, including the Union-Find (UF) decoder. However, in parallel computing environments, its computational complexity is comparable to or even surpasses that of the UF decoder itself, resulting in a substantial overhead. Furthermore, this method requires global information about the decoding graph, making it poorly suited for existing hardware implementations of the UF decoder on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). In this paper, to alleviate these issues, we develop more efficient methods for evaluating high-quality soft outputs in cluster-based decoders by introducing several early-stopping techniques. Our central idea is that the precise value of a large soft output is often unnecessary in practice. Based on this insight, we introduce two types of novel soft-outputs: the bounded cluster gap and the extra-cluster gap. The former reduces the computational complexity of Meister's method by terminating the calculation at an early stage. Our numerical simulations show that this method achieves improved scaling with code distance $d$ compared to the original proposal. The latter, the extra-cluster gap, quantifies decoder reliability by performing a small, additional growth of the clusters obtained by the decoder. This approach offers the significant advantage of enabling soft-output computation without modifying the existing architecture of FPGA-implemented UF decoders.

In classes AIII and BDI, we find that the Zak phase effectively detects edge states as a relative boundary topological index, although the correspondence is highly sensitive to the parameters characterizing the truncation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e7f\u4e49Dirac--Kronig--Penney\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u79f0\u7c7b\u4e2d\u4e92\u4e0d\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u79f0\u7c7b\u4e0b\u62d3\u6251\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u79f0\u7c7b\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7c7bAIII\u548c\u7c7bBDI\u7684Zak\u76f8\u4f4d\u5177\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u7c7bD\u4e2dZak\u76f8\u4f4d\u4e3a\u975e\u91cf\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5206\u754c\u9762\u6548\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u622a\u65ad\u4f4d\u7f6e\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e7f\u4e49Dirac--Kronig--Penney\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u79f0\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7c7bAIII\u548c\u7c7bBDI\u4e2d\uff0cZak\u76f8\u4f4d\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fb9\u754c\u9762\u6001\u3002"}}

We also investigate the role of Skip Connections in preserving semantic information during the reverse diffusion process.

Here, we cast quantum circuit synthesis as a closed-loop, test-time optimization problem: an LLM proposes edits to a fixed-length gate list, and an external simulator evaluates the resulting state with the Meyer-Wallach (MW) global entanglement measure. We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments prompts with a score-difference feedback, and applies restart-from-the-best sampling to escape potential plateaus. Across fixed 20-qubit settings, the loop without feedback and restart-from-the-best improves random initial circuits over a range of gate budgets. To lift up this performance and success rate, we use the full learning strategy. For 25-qubit, it mitigates a pronounced performance plateau when naive querying is used. Beyond raw scores, we analyze the structure of synthesized states and find that high MW solutions can correspond to stabilizer or graph-state-like constructions, but full connectivity is not guaranteed due to the metric property and prompt design.

Different techniques exist to mitigate these effects and run larger algorithms. In this work, we analyze one of these techniques called quantum circuit cutting. With circuit cutting, a quantum circuit is decomposed into smaller sub-circuits, each of which can be run on smaller quantum hardware.

This limit defines a new class of quantum Brownian motion, which incorporates both the external and internal degrees of freedom of the Brownian particle. We consider a weakly driven Brownian particle confined in a harmonic potential and dissipatively coupled to a thermal bath. Applying the rotating wave approximation (RWA) to the system-bath interaction Hamiltonian, we derive a completely positive Born-Markov master equation for the reduced dynamics. We express the resulting master equation in the coordinate representation and, utilizing the adiabatic elimination of fast variables, derive a completely positive hybrid quantum-classical master equation that defines OQBM. We illustrate the resulting dynamics using examples of initial Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions of the OQBM walker. Both examples reveal the emergence of Gaussian distributions in the limiting behavior of the OQBM dynamics, which closely matches that of the standard OQBM. With the help of the obtained OQBM master equation, we derive the equations for the $n$-th moments and the cumulants of the position distribution of the open Brownian walker.

By minimizing geometric action, LAUT guarantees dynamical fidelity and inherently enforces the preservation of symmetries--properties frequently violated by conventional Schrieffer-Wolff and Givens rotation techniques. We identify the Bloch-Brandow formalism as the natural perturbative counterpart to this principle, yielding analytic expansions that preserve symmetries to high order. We validate this framework against experimental data from superconducting quantum processors, demonstrating that LAUT quantitatively reproduces interaction rates in driven entangling gates where standard approximations diverge. Furthermore, in tunable coupler architectures, we demonstrate that the LAUT approach captures essential non-rotating-wave contributions that standard models neglect; this inclusion is critical for quantitatively reproducing interaction rates and revealing physical multi-body interactions such as $XZX+YZY$, which are verified to be physical rather than gauge artifacts.

Traditionally, this enhancement is associated with a closing energy gap, which causes the characteristic timescales for adiabatic preparation or relaxation to diverge with increasing system size. Consequently, the apparent growth of the quantum Fisher information largely reflects the increasing evolution time induced by critical slowing down, rather than a genuine gain in metrological performance, thereby severely limiting the practical usefulness of such protocols. Here we show that the relationship between energy-gap variations, quantum Fisher information, and achievable precision is far more subtle in interacting quantum systems: enhanced sensitivity does not require a vanishing gap, and, perhaps more surprisingly, a decreasing quantum Fisher information does not necessarily imply reduced precision once the time is properly taken into account. Building on this insight, we introduce an anti-critical metrology scheme that achieves enhanced precision while the energy gap increases. We illustrate this mechanism using the quantum Rabi model, thereby identifying a route to metrological advantage that avoids the critical slowing down associated with conventional criticality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e34\u754c\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u80fd\u91cf\u95f4\u9699\u53d8\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6216\u4e0d\u4f1a\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u654f\u611f\u5ea6-\u80fd\u91cf\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bd5\u56fe\u89e3\u51b3\u4e34\u754c\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u4e2d\u80fd\u91cf\u95f4\u9699\u53d8\u5c0f\u65f6\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u662f\u5426\u4f9d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50 Fisher \u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cd\u4e34\u754c metrology \u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u53cd\u4e34\u754c metrology \u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u95f4\u9699\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4e34\u754c\u6162\u5316\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e34\u754c\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

These limitations underscore the need for computational approaches that retain first principles physical rigor while enabling efficient and scalable prediction. Motivated by recent advances in quantum algorithms for chemistry, we introduce a variational quantum framework combined with the quantum equation of motion formalism to compute molecular properties and predict ECD spectra, implemented within a multi GPU or QPU accelerated hybrid quantum/classical workflow. We demonstrate its efficient applicability on 12 clinically relevant chiral drug molecules accessing expanded active spaces.

For such cases, the classical Monte Carlo integration procedure provides the state-of-the-art provable, asymptotic performance: polynomial in problem dimension and quadratic in inverse-precision. While quantum algorithms are known to offer quadratic speedups over classical Monte Carlo methods, end-to-end speedups have been proven only in the simplified setting over the Black-Scholes geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model. This paper extends existing frameworks to demonstrate novel quadratic speedups for more practical models, such as the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model and a variant of Heston's stochastic volatility model, utilizing a characteristic of the underlying SDEs which we term fast-forwardability. Additionally, for general models that do not possess the fast-forwardable property, we introduce a quantum Milstein sampler, based on a novel quantum algorithm for sampling L\u00e9vy areas, which enables quantum multi-level Monte Carlo to achieve quadratic speedups for multi-dimensional stochastic processes exhibiting certain correlation types.\n  We also present an improved analysis of numerical integration for derivative pricing, leading to substantial reductions in the resource requirements for pricing GBM and CIR models. Furthermore, we investigate the potential for additional reductions using arithmetic-free quantum procedures. Finally, we critique quantum partial differential equation (PDE) solvers as a method for derivative pricing based on amplitude estimation, identifying theoretical barriers that obstruct achieving a quantum speedup through this approach.

Most existing approaches target phase estimation and rely on a shared phase reference between the signal and the probe, yet many relevant scenarios deal with regimes where such a reference is absent, making the estimation of force or field amplitudes the main task. We study this phase-insensitive regime for bosonic sensors that undergo identical displacements with common phases randomly varying between experimental runs. We derive analytical bounds on the achievable precision and show that it is determined by first-order normal correlations between modes in the probe state, constrained by their average excitations. These correlations yield a collective sensitivity enhancement over the standard quantum limit, with a gain that grows linearly in the total excitation number, revealing a distributed quantum advantage even without a global phase reference. We identify families of multimode states with definite joint parity that saturate this limit and can be probed efficiently via local parity measurements already demonstrated or emerging in several quantum platforms. We further demonstrate that experimentally relevant decoherence channels favor two distinct sensing strategies: splitting of a single-mode nonclassical state among the modes, which is robust to loss and heating, and separable probes, which are instead resilient to dephasing and phase jitter.

However, passive reset occurs on timescales that are much longer than those of gate operations and measurements, making it a significant bottleneck for algorithmic execution. Here, we show that this limitation can be overcome by exploiting the Mpemba effect, originally indicating the faster cooling of hot systems compared to cooler ones. Focusing on the regime where coherence times exceed energy relaxation times ($T_2 > T_1$), we propose a simple protocol based on a single entangling two-qubit gate that converts local single-qubit coherences into fast-decaying global two-qubit coherences. This removes their overlap with the slowest decaying Liouvillian mode and enables a substantially faster relaxation to the ground state. For realistic parameters, we find that our protocol can reduce reset times by up to $50\\%$ compared to standard passive reset. We analyze the robustness of the protocol under non-Markovian noise, imperfect coherent control and finite temperature, finding that the accelerated reset persists across a broad range of realistic error sources. Finally, we present an experimental implementation of our protocol on an IQM superconducting quantum processor. Our results demonstrate how Mpemba-like accelerated relaxation can be harnessed as a practical tool for fast and accurate qubit initialization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528Mpemba\u6548\u5e94\u52a0\u901f\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u91cd\u7f6e\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u91cd\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8650%\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u91cd\u7f6e\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u91cd\u7f6e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8017\u65f6\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Mpemba\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u901f\u91cd\u7f6e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u7ea0\u7f20\u5668\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u79fb\u9664\u6162\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u674e\u4e4c\u7ef4\u6797\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a0\u901f\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u88ab\u52a8\u91cd\u7f6e\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u91cd\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1150%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6709\u9650\u6e29\u5ea6\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u8bef\u5dee\u6e90\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528Mpemba\u6548\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}
