The long-time asymptotics for the defocusing or focusing Manakov system under nonzero background still remains open. In this paper, we derive the long-time asymptotic formula for the solution of the defocusing Manakov system on nonzero boundary conditions and provide a detailed proof. The solution of the defocusing Manakov system on such nonzero background is first transformed into the solution of a $3 \\times 3$ matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. Then we demonstrate how to conduct the Deift-Zhou steepest descent analysis for this Riemann-Hilbert problem, thereby obtaining the long-time asymptotic behavior of the solution in the space-time soliton region. In this region, the leading order of the solution takes the form of a modulated multisoliton.

Biological experiments and computational modeling elucidated the physics of how these spiders use long-timescale web-building behaviors, which occur before prey capture, to modulate vibration sensing of prey by controlling web geometry, materials, and tension distribution. By contrast, the physics of how spiders use short-timescale leg behaviors to modulate vibration sensing on a web during prey capture is less known. This is in part due to challenges in biological experiments (e.g., having little control over spider behavior, difficulty measuring the whole spider-web-prey system vibrations) and theoretical/computation modeling (e.g., close-form equations intractable for a complex web, high computation cost for simulating vibrations with behaving animals). Here, we use robophysical modeling as a complementary approach to address these challenges and study how dynamic leg crouching behavior common in orb-weaving spiders contributes to vibration sensing of prey on a web. We created a robophysical model consisting of a spider robot that can dynamically crouch its legs and sense its leg vibrations and a prey robot that can shake both on a horizontal physical wheel-shaped web. We discovered a physical mechanism that can allow the spider to use leg crouching to detect prey presence and distance. Our work demonstrated that robophysical modeling is a useful approach for discovering physical mechanisms of how spiders use short-time scale leg behaviors to enhance vibration sensing of objects on a web and providing new biological hypotheses.", "AI": {"tldr": "Orb-weaving spiders use dynamic leg crouching to enhance vibration sensing for detecting prey on webs.", "motivation": "The paper explores how orb-weaving spiders sense prey using leg movements, addressing a gap in understanding shorter-term behaviors during prey capture.", "method": "A robophysical model was developed, featuring a spider robot with leg crouching capabilities and a prey robot that shakes on a virtual web.", "result": "The model found that dynamic leg crouching allows spiders to detect prey presence and distance through vibrations.", "conclusion": "This study suggests robophysical modeling as a valuable tool for uncovering physical mechanisms in spider sensory behaviors, providing new biological insights."}}

Building on the quantum-optics approach to acceleration radiation and its near-horizon conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) structure, we show that the dominant physics is again governed by an inverse-square potential in the radial Klein-Gordon equation, with an effective coupling fixed by the Bardeen surface gravity. Using geodesic expansions and a near-horizon CQM reduction of the scalar field, we derive the excitation probability for atoms falling through a Boulware-like vacuum in the presence of a stretched-horizon mirror. The resulting spectrum is Planckian in the mode frequency, with a temperature determined by the Bardeen Hawking temperature.

Although highly powerful, the main limitation of AdS/CFT is that AdS does not appear in the real world outside of very specific limits. This limitation justifies the attempt to generalize the holographic principle to other spacetimes. In this thesis, we will pursue this direction and seek spacetimes that have at least some connection to de Sitter (dS), whose cosmological interest is evident. dS is, in fact, not only the geometry that best represents our Universe on large scales in the present, but also during the inflationary epoch that followed the Big Bang, where our current description of Nature fails completely.\n  First, we will present some basic facts about the AdS/CFT correspondence. Then, the gravitational path integral will be introduced. After presenting the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and dilaton-gravity models, a holographic link between the two will be established. Next, we will discuss the double-scaled limit of SYK, known as DSSYK. We will then consider a ``charged'' variation of SYK with Dirac fermions, for which we will determine the fermionic two-point function. After studying the thermodynamic properties of the gravitational dual of DSSYK and the quasinormal modes of massive real scalars propagating in this geometry, we will conjecture how to modify the duality when considering the Dirac version of the model, showing that several bounds constrain the space of possible dual theories. Finally, we will summarize our findings and present an outlook on possible future developments based on the results described here.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we develop a machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) trained on an existing density functional theory dataset (\\textit{Angew.\\ Chem.\\ Int.\\ Ed.}, \\textbf{63} , e202410088 (2024)), achieving reasonable accuracy at a computational cost much lower than the existing machine-learned and empirical potentials. Leveraging this potential, we perform large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model the thermal reduction of GO across realistic structural domains. Using the homogeneous nonequilibrium MD method with a proper quantum-statistical correction scheme, we find that reduced GO exhibits strongly suppressed thermal conductivities, ranging from a few to tens of Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, substantially lower than pristine GO without defects and far below graphene. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of reduced GO increases moderately with increasing OH/O ratio, except at the highest oxidation level (O/C=0.5) where this trend inverts, while decreasing significantly with increasing O/C ratio, a trend strongly correlated with the fraction of recovered graphene-like structures.

However, laser-induced energy modulation inevitably degrades electron beam quality by increasing energy spread. In this paper, a straightforward yet practical implementation method for verifying the electron beam demodulation process in seeded FELs is proposed. The method employs a dedicated demodulation undulator system, referred to as a demodulator, equipped with a phase shifter. Both one-dimensional analytical models and three-dimensional simulations demonstrate that introducing a $\u03c0$ phase shift in the demodulator enables simultaneous energy modulation and demodulation using only a single seed laser. Under optimized conditions with weak initial modulation, simulation results indicate that the energy modulation can be substantially reduced or nearly eliminated. With increasing laser intensity, the modulation amplitude is significantly suppressed by more than an order of magnitude, effectively mitigating energy spread degradation. The residual energy modulation can be characterized using complementary diagnostic techniques: the coherent undulator radiation method combined with the dispersion scan method.

They occur close to the magnetic $T_c$ in low carrier density local moment magnets when the electron-spin coupling is comparable to the hopping scale. In non disordered systems the primary signatures are a modest non-monotonicity in the temperature dependent resistivity $\u03c1(T)$, and a magnetoresistance that can be $\\sim 20-30 \\%$ at $T_c$, at fields that, in energy units, are $\\sim 0.01 k_BT_c$. We find that structural disorder, in the form of pinning centers, promotes polaron formation, hugely increases the resistivity peak at $T_c$, and can enhance the magnetoresistance to $\\sim 80\\%$. The change in magnetoresistance with disorder is, however, non-monotonic. Too much disorder just creates an Anderson insulator - with the resistivity unresponsive to the magnetisation.

Recent spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) excel in multi-node optimization and spin glass simulations, leveraging their large-scale and fully connected characteristics. However, existing laser diffraction-based SPIMs usually sacrifice time efficiency or spin count to encode high-rank spin-spin coupling and external fields, limiting their scalability for real-world applications. Here, we demonstrate an amplitude-only modulated rank-free spatial photonic Ising machine (AR-SPIM) with 200 iterations per second. By re-formulating an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian as the sum of Hadamard products, followed by loading the corresponding matrices/vectors onto an aligned amplitude spatial light modulator and digital micro-mirrors device, we directly map a 797-spin Ising model with external fields (nearly 9-bit precision, -255 to 255) into an incoherent light field, eliminating the need for repeated and auxiliary operations. Serving as encoding accuracy metrics, the linear coefficient of determination and Pearson correlation coefficient between measured light intensities and Ising Hamiltonians exceed 0.9800, with values exceed 0.9997 globally. The AR-SPIM achieves less than 0.3% error rate for ground-state search of biased Max-cut problems with arbitrary ranks and weights, enables complex phase transition observations, and facilitates scalable spin counts for sparse Ising problems via removing zero-valued Hadamard product terms.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We introduce GraviBERT, a novel deep learning framework for inference of gravitational-wave time series, which relies on an Inception-inspired multi-scale convolutional feature extractor combined with a transformer encoder and a suitable regression head. GraviBERT is trained in two stages: a BERT-style pretraining phase, in which the model learns to predict masked segments in feature space to capture universal patterns and physics, followed by supervised fine-tuning for accurate parameter estimation. This approach demonstrates impressive improvement across multiple metrics compared to training from scratch. On in-domain data, it reduces the mean absolute error for point-estimate parameter inference by up to $30\\%$, and training convergence accelerates by up to a factor of six. Moreover, at low signal-to-noise ratio, the mean relative precision of the inferred masses and distances reaches the few-percent level, while the mean absolute error in the effective spin is about $10^{-3}$. For domain adaptation to new detector noise profiles, the pretrained model demonstrates remarkable efficiency, converging up to $15\\times$ faster on small target datasets and reducing estimation errors by up to approximately $45\\%$, indicating that it learns sufficient detector-agnostic representations.

In this work, we investigate the interaction dynamics of two Neel-type skyrmions in an ultrathin ferromagnetic film through a combined analytical and numerical approach. Full micromagnetic simulations reveal that when the initial separation exceeds twice the skyrmion radius, the pair undergoes a repulsive interaction leading to an outward spiral trajectory whose radial and angular components depend sensitively on the Gilbert damping, consistent with particle-like models of skyrmion motion. The simulations further show a two-component oscillatory behaviour in the out-of-plane magnetization: a fast intrinsic breathing mode superimposed on a slower interaction-induced modulation. Using Thiele collective-coordinate model, an expression for the radial drift, angular decay, and logarithmic growth of the separation distance is derived. The analytical predictions show excellent agreement with numerical results, confirming the exponential form of the long-range interaction potential. A continuum micromagnetic analysis of the skyrmion tail explains the origin of the exponential decay and its role in governing the interaction strength. Together, these findings provide a unified framework for understanding spiral motion, breathing dynamics, and long-range repulsion in interacting skyrmion systems, offering insights relevant for multi-skyrmion information carriers and collective skyrmion-based devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5929 Skyrmions \u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u7c92\u5b50\u6837\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d85\u8584\u94c1\u78c1\u7247\u4e2d\u4e24\u79cd Neel \u7c7b Skyrmions \u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u521d\u59cb\u5206\u79bb\u8ddd\u79bb\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e24\u500d Skyrmions \u534a\u5f84\u65f6\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u53d1\u751f\u6392\u65a5\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5411\u5916\u87ba\u65cb\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5176\u5f84\u5411\u548c\u89d2\u5411\u5206\u91cf\u5bf9 Gilbert \u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u7b26\u5408 Skyrmions \u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u8fd8\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u9762\u5916\u78c1\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u632f\u8361\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u6da8\u7f29\u6a21\u5f0f\u53e0\u52a0\u5728\u7f13\u6162\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u4e0a\u3002\u5229\u7528 Thiele \u96c6\u4f53\u5750\u6807\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5f84\u5411\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u89d2\u5411\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u589e\u957f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u52bf\u7684\u6307\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790 Skyrmion \u5c3e\u90e8\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5fae\u78c1\u5b66\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u652f\u914d\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7efc\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3 Skyrmions \u7684\u87ba\u65cb\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u547c\u5438\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u6392\u65a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u591a Skyrmions \u4fe1\u606f\u8f7d\u4f53\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e Skyrmions \u7684\u96c6\u4f53 Skyrmion \u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u662f\u672a\u6765\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d Skyrmions \u4f5c\u4e3a\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24 Neel \u7c7b Skyrmions \u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5fae\u78c1\u5b66\u4eff\u771f\u548c Thiele \u96c6\u4f53\u5750\u6807\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u5230 Skyrmions \u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "1. \u4e24 Neel \u7c7b Skyrmions \u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5206\u79bb\u8ddd\u79bb\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e24\u500d Skyrmions \u534a\u5f84\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\u6392\u65a5\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5448\u73b0\u5411\u5916\u87ba\u65cb\uff0c\u5176\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e Gilbert \u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\u30022. \u5e73\u9762\u5916\u78c1\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e8c\u7ef4\u632f\u8361\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5feb\u901f\u672c\u5f81\u6da8\u7f29\u6a21\u5f0f\u53e0\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f13\u6162\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8c03\u5236\u30023.

We investigate this model in the grand canonical ensemble by introducing a fermionic infinite projected entangled simplex state (iPESS) approach, which offers direct access to the stability of the emergent correlated states at the thermodynamic limit. Through numerically optimizing fermionic iPESS, we accurately capture the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase in the Mott insulating regime, characterized by a uniform chiral order, entanglement spectrum and the appearance of gossamer correlation tails in spin channel. The intermediate-$U$ CSL is separated from the weak-$U$ Chern insulator by a Mott transition at $U_{c_1} \\approx 11.5$, signaled by changes in the charge fluctuation and compressibility. Finite-correlation-length scaling of the magnetization reveals a transition into a large-$U$ $120^\\circ$ N\u00e9el phase at $U_{c_2} \\approx 22.5$. Remarkably, with finite hole doping $\u03b4$, we identify a uniform superconducting state with a finite pairing amplitude, whose order parameter displays a nearly universal phase winding across the $U$-$\u03b4$ phase diagram.

As of yet, this mass has not been observed in a superfluid. However, ultracold Fermi gases provide a promising platform in which recently much experimental progress was made, offering tunability of the interaction as well as control on the single-vortex level. Not only can the scattering length be freely tuned, allowing exploration of the BEC-BCS crossover, but also an imbalance between different pseudospin states can be introduced. We study the effect of introducing this imbalance on the vortex mass, using a method based on an effective field theory for superfluid Fermi gases. We find that it is crucial to consider the imbalance in conjunction with nonzero temperatures; at some temperatures, the vortex mass is significantly enhanced while at others, the vortex mass is diminished. This pronounced temperature dependence highlights the need for careful tuning of experimental conditions and identifies favorable parameter regimes in which the vortex mass is likely to be observed.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

On many platforms, accessible Hamiltonians are largely restricted to one- and two-body interactions, limiting access to multi-body Hamiltonians and to systems governed by simultaneous, non-commuting interaction terms that are central to condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and high-energy physics. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate a hybrid digital-analog protocol that overcomes these limitations by embedding analog evolution between shallow entangling-gate layers. This method produces effective Hamiltonians with simultaneous non-commuting three- and four-body interactions that are generated non-perturbatively and without Trotter error -- capabilities not practically attainable on near-term hardware using purely digital or purely analog schemes. We implement our scheme on a trapped-ion quantum processor and use it to realize a topological spin chain exhibiting prethermal strong zero modes persisting at high temperature, as well as models featuring three- and four-body interactions.

Yet, whereas quantization is investigated thoroughly, transport properties related to the phase of charge carriers remains unexplored. Here, we study quantum coherent transport in mesoscopic Hall bars fabricated from thick exfoliated MnBi2Te4 flakes, and reveal the longest phase-coherence length ever observed in a mesoscopic magnet (about 500nm at 1K), associated to 2D topological surface states. In the fully-coherent regime, significant non-local contributions to quantum interference up to the micron scale lead to giant-amplitude universal conductance fluctuations (about 20e2/h). In the self-averaging regime, the statistical properties of conductance fluctuations confirm the 2D nature of quantum interference and different dephasing mechanisms are identified, as due to either magnetism or magnetic flux through coherent loops. Remarkably, the weak decoherence in magnetic topological insulator nanostructures show their potential to realize novel quantum spin interferometers based on dephasing by local magnetic textures at liquid-helium temperatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u78c1\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u539a\u81f4\u5bc6\u7684MnBi2Te4\u7247\u4e2d\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u5fae\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u957f\u76f8\u5e72\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u5728\u81ea\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u963b\u5c3c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4e0e\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u73af\u8def\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u901a\u6709\u5173\u3002\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u5e72\u6d89\u5668\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u5e72\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65e5\u76ca\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5728\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u963b\u5c3c\u673a\u5236\u53d8\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a2\u67e5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6750\u6599\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5236\u5907\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u539a\u81f4\u5bc6MnBi2Te4\u7247\u7684\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784 Hall-bars\uff0c\u4eb2\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u5236\u5907\u6790\u51fa\u5c42\u72b6\u7247\uff0c\u8868\u5f81\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u5f81\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4eea\u5668\u5305\u62ec\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c (TEM)\u548c Transportspectroscopy\uff08ps qr\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca cryogenic \u8bbe\u5907\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u901a\u8fc7 Hall-effect\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u72ec\u4e00\u65e0\u4e8c\u7684\u8868\u9762\u6001\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728Hallbars\u4e2d\u6d4b\u5b9a\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u963b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u963b\u5c3c\u957f\u5ea6\u662f500\u7eb3\u7c73\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u8981\u957f\u3002\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u6548\u5e94\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5fae\u7c73\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc720e2/h\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u91cf\u5316\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002\u5728\u81ea\u5e73\u6ed1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u78c1\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u963b\u5c3c\u673a\u5236\u3002\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u6750\u6599\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u963b\u5c3c\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u78c1\u6027\u4e8c\u7ef4\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u78c1\u6027\u5668\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u963b\u5c3c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6750\u6599;m \u5341\u4e8c\u5e74\u540e\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u51ed\u501f\u5176\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u957f\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u957f\u5ea6\uff0cMnBi2Te4 \u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u78c1\u6027\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u6750\u6599\u3002"}}

Yet, how soft surfaces govern bacterial dynamics and their self-organisation into colonies remains poorly understood. Using experiments and agent-based modelling, we report the self-organisation of bacterial cells into nascent biofilms on soft substrates. By tuning the elastic modulus over two orders of magnitude, we show that the colony morphology, spreading dynamics and collective behaviour depend on the substrate stiffness, wherein softer surfaces promote slowly expanding, geometrically anisotropic, multilayered colonies, while harder substrates drive rapid, isotropic expansion of bacterial monolayers before multilayer structures emerge. Supported a cell mechanical model and two-dimensional agent-based simulations, our results identify that anisotropic drag forces on soft substrates, emerging due to local deformations, underpin colony anisotropy and swift verticalisation. In contrast, reduced drag on hard surfaces allows rapid expansion of monolayers, thus delaying the transition to a multilayer structure. Surface compliance, a key but overlooked determinant of early-stage biofilm development, could be harnessed to engineer biofilm structures and dynamics for nature-inspired and biomedical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8868\u9762\u7684\u751f\u7269\u819c\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u751f\u957f\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u5176\u5f39\u6027\u6a21\u91cf\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u786c\u8868\u9762\u5219\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5355\u5c42\u819c\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u8f6f\u8868\u9762\u5219\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u5c42\u819c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8868\u9762\u7684\u751f\u7269\u819c\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u751f\u957f\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u73af\u5883\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eagent\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u4e0d\u540c\u5f39\u6027\u6a21\u91cf\u7684 soft substrates\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ec6\u83cc\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u751f\u957f\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002\u5229\u7528 X \u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04 (XRD) \u5206\u6790\u3001\u843d\u5728\u751f\u5316\u6ee4\u819c\u4e0a\u7684\u7ec6\u83ccailing \u6210\u50cf\u548c\u4f53\u5916\u6210\u819c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u3002 ", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ec6\u83cc\u5728\u8f6f\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5f62\u6210\u591a\u5c42\u751f\u7269\u819c\uff0c\u4e14 anisotropic \u963b\u529b\u5bf9\u8f6f\u8868\u9762\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u7269\u819c\u7684 anisotropic \u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u5782\u76f4\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u5728\u786c\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ec6\u83cc\u66f4\u5177isotropic \u6269\u5f20\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u591a\u5c42\u819c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8868\u9762\u7684\u751f\u7269\u819c\u7684 Preliminary \u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u751f\u7269\u819c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We then reflect on how background media change atom-atom excited-state systems. To highlight the impact of nonlocal media, such as salt solutions, we predict that a new contribution to the resonance interaction energy emerges in a form $\\propto e^{-\u03ba_{\\rm D} \u03c1}/\u03c1$. Here $\u03ba_{\\rm D}$ is the Debye length and $\u03c1$ is the distance between the atoms. This contribution vanishes at zero temperature, where a new term proportional to $1/\u03c1^4$ (similar to free space) occurs. This new term is dampened by the electrolyte at large distances, causing it to decrease much faster, proportional to $1/\u03c1^7$.

In discrete lattices, however, its realization can deviate markedly from the continuous case, especially in the presence of nontrivial momentum-space band touchings. Here, we investigate angular momentum conservation associated with quadratic band-touching points (QBTPs) in two-dimensional lattices. We show that, unlike in graphene lattices hosting linear band-touching points (LBTPs), the conventional angular momentum is no longer conserved near QBTPs. Instead, we identify a generalized total angular momentum (GTAM) that remains conserved for both LBTPs and QBTPs, inherently determined by the topological winding number at the band-touching point (BTP). Using a photonic Kagome lattice, we experimentally demonstrate GTAM conservation through pseudospin-orbital angular momentum conversion. Furthermore, we show that this conservation principle extends to a broad class of discrete lattices with arbitrary pseudospin textures and higher-order winding numbers. These results reveal a fundamental link between pseudospin, angular momentum, and topology, establishing a unified framework for angular-momentum dynamics in discrete systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u5e26\u89e6\u70b9\uff08LBTP\uff09\u5982 Graphene \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e8c\u6b21\u80fd\u5e26\u89e6\u70b9\uff08QBTP\uff09\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u5e76\u975e\u5b88\u6052\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e00\u79cd\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684\u603b\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\uff08GTAM\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u5b88\u6052\u6027\u4e0e\u5e03\u6d1b\u8d6b\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u62d3\u6251 winding \u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u5173\u5149\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u7684\u4f53\u73b0\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5e26\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u5e26\u89e6\u70b9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528 Kagome \u5149\u6676\u683c\u8fd9\u4e00\u901a\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f2a\u81ea\u65cb-\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u8f6c\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u603b\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u7684\u63a8\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u5316\u5730\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u8bba\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4efb\u610f\u4f2a\u81ea\u65cb\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This review first lays out the SM+GR+$\u039b$CDM baseline, the best current evidence for its parameters, and the concrete anomalies and missing ingredients. It then surveys the most relevant theoretical directions (effective field theories; amplitude/positivity programs; lattice and many-body methods; symmetry-based model building; cosmological EFTs; quantum information approaches to QFT/gravitation) and the experimental/observational landscape, including ground and space platforms, astronomical messengers, and in-situ tests.

Using the Fubini-Study formalism, we derive the metric tensor of the associated quantum state manifold and compute the corresponding Riemann curvature. Our analysis reveals that the system evolves over a smooth, compact, two-dimensional manifold with spherical topology and a dumbbell-like structure shaped by collective spin interactions. We further investigate the influence of the geometry and topology of the resulting state space on the behavior of geometric and topological phases acquired by the system. We explore how this curvature constrains the system's dynamical behavior, including its evolution speed and Fubini-Study distance between the quantum states. Within this geometric framework, we address the quantum brachistochrone problem and derive the minimal time required for optimal evolution, a result useful for time-efficient quantum circuit design. Subsequently, we explore the role of entanglement in shaping the state space geometry, modulating geometric phase, and controlling evolution speed and brachistochrone time. Our results reveal that entanglement enhances dynamics up to a critical threshold, beyond which geometric constraints begin to hinder evolution. Moreover, entanglement induces critical shifts in the geometric phase, making it a sensitive indicator of entanglement levels and a practical tool for steering quantum evolution.

Here, we demonstrate an on-chip quadratically nonlinear photodetector (QNPD) by configuring an InSe p-i-n homojunction on a silicon waveguide. Telecom-band light guiding in the waveguide couples with the InSe evanescently and is frequency up-converted into visible light via InSe's second-harmonic generation (SHG), which is subsequently absorbed by InSe and finally generates photocurrent under the built-in electric field of the p-i-n homojunction. Governed by these sequential processes, the on-chip QNPD presents a quadratic function between photocurrent and optical power. Thanks to the efficient SHG and well-established homojunction in InSe, the QNPD reaches a high normalized responsivity of 37.1 A/W2 and low dark current of 1 pA, representing greatly improved performances among reported nonlinear photodetectors. Benefiting from the extra SHG process, the on-chip QNPD intrinsically incorporates light-light interactions, enabling straightforwardly monitoring all-optically mixing signals electrically. As an example, an array of 16-pixel QNPDs was designed to implement a fully single-shot on-chip autocorrelator without requirement of bulky optics and external cameras, which precisely measures picosecond pulses with high sensitivity of 6.1*10-10 W2.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u6b21\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff08QNPD\uff09\u7684\u5149\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5149\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5149-sensitive\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5149-\u7535\u6df7\u5408\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7845\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4e0a\u5e03\u7f6eInSe p-i-n\u540c\u8f74\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528InSe\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u8c10\u6ce2\u751f\u6210\u5c06\u901a\u5e26\u5149\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5728p-i-n\u7ed3\u6784\u5185\u7f6e\u7535\u573a\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u5149\u751f\u7535\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u8be5QNPD\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e8c\u6b21\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u8fbe37.1A/W\u00b2\uff0c\u6697\u7535\u6d41\u4f4e\u81f31pA\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5149\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u4e8c\u6b21\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5149\u4fe1\u53f7\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

An inner dense silica layer preserves the intrinsic properties of NV centers, while an outer porous silica layer facilitates efficient adsorption and stabilization of hydroxyl radicals and their precursor reactants.

The radical production is monitored in real time and in situ through spin-dependent T1 relaxometry of the NV centers, demonstrating stable and tunable radical fluxes, with concentration tunable across a continuous range from approximately 100 mM to molar levels by adjusting the catalyst condition.

Compared to chemical or mechanical approaches, ultrafast optical excitation further promises a path to create and manipulate novel non-equilibrium phases with ultimate spatiotemporal precision. However, achieving a truly nonvolatile electronic phase transition in laser-excited Mott systems remains an elusive challenge. Here, we present a highly robust and reversible method for optical control of the Mott state in van der Waals systems. Specifically, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe a nonvolatile Mott-to-metallic transition in the ultrafast laser-excited charge density wave (CDW) material 1T-TaSe2. Complementary theoretical calculations reveal that this transition originates from a rearrangement of the interlayer CDW stacking. This new stacking order, formed following the ultrafast quenching of the CDW, circumvents the need for large-scale atomic sliding. Intriguingly, it introduces a significant in-plane component to the electron hopping and effectively reduces the ratio of on-site Coulomb interaction to bandwidth, thereby suppressing the Mott state and stabilizing a metallic phase.

Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a compact, programmable photonic integrated circuit (PIC) architecture that operates on both spatial and frequency degrees of freedom by leveraging embedded optical feedback loops. This architecture enables universal linear unitary transforms by combining resonators with passive linear mixing layers and tunable active phase layers. The strong dispersion achieved from the resonant loops enables multi-frequency operation and reduces the number of required active layers to achieve universality. This solution reduces the optical port requirements, minimizes power losses, and leverages resonances to enable massive parallel computing in the frequency domain. The fabricated samples are compatible with silicon-on-insulator platforms and operate at single- and dual-frequency modes. The experimental setup demonstrates the ability to perform in situ training in both cases, validating the parallel-computing capabilities of the PICs. This work highlights the potential of feedback-loop PICs for scalable, compact, and energy-efficient linear optical computing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In both settings, integrating out the dilaton or a minisuperspace variable produces a functional delta that enforces the classical constraint equation, thereby localizing the remaining path integral onto classical configurations. The associated Jacobian, equivalently, the functional determinant of the operator obtained by linearizing the constraint about the classical solution, fixes the semiclassical prefactor and the correct measure. We evaluate this determinant exactly via the Gelfand-Yaglom method and obtain the fully normalized fixed-lapse propagators. We further extend the JT analysis to a quadratic dilaton potential $U(\u03c6)=m^{2}\u03c6^{2}$ and comment on the corresponding saddle-point structure of the lapse integral. Finally, we apply the same approach to Bianchi IX quantum cosmology and derive the fixed-lapse propagator, including its prefactor.

We can reconsider this idea in a BIon system. A Bion is formed from two branes that are connected by a wormhole. Our universe may live on one of these branes. Each brane could be formed by joining lower-dimensional branes, such as $D_1$ ones. By joining $D_1$ branes, a $D_n$ brane is formed, and some amounts of energy are released. Then, perhaps some dimensions are compacted, and a certain amount of energy is released. These energies cause a significant difference between the number of degrees of freedom on the surface and in the bulk of branes. This causes the evolution of the universe and many changes in thermodynamic parameters, such as entropy, as well as cosmic parameters, including the Hubble constant.

Quantum embedding (QE) theories address this limitation by mapping the system onto an auxiliary embedding Hamiltonian (EH) describing fragment-environment interactions, but the EH is typically large and its iterative solution is the primary computational bottleneck. We introduce a linear foundation model for QE that utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) to compress the space of quantum states needed to solve the EH within a small variational subspace. Using a data-driven active-learning scheme, we learn this subspace from EH ground states and reduce each embedding solve to a deterministic ground-state eigenvalue problem in the reduced space. Within the ghost Gutzwiller approximation (ghost-GA), we show for a three-orbital Hubbard model that a variational space learned on a Bethe lattice is transferable to square and cubic lattices without additional training, while substantially reducing the cost of the EH step. We further validate the approach on plutonium, where a single variational space reproduces the energetics of all six crystalline phases while reducing the cost of the EH solution by orders of magnitude.

Here, we present an analytical inverse-design approach based on non-Hermitian zero-index networks, which enables arbitrary reflectionless routing for nearly any desired scattering response. By establishing a direct algebraic mapping between target scattering responses and the network's physical parameters, we transform the design process from iterative optimization into deterministic calculation. This approach enables the precise engineering of arbitrary reflectionless optical routing. We demonstrate its broad utility by designing devices from unicast and multicast routers with full amplitude and phase control to coherent beam combiners and spatial mode demultiplexers in four-port and six-port networks. Our work provides a systematic and analytical route to designing advanced light-control devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Such geometry may be represented by an exotic compact object. Because the horizon is enclosed by a photon sphere, it is difficult to probe this region directly. In this paper, we develop a method to study the region inside the photon sphere by applying the AdS/CFT correspondence. We extract signatures of the modified geometry from the retarded Green functions of the dual conformal field theory. The retarded Green functions can be computed from bulk wave functions of scalar field. We show that exotic compact objects leave two characteristic imprints: bulk-cone singularities and echoes. The bulk-cone singularities correspond to null geodesics in the bulk, allowing us to detect null trajectories that are specific to exotic compact objects. The echoes arise from wave modes trapped inside the photon sphere, and thus signal the absence of a horizon. As concrete examples, we study AdS gravastar and AdS wormhole.

Such generalized symmetries lead to exotic phases of matter and excitations that defy Landau's original paradigm. Here, we develop an algebraic framework for systematically deriving the fusion rules of topological defects in higher-dimensional lattice systems with non-invertible generalized symmetries, and focus on a (2+1)-dimensional quantum Ising plaquette model as a concrete illustration. We show that bond-algebraic automorphisms, when combined with the so-called half-gauging procedure, reveal the structure of the non-invertible duality symmetry operators, which can be explicitly represented as a sequential quantum circuit.

Detecting such long-lived signals, however, remains challenging. Here, we adapt standard methods used in searches for quasi-monochromatic signals to search for mini-EMRIs, and derive a statistical framework that explicitly handles spectral leakage. In particular, we introduce a new method that sums along the tracks in the time-frequency plane carved out by possible mini-EMRI signals, which we call $\u03a3$Track. This refinement establishes a general basis for analyzing long-duration transient signals with rapid frequency evolutions, regardless of the underlying mechanism for gravitational-wave emission. We also compute a new semi-analytic sensitivity estimate within our new statistical framework, which is valid under the assumption that the signal is weak with respect to the noise level.

In this letter, we propose a general and explicit construction recipe for QECCs from a total of D classical codes for arbitrary D. Following this recipe guarantees the obtainment of a QECC within the stabilizer formalism and nearly exhausts all possible constructions. As examples, we demonstrate that our construction recovers the HGP construction when D = 2 and leads to four distinct types of constructions for D = 3, including a previously studied case as one of them. When the input classical codes are repetition codes, our D = 3 constructions unify various three-dimensional lattice models into a single framework, encompassing the three-dimensional toric code model, a fracton model, and two other intriguing models not previously investigated. Among these, two types of constructions exhibit a trade-off between code distance and code dimension for a fixed number of qubits by adjusting the lengths of the different classical codes, and the optimal choice can simultaneously achieve relatively large values for both code distance and code dimension. Our general construction protocol provides another perspective for enriching the structure of QECCs and enables the exploration of richer possibilities for good codes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This paper develops two complementary quantum formulations of the NDWT that embed these classical properties coherently into quantum computation. The first formulation is based on the epsilon-decimated interpretation of the NDWT and realizes all circularly shifted wavelet transforms simultaneously by promoting the shift index to a quantum register and applying controlled circular shifts followed by a wavelet analysis unitary. The resulting construction yields an explicit, fully unitary quantum representation of redundant wavelet coefficients and supports coherent postprocessing, including quantum shrinkage via ancilla-driven completely positive trace preserving maps. The second formulation is based on the Hadamard test and uses diagonal phase operators to probe scale-shift wavelet structure through interference, providing direct access to shift-invariant energy scalograms and multiscale spectra without explicit coefficient reconstruction. Together, these two approaches demonstrate that redundancy and translation invariance can be exploited rather than avoided in the quantum setting.

In magnetic topological insulators, dissipationless edge states give functional devices in zero magnetic field, of interest for quantum metrology (resistance standard) or topological electronics (Chern networks). Here we show that a new generation of simple quantum circuits (disk, ring) with non-Hermitian topology, based on the interconnection of 1D Chern states in the quantum anomalous Hall regime, can have a much stronger quantization of their invariant than that of the Chern invariant itself, when measured in a non-metrology grade setup - that is, in industry-relevant conditions. Remarkably, the chirality-related topological skin effect is realized without the need of a magnetic field or an electrical gate, with a record degree of localization for a quantum Hall device. This new type of topological quantum devices based on magnets, with an exponential response that can be switched at small magnetic fields (about 200mT), can operate at liquid-Helium temperature with a good quantization and have some potential as cryogenic sensors for applications in high-precision impedance or magnetic field measurements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e1D Chern\u6001\u7684\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5982\u78c1\u5706\u76d8\u548c\u78c1\u73af\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f3a\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4f4e\u6e29 cryogenic \u611f\u5e94\u5668\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u6750\u6599\u548c\u65b0\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u548c\u7535\u5b50 devices\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c061D Chern\u6001\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u53cd\u5e38\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u76f8\u4e92\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5706\u76d8\u548c\u73af\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u5916\u52a0\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u65e0\u9700\u7535\u95e8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u76ae\u5c42\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u578b\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u5728\u975e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eChern\u6570\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5c40\u57df\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6db2\u6c26\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u5728\u5c0f\u4e8e200mT\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e cryogenic \u7cbe\u51c6\u611f\u5e94\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, detecting such systems, which could spend hours to years in LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA data, poses a computational challenge to standard matched-filtering methods. However, semi-coherent methods are constrained by the quasi-monochromatic assumption, which restricts the coherence time to avoid spectral leakage caused by frequency evolution. In this work, we extend the development of our method, $\u03a3$Track, to the regime in which the quasi-monochromatic approximation is relaxed, in two ways. First, we establish an analytical model for the spectral leakage, extending the validity of conventional analyses beyond the quasi-monochromatic regime. Second, we propose the $\u03a3R$ statistic -- a novel detection metric formed by a weighted summation of power ratios -- which effectively recovers the signal energy dispersed across adjacent frequency bins. Building on this framework, we further introduce an innovative frequency-layered search strategy that dynamically optimizes the coherence time across the observation band. We benchmark our method against a globally optimized Hough transform pipeline using a fiducial mini-EMRI signal from a binary with masses $(1.5, 10^{-5})\\,M_\\odot$. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves an order-of-magnitude enhancement in the effective detection volume, significantly expanding the horizon for discovering mini-EMRIs and sub-solar exotic compact objects with ground-based gravitational wave detectors.

We show that these experimental observations are well-captured by the layered t-J-V model, which extends the standard t-J framework to include the long-range Coulomb interaction V and the layered structure.\n  This new perspective elucidates how charge dynamics renormalizes one-particle excitation properties, leading to several profound and often counterintuitive consequences. We demonstrate that the electron dispersion does not exhibit a sharp kink, and Landau quasiparticles persist in the low-energy limit despite a significant suppression of their spectral weight. We further show that while charge fluctuations alone cannot fully account for the pseudogap, they are a crucial component for understanding its formation. Additionally, we reveal that optical plasmon excitations generate fermionic quasiparticles, known as plasmarons, which give rise to a distinct, incoherent replica band.\n  We argue that accurately describing these plasmonic effects requires a three-dimensional theoretical approach. This perspective on plasmon excitations may offer a critically new clue to a long-standing puzzle: why multi-layer cuprate superconductors, containing more than two CuO2 layers per unit cell, consistently exhibit a higher critical temperature Tc than their single-layer counterparts.

An example of such a scenario is a binary black hole (BBH) merging near a supermassive black hole, which is touted to occur frequently. The limited low-frequency sensitivity of current GW detectors makes it challenging to detect these effects, as the associated waveform phase remains elusive. However, next-generation (3G) detectors such as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), with improved sensitivity at lower frequencies, are expected to be capable of capturing such signatures. In our study, we focus on the stellar-mass BBHs and explore the parameter space where the CoM acceleration will play a dominant role affecting parameter inference of the binary. We demonstrate that an unaccounted CoM acceleration of a low-mass binary with a total mass of $5\\, \\rm{M}_{\\odot} $ can lead to significant systematic biases, exceeding statistical errors in the estimation of the chirp mass and symmetric mass ratio when the CoM parameter $\u03b1$ is as small as $\\sim 10^{-9}$ and $10^{-10}$ $\\rm{s}^{-1}$ for CE and ET, respectively. We also find that asymmetric binaries are more susceptible to systematic bias when CoM acceleration is neglected. When the effect of CoM acceleration is included in the GW phase, then $\u03b1= 10^{-7} \\rm s^{-1}$ can be constrained with a bound of $10^{-9} (10^{-11})\\, \\rm s^{-1}$ for CE (ET).

Advances in this field have clarified that doped charges in cuprates exhibit remarkably rich collective behavior, governed by the combined effects of strong electronic correlations, the intrinsic layered crystal structure, and long-range Coulomb interaction. First, the emergence of acousticlike plasmons has been firmly established through quantitative analyses of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra based on the t-J-V model -- an extension of the conventional t-J model that incorporates the layered crystal structure and the long-range Coulomb interaction V. These acousticlike plasmons arise near the in-plane momentum q=(0,0) and possess characteristic energies far below the well-known ~ 1 eV optical plasmon. This behavior is found to be universal across both hole- and electron-doped cuprates, including multilayer systems. Second, in electron-doped cuprates, a pronounced tendency toward d-wave bond-charge order develops near q=(0.5pi, 0), as revealed by resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) and RIXS. As a result, the charge dynamics acquires a dual structure, in which low-energy bond-charge excitations coexist with relatively high-energy plasmons. Third, analogous signatures of charge-order tendency have also been reported in hole-doped cuprates. However, a direct application of the d-wave bond-charge-order framework fails to account for experimental observations. Similarly, the charge-stripe order in La-based cuprates remains unresolved within existing theoretical approaches. Assuming that mobile carriers behave in a largely universal manner across electron- and hole-doped systems, we discuss a possible scenario that may reconcile these diverse experimental findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Transmission probabilities are numerically analyzed depending on the parameters of the problem, highlighting the roles of twist angle, number of barriers, barrier geometry, and the presence of a defect barrier within the superlattice. Our numerical results reveal that transmission is highly sensitive to these parameters: reducing the twist angle changes the number, depth, and position of transmission gaps and resonance peaks. The presence of defect affects the transmission, leading to the appearance of tunneling states inside transmission gaps with energy position can be tuned by the well width. At low incident energy, the transmission for normally incident electrons is perfect or nearly perfect, independent of the twist angle and the number of barriers. However, at large incident energy, the transmission becomes distinctly anisotropic, reflecting the separation of Dirac cones induced by twist angle variations. The presence of defects, particularly at smaller twist angles, provides additional control of tunneling behavior, allowing complete suppression of Klein tunneling under certain conditions.

Since the field equations contain extra degrees of freedom, we choose Finch-Skea metric and MIT bag model equation of state to make them solvable. We also use matching conditions to calculate a constant triplet in the chosen ansatz. The resulting solutions are then graphically analyzed for particular values of the bag constant and model parameter in the interior of 4U 1820-30 compact star. The viability and stability of the modified models are also checked through certain tests. Further, we calculate the values of model parameter through the vanishing radial pressure constraint that correspond to the observed data (radii and masses) of eight different star candidates.

In this work, we derive a tight performance bound for magnetic-field sensing with a spin ensemble in the presence of dissipation. The metrological performance is quantified by the integrated metrological gain (IMG), which explicitly incorporates the time evolution of the measurement apparatus. By combining the Lindblad master equation with the quantum Fisher information, we obtain analytically exact trade-off relations between the IMG and the dissipation rate for local dephasing and local emission processes, showing that the gain scales inversely with the dissipation strength. This trade-off complements the Heisenberg limit, which addresses only the scaling with the number of spins and neglects dissipative dynamics. We analyze various initial state preparations and elucidate the role of quantum entanglement in the presence of dissipation. Notably, while entanglement is essential for achieving Heisenberg scaling at short times, it also accelerates dissipative degradation during time evolution. Consequently, for sufficiently long observation times, comparable metrological performance can be achieved even without entanglement.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Zhao"], "title": "A Cohomological Framework for Topological Phases from Momentum-Space Crystallographic Groups", "comment": "16 pages, 2 figures and supplementary materials", "summary": "Crystallographic groups are conventionally studied in real space to characterize crystal symmetries. Recent work has recognized that when these symmetries are realized projectively, momentum space inherently accommodates nonsymmorphic symmetries, thereby evoking the concept of \\textit{momentum-space crystallographic groups} (MCGs). Here, we reveal that the cohomology of MCGs encodes fundamental data of crystalline topological band structures. Specifically, the collection of second cohomology groups, $H^2(\u0393_F,\\mathbb{Z})$, for all MCGs $\u0393_F$, provides an exhaustive classification of Abelian crystalline topological insulators, serving as an effective approximation to the full crystalline topological classification. Meanwhile, the third cohomology groups $H^3(\u0393_F,\\mathbb{Z})$ across all MCGs exhaustively classify all possible twistings of point-group actions on the Brillouin torus, essential data for twisted equivariant K-theory. Furthermore, we establish the isomorphism $H^{n+1}(\u0393_F,\\mathbb{Z})\\cong H^n\\big(\u0393_F,\\operatorname{\\mathcal{F}}(\\mathbb{R}^d_F,U(1))\\big)$ for $ n\\ge 1$, where $\\operatorname{\\mathcal{F}}(\\mathbb{R}^d_F,U(1))$ denotes the space of continuous $U(1)$-valued functions on the $d$D momentum space $\\mathbb{R}^d_F$.

Unlike Schwarzschild black holes, the temperature decreases with mass near the evaporation endpoint, signaling a phase transition and possible stable remnant. The entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation is obtained both with and without island contributions. Without islands, the radiation entropy grows linearly indefinitely, leading to the information paradox. By including island contributions and extremizing the generalized entropy functional, we resolve this paradox. At late times, the radiation entropy saturates at the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, confirming unitary evolution. From this, we derive the Page time and scrambling time by equating early- and late-time entanglement entropies. The result of this study establishes the finiteness of the radiation entropy and consistency with quantum mechanics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u5b89\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u4f5c\u7528\u533a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u54c8\u7ef4\u514b\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u70ed\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u71b5\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u89c6\u754c\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u4e0e\u65bd\u74e6\u8328child\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6e29\u5ea6\u5728\u84b8\u53d1\u7aef\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\u968f\u7740\u8d28\u91cf\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u9884\u793a\u7740\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6b8b\u4f59\u3002\u672a\u5305\u542b\u5c9b\u8d21\u732e\u65f6\uff0c Hawking \u8f90\u5c04\u71b5\u65e0\u9650\u589e\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u6096\u8bba\u3002\u5305\u542b\u5c9b\u8d21\u732e\u5e76\u6781\u503c\u5e7f\u4e49\u71b5\u51fd\u6570\u540e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8be5\u6096\u8bba\u3002\u5728\u8f83\u665a\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c \u8f90\u5c04\u71b5\u9971\u548c\u4e8e\u8d1d\u80af\u65af-\u970d\u5c14\u767b\u71b5\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7b49\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u548c\u665a\u671f\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\uff0c \u5f97\u5230\u4e86 \u9875\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6253\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u8f90\u5c04\u71b5\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6027\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u81ea\u6d3d\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u606f\u6096\u8bba\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6e10\u8fd1\u5b89\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u71b5\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u83b7\u5f97\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u5b89\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u606f\u6096\u8bba\uff0c \u8f90\u5c04\u71b5\u5728\u8f83\u665a\u65f6\u95f4\u9971\u548c\u4e8e\u8d1d\u80af\u65af-\u970d\u5c14\u767b\u71b5\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e10\u8fd1\u5b89\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4fe1\u606f\u6096\u8bba\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

This points together with limit points of this set, namely caustics, form the so-called \"crease set\". Light rays enter into the horizon through the crease set, characterizing the latter as the birth of the horizon. A natural question in this context refers to the classification and stability of the structural possibilities of black hole crease sets. In this work we revisit the strategy adopted by Gadioux & Reall for such a classification in the setting of singularity theory in contact geometry. Specifically, in such contact geometry setting, the event horizon is identified as a component (not connected to null infinity) of a so-called ``BigFront''. The characterization of BigFronts as Legendrian projections of Legendrian submanifolds permits to classify the crease sets and ``cuspidal sets'' (or caustics in Penrose's terminology) by applying classical results established by V.I. Arnol'd. Here we refine the stability discussion presented by Gadioux & Reall of that connected component of the crease set that is not causally connected to null infinity and that constitutes the event horizon birth. In addition, we identify the existence of other components of the crease set that lie in the part of the BigFront that is causally connected to null infinity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Starting from a Hubbard-Peierls description, we derive an effective field-theoretic functional in which the inverse local susceptibility defines a phase-rigidity scale controlled by system size and electronic correlations. This rigidity quantifies the resistance of a coherent many-body state to geometric deformation of its phase structure, rather than to energetic localization. We demonstrate that interactions enhance phase rigidity in finite systems, counter to naive expectations based on single-particle localization, and that rigidity loss may occur without a direct correspondence to gap formation.

The theoretical framework is constructed from a generalized mass-to-horizon scaling relation, $M \\propto L^n$, which implies a corresponding generalized entropic functional $S_n \\propto L^{n+1}$. Within this setting, cosmic acceleration arises as an emergent phenomenon driven by an entropic force acting on the cosmological horizon. While earlier studies demonstrated that these entropic cosmologies can reproduce the background expansion history of the standard $\u039b$CDM model, here we present a comprehensive observational analysis that jointly employs Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova data with SH0ES calibration, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance priors, and a suite of cosmological structure growth observations.

The polaron picture is a method capable of analyzing in the entire coupling regime and extracting the essential physics behind the QPT. However, the asymmetric deformation of polarons is missing in the current polaron picture. In the present work we propose an improved variational method in asymmetric polaron picture (APP). Our APP not only increases the method accuracy but also reveals more underlying physics concerning the QPT. We find that in the ground state both the polarons and antipolarons are asymmetrically deformed to a large extent, which leads to a richer phase diagram. We also analyze the first excited state in which we unveil an asymmetry direction reversal for the polarons and an attraction/replusion transition differently from the ground state. Finally, we apply the APP in quantum Fisher information analysis and critical coupling extraction, the improvements indicate that the polaron asymmetry makes a considerable contribution to the quantum resource in quantum metrology and plays an unnegligible role in the QPT.

In this work, we investigate the role of projective lattice symmetry in a hexagonal lattice with rational magnetic flux, emphasizing the resulting topological constraints on the electronic band structure. We show that, at pi flux, the symmetry in the hexagonal lattice enforces novel Dirac band touchings at E not equal to zero, and for general rational flux it constrains the number of Dirac points at E = 0. We further analyze the symmetry-imposed constraints on the Chern numbers of both isolated gapped bands and band multiplets connected by Dirac-point touchings.

We revisit this question in JT gravity from two perspectives: the closed-channel bulk path integral and the path integral over boundary curves. First, we study the radial evolution of a closed universe and derive the trumpet wavefunction as a transition amplitude between a geodesic boundary and a finite Dirichlet boundary. Our analysis recovers the Hartle--Hawking wavefunction without imposing asymptotic boundary conditions, allowing the trumpet to be glued to a cap wavefunction to reconstruct the smooth disk. Second, we derive an exact Riccati equation for the extrinsic curvature of a finite-cutoff boundary curve in the Euclidean Poincar\u00e9 disk. A WKB expansion of this equation yields all perturbative corrections in the cutoff parameter and captures nonperturbative effects. From this, we compute the quadratic boundary action and the one-loop partition function at finite cutoff, finding agreement with both the bulk approach and the expected one-loop effective action for the $T\\bar{T}$ deformation of the Schwarzian theory. Extracting lessons from JT gravity, we then argue that similar relationships hold for general dilaton gravities with arbitrary potentials $V(\u03c6)$ and propose an exact expression for their finite cutoff partition functions.

While local Ising models may exhibit integrable or chaotic dynamics contingent on interaction strengths and field parameters, systems with non-local interactions generally display a stronger propensity toward chaos, even when the non-local couplings are weak. By examining the distribution of energy level spacings through the level spacing ratio, we delineate the transition from integrable to chaotic regimes and characterize the emergence of quantum chaos in these systems. Our analysis demonstrates that non-local couplings facilitate faster operator spreading and more intricate dynamical behavior, enabling these systems to approach maximal chaos more readily than their local counterparts. Additionally, we analyze Krylov complexity as a dynamical probe of chaos, observing a characteristic peak followed by a plateau at late times in chaotic regimes. This behavior provides a quantitative means to distinguish between integrable and chaotic phases, with the growth rate and saturation level of the complexity serving as effective indicators.

The principal innovative aspect of our work is the construction of a time-dependent Lyapunov function that naturally induces a controlled Schr\u00f6dinger evolution with a time dependent Hamiltonian for maximizing approximation ratios of algorithms. Because the approximation ratio depends on the optimal solution, which is typically elusive and difficult to ascertain a priori, the second novel component is to construct the upper bound of the optimal solution through the current quantum state. By enforcing the non-decreasing property of this Lyapunov function, we not only derive a class of quantum dynamics that can be simulated by quantum devices but also obtain rigorous bounds on the achievable approximation ratio. As a concrete demonstration, we apply our framework to Max-Cut problem, implementing it as an adaptive variational quantum algorithm based on a Hamiltonian ansatz.

The stochastic field is modeled as a complex Gaussian-Markovian random process with finite bandwidth to describe realistic laser noise. Using the Born-Markov and rotating-wave approximations, we derive a Lindblad-form master equation that incorporates spontaneous emission and noise-induced terms, and we solve for the steady-state regime. We examine level populations in both the bare and dressed bases and compute the incoherent resonance-fluorescence spectrum. Our analysis shows that the stochastic drive is not merely a source of decoherence but a versatile control parameter. By detuning the stochastic-field central frequency relative to the coherent drive (especially for narrow bandwidths), we observe pronounced changes in emission characteristics, including selective enhancement or suppression, and reshaping of the multi-peaked fluorescence spectrum when the detuning matches the generalized Rabi frequency. Numerical results reveal nontrivial steady-state modifications distinct from purely coherent driving, enabling precise control of populations and suggesting applications in quantum control, quantum technologies, spectroscopy, and noise-assisted manipulation of atomic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u4e2a$\u039b$\u578b\u4e09\u7ef4\u539f\u5b50\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5e72\u6fc0\u5149\u548c\u5f31\u968f\u673a\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u6570\u503c\u89e3\u663e\u793a\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u4e0e\u5f3a\u6fc0\u5149\u7684\u504f\u9891\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u5982\u53d1\u5c04\u7387\u548c\u539f\u5b50\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Born-Markov\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u6ce2 cascades\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bfc\u51fa Lindblad \u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u7a33\u6001\u89e3\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e0d\u76f8\u5e72\u6fc0\u53d1\u5149\u8c31\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u673a\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u566a\u58f0\u6e90\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\uff08\u589e\u5f3a/\u6291\u5236\u53d1\u5149\uff0c\u91cd\u5851\u5149\u8c31\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u539f\u5b50\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u673a\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u80fd\u4e0e\u5f3a\u6fc0\u5149\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u539f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In these settings, coupling a suitable ``seed'' theory to auxiliary fields provides a powerful mechanism to generate infinite families of models while preserving key dynamical properties, such as electromagnetic duality invariance in four dimensions and classical integrability in two dimensions. Deformations induced through auxiliary fields are closely related to $T\\bar{T}$-like deformations and, in two dimensions, also to their higher-spin generalisations. In this paper, we analyse and clarify the relations between different auxiliary field formulations in two and four dimensions, showing how they are governed by Legendre transformations of the interaction functions combined with appropriate field redefinitions. In four-dimensional electrodynamics, we establish a correspondence between the auxiliary field model of Russo and Townsend and the Ivanov--Zupnik formalism. In two dimensions, we develop the analogue of the Ivanov--Zupnik $\u03bc$-frame to deform Principal Chiral, symmetric-space, non-Abelian T-dual, and (bi-)Yang-Baxter sigma models.

Whereas this approach is well suited for calculating emission probabilities and cross sections, it is insensitive to spatial and temporal phenomena such as, for instance, radiation formation, quantum coherence, and wave packet spreading. These effects are becoming increasingly important for experiments involving electrons, photons, atoms, and ions, particularly with the advent of attosecond spectroscopy and metrology. Here, we propose a general method for describing the emission of photons in phase space via a Wigner function. Several effects for Cherenkov radiation are predicted, absent in classical realm or in quantum theory in momentum space, such as a finite spreading time of the photon, finite duration of the flash and a quantum shift of the photon arrival time. The photon spreading time turns out to be negative near the Cherenkov angle, the flash duration is defined by the electron packet size, and the temporal shift can be both positive and negative. The characteristic time scales of these effects lie in the atto- and femtosecond ranges, thereby illustrating atomic origins of these macroscopic phenomena. The near-field distribution of the photon field resembles the electron packet shape, thus making ``snapshots'' of the emitter wave function. Our approach can easily be generalized to the other types of radiation and extended to scattering, decay, and annihilation processes, bringing tomographic methods of quantum optics to particle physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Unitary qubit dynamics generated by Hermitian Hamiltonians correspond to elliptic spatial rotations of this effective charge while non-unitary qubit dynamics generated by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or stochastic measurement collapse correspond to hyperbolic Lorentz boosts. Notably, to faithfully emulate the stochastic qubit dynamics arising from continuous qubit measurement, the stochastic electromagnetic fields must depend on the velocity of the charge they are acting on. Moreover, continuous qubit measurements admit a dynamical delayed choice effect where a future experimental choice can appear to retroactively determine the type of past measurement backaction, so the corresponding point charge dynamics can also exhibit delayed choice Lorentz transformations in which a future experimental choice determines whether stochastic force fields are electric or magnetic in character long after they interact with the particle.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We show that CWI fixes the leading total-energy-pole residue to the flat-space amplitude and subleading residues to curvature induced corrections to bulk vertices. The structure of the Ward-Takahashi identities are similarly fully determined. As an application, we derive four massless spin-1/2 WFC due to graviton exchange. We also revisit the tension between conserved spin-3/2 operators and de Sitter geometry. We demonstrate that the reality conditions appropriate to dS and Euclidean AdS (EAdS) lead to distinct three-point WFCs for two spin-3/2 operators and the stress tensor. Consequently, the residue of the leading total-energy pole for the four-point WFC receives graviton- and photon-exchange contributions with opposite signs in dS, whereas they appear with the same sign in EAdS.

Starting from a phenomenological error model of charge-conserving noise, we study the optimal decoder assuming the local charges of each anyon can be measured. The error threshold of the optimal decoder corresponds to a continuous phase transition in a disordered two-dimensional integer loop model on the Nishimori line. Using an effective replica field theory analysis and Monte Carlo numerics, we show that the optimal decoding transition exhibits Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality with a modified universal jump in winding number variance. We further generalize the model beyond the Nishimori line, which defines a large class of suboptimal decoders.

The main challenge lies in verifying the existence of a local hidden-state (LHS) model capable of reproducing all post-measurement assemblages generated by arbitrary measurements. To address this, we propose a machine learning-based framework that employs batch sampling of measurements and gradient-based optimization to construct an optimal LHS model. We validate our method by analyzing the steerability of two-qubit Werner and two-qutrit isotropic states. For Werner states, our approach saturates the analytical visibility bounds under three Pauli measurements, arbitrary projective measurements (PVMs), and arbitrary positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs).

For Werner states, under certain measurements, POVMs provide the same steerability as PVMs, but it also works with arbitrary projective and positive operator-valued measurements.

For non-abelian gauge theories, this proposal is verified, to all perturbative orders, by dipole color correlations in the infrared factor of non-abelian scattering amplitudes, which are given by a correlator of matrix-valued vertex operators in a free-boson theory on the sphere. Decades of high-order gauge-theory calculations have provided a number of further results that can be used to test and constrain a possible celestial theory: they include explicit expressions for soft emission currents up to three particles, and up to three loops for single soft emission. In this paper, we analyze this trove of data, appropriately translated in the celestial language, and we use them to extract information on the celestial theory. In particular, we show that all logarithms arising in the loop expansion of the single soft current can be reabsorbed in the scale choices for the $d$-dimensional coupling, casting some doubt on the need for a logarithmic celestial theory. We then note that the celestial OPEs suggested by the structure of multiple emission currents in collinear limits are never ambiguous, but involve coefficients depending on gluon energy fractions, which break holomorphic factorization, as well as associativity when double limits are taken. Strongly-ordered soft limits recover associativity, but suffer from ambiguities already discussed in earlier literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, the dynamics and physical mechanisms governing ergotropy evolution remain open challenges. Here, we investigate the ergotropy of a general QB model and find that the charging process is accompanied by the variation and inversion of the energy level populations. In the absence of population inversion, the ergotropy is fully consistent with coherent ergotropy; in local and global population inversion, it is determined by both coherent and incoherent ergotropy. Via random sampling of quantum states and Hamiltonians, we show that coherence and the participation ratio enhance coherent ergotropy, whereas incoherent ergotropy--whether enhanced, unchanged, or suppressed--depends on diagonal entropy, the participation ratio, and energy level population ordering. We demonstrate that the ergotropy lower bound is incoherent ergotropy, the upper bound is the QB stored energy, and enhanced QB purity suppresses locked energy and boosts charging efficiency. Furthermore, we use the Tavis-Cummings (TC) and Jaynes-Cummings (JC) batteries as paradigms to validate our findings.

In particular, sheaf codes represent a novel framework that encompasses all well-known good qLDPC codes with profound underlying mathematics. In this work, we generalize Poincar\u00e9 duality from manifolds to both classical and quantum codes defined via sheaf theory on $t$-dimensional cell complexes. Viewing important code properties including the encoding rate, code distance, local testability soundness, and efficient decoders as parameters of the underlying (co)chain complexes, we rigorously prove a duality relationship between the $i$-th chain and the $(t-i)$-th cochain of sheaf codes.\n  We further build multiplicative structures such as cup and cap products on sheaved chain complexes, inspired by the standard notions of multiplicative structures and Poincar\u00e9 duality on manifolds. This immediately leads to an explicit isomorphism between (co)homology groups of sheaf codes via a cap product. As an application, we obtain transversal disjoint logical $\\mathrm{C}Z$ gates with $k_{\\mathrm{C}Z}=\u0398(n)$ on families of good qLDPC and almost-good quantum locally testable codes.

In particular we emphasize the point of view that (i) which yardsticks haven been applied in quantifying entanglement and its distribution, (ii) what are the substantive characteristics and interrelations of these measures and their monogamy relations mathematically by comparing, and (iii) which concepts should be improved or revised and how they were developed accordingly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u8ff0 Ever since Bennett \u7b49\u4eba\u4e8e1996\u5e74\u63d0\u51fa\u71b5\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u4e09\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u91cf\uff0c\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u53ca\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u91cf\u5b50resource\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bf8\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u70b9\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u91cf\u5ea6\u53ca\u7ea0\u7f20\u5355\u6027\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u81fb\u6e05\u6670\u3002\u7eaf\u6001\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5bf9\u5bb9\u6613\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4f46\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u548c\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\u5374\u590d\u6742\u5f97\u591a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86(\u4e00)\u4f55\u5904\u5e94\u7528\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ea0\u7f20\u91cf\u5ea6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c(\u4e8c)\u8fd9\u4e9b\u91cf\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u5355\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\u9610\u660e\u5176\u6570\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff0c(\u4e09)\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u6790\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u82e5\u5e72\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6216\u4fee\u6b63\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u548c\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ecd\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u6311\u6218\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u51e0\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u5f00\u5206\u6790\uff1a(1) \u7efc\u8ff0 history\u4e0a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c(2) \u5f52\u7eb3\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5ea6\u7684\u5171\u540c\u539f\u7406\u4e0e\u7279\u70b9\uff0c(3) \u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u91cf\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u5355\u6027\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c(4) \u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u6216\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4f9d\u636e\u53ca\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u7ea0\u7f20\u91cf\u5ea6\u3001\u5355\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5404\u91cf\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u4e0e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u82e5\u5e72\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7740\u91cd\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5355\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u6280\u672f\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

The first is the implementation of the Ising Sample-based Quantum Configuration Recovery (ISQR) routine, which improves solution quality in Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems. The second is the use of the VQE Constrained method to decompose the optimization task, enabling us to handle DPO instances with more variables than the available qubits on current hardware. These advances, which are broadly applicable to other optimization problems, allow us to address a portfolio with a size relevant to the financial industry, consisting of up to 38 assets and covering the full Spanish stock index (IBEX 35).

In this review, we highlight recent advances by linking quantum fluctuation theorems with linear response theory, offering new insights into the nature of quantum fluctuations and irreversibility in the near-equilibrium regime.

It has been classified into three distinct types: quantum entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, and Bell's nonlocality. In 1991, Gisin presented a fundamental theorem on Bell's nonlocality, pointing out all pure entangled states possess Bell's nonloclaity. Many of the core protocols of quantum information science (such as quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, and certain algorithms in quantum computing) rely on entanglement. Gisin's theorem tells us that as long as we successfully prepare a pure entangled state, we then have a Bell-nonlocality resource that can show the non-classical correlations. Such a resource is not ``virtual'' and can be tested and used through Bell-experiments. Similarly, in this work, we present a Gisin-like fundamental theorem on EPR steering, which indicates all rank-2 (and rank-1) entangled states possess EPR steerability. Thus all rank-2 entangled states can be applicable as EPR-steering resources in quantum information.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Although variational quantum algorithms offer promising new approaches that may eventually outperform classical schemes, they suffer from resource constraints and trainability issues such as barren plateaus, making large-scale instances intractable on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. In this paper, we propose an enhanced distributed variational quantum eigensolver for large-scale MaxCut problems, which extends our prior distributed variational quantum eigensolver framework by integrating a novel hybrid classical-quantum perturbation strategy, enhances optimization scalability and efficiency. Our algorithm solves weighted MaxCut instances with up to 1000 vertices using only 10 qubits, and numerical results indicate that it consistently outperforms the Goemans-Williamson algorithm. We further employ a warm-start initialization strategy, seeding the algorithm with high-quality solutions from the Goemans-Williamson algorithm, with results confirming that the optimal classical solution can be effectively further improved. The practical utility of the proposed algorithm is further validated through its application to haplotype phasing on genome sequencing data of the human ABCA1 gene, producing high-quality haplotypes that rival those obtained by the Goemans-Williamson algorithm with $10^6$ projections. These results establish the proposed algorithm as a scalable, NISQ-compatible framework for near-term quantum-enhanced large-scale combinatorial optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578bMaxCut\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u53d8\u5206\u578b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178-\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u5408\u6270urbation\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178GW\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u5347\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728NISQ\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u53d8\u5206\u578b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u5178-\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u5408\u6270urbation\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 warm-start \u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e1000\u9876\u70b9\u52a0\u6743MaxCut\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4f18\u4e8eGW\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728\u4eba\u7c7bABCA1\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u5355\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u805a\u5408\u7269\uff08haplotype\uff09\u7247\u6bb5\u89e3\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aNISQ\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86-scalable\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

By the Naimark extension theorem, an IC measurement may be realized by a von Neumann measurement on an extended system after a suitable interaction. In this work, we elaborate on a simple algorithm for realizing Naimark extensions for rank-one Weyl-Heisenberg covariant informationally complete measurements in arbitrary finite dimensions. Exploiting Weyl-Heisenberg covariance, we show that the problem reduces to determining a $d \\times d$ unitary from which the full $d^2 \\times d^2$ unitary interaction can be constructed. The latter unitary enjoys a block-circulant structure which allows e.g., for an elegant optical implementation. We illustrate the procedure with explicit calculations for qubit, qutrit, and ququart SIC-POVMs. Finally, we show that from another point of view, this method amounts to preparing an ancilla system according to a so-called fiducial state, followed by a generalized Bell-basis measurement on the system and ancilla. These results provide a straightforward framework for implementing informationally complete measurements in the laboratory suitable for both qubit and qudit based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By analogy, we define an information critical phase as an extended region of a mixed state phase diagram where the Markov length, the characteristic length scale governing the decay of the conditional mutual information (CMI), diverges.\n  We demonstrate that such a phase arises in decohered $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric codes by assessing both the CMI and the coherent information, the latter quantifying the robustness of the encoded logical qudits. For $N>4$, we find that the system hosts an information critical phase intervening between the decodable and non-decodable phases where the coherent information saturates to a fractional value in the thermodynamic limit, indicating that a finite fraction of logical information is still preserved. We show that the density matrix in this phase can be decomposed into a convex sum of Coulombic pure states, where gapped anyons reorganize into gapless photons. We further consider the ungauged $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and interpret its mixed state phase diagram in the language of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking. We argue that in the dual model, the information critical phase arises because the spontaneously broken off-diagonal $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ symmetry gets enhanced to a U(1) symmetry, resulting in a novel superfluid phase whose gapless modes involve coherent excitations of both the system and the environment. Finally, we propose an optimal decoding protocol for the corrupted $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and evaluate its effectiveness in recovering the fractional logical information preserved in the information critical phase. Our findings identify a gapless analog for mixed-state phases that still acts as a fractional topological quantum memory, thereby extending the conventional paradigm of quantum memory phases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u4e34\u754c\u76f8\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Z_N toric\u7801\u5728\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53N>4\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e34\u754c\u76f8\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u76f8\u5e72\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u5206\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u88ab\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50 memories\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6269\u5c55.", "motivation": "\u4e34\u754c\u73b0\u8c61\u5728Phase transitions\u548c statistical physics\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u8fd9\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\u5230\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u76f8\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c.", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6761\u4ef6\u76f8\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff08CMI\uff09\u548c\u76f8\u5e72\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9Z_N toric\u7801\u5728\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53N>4\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u4e34\u754c\u76f8\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u548c\u5176\u7279\u6027.", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5f53N>4\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e34\u754c\u76f8\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u76f8\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u5e72\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u5206\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u88ab\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7eaf\u6001\u7684\u51f8\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u80fd\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u7684Z_N toric\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e34\u754c\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5230\u5f31\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u7f3a\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5bf9\u5076\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e34\u754c\u76f8\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u672a\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u7684Z_N \u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u81ea\u53d1\u6027\u5730\u589e\u957f\u4e3aU(1)\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u76f8\uff0c\u5176\u65e0\u80fd\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6fc0\u53d1.", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50 memories\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e34\u754c\u76f8\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u5229\u7528."}}
