We start with two species of fermions $c_i, f_i$, each with\n$N$ flavors and matrix bosons $b_{ij}$ with $N^2$ components. They interact\nwith each other via slave-boson like interaction $\\int b_{ij}^{\\dagger} \\,\nc_i^{\\dagger}f_j$.

We show that for $d = z+1,$ the electronic\nself energy shows marginal Fermi liquid behavior. We first evaluate the\nfermionic self energy $\\Sigma(i\\omega)$ using the standard approximate boson\nself energy $\\Pi(\\textbf{q}, i\\nu) \\propto |\\nu|/|\\textbf{q}|$ and find that\n$\\Sigma(i\\omega) \\sim \\omega \\ln(N/|\\omega|)$ which shows a much weaker\ndependence on $N$ when compared with similar results from non-SYK large-$N$\nIsing-nematic models.

This field of research has received increasing\nattention over the past decades. For example, balsa wood has emerged as a\nhighly promising alternative to foam or honeycomb cores, offering a\nlightweight, rapidly renewable and cost-effective solution. However, plant\nfibers such as balsa wood and flax often display high hydrophilic behavior,\nwhich could affect their mechanical performance and long-term durability.

In these systems the unconditional spatio-temporal\ncorrelations are long-range, and local (e.g., Metropolis) dynamics exhibits\ncritical slowing down. Nevertheless, our results imply the existence of local\n\"decoders\" that undo the decoherence, when the decoherence strength is below a\ncritical value. An implication of these results is that thermally stable\nquantum memories have a threshold against decoherence that remains nonzero as\none approaches the critical temperature. Analogously, in diffusion models,\nstability of data distributions implies the existence of\ncomputationally-efficent local denoisers in the late-time generation dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u4ea4\u6362Pauli\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684Gibbs\u6001\u5728\u5f31\u5c40\u90e8\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u4e0b\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u5373\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u6548\u679c\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u5c40\u90e8\u9006\u8f6c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u6e29\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u548c\u4f4e\u6e29\u6709\u5e8f\u76f8\u6001\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c unconditional\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u662f\u957f\u7a0b\u7684\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08\u5982Metropolis\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e34\u754c\u653e\u6162\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u201c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u201d\u9006\u8f6c\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\uff0c\u5f53\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u503c\u65f6\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u65f6\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u96f6\u7684\u6297\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u9608\u503c\u3002\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5730\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5728\u540e\u671f\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u5c40\u90e8\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5728\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73af\u5883\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u6297\u5916\u754c\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684Gibbs\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51faGibbs\u6001\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5f31\u5c40\u90e8\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u4ea4\u6362Pauli\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684Gibbs\u6001\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u9006\u8f6c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In this work, we extend the measurable film-thickness range of\nreflectometry to at least 50 um through a new model-free algorithm, the\nLinearized Reflectance Zero-Crossing (LRZ) method. The approach builds upon the\npreviously reported Linearized Reflectance Extrema (LRE) technique but\neliminates the sensitivity to spectral sampling and fringe attenuation that\ndegrade performance in the thick-film regime. By linearizing phase response and\nextracting zero-crossing positions in wavenumber space, LRZ provides robust and\nrepeatable thickness estimation without iterative fitting, achieving comparable\naccuracy with much higher computational efficiency than conventional\nmodel-based methods.

Nonlinear optical processes\nin microresonators require both large quality factors to promote build-up of\nlarge intracavity powers and sufficient control over resonator dispersion to\nimplement phase-matching, which is generally achieved through careful design\nand fabrication of the resonator cross-sectional dimensions.

Although a few\ngeometric length scales, such as the quantum-metric length, can still be\ndefined, because of their embedding dependence, i.e., the dependence on the\nchoice of orbital positions used to construct the tight-binding model, they\ncannot serve as a universal length scale of the flat band systems. Here, we\nintroduce an embedding-independent length scale $\\xi_\\text{flat}$ of a flat\nband that is defined as the localization length of an in-gap state proximate to\nthe flat band. Because $\\xi_\\text{flat}$ is derived from the intrinsic\nlocalization of compact localized states, it is solely determined by the\nHamiltonian and provides a robust foundation for embedding-independent\nobservables. We show analytically that the superconducting coherence length in\na flat-band superconductor is given by $\\xi_\\text{flat}$ in the weak-coupling\nlimit, thereby identifying $\\xi_\\text{flat}$ as the relevant length scale for\nmany-body phenomena. Numerical simulations on various lattice models confirm\nall theoretical predictions, including the correspondence between\n$\\xi_\\text{flat}$ and the superconducting coherence length.

The crucial role played by the beta shift, which is a modification\nof the standard dim-reg beta function, is elucidated, and specific conditions\nthat it needs to satisfy for the RG flow to be gradient are derived.

Using a harmonic oscillator with\ntime-dependent mass and frequency as a toy model, we show that both circuit and\nspread complexity at any instant is determined by the mean number of quanta and\nits rate of change. Furthermore, both complexity and its growth are directly\nlinked to the variances of the position and momentum operators, providing a\nclear physical interpretation of complexity in terms of the state's excitation\nand phase-space fluctuation. Although the analysis is carried out for a single\ntime-dependent oscillator, the results have direct relevance for quantum field\ntheory in curved backgrounds, where individual field modes effectively behave\nas time-dependent oscillators. This offers new insights into how quantum\ncomplexity encodes particle production and phase space fluctuations in\nnon-holographic systems.

In a\ncomplex system, the encountered magnetic field is often inhomogeneous, which\nmay be represented by a linear combination of z^n gradient fields, where n is\nthe order. Additionally, the higher the order of the nonlinear gradient field,\nthe more sensitive the phase variances are to differences in diffusion\ncoefficients and delay times. Hence, studying higher-order fields has both\ntheoretical and experimental importance, but this is a challenge for\ntraditional methods. The recently proposed phase diffusion method proposed a\ngeneral way to overcome the challenge. This method is used and demonstrated in\ndetail in this paper to determine the phase evolution in a quadric field (n =\n4). Three different types of phase evolution in the quadric gradient field are\nobtained. Moreover, a general signal attenuation expression is proposed to\ndescribe the signal attenuation for spin diffusion from the origin of the\nnonlinear gradient field. This approximation is based on the short gradient\npulse (SGP) approximation but is extended to include the finite gradient pulse\nwidth (FGPW) effect by using the mean square phase.

We extend this approach to multi-band systems and\nshow that the nonlinearity introduces a degeneracy between bands, subsequently\nleading to the observation of fractionally quantized pumping.

Utilizing the spacetime metric and geodesic equations, we\ncalculated several geometric quantities characterizing the black hole. To\nvisualize the observational appearance of the accretion disk, we employed the\nNovikov--Thorne model to simulate both its primary and secondary images.\nFurthermore, we analyzed the QNMs of the black hole under scalar and\nelectromagnetic perturbations for different parameter values. The results\nindicate that as the regularization parameter $l$ increases, the outer horizon\nradius $r_{+}$, photon-sphere radius $r_{\\text{ph}}$, critical impact parameter\n$b_{c}$, and innermost stable circular orbit $r_{\\text{isco}}$ exhibit a\ngradual decrease, while the inner horizon radius $r_{-}$ and the real part of\nthe QNMs frequency $\\omega_{r}$ increase.

Here, we\npropose and analyze a strategy for distinguishing among N phase-symmetric\ncoherent states, which optimally takes unambiguous discrimination (UD) to the\ndeterministic regime, at the inevitable cost of having non-zero probability of\nerror. Despite the disturbance introduced by the separation map used in the UD\nprocess, we show that for N > 2, the \"failure\" states of UD retain residual\ninformation about the original input states, which can be further used for\ndiscrimination. Rather than discarding inconclusive outcomes as in conventional\nUD, we show that the \"failure\" states of UD can be optimally recycled by\nperforming a sequential minimum-error discrimination (MED). This strategy,\nwhich we call information recycling (IR), combines the benefits of both MED and\noptimal UD: It always provides conclusive results while allowing for a subset\nof those results to be error-free, which are identifiable by an ancillary\nsystem. We characterize the disturbance introduced by the state separation map\nby the infidelity between input and failure states, demonstrating that it lower\nbounds the error probability in the recycling stage. Furthermore, in the\nlow-amplitude regime-relevant for long-distance CV-QKD applications-we show\nthat the state separation achieves significant success while introducing\nrelatively low disturbance to the input states after failed events.

We demonstrate that\nfits of this ringdown signal using two quasinormal modes are statistically\npreferred over single-mode fits, for a broad range of fit start times. We also\nfind that two-mode fits give remnant mass and spin measurements consistent with\nthose of the inspiral-merger-ringdown model NRSur7dq4, whereas one-mode fits\nstruggle to do so. Agreement of our fits with those of NRSur7dq4 is achieved by\nlabeling the two quasinormal modes as the ${(\\ell,m)=(2,2)}$ and ${(2,0)}$ Kerr\nprograde fundamental modes. However, we find some indications that fits with\nthe ${(2,1)}$ quasinormal mode instead of the ${(2,0)}$ mode may describe the\ndata better, hinting at possible NRSur7dq4 error or other systematics. When\nfitting at early times near the estimated peak strain, we find that the\ninclusion of a third mode, an ${(\\ell,m,n)=(2,2,1)}$ prograde overtone,\nimproves consistency with fits at later times. Finally, we perform a test of\ngeneral relativity by searching for deviations from the Kerr frequency\nspectrum. Setting issues of systematics aside, we validate the Kerr frequency\nand damping rate spectrum to within $\\pm10\\%$ at the 90$\\%$ credible level\nusing a fundamental mode fit, and we also report $\\pm8\\%$ constraints using a\nmodel with fundamental modes and an overtone fit at times near the peak strain.\nUnderstanding the systematic errors that may be affecting the most accurate\nanalyses of GW231123 is crucial in the context of population and binary\nformation studies -- our ${(2,1)}$ mode fits return a significantly higher\nremnant mass and spin than all available inspiral-merger-ringdown models\nincluding NRSur7dq4, and this difference in parameter estimates may have\nastrophysical implications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
