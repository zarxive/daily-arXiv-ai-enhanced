Active beam steering loops, utilizing differential wavefront sensing (DWS) signals, ensure co-alignment between the receiving (RX) beam and the transmitting (TX) beam. With spacecraft attitude jitter simulated by hexapod-driven rotations, the interferometric link achieves a pointing stability below 10 urad/$\\mathrm{\\sqrt{Hz}}$ in the frequency range between 2 mHz and 0.5 Hz, and the fluctuation of the TX beam's polarization state results in a reduction of 0.14\\% in the carrier-to-noise-density ratio over a 15-hour continuous measurement. Additionally, tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling is experimentally investigated using the periodic scanning of the hexapod. Experimental results show that the on-axis LRI enables the inter-spacecraft ranging measurements with nanometer accuracy, making it a potential candidate for future GRACE-like missions."}

This unified functionality moves well beyond reciprocity-breaking mechanisms, marking a fundamental transition from static media to polychromatic, energy-efficient wave processors. This article establishes dispersion engineering as the core design paradigm for these dynamic systems. We show that the dispersion relation, linking frequency and wavenumber, serves as a master blueprint governing exotic wave phenomena such as nonreciprocity, beam splitting, asymmetric frequency conversion, amplification, spatial decomposition, and momentum bandgaps. By analyzing analytical dispersion surfaces and isofrequency contours in subluminal, luminal, and superluminal modulation regimes, we reveal how tailored spatiotemporal modulation orchestrates controlled energy flow among harmonic modes. We further demonstrate how this framework directly informs practical device operation, highlighting advanced implementations including angular-frequency beam multiplexing in superconducting Josephson junction arrays. Combining insights from wave theory, numerical modeling, and experimental realization, this work provides a comprehensive roadmap for leveraging dispersion engineering to design next-generation metamaterials for wireless communication, quantum technologies, and integrated photonics."}

Inverse-design techniques have shown to best exploit the degrees of freedom available in design, resulting in high-performing systems for wireless communications, sensing and analog signal processing. Nonetheless, fundamental yet powerful properties of metamaterials are still to be revealed. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Perfectly Matched Metamaterials (PMMs). PMMs are passive, inhomogeneous media that perform purely refractive field transformations under different excitations. Their advantage lies in their simplicity, reflectionless behavior and suitability for both analytical and numerical design methods. Unlike Transformation Optics, PMM-based designs are devoid of coordinate transformations. Anisotropic unit cells are configured to control EM fields in a true-time delay manner. Simple analytical designs are reported which demonstrate the broadband capability of PMM devices. Proposed PMMs may find application in wideband beamforming and analog computing, realizing functionalities such as spatial filtering and signal pre-processing."}

The positional stability of the trapped particle is pivotal to system performance, directly setting the measurement noise floor and operational precision. In this work, we observe bistability and hysteresis in the axial equilibrium position of a 10-um diameter SiO2 microsphere. This bistability arises from optical interference between the fiber ends and the microsphere, creating multiple potential wells. Experimental results demonstrate that the microsphere's transition rate can be effectively modulated through precise control of the trapping laser power. Furthermore, the incorporation of transverse misalignment has effectively eradicated bistability, thereby substantially improving positional stability throughout the entire optical trapping region. This suppression successfully reduced the system's residual positional uncertainty to the thermal noise limit. Consequently, this research will enhance the precision of microparticle manipulation and the sensitivity of sensing in dual-fiber optical trap systems."}

Based on considerations in the weak-coupling regime of a microscopic description of the pairing phase (to mimic the phase as it gives way to a nematic phase in the experiments), we argue that the ensuing and relevant PDW state has a strong-pairing character. Furthermore, due to the existence of a single collective mode associated with the order parameter in the uniform paired phase, in the weak-coupling regime, the $p$-wave paired state, in general (for example, in the superconducting state of electrons), may be prone to a PDW instability."}

The scheme works in the frequency domain (using phasors) and couples the oscillatory Stokes equation with rigid or flexible structures, modeled by viscoelastic networks of immersed boundary kernels. The fluid-structure coupling can be solved by two routes. One route calculates the hydrodynamic mobility matrix required to solve the equation for the structure deformation rate in matrix form. The second route iteratively solves the coupled fluid-structure equations: fluid-induced forces on the structures create a tension field which is then transferred to the fluid, until convergence. The resulting fixed-point problem is solved iteratively using the Anderson acceleration method. The mobility route is optimal when dealing with one or few structures, while the iterative scheme is preferred for denser dispersions. In any case, the flow resulting from the body forces is solved by a recently developed scheme [J. Fluid. Mech. 1010 A57, 2025] which is spectral in space and time and deals with doubly periodic open domains (either free-space or wall-bounded) where meshing is restricted to the region of interest around the structures. We test the present scheme in two applied contexts: quartz-crystal-microbalance (QCM) of spheres, suspended, adsorbed or tethered to viscoelastic linkers; and force spectroscopy (via atomic force microscopy) reproducing the power spectra of vibrating microparticles near a solid boundary. In all cases, comparisons with analytical, numerical and experimental results show excellent agreement. We conclude by discussing new routes the scheme opens in force spectroscopy and QCM analyses of soft objects."}

The standard phase accumulation model accurately captures the characteristics of QWS and extracts the electronic band dispersion, showing excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations. Band structure calculation reveals that with increasing quantum-layer thickness, the interlayer coupling enhances the electronic dispersion, progressively reducing subband splitting and giving rise to bulk-like continuous bands. Spatially resolved spectroscopy around surface defects further confirms that QWS of Dirac electrons in topological insulators remains robust against defect scattering.

Theoretical studies have shown that ratchet-based ion pumps (RBIPs) can separate ions with the same charge and valance by driving them in opposite directions according to their diffusion coefficients. This process relies on frequency dependent current reversal, a unique feature of ratchets in which the particle current direction is inverted with the input signal frequency. Previous experimental demonstrations of RBIPs achieved ion pumping against electrostatic forces and water deionization, but lacked frequency-dependent current reversal and control of the asymmetry of the device. Here, we report the first experimental realization of these key functionalities by driving RBIPs with a bipotentiostat. Complementary input signals applied to RBIP contacts unlock a flashing ratchet-like behavior, and enhances the device performance by an order of magnitude compared to the prior floating-drive approach. The enhanced control of the electrostatic potential at the RBIP surfaces leads to frequency dependent current reversals, and the addition of a potential offset to the input signal enables tuning the amplitude asymmetry of the device. This flashing ratchet functionality provides a significant step towards the realization of ratchet driven selective ion separation systems."}

By exploring the simplest cosmological model in the bulk, that of an empty and flat space with a cosmological constant $Λ$, we find that its holographic dual makes sense as a theory of fundamental quantum degrees of freedom at the boundary. Moreover, we find that an observer in the bulk, making long-range (electromagnetic and gravitational) observations, cannot distinguish the acceleration induced by the cosmological constant $Λ$ from that induced by the thermodynamic properties of the boundary, the de Sitter horizon. By including matter in the bulk we extend this holographic principle to GREA, where the quantum d.o.f. associated with the evolving boundary of the causal horizon induces an entropic acceleration that varies in time.

By measuring the $D_1$ transition energies in Na- and Mg-like charge states of Lu and Yb confined in the Tokyo electron-beam ion trap, we extract meV-level energy shifts that are directly sensitive to nuclear-size effects. Transition-energy differences obtained from these spectra are compared with state-of-the-art relativistic many-body perturbation theory, including a new treatment of Mg-like ions. We develop a generalized framework to propagate uncertainties arising from nuclear deformation and surface diffuseness and evaluate corresponding nuclear-sensitivity coefficients. Combining Na- and Mg-like results yields mutually consistent radius differences, demonstrating the robustness of both the experimental calibration and the theoretical predictions. To determine absolute isotopic radii, we perform a generalized least-squares optimization incorporating our HCI constraints together with optical-isotope-shift data and muonic-atom results. This analysis establishes that the $^{175}$Lu charge radius is smaller than that of $^{174}$Yb, restoring the expected odd-even staggering across the $N=94$ isotonic chain. Our recommended value, $R(^{175}\\text{Lu}) = 5.291(11)$ fm, reduces the uncertainty of the Lu radius by a factor of three compared with the previous electron-scattering result and resolves a long-standing anomaly in rare-earth nuclear systematics. This work demonstrates that EUV spectroscopy of HCIs provides a powerful and broadly applicable method for precision nuclear-structure studies in heavy, deformed nuclei. The techniques developed here enable future investigations of isotonic and isoelectronic sequences, including radioactive nuclides and higher-$Z$ systems."}

Using a 64x64 multicellular grid over 60,000 simulation steps, we show that reducing Meff below a critical threshold (~0.6) drives sustained depolarization, ATP collapse, and elevated ROS, reproducing key electrophysiological signatures associated with GBM.

Our theoretical framework goes beyond the Marčenko-Pastur law-valid only in the limit of a large number of channels-by accurately predicting the mean enhancement in finite-channel experiments and its fluctuations whenever long-range mesoscopic correlations are negligible (e.g., in weakly scattering media or under limited wavefront control). Notably, in the strongly scattering regime, experiments and simulations reveal giant fluctuations in the enhancement factor, which we attribute directly to long-range mesoscopic correlations. From a fundamental perspective, our results provide a direct method for quantifying long-range correlations in wavefront-shaping-based focusing, even with a limited number of input control channels. On the applied side, they enable the accurate prediction of the enhancement factor and a lower bound on its fluctuations, which are crucial for biomedical imaging, optical metrology, optical trapping, and communication through scattering media."}

We then apply RBMs to kagome spin ice and show that they successfully learn the local ice rules and short-range correlations of the extensively degenerate ice-I manifold. Correlation functions computed from RBM-generated configurations closely match those from direct Monte Carlo simulations. For the partially ordered ice-II phase -- featuring long-range charge order and broken time-reversal symmetry -- accurate modeling requires RBMs with uniform-sign bias fields, mirroring the underlying symmetry breaking. These results highlight the utility of RBMs as generative models for learning constrained and highly frustrated magnetic states."}

Here we consider the localizable class CI in 3D, and numerically investigate the stability of surface states. We demonstrate that surface states of a bulk class-CI topological lattice model are fragile in that they can be Anderson localized by the combination of weak quenched randomness and hybridization with an additional trivial 2D band (a trivializing proximity effect, TPE). With the TPE, stronger disorder is more destructive to the surface states of the bulk lattice model. By contrast, without additional bands the surface states remain extended, exhibiting robust spectrum-wide quantum criticality. We also investigate the fragility of surface states in effective 2D class-CI continuum Dirac theories, including the chiral limit of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene. Although the continuum models exhibit signs of Anderson localization near gap edges for weak disorder, stronger disorder instead appears to heal the surface, restoring criticality whilst filling in spectral energy gaps. Our results provide further evidence that effective continuum field theories fail to capture key aspects of surface-state physics in localizable topological phases."}

We show that the dispersion relation, linking frequency and wavenumber, serves as a master blueprint governing exotic wave phenomena such as nonreciprocity, beam splitting, asymmetric frequency conversion, amplification, spatial decomposition, and momentum bandgaps.

Combining a semiclassical framework with Boltzmann transport theory, we show that the vertical magnon transport (VMT) currents respond both linearly and nonlinearly to the in-plane gradients of magnetic field and temperature. The linear transport coefficients are tied to the total hidden magnon BC, while the nonlinear (second-order) coefficients for the magnetic field and temperature gradients are determined by the hidden magnon BC dipole and the hidden extended magnon BC dipole, respectively. Using linear spin-wave theory, we find that the hidden magnon BC over the Brillouin zone is given by the expectation value of a pseudo-${\\cal Z}$ operator, representing vertical displacements, evaluated in the space of paraunitary matrices that diagonalize the magnon Hamiltonian. We estimate VMT in spin models of realistic magnets with ferro- and antiferromagnetic order, including the buckled honeycomb (BHC) lattice and bilayer Chromium trihalide (CrX$_3$; X = Cl, Br, I) systems. In BHC, both linear and nonlinear VMT arise when time-reversal symmetry is broken by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. In CrX$_3$ systems, the nonlinear coefficients dominate, while the linear responses vanish due to time-reversal symmetry. Both systems exhibit distinctive features across a broad range of temperatures and parameters. Therefore, our prediction of VMT and its characteristic signatures is directly testable in present-day magnonic experiments, especially in atomically thin, few-layered van der Waals magnets."}

However, performing absorption spectroscopy on individual molecules is challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we report on a nondestructive absorption spectroscopy on a mid-infrared vibrational transition in a single molecular ion that is co-trapped with an atomic ion. The absorption of a single photon is detected via the momentum transfer from the absorbed photon onto the molecule. This recoil signal is amplified using a non-classical state of motion of the two-ion crystal and subsequently read out via the atomic ion. We characterize the recoil detection method and use it to investigate the interaction between femtosecond laser pulses and the O-H stretching vibration in individual CaOH+ molecular ions. Furthermore, we present the single-photon absorption spectrum obtained for the vibrational transition. This method represents a milestone towards quantum non-demolition measurements of complex polyatomic molecules, providing high-fidelity methods for preparation and measurement of the quantum state of a wide range of molecular species."}

Classical spinning observables are recovered by extrapolating to large spin, results calculated with finite quantum spin-$s$ particles using the properties of spin universality and Casimir interpolation. At leading-order our results give a completely general and non-redundant parametrization of absorptive observables in terms of a finite number of Wilson coefficients associated with 3-particle mass and spin-magnitude changing on-shell amplitudes. We denote these semi-fictitious microscopic processes: \\textit{classical spin transitions}. Explicit results for the leading-order impulse due to the absorption of scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational radiation, for spin transitions $Δs = 0,\\pm 1, \\pm 2$ are given in a fully interpolated form up to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(S^2\\right)$, and Casimir independent contributions given up to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(S^4\\right)$. Our explicit results reveal some surprising universal patterns. We find that, up to identification of Wilson coefficients, the Casimir independent contributions to the impulse for spinning-up and spinning-down by the same magnitude $|Δs|$ are identical. For processes where the quantum $Δs<0$ transition is forbidden, the corresponding classical observable is suppressed in powers of $S$ by a predictable amount. Additionally we find that, while for generic non-aligned spin configurations there is a non-zero scattering angle at leading-order, for aligned spin, similar to non-spinning absorption, the scattering angle vanishes and the impulse is purely longitudinal."}

Under these far-from-equilibrium conditions, we show that in a wide range of forces, one part of the momentum transferred to the system is periodically channeled into the Bose gas through the emission of dispersive density shock waves, solitons, density waves and the creation of additional phase gradients. As a result, the impurity velocity does not increase indefinitely, but periodically oscillates in time around the drift velocity. We uncover and characterize different dynamical regimes in a wide range of the impurity-boson coupling, the impurity mass and the external force. At a sufficiently large force, the Bloch oscillations cease and the impurity exhibits an unlimited acceleration."}

The platform consists of a yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity, where a strong microwave drive pumps the magnon mode and a weak field probes the cavity. The traveling field's interaction with the magnon induces gain, yielding non-Hermitian dynamics. When the traveling field is oriented at $π/2$ relative to the cavity's $x$-axis, the system realizes $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry; eigenvalue analysis reveals a third-order exceptional point ($\\mathrm{EP}_3$) at a tunable effective magnon-photon coupling. Under balanced gain-loss and finite effective magnomechanical coupling, we demonstrate coherent control of the GHS by steering the system across the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric transition and through $\\mathrm{EP}_3$ via the effective magnon-photon coupling, enabling pronounced enhancement or suppression of the lateral shift. Furthermore, we show that without effective magnomechanical coupling, the system exhibits a second-order exceptional point ($\\mathrm{EP}_2$) with a distinct GHS phase transition. This phase transition vanishes when the effective magnomechanical coupling exceeds a parametric threshold, where strong absorption at resonance suppresses the GHS. We also identify the intracavity length as an additional control parameter for precise shift tuning. Notably, the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric configuration yields substantially larger GHS than its Hermitian counterpart. These results advance non-Hermitian magnomechanics and open a route to GHS-based microwave components for quantum switching and precision sensing."}

While the model in the gapped phase is known to reduce to the toric code model - whose ground state is entirely constructible from Clifford circuits - we demonstrate that the very different gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase can also be significantly disentangled with Clifford circuits. Specifically, CAMPS simulations reveal that approximately two-thirds of the entanglement entropy in the isotropic point arises from Clifford-circuit contributions, enabling dramatically more efficient computations compared to conventional matrix product state (MPS) methods. Crucially, this finding implies that the Kitaev QSL state retains significant Clifford-simulatable structure, even in the gapless phase with non-abelian anyon excitations when time reversal symmetry is broken. This property not only enhances classical simulation efficiency significantly but also suggests substantial resource reduction for preparing such states on quantum devices. As an application, we leverage CAMPS to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model and determine the most accurate phase boundary between the anti-ferromagnetic phase and the Kitaev QSL phase in the model. Our results highlight how Clifford circuits can effectively disentangle the intricate entanglement of Kitaev QSLs, opening avenues for efficiently simulating related and similar strongly correlated models."}

Our analysis reveals that the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) plays a central role in significantly boosting the efficiency of SHG. The unique electronic properties of graphene, combined with the resonant characteristics of SPPs, create a synergistic effect that amplifies the nonlinear optical signals. This enhancement is attributed to the strong field confinement and the resonant nature of SPPs, which effectively increase the interaction between the incident light and the graphene monolayer. Furthermore, we analyze the underlying mechanisms that govern this process, providing a comprehensive theoretical framework that elucidates the interplay between graphene's electronic structure and the optical fields. Our findings suggest that the ATR scheme not only facilitates the excitation of SPPs but also optimizes the conditions for SHG."}

Although the model applies to NV centre in diamond, it can be applied with small modifications to other semiconducting solid state qubits. In our model, we include the drift and collection of charge carriers as well as the presence of other defects via generation and recombination dynamics. Though the photoluminescence readout and the associated dynamics of the NV defect has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically, so far, there has been no precise model for photocurrent readout, including these effects. In our description, we use a multilevel-level system including mS=0, mS=+-1 ground and excited states, singlet state and the NV0 neutral state. Also, the presence of substitutional nitrogen (NS), which for example determines the spin coherence via the paramagnetic spin bath, is discussed together with presence of acceptor defects. We model the time-dependent occupation of all electronic sublevels and also consider the electronic charge transport from the Boltzmann transport equation, leading to information about the charge state transitions and recombination dynamics. ODMR and PDMR response as well as their quantum efficiencies, are calculated. On this basis, we determine an optimal parameter space for qubit operations, including the highest spin contrast and especially relate those to NS presence. The model is confirmed experimentally and can become a useful tool for optimisation of the performance of NV qubit photoelectric readout."}

In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data \\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim} and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\\lesssim r\\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $α^{\\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier."}

Here we test these new approaches on various one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin systems with a single ejected fermion, i.e., extracting the single-hole spectral function $A(k,ω)$. We compute the Green's function $G(r,τ)$ via a canonical transformation of the fermionic Hamiltonian, implementing it for stochastic series expansion QMC simulations. Our calculations of $A(k,ω)$ focus on the different characteristics of systems with spin-charge separation and those in which a spin polaron forms instead due to effectively attractive interactions between the spin and the charge. Spin-charge separation is well established in the conventional $t$-$J$ chain, which we confirm here as a demonstration of the method. Turning on a multi-spin interaction $Q$ that eventually drives the system into a spontaneously dimerized (valence-bond solid, VBS) state, we can observe the features of spin-charge separation until the VBS transition takes place. While generally good agreement is found with the conventional analytical spin-charge separation ansatz, we point out the formation of a gap between two holon bands that in the ansatz are degenerate at $k=0$ and $k=π$. Inside the VBS phase, effectively attractive interactions may lead to the binding of the spinon and holon, of which we find evidence at large $Q/J$. In the statically dimerized $t$-$J$ chain, we find equally spaced spin polaron bands corresponding to increasingly large bound states with two internal spin polaron modes -- even and odd with respect to parton permutation. Our results overall demonstrate the power of modern analytic continuation tools in combination with large-scale QMC simulations."}

We discover a fundamentally different regime of topological transport, whereby the optimal oscillatory preparation protocol functions as a non-adiabatic topological pump: as a result, ultrahigh time-averaged anomalous Hall conductivities emerge, that reach up to around seventy times the values one would expect from the Chern number of the targeted Floquet state. The optimal protocols achieve >99% fidelity at the topological energy gap closing point - a twenty-fold improvement over standard monotonic approaches in as little as ten Floquet cycles - while unexpectedly generating the predicted ultrahigh conductivities.

In this work, we present pTEOBResumS, a new parametrized inspiral-merger-ringdown model for null tests of GR that incorporates both orbital eccentricity and spin precession. Building on the effective-one-body model TEOBResumS-Dalí, we introduce parametrized deviations from GR both in the inspiral and the merger-ringdown regimes. We validate the model via parameter estimation of synthetic signals, including from numerical relativity simulations of BBHs and a boson star binary. These allow us to establish the model's consistency, demonstrate its capability to identify beyond-GR effects, and gauge the impact of eccentricity in tests of GR. We then analyze a set of BBH events from the first three LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs, testing whether they are best explained by a GR or non-GR waveform, under either the eccentric, spin-aligned or precessing, quasi-circular hypotheses. We find no significant statistical evidence in favor of deviations from GR. Consistent with previous works, we infer a mild preference for longer remnant quasi-normal mode damping times than expected in GR, though the limited sample and potential systematics reduce its significance. In addition, when weighting by signal strength, joint posteriors combining the individual events are still compatible with GR. We find no strong evidence for imprints of orbital eccentricity in the analyzed events, with the exception of GW200129. For this, our analysis finds a strong preference for an eccentric, GR-consistent description, although as previous works have noted this result could be influenced by data quality issues."}

The Kitaev model has become a cornerstone of quantum magnetism due to its quantum spin liquid ground state and rich phase diagram. The Kitaev model has also been treated in the monitored circuit setting, giving rise to topological area-law and critical-law entanglement entropy phases. In this article, we study the evolution of its phase diagram under the addition of new terms, motivated by their effects in the Kitaev model. We find that a single-qubit term, analogous to a magnetic field, leads to a trivial state in the high field limit, but with an additional intermediate volume-law phase. A three-qubit operator that commutes with the flux operators has the opposite effect: it stabilizes the critical-law phase against the short ranged area-law entanglement. We also employ a four-qubit plaquette commuting operator that simultaneously measures two opposite identical-type bonds on a plaquette. This generates a distinct volume-law phase and preserves the plaquette fluxes and associated topological order, yielding extensive entanglement while coexisting with the topological memory characteristic of the area-law phase. We quantitatively locate phase boundaries using stabilizer (Clifford) simulations together with tripartite mutual information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results highlight the rich phase diagram accessible from the measurement-only Kitaev model as well as suggesting rules relating the newly added operators to the phases they promote."}

As a result, in the absorption band of the film a novel feature of the Faraday effect is experimentally observed and numerically confirmed: sign of the Faraday rotation at a fixed wavelength becomes dependent on the film thickness and therefore is ambiguously related to the sign of the gyration and magnetization of the film. We elaborated an analytical model taking into account an interplay between the bulk and surface contributions which nicely describes the experimental data. Moreover, the Faraday rotation coming purely from interfaces without any bulk contribution is demonstrated. Possible applications of the observed unusual Faraday rotation behavior include hardware data encryption and other devices performing polarization control at nanoscale."}

Current PTA analyses generally assume circular binaries; however, dynamical interactions with the surrounding environment can prevent complete circularisation, allowing SMBHBs to retain appreciable eccentricities. In this work, we present a gravitational waveform model for eccentric binaries based on the Effective-One-Body (EOB) formalism, designed for continuous GW searches in PTA data. The model is accurate up to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order for the conservative dynamics and up to post-leading order for the radiation-reaction terms. We provide both a numerically precise and a computationally efficient approximate implementation and evaluate the latter's accuracy against the full model over a broad range of eccentricities and initial orbital frequencies. Our results show that a substantial region of the parameter space exhibits pronounced orbital evolution, much stronger than in the circular case. We demonstrate the rich harmonic structure of timing residuals induced by eccentric GWs. Properly characterising eccentric binaries is an essential step toward detecting GWs in PTA data and interpreting the results, ultimately improving our understanding of the supermassive black hole population in the local Universe."}

In this context, equation-of-state-insensitive or ``quasi-universal'' relations between key observables, such as the compactness, dimensionless static tidal deformability, and moment of inertia, play a crucial role in connecting different measurable observables while minimizing uncertainties due to the yet unknown equation of state. In this work, we identify new quasi-universal relations between the static, dimensionless tidal deformability ($Λ^{(0)}$) and its leading-order dynamical correction ($Λ^{(2)}$), as well as a combination of these parameters ($\\sqrt{Λ^{(0)}/Λ^{(2)}} \\equiv Mω_*$), obtained from the small-frequency expansion of the relativistic tidal response. We test these relations across a representative set of 63 equations of state, finding that the equation-of-state dependence does not exceed $\\sim 5\\%$ for the $Λ^{(0)}$-$Λ^{(2)}$ relation and $\\sim 2.5\\%$ for the $Λ^{(0)}$-$Mω_*$ relation. This indicates a high degree of universality and offers a simplified framework for incorporating dynamical tidal effects into gravitational-wave modeling. Furthermore, we compare the fully dynamical tidal response against different recent strategies (a Taylor expansion and an effective-one-mode approximation) to model the dynamical tide. We find that both models are capable of capturing the frequency-dependent behavior of the fully dynamical tidal deformability, with the Taylor expansion outperforming the effective-one-mode approximation in most of the parameter space."}

Two-point optical frequency division using chip-scale components and ~1 THz-spanning microcombs has been quite successful, but with stringent requirements on the comb source's free-running noise and feedback control dynamics. Here we introduce a major simplification of this architecture that replaces feedback control of the frequency comb in favor of electronic feedforward noise cancelation that significantly relaxes the comb requirements. Demonstrated with both a high repetition rate solid-state mode-locked laser and a microcomb, feedforward on a 10 GHz carrier results in more robust operation with phase noise as low as -153 dBc/Hz at offsets >10 kHz, femtosecond timing jitter, and elimination of the large \"servo bump\" noise increase at high offset frequency.

Measurements using a superconducting high-impedance resonator capacitively coupled to the double quantum dot reveal dispersive features of two and three electron states, enabling the detection of Pauli spin and valley blockade and the characterization of the spin-orbit gap at zero magnetic field. The results deepen our understanding of few-carrier spin and valley states in bilayer graphene quantum dots and demonstrate that cQED techniques are a powerful state-selective probe for semiconductor nanostructures."}

Persistent microseisms in the 0.1-0.3 Hz band couple into the instruments, degrade lock stability, and contribute substantially to detector downtime during observing runs. The multi-stage seismic isolation system has achieved remarkable success in mitigating such disturbances through active feedback control, yet residual platform motion remains a key factor limiting low-frequency sensitivity and duty cycle. Further reduction of this residual motion is therefore critical for improving the long-term stability and overall astrophysical reach of the observatories.\n  In this work, we develop a data-driven approach that uses machine learning to model and suppress residual seismic motion within the isolation system. Ground and platform sensor data from the detectors are used to train a neural network that predicts platform motion driven by microseismic activity. When incorporated into the control scheme, the network's predictions yield up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in residual motion compared to conventional linear filtering methods, revealing that nonlinear couplings play a significant role in limiting current isolation performance. These results demonstrate that machine-learning-based control can provide a powerful new pathway for enhancing active seismic isolation, improving lock robustness, and extending the low-frequency observational capabilities of gravitational-wave detectors."}

A popular transformation step in this pipeline involves the quadratization of higher-order binary optimization problems, translating them into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations through the introduction of auxiliary variables. Conventional algorithms for the selection of auxiliary variables often aim to minimize the total number of required variables without taking the constraints of the underlying quantum computer-in particular, the connectivity of its qubits-into consideration. This quickly results in interaction graphs that are incompatible with the target device, resulting in a substantial compilation overhead even with highly optimized compilers. To address this issue, this work presents a novel approach for the selection of auxiliary variables tailored for architectures with limited connectivity. By specifically constructing an interaction graph with a regular structure and a limited maximal degree of vertices, we find a way to construct QAOA circuits that can be mapped efficiently to a variety of architectures. We show that, compared to circuits constructed from a QUBO formulation using conventional auxiliary selection methods, the proposed approach reduces the circuit depth by almost 40%.

Of special interest are photonic circuits employing microwave capacitors, which instantaneously modulate photonic waveguides with frequency $ω_p \\ll ω_0$. While the amplification of light is negligible in such circuits, ideally, frequency conversion can be completed with the conservation of the light amplitude. Therefore, similar to the elastically transparent photonic structures (i.e., structures conserving both the light amplitude and frequency), we can say that a photonic circuit parametrically modulated in time exhibits complete inelastic transparency if a wave enters the structure with frequency $ω_0$ and exits it with a different frequency and the same amplitude. Here, we develop an approach that allows us to introduce and investigate a broad class of time-modulated photonic circuits exhibiting complete inelastic transparency. Light enters these circuits with a resonant frequency $ω_0$, cascades between their $N$ eigenstates separated by the modulation frequency $ω_p$, and exits with frequency $ω_0 + (N-1)ω_p$ and the output amplitude close to the input amplitude.

Combining a semiclassical framework with Boltzmann transport theory, we show that the vertical magnon transport (VMT) currents respond both linearly and nonlinearly to the in-plane gradients of magnetic field and temperature. The linear transport coefficients are tied to the total hidden magnon BC, while the nonlinear (second-order) coefficients for the magnetic field and temperature gradients are determined by the hidden magnon BC dipole and the hidden extended magnon BC dipole, respectively. Using linear spin-wave theory, we find that the hidden magnon BC over the Brillouin zone is given by the expectation value of a pseudo-${\\cal Z}$ operator, representing vertical displacements, evaluated in the space of paraunitary matrices that diagonalize the magnon Hamiltonian. We estimate VMT in spin models of realistic magnets with ferro- and antiferromagnetic order, including the buckled honeycomb (BHC) lattice and bilayer Chromium trihalide (CrX$_3$; X = Cl, Br, I) systems. In BHC, both linear and nonlinear VMT arise when time-reversal symmetry is broken by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. In CrX$_3$ systems, the nonlinear coefficients dominate, while the linear responses vanish due to time-reversal symmetry. Both systems exhibit distinctive features across a broad range of temperatures and parameters. Therefore, our prediction of VMT and its characteristic signatures is directly testable in present-day magnonic experiments, especially in atomically thin, few-layered van der Waals magnets."}

We find that the second-order Hall response (SOHE), which originates from the Berry curvature dipole, is enhanced in the single-node semimetallic phase as compared to the double node case when inversion symmetry is broken. In contrast, the SOHE vanishes in the nodal line semimetal as the inversion symmetry retains. Notably, the third-order Hall response due to Berry connection polarizabilty becomes much larger in the line-node Dirac semimetal, especially when the Fermi energy lies near the band edge, than in the single- and double-node Dirac semimetals.

Standard equilibrium approaches, limited by the Quantum Fisher Information given by static energy fluctuations, lose sensitivity outside a fixed temperature window. Non-equilibrium strategies have therefore been recently proposed to overcome these limits, but their advantages are typically model-dependent or tailored for a specific purpose. This Letter establishes a general, model-independent result showing that any temperature-dependent unitary driving applied to a thermalized probe enhances its quantum Fisher information with respect to its equilibrium value. Such information gain is expressed analytically through a positive semi-definite kernel of information currents that quantify the flow of statistical distinguishability. Our results are benchmarked on a driven spin-$1/2$ thermometer, furthermore showing that resonant modulations remarkably restore the quadratic-in-time scaling of the Fisher information and allow to shift the sensitivity peak across arbitrary temperature ranges.

Several distinct chain architectures have been developed for this purpose. Here, we report a zigzag superlattice, containing two staggered sub-lattices, that supports multiple edge states, including higher-order modes. In such lattices, the intra- and intercell coupling is imbalanced by the tunneling effect of the eigenstates or deformation of the higher-order modes. We demonstrate that by arranging the zigzag superlattice into a curved shape, some of the edge states transition into bulk states as the curvature of the lattice increases, while some bulk states become more localized towards edge states. The reason is that a curved superlattice strengthens the intra-lattice coupling of the inner sub-lattice due to the separation reduction of the potential wells. %which, on the one hand, hinders the tunneling of the eigenstate to the outer sub-lattice and hence weakens the edge states formed in the inner sub-lattice. On the other hand, it can isolate more edge states formed in the outer sub-lattice, because of the induced more intensive deformation of the higher-order modes in the inner sub-lattice. We also show that some bulk states at larger curvatures can be transformed into edge states by a repulsive nonlinearity, which also enables the coexistence of different edge states. As a specific and ideal platform for realizing such topological superlattices we explore exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities with their strong nonlinearity and possibility for optical excitation and control. Our work introduces an additional dimension for the design of complex topological lattices and functional photonic devices."}

The interplay between lattice geometry and the symmetries of the driven system gives rise to drive-induced tunneling processes that redefine the interference conditions and open a controllable route to escaping Aharonov-Bohm caging. Under driving, the diamond chain effectively acquires the geometry of a dimerized lattice, exhibiting charge oscillations between opposite boundaries. This feature can be exploited to generate two-particle entanglement that is directly accessible experimentally.

Results show that PSHE tuned by δn =-2, 0, +2 has completely different dependent behaviors on LLs, incident angle of incident photons, and magnetic induction intensity. These discrepancies are ascribed to Hall-conductivity-incurred Hall angle Θ because the variation tendency of photonic spin Hall shifts is similar to that of Θ with changing the LL index.

Remarkably enhanced PSHE occurs at near-zero Hall angles. In-plane and transverse spin-dependent displacements give their respective extremum values at the same incident angles when the Θ is near to zero, and their incident-angle deviation will become larger and larger as the |Θ| increases.

Working entirely within the Gaussian formalism, we derive closed-form evolution equations for the covariance matrix and show that squeezing induces entropy generation only at *second order* in the anomalous correlations, a nonlinear mechanism absent in thermal environments. This entropy flow is accompanied by a rich non-Hermitian structure: by scanning the squeezing parameters we uncover a characteristic \"exceptional-point fan\" in the (M1, M2) plane, which separates a narrow PT-unbroken region of oscillatory dynamics from broad PT-broken sectors in which one normal mode becomes purely overdamped. This geometric organization of EPs reveals that PT symmetry survives only when the two reservoirs squeeze opposite quadratures, and is generically broken for in-phase squeezing. Our analysis establishes squeezed reservoirs as a natural setting where information-bearing noise drives irreversible behavior through coherent pathways, and lays the groundwork for experimentally accessible probes of entropy flow and critical mode behavior in more complex open systems."}

The key ingredient is the evaluation of the static structure factors of multi-site operators through differentiating the generating function. Despite the approximation errors, we show that our method is still able to extract from exact or variational iPEPS to good precision both frustration-free and non-frustration-free parent Hamiltonians that are beyond the standard construction and obtain better locality. In particular, we find a 4-site-plaquette local Hamiltonian that approximately has the short-range RVB state as the ground state. Moreover, we find a Hamiltonian that has the deformed toric code state at any string tension as excited eigenstates at the same energy, which might be potential candidates for quantum many-body scars."}

We obtain four different wormhole models, two wormholes are characterised by solid angle deficit, three are not asymptotically extendible, while one is asymptotically flat with zero tidal force. These are supported by four different power law $f(R)$ models. The parameter space of the models can support both null energy conditions (NEC) satisfying as well as violating wormhole.

Therefore a full quantum treatment is rarely possible analytically and can be carried out numerically for fairly small systems only. Fortunately, in order to obtain interesting physics, approximations often very well suffice. One of these approximations is given by the cumulants expansion, where expectation values of products of operators are approximated by products of expectation values of said operators, neglecting higher-order correlations. The lowest order of this approximation is widely known as the mean field approximation and used routinely throughout quantum physics. Despite its ubiquitous presence, a general criterion for applicability and convergence properties of higher order cumulants expansions remains to be found. In this paper, we discuss two problems in quantum electrodynamics and quantum information, namely the collective radiative dissipation of a dipole-dipole interacting chain of atoms and the factorization of a bi-prime by annealing in an adiabatic quantum simulator. In the first case we find smooth, convergence behavior, where the approximation performs increasingly better with higher orders, while in the latter going beyond mean field turns out useless and, even for small system sizes, we are puzzled by numerically challenging and partly non-physical solutions."}

Using complementary techniques based on spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we separate the contributions of the spin Hall effect (SHE) and the spin anomalous Hall effect (SAHE). We show that the torques arising from both mechanisms retain their sign across the magnetisation compensation temperature, and that the SAHE-driven damping-like torque has the opposite sign to the SHE-driven term. We suggest that both effects originates from distinct electronic subsystems: the SHE emerging from Gd 5d electrons, and the SAHE from FeCo 3d electrons. Consequently, the SHE sign remains insensitive to the magnetisation state, whereas the SAHE sign does not invert at compensation, reproducing our observations. Together, these insights clarify the interplay between sublattices in ferrimagnetic spin transport and highlight the potential of ferrimagnetic spin currents to generate spin torques in adjacent layers or within the ferrimagnet itself."}

Here, we imaged excitons across the moiré of a 2$^{\\circ}$ twisted bilayer MoS$_2$ with nanometre resolution using room-temperature photocurrent atomic force microscopy. We directly resolved site-selective confinement: direct and indirect excitons localize at different stacking registries of the moiré, with contrast governed by alignment between site-selective generation and confinement minima. A Wannier-based moiré-exciton model reproduces the measured energies and the moiré-induced localization of the exciton wavefunction.

Analysis using the Husimi Q-function, synchronization measures, and Arnold tongue structures reveals a detuning-induced enhancement of phase locking, which significantly improves stability compared to the resonance case.

Results show that PSHE tuned by δn =-2, 0, +2 has completely different dependent behaviors on LLs, incident angle of incident photons, and magnetic induction intensity. These discrepancies are ascribed to Hall-conductivity-incurred Hall angle Θ because the variation tendency of photonic spin Hall shifts is similar to that of Θ with changing the LL index. Giant PSHE with the largest in-plane displacement of more than 400 times of incident wavelength is obtained at the transition |n=55>->|n'=57>.

We find that the SC responds only mildly to weak fields, behaving as an almost even function of field strength. In contrast, the MBC is activated directly by TRS breaking and grows linearly with weak fields at selected photon energies. Focusing on AB-bilayer graphene ribbon we investigate the behavior of SC and MBC under both weak and strong vertical fields. We uncover the strikingly opposite roles played by edge states in the SC: under weak fields these highly localized, sublattice- and layer-polarized edge modes are essentially dark, yet under strong fields - when Landau levels dominate - the same edge states swell in spatial extent and become intensely bright contributors to the SC response."}

The ringdown of BBH merger, consisting of a series of quasi-normal modes (QNMs), is of particular interest for both the black hole (BH) spectroscopy and the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency check. Unlike the QNM frequencies that only depend on the properties of the remnant BH, the excitation amplitudes and phases of QNMs depend on the progenitor system, and calculating them is beyond the perturbative approach. In this paper, by performing self-consistent fully non-linear simulations of BBH merger in shift-symmetric scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity as well as in sGB gravity allowing for scalarization, and extracting the QNM excitation, we explore the possible deviations from GR at the ringdown stage. We numerically verify that the mode frequencies are consistent with the theory prediction, and provide the fitting results of mode amplitudes and phases. We find relatively small changes in the mode excitation, considering that the largest coupling we used in the simulations is close to the limit of loss of hyperbolicity. To demonstrate that our results are robust against the eccentricity caused by the imperfect initial data, we also perform eccentricity reduction and estimate the effect caused by the initial eccentricity. These studies are useful for understanding the ringdown in sGB gravity."}

The modification is principally grounded on a multiscalar-metric concept of spacetime endowed with two dynamical structures: a basic metric and a set of the reversible multiscalar fields. The latter ones serve geometrically as exceptional dynamical coordinates among arbitrary kinematical/observer's ones and physically as a kind of gravitational Higgs fields producing possible spontaneous breaking of the symmetry (SSB) of relativity. The effective field theory (EFT) of the extended gravity based on the multiscalar-metric spacetime -- the metagravity -- is discussed and some of its particular realizations beyond GR as SBR are explicated. Physically, SBR results in appearance of massive tensor and scalar gravitons. Some of the emerging consequences, problems and prospects for SBR for future deeper unification of gravity with matter in the context of the relativity and internal symmetries breaking are shortly discussed."}

Shrinkage is interpreted as a completely positive trace-preserving process, so attenuation of coefficients is carried out through controlled decoherence rather than nonlinear thresholding. Phase damping and ancilla-driven constructions realize this behavior coherently and show that statistical adaptivity and quantum unitarity can be combined within a single circuit model. The same physical mechanisms that reduce quantum coherence, such as dephasing and amplitude damping, are repurposed as programmable resources for noise suppression. Practical demonstrations implemented with Qiskit illustrate how circuits and channels emulate coefficientwise attenuation, and all examples are provided as Jupyter notebooks in the companion GitHub repository. Encoding schemes for amplitude, phase, and hybrid representations are examined in relation to transform coherence and measurement feasibility, and realizations suited to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices are discussed. The work provides a conceptual and experimental link between wavelet-based statistical inference and quantum information processing, and shows how engineered decoherence can act as an operational surrogate for classical shrinkage."}

However, this may change with the next generation of experiments. If we can convince ourselves that the cosmic acceleration is not due to a constant, this would open up new fascinating avenues. By exploring the simplest cosmological model in the bulk, that of an empty and flat space with a cosmological constant $Λ$, we find that its holographic dual makes sense as a theory of fundamental quantum degrees of freedom at the boundary. Moreover, we find that an observer in the bulk, making long-range (electromagnetic and gravitational) observations, cannot distinguish the acceleration induced by the cosmological constant $Λ$ from that induced by the thermodynamic properties of the boundary, the de Sitter horizon. By including matter in the bulk we extend this holographic principle to GREA, where the quantum d.o.f. associated with the evolving boundary of the causal horizon induces an entropic acceleration that varies in time. Future observations will determine whether our causal horizon is responsible for the present acceleration and whether our universe will end in de Sitter or Minkowski."}

We construct a family of star-like graphs whose states fail a specific class of MMI instances, and extend this analysis to general star topologies. Deriving adjacency matrix constraints that fix the MMI evaluation for these instances and interpreting them physically, we prove the forbidden-subgraph conjecture for this family of graphs.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Fault tolerance is widely regarded as indispensable for achieving scalable and reliable quantum computing. However, the spacetime overhead required for fault-tolerant quantum computating remains prohibitively large. A critical challenge arises in many quantum algorithms with Clifford + $\\varphi$ compiling, where logical rotation gates $R_{Z_L}(\\varphi)$ serve as essential components. The Eastin-Knill theorem prevents their transversal implementation in quantum error correction codes and necessitating resource-intensive workarounds through T-gate compilation combined with magic state distillation and injection. In this work, we consider error-structure-tailored fault tolerance, where fault-tolerance conditions are analyzed by combining perturbative analysis of realistic dissipative noise processes with the structural properties of stabilizer codes. Based on this framework, we design 1-fault-tolerant continuous-angle rotation gates in stabilizer codes, implemented via dispersive-coupling Hamiltonians. Our approach could circumvent the need for T-gate compilation and distillation, offering a hardware-efficient solution that maintains simplicity, minimizes physical footprint, and requires only nearest-neighbor interactions. Integrating with recent small-angle-state preparation techniques, we can suppress the gate error to $91|\\varphi| p^2$ for small rotation angle (where p denotes the physical error rate). For current achievable hardware parameters ($p=10^{-3}$), this enables reliable execution of over $10^7$ small-angle rotations when $|\\varphi|\\approx 10^{-3}$, meeting the requirements of many near-term quantum applications. Compared to the 15-to-1 magic state distillation and magic state cultivation approaches, our method reduces spacetime resource costs by factors of 1337.5 and 43.6, respectively, for a Heisenberg Hamiltonian simulation task under realistic hardware assumptions."}

We show that imposing phase-covariance, flip covariance, permutation invariance, and classical consistency fully determines the structure of the broadcasting map. Within this family, we identify the unique map that minimizes the simulation cost, and we prove that both the simulation cost and the distance to the closest CPTP map are strictly smaller than in the unitary covariant setting. We also demonstrate that the closest physical map is the optimal phase-covariant cloning channel, mirroring the relation between unitary covariant broadcasting and universal cloning. Despite these improvements, the resulting virtual broadcasting map remains sample-inefficient and is therefore still operationally impractical."}

The reconstruction of solutions (i.e., the readout of quantum states) remains a crucial problem, although numerous efficient quantum algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, we propose and compare several efficient readout methods in the real and the Fourier space. The Fourier space readout (FSR) and the proposed approximate real space readout (ARSR) methods are currently the most efficient and practical ones for the purpose of reconstructing continuous real-valued functions. In contrast, the quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) based methods (especially in the Fourier space) are favorable for mid-term/far-term quantum devices. Besides, we apply the methods for benchmark solutions in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and demonstrate great improvements compared to the conventional sampling method for large grid numbers. Equipped with efficient readout methods, we further show that a 2D Burgers' equation can be solved efficiently without using the expensive strategy of linearization. It suggests the potential quantum advantages for some practical applications on mid-term quantum devices."}

Unlike classical amplifiers, SPAs can achieve or closely approach quantum-limited performance, specifically the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) of half a photon of added noise for phase-preserving amplification. The core principle of SPAs relies on parametric amplification, where energy is transferred from a strong pump tone to a weak input signal through non-dissipative nonlinear mixing processes. This is enabled by intrinsic nonlinearities in superconducting materials, primarily kinetic inductance in thin films (e.g., NbTiN, Al) and, more significantly, the Josephson effect in Josephson junctions. These nonlinear elements facilitate frequency mixing (three-wave or four-wave mixing) and can operate in phase-preserving or phase-sensitive amplification modes, with the latter allowing for noise squeezing below the SQL. This chapter emphasizes the significant role of resonator design in determining critical SPA performance metrics such as gain, bandwidth, and noise characteristics. It details both lumped-element (LC) and distributed-element (coplanar waveguide, CPW) resonators, discussing their unique properties, suitability for different frequency ranges, and the importance of achieving high-quality factors (Q) for efficient energy storage and minimal loss. A practical design and simulation of a meandered quarterwavelength CPW resonator coupled to a feed line is presented, illustrating how precise control over geometric parameters optimizes resonant frequency, coupling strength, and quality factor for high-fidelity qubit state discrimination."}

Therefore a full quantum treatment is rarely possible analytically and can be carried out numerically for fairly small systems only. Fortunately, in order to obtain interesting physics, approximations often very well suffice. One of these approximations is given by the cumulants expansion, where expectation values of products of operators are approximated by products of expectation values of said operators, neglecting higher-order correlations. The lowest order of this approximation is widely known as the mean field approximation and used routinely throughout quantum physics. Despite its ubiquitous presence, a general criterion for applicability and convergence properties of higher order cumulants expansions remains to be found. In this paper, we discuss two problems in quantum electrodynamics and quantum information, namely the collective radiative dissipation of a dipole-dipole interacting chain of atoms and the factorization of a bi-prime by annealing in an adiabatic quantum simulator. In the first case we find smooth, convergence behavior, where the approximation performs increasingly better with higher orders, while in the latter going beyond mean field turns out useless and, even for small system sizes, we are puzzled by numerically challenging and partly non-physical solutions."}

In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data \\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim} and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\\lesssim r\\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered.

Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier."}

In contrast, a direct unitary implementation of the ${T}$ gate using the cubic phase gate has been shown to have logical error floor unless the GKP codestate has a biased noise profile [1]. In this work, we propose a method for on-demand noise biasing based on a standard GKP error correction circuit. This on-demand biasing circuit can be used to bias the GKP codestate before a $T$ gate and return it to a non-biased state afterwards. With the on-demand biasing circuit, we prove that the logical error rate of the $T$ gate can be made arbitrarily small as the quality of the GKP codestates increases. We complement our proof with a numerical investigation of the cubic phase gate subject to a phenomenological noise model, showing that the ${T}$ gate can achieve average gate fidelities above $99\\%$ with 12 dB of GKP squeezing without the use of postselection. Moreover, we develop a formalism for finding optimal unitary representations of logical diagonal gates in higher levels of the Clifford hierarchy that is based on a framework of ``polynomial phase stabilizers'' whose exponents are polynomial functions of one of the quadrature operators.

By varying the spacing between the resonators, we observe strong modulation of the transmission spectra, including mode splitting, interference effects, and the formation of dark states. Measurements on fabricated devices show clear signatures of hybridization that depend on both chirality and proximity, and these results are consistent with full-wave electromagnetic simulations. To describe the observed behavior, we develop a circuit quantum electrodynamics model that captures the dependence of the coupling strength on geometry and the reversal of its sign. Although the experimental excitation is classical, the system reproduces features expected from two quantized harmonic oscillators, providing a classical analogue of a chiral quantum hybrid platform. The ability to control photon tunneling through structural design and excitation parameters suggests potential applications in reconfigurable photonic devices, quantum communication, chiral sensing, and polarization-selective signal processing."}

The coherence of the wave function as measured by the boosted observer is studied as a function of the boost parameter and the width of the Gaussian wave packets. Using various formulations of coherence, it is shown that in general the coherence decays with increase in the width of the Gaussian wave packet, higher values of boost parameter, and the number of particles on which boost is applied."}

By using controlled rotations of ancillary systems between successive interaction stages, we eliminate parameter interdependencies, thereby rendering the quantum Fisher information matrix non-singular.

A central open question is how magnetic or synthetic gauge fields influence this boundary phenomenon. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for magnetic control of the NHSE along line boundaries in two-dimensional single-band lattices. Using a non-Hermitian extension of the anisotropic Harper--Hofstadter model as a representative example, we show that magnetic fields suppress the geometric skin effect in reciprocal models, whereas skin localization can persist in nonreciprocal systems. The analysis disentangles the interplay of flux, nonreciprocity, and boundary geometry, revealing that magnetic fields mitigate or suppress the NHSE through distinct physical mechanisms -- such as bulk localization via Landau or Anderson physics, or the restoration of effective reciprocity. In particular, the geometry-dependent skin effect in reciprocal systems is found to be fragile against even weak magnetic fields."}

Although widely studied in optical and quantum systems, using them for energy storage in quantum systems has been difficult because existing approaches rely on gain, precise balanced loss, or explicitly non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a quantum energy-storage mechanism that realizes exceptional-point physics in a fully passive, physically consistent open quantum system. Instead of amplification, we use trace-preserving reservoir engineering to create an effective complex interaction between a charging mode and a storage mode through a dissipative mediator, generating an exceptional point directly in the drift matrix of the Heisenberg-Langevin equations while preserving complete positivity. The resulting dynamics exhibit two regimes: a stable phase where the stored energy saturates, and a broken phase where energy grows exponentially under a bounded coherent drive. This rapid charging arises from dissipative interference that greatly boosts energy flow between the modes without gain media or nonlinear amplification. The mechanism is compatible with optomechanical devices, superconducting circuits, and magnonic systems, offering a practical route to fast, robust, and scalable quantum energy-storage technologies and new directions in quantum thermodynamics."}

Single-shot error correction aims to suppress errors using only one round of syndrome extraction. However, for most codes, it requires high-weight checks, which significantly degrade, and often eliminate, single-shot performance at the circuit level. In this work, we introduce local single-shot checks, where we impose constraints on check weights. Using a dynamic measurement scheme, we show that the number of required measurement rounds can be reduced by a factor determined by this constraint. As an example, we show through numerical simulation that our scheme can improve decoding performance compared to conventional checks when using sliding-window decoding with a reduced window size under circuit-level noise models for toric codes. Our work provides a new direction for constructing checks that can reduce time overhead in large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation."}

Yet, the challenge of transforming these idealized security models into practical, resilient systems remains a pressing issue, especially as quantum computing evolves. In this review, we critically dissect and synthesize the latest advancements in QKD protocols and their security vulnerabilities, with a strong emphasis on rigorous security proofs. We actively categorize contemporary QKD schemes into three key classes: uncertainty principle-based protocols (e.g., BB84), hybrid architectures that enable secure direct communication (eg, three-stage protocol), and continuous-variable frameworks. We further include two modern classes of QKD protocols, namely Twin-field QKD and Device-Independent QKD, both of which were developed to have practical implementations over the last decade. Moreover, we highlight important experimental breakthroughs and innovative mitigation strategies, including the deployment of advanced Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs), that significantly enhance channel fidelity and system robustness. By mapping the current landscape, from sophisticated quantum attacks to state-of-the-art error correction methods, this review fills an important gap in the literature. To bring everything together, the relevance of this review concerning quantum augmented networks (QuANets) is also presented.

Our ancilla-free GF multiplication circuit has the gate count complexity of $O(m^{\\log_2{3}})$, an improvement over the previous best bound of $O(m^2)$. This was achieved by developing an efficient $O(m)$ circuit for multiplication by the constant polynomial $1+x^{\\lceil{m/2}\\rceil}$, a key component of Van Hoof's construction. This asymptotic reduction translates to a factor of 100+ improvement of the $\\cnotgate$ gate counts in the implementation of the multiplication by the constant for parameters $m$ of practical importance. For the GF division, we reduce gate count complexity from $O(m^2 \\log(m))$ to $O(m^2 \\log \\log(m)/\\log(m))$ by selecting irreducible polynomials that enable efficient implementation of both the constant polynomial multiplication and field squaring operations. We demonstrate practical advantages for cryptographically relevant values of $m$.

We answer this question by presenting a method to extract geometrically $k$-local conserved operators that have the given infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS) in 2D as an (approximate) eigenstate. The key ingredient is the evaluation of the static structure factors of multi-site operators through differentiating the generating function. Despite the approximation errors, we show that our method is still able to extract from exact or variational iPEPS to good precision both frustration-free and non-frustration-free parent Hamiltonians that are beyond the standard construction and obtain better locality. In particular, we find a 4-site-plaquette local Hamiltonian that approximately has the short-range RVB state as the ground state. Moreover, we find a Hamiltonian that has the deformed toric code state at any string tension as excited eigenstates at the same energy, which might be potential candidates for quantum many-body scars."}

Most previous work on routing in quantum networks assumes utility functions that are isotonic, meaning that the ordering of two paths does not change when extending both with the same edge. However, we show that utility functions that take into account both the rate and quality of the entanglement generation (e.g., the secret-key rate) are often non-isotonic. This makes pathfinding difficult as classical algorithms such as Dijkstra's become unsuitable, with the state of the art for quantum networks being an exhaustive search over all possible paths. In this work we present improved algorithms. First, we present two best-first-search algorithms that use destination-aware merit functions for faster convergence. One of these provably finds the best path, while the other uses heuristics to achieve an effectively sublinear scaling of the query count in the network size while in practice always finding a close-to-optimal path. Second, we present metaheuristic algorithms (simulated annealing and a genetic algorithm) that enable tuning a tradeoff between path quality and computational overhead. While we focus on swap-ASAP quantum repeaters for concreteness, our algorithms are readily generalized to different repeater schemes and models."}

We first formulate a topological $S[O(2)\\times O(2)]$ BF theory, and by identifying the Wilson loops and twist operators of this theory with anyons, we show that our topological BF theory reproduces the complete anyon data, and can incorporate all Dijkgraaf--Witten twists. Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further indicates a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry. Our proposal offers an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising prospects in synthetic gauge field platforms."}

Starting from the free Kemmer field in an accelerated reference frame, we establish eigenvalue equations resembling those of the Klein--Gordon equation in Rindler coordinates. By introducing the Dirac oscillator interaction through a momentum substitution, we derive an exact closed-form spectrum for the Kemmer oscillator, revealing how the acceleration parameter modifies the characteristic length, shifts the discrete energy spectrum, and lifts degeneracies.

On a lightlike hypersurfaces, this is no longer true. Electric and magnetic fluxes are no longer independent. To compute the Poisson brackets explicitly, we choose a regularisation. Each path is smeared into a thin ribbon. In the resulting holonomy algebra, Wilson lines commute unless they intersect the same light ray. We compute the structure constants of the holonomy algebra and show that they depend on the geometry of the intersection and the conformal class of the metric at the null surface. Finally, we propose a quantisation. The resulting Hilbert space shows a number of unexpected features. First, the holonomies become anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. Second, for pairs of Wilson lines, the commutation relations can continuously interpolate between fermionic and bosonic relations. Third, there is no unique ground state.

We discover a fundamentally different regime of topological transport, whereby the optimal oscillatory preparation protocol functions as a non-adiabatic topological pump: as a result, ultrahigh time-averaged anomalous Hall conductivities emerge, that reach up to around seventy times the values one would expect from the Chern number of the targeted Floquet state.

The interplay between lattice geometry and the symmetries of the driven system gives rise to drive-induced tunneling processes that redefine the interference conditions and open a controllable route to escaping Aharonov-Bohm caging. Under driving, the diamond chain effectively acquires the geometry of a dimerized lattice, exhibiting charge oscillations between opposite boundaries.

While the model in the gapped phase is known to reduce to the toric code model - whose ground state is entirely constructible from Clifford circuits - we demonstrate that the very different gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase can also be significantly disentangled with Clifford circuits. Specifically, CAMPS simulations reveal that approximately two-thirds of the entanglement entropy in the isotropic point arises from Clifford-circuit contributions, enabling dramatically more efficient computations compared to conventional matrix product state (MPS) methods. Crucially, this finding implies that the Kitaev QSL state retains significant Clifford-simulatable structure, even in the gapless phase with non-abelian anyon excitations when time reversal symmetry is broken. This property not only enhances classical simulation efficiency significantly but also suggests substantial resource reduction for preparing such states on quantum devices. As an application, we leverage CAMPS to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model and determine the most accurate phase boundary between the anti-ferromagnetic phase and the Kitaev QSL phase in the model. Our results highlight how Clifford circuits can effectively disentangle the intricate entanglement of Kitaev QSLs, opening avenues for efficiently simulating related and similar strongly correlated models."}

The platform consists of a yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity, where a strong microwave drive pumps the magnon mode and a weak field probes the cavity. The traveling field's interaction with the magnon induces gain, yielding non-Hermitian dynamics. When the traveling field is oriented at $π/2$ relative to the cavity's $x$-axis, the system realizes $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry; eigenvalue analysis reveals a third-order exceptional point ($\\mathrm{EP}_3$) at a tunable effective magnon-photon coupling. Under balanced gain-loss and finite effective magnomechanical coupling, we demonstrate coherent control of the GHS by steering the system across the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric transition and through $\\mathrm{EP}_3$ via the effective magnon-photon coupling, enabling pronounced enhancement or suppression of the lateral shift. Furthermore, we show that without effective magnomechanical coupling, the system exhibits a second-order exceptional point ($\\mathrm{EP}_2$) with a distinct GHS phase transition. This phase transition vanishes when the effective magnomechanical coupling exceeds a parametric threshold, where strong absorption at resonance suppresses the GHS. We also identify the intracavity length as an additional control parameter for precise shift tuning. Notably, the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric configuration yields substantially larger GHS than its Hermitian counterpart. These results advance non-Hermitian magnomechanics and open a route to GHS-based microwave components for quantum switching and precision sensing."}

The same is true for excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells, for which many effects have been obtained so far only qualitatively within a hydrogenlike two-band model. Here, we derive the complete Hamiltonian for excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells based on the Luttinger-Kohn model, taking into account the full complex valence band structure. Symmetry properties of the system are discussed. Numerical results based on the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian using B-spline functions reveal the energy shifts and the lifting of degeneracies due to the nondiagonal coupling terms of the complex valence band. The relative oscillator strengths of the excitonic transitions induced by circularly polarized light are also calculated."}
