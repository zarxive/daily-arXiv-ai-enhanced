A key to many of these phases is collective bosonic excitations, encoding fluctuations of the underlying order. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework for parametric driving of such modes, whereby periodic modulation of microscopic parameters generates resonant two-boson processes. We show that the feasibility and strength of this drive depend sensitively on whether the targeted parameter alters the properties of the bosonic excitations vacuum, linking potential parametric instabilities directly to the fidelity susceptibility of the ground state. The driving facilitates nonthermal melting of the parent orders, as well as stabilization of novel steady states with experimentally distinct signatures. Through microscopic case-studies of correlated electronic systems, we identify promising driving knobs, highlight the role of quantum geometry in the collective modes susceptibility, and propose realistic experimental probes. Collective excitations are a powerful resource for steering correlated phases out of equilibrium, and will likely have several applications in quantum science.

Magnetic susceptibility reveals canted antiferromagnetic (CAFM) ordering at T_N = 125 K, two compensation points (T_comp1 and T_comp2), followed by magnetization reversal with a magnetic susceptibility minimum between T_comp1 and T_comp2. Heat capacity shows a sharp lambda-type transition at T_N, associated with the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering of Cr, followed by a broad feature near 9 K. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) establishes the Pn'm'a (Gamma2) magnetic structure below T_N. A gradual change in magnetic structure occurs during the spin-reorientation (SRO) transition below 30 K, where the magnetic symmetry transforms from Pn'm'a (Gamma2) to Pn'ma' (Gamma4) phase. However, below the SRO, neither Gamma2 nor Gamma4 alone adequately fit the intensity of magnetic reflections. A satisfactory refinement is achieved using the monoclinic subgroup P21'/c', derived from a combination of Gamma2 and Gamma4. The gradual SRO of Tm and Cr moments across the compensation regime is consistent with the magnetic symmetry P21'/c'. Furthermore, the ordered moments of Cr and Tm in TmCrO3 exhibit a complex, non-monotonic temperature dependence, with the Tm sublattice driving the spin-reorientation transition near the compensation point.

Unlike physical etching, this method preserves the guided-mode profile of the photonic crystal without introducing significant scattering, limiting refractive index perturbations to below 0.001 with 0.01% additional loss. In contrast, physical etching can reduce single-band transmission by more than 30% for an etch width of 100 nm. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using quantum dots embedded in a glideplane photonic crystal waveguide, controlling the detuning between different spin-state combinations of two highly chiral quantum dots coupled to the same mode. Second-order photon correlation measurements provide a sensitive probe of the chirality-dependent photon statistics, which are in good agreement with a waveguide-QED master equation model.

Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials present a particularly promising platform due to their robustness against stray fields and their potential for exceptional DW velocities. Among various proposed driving mechanisms, coherent spin waves could potentially propel AFM DWs to the magnon group velocity while minimizing dissipation from Joule heating. However, experimental realization has remained elusive due to the dual challenges of generating coherent AFM spin waves near isolated mobile AFM DWs and simultaneously measuring high-speed DW dynamics. Here we experimentally realize an approach where ultrafast laser pulses generate coherent spin waves that drive AFM DWs and develop a technique to directly map the spatiotemporal DW dynamics. Using the room-temperature AFM insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$, we observe AFM DW motion with record-high velocities up to ~50 km/s. Remarkably, the direction of DW propagation is controllable through both the pump laser helicity and the sign of the DW winding number. This bidirectional control can be theoretically explained, and numerically reproduced, by the DW dynamics induced by coherent spin waves of the in-plane magnon mode - a phenomenon unique to magnets with an easy-plane anisotropy. Our work uncovers a novel DW propulsion mechanism that is generalizable to a wide range of AFM materials, unlocking new opportunities for ultrafast coherent AFM spintronics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This paper reviews the application of passive sonar systems combined with artificial intelligence (AI) in underwater oil and gas leak detection. The advantages and limitations of traditional monitoring methods, including fibre optic, capacitive and pH sensors, are compared with those of passive sonar systems. Advanced AI methods that enhance signal discrimination, noise suppression and data interpretation capabilities are explored for leak detection. Emerging solutions such as embedded AI analogue-to-digital converters (ADCs), deep learning-based denoising networks and semantically aware underwater optical communication (UOC) frameworks are also discussed to overcome issues such as low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and transmission instability. Furthermore, a hybrid approach combining non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and temporal models (GRU, TCN) is proposed to improve the classification and quantification accuracy of leak events. Despite challenges such as data scarcity and environmental change, AI-assisted passive sonar has shown great potential in real-time, energy-efficient and non-invasive underwater monitoring, contributing to sustainable environmental protection and maritime safety management.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u58f0\u7eb3\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6d77\u5e95\u6cb9\u6c14\u6f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u9ad8\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6d77\u6d0b\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u6d77\u5e95\u6cb9\u6c14\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\u9762\u4e34\u8bf8\u591a\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5f15\u5165AI\u8f85\u52a9\u88ab\u52a8\u58f0\u7eb3\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u88ab\u52a8\u58f0\u7eb3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u5149\u7ea4\u3001 capacitive\u3001pH\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fAI ADC\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53bb\u566a\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u8bed\u4e49 aware\u6c34\u4e0b\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\uff08UOC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7b49\u5148\u8fdbAI\u6280\u672f\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\uff08NMF\uff09\u3001\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff08GRU\uff0cTCN\uff09\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6f0f\u68c0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165AI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u58f0\u7eb3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u5f31\u58f0\u53d1\u5c04\u548c\u9ad8\u566a\u97f3\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAI\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u58f0\u7eb3\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u8f85\u52a9\u88ab\u52a8\u58f0\u7eb3\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6d77\u5e95\u6cb9\u6c14\u6f0f\u96be\u9898\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u73af\u5883\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6d77\u6d0b\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

This is in addition to the wide interest in the application of operator methods for better understanding of fluid flows. A particular problem of relevance to all such applications is, how does the Koopman or the Perron-Frobenius (PF) operator change if the underlying vector field of the dynamical system undergoes small changes or if two vector fields are added. The current numerical methods rely on significant computations and model or parameter changes to the dynamical system often require all the computations to be repeated. This paper reports on a novel approach to the computation of the approximate PF and Koopman operators in such cases. The approach makes use of the exponentials of the infinitesimal generators of these operators. It is shown that this approximation depends on the Lie bracket of the vector field and the perturbation vector field. Examples are described where the Koopman and PF operators are constructed from operators of primitive flows and for cases where the model parameters undergo perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Metal-insulator transitions (MITs) are central to bridging these two domains while simultaneously serving as 'on-off' switches for electronic states. Here, we demonstrate how the prototypical material of K2Cr8O16 undergoes a ferromagnetic MIT accompanied by a change in band topology. Through inelastic x-ray and neutron scattering experiments combined with first-principles theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that this transition is not driven by a Peierls mechanism, given the lack of phonon softening. Instead, we establish the transition as a topological MIT within the ferromagnetic phase (topological-FM-MIT) with potential axionic properties, where electron correlations play a key role in stabilizing the insulating state. This work pioneers the discovery of a topological-FM-MIT and represents a fundamentally new class of topological phase transitions, revealing a unique pathway through which magnetism, topology, and electronic correlations interact.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This study investigated the interaction between atoms and a dielectric surface using an atomic fountain measurement technique, in which cold rubidium atoms were released from a moving optical dipole trap. The launched cold atoms were irradiated with an evanescent light detuned from the D$_2$ transition by $-$20.2 to $+$20.2 MHz, after which they were recaptured by reactivating the optical dipole trap. Our measurements revealed that the number of recaptured atoms decreased with increasing flight time, and the decay was suppressed under blue-detuned conditions. We modeled the motion dynamics of the cold atomic ensemble, incorporating Casimir-Polder interactions between the dielectric surface and cold atoms, and observed that the rate of decrease in the number of residual atoms depended on the value of the van der Waals potential coefficient $C_3$.

To address this, we recently demonstrated, by modifying Euler-angle parameterization, that an optical gadget consisting of two quarter-wave $q$-plates and one half-wave $q$-plate, each endowed with the same topological charge $q$, operates as a viable SU(2) gadget for the higher-order Poincar\u00e9 sphere, contingent upon the fulfillment of the holonomy condition. This work presents the controlled navigation on the higher-order Poincar\u00e9 sphere through the proposed architecture, formulated under the concept of an effective waveplate and thus can be referred to as an effective SU(2) gadget. The notion of an effective waveplate refers to a coaxial arrangement of multiple waveplates that, under specific constraints, can act as a single waveplate. In this gadget, the relative alignment of the offset angles of the constituent $q$-plates emerges as the decisive parameter governing systematic navigation on the higher-order Poincar\u00e9 sphere.

The QNM sector imprints a set of Lorentzian resonances in the detector spectrum at the redshifted real parts of the QNM frequencies, with widths determined by the imaginary parts.

We numerically determine the critical energy density of this regime, finding that it approximately decays as $1/N^2$ with the number of particles N.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

It is found that the appearance of these two states requires that the characteristic hole concentration below which the Mott-Heisenberg and Slater mechanisms of electron localization occurs $p_{\\rm MS}$ nearly coincides with the hole concentration where the Van Hove singularity (VHS) point is placed at the vicinity of the Fermi level. When this condition is met the VHS point is pined at which the nesting condition of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuation is fulfilled almost everywhere on the Fermi surface in wide range of the hole concentration in a metallic state, i.e., the strange metal state. The spin fluctuation of the strange metal state is nearly quantum critical and the dynamical spin susceptivity is well described by overdamped spin wave having the $\u03c9/T$ scaling with the relaxation rate at the Planckian limit. Because of these distinctive features of the strange metal state, the $k$ dependence of scattering rate of electrons is small and electrons behave as the marginal Fermi liquid, resulting in $T$-linear resistivity. In contrast, the pseudogap state is magnetically in the renormalized classical regime and the pseudogap is formed near the X point where the nesting condition of the short-range AFM order is fulfilled.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Fragmentation occurs closer to the source for larger beams, which indicates that smaller beams are more robust to decoherence.

Superparticles exhibit unique optical, chemical, and electronic properties. These properties are not merely the sum of the constituent quantum dots but rather bear the signature of the collective behavior of the nanoscale building blocks. In particular, assembling an ensemble of quantum dots into a super-sphere allows them to function as a single, high-quality optical resonator. This structure efficiently confines the emission from the pump-excited quantum dots via whispering gallery modes. The emissive properties of such a superparticle resonator remain an area of active investigation. Using numerical simulation, we study the angular structure of the photoluminescence from superparticles of various sizes and architectures formed from CdS quantum dots. We show that, in general, the angular distribution of the SP emission is characterized by strong asymmetry, with a maximum in the backward direction relative to the incident pump beam. In contrast, this asymmetry is virtually absent in the forward and side-scattering directions. The excitation of resonant modes in the superparticle enhances the emission intensity and reduces the degree of its backward asymmetry. Furthermore, coating the CdS quantum dot particle with a silicon dioxide layer increases the probability of exciting field resonances in such a core-shell superparticle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u8d85\u7c92\u5b50\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5408\u6210\u7eb3\u7c73\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8d85\u7403\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u53d1\u5149\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u5728\u53cd\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5149\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u6b63\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u4fa7\u9762\u57fa\u672c\u65e0\u53d1\u5149\u3002\u7eb3\u7c73\u5305\u88f9\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u7845\u5c42\u53ef\u4ee5\u6fc0\u53d1\u8d85\u7403\u4f53\u8868\u5185\u573a\u5171\u632f\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u589e\u5f3a\u53d1\u5c04\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u53cd\u5411\u53d1\u5149\u503e\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u8d85\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7eb3\u7c73\u5668\u4ef6\u548c\u5149\u5b50ics\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u8d85\u7c92\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5149\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8d85\u7c92\u5b50\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u5728\u53cd\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5149\u6700\u5927\u3002\u7eb3\u7c73\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u7845\u8868\u58f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u53d1\u5c04\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u53cd\u5411\u53d1\u5149\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u8d85\u7c92\u5b50\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We then develop a general method to \"climb\" the spectrum-adding oscillators in a controlled way that generates entire Regge trajectories from a finite set of seed states. Remarkably, the coefficients determining each state's oscillator composition depend on the level in a simple way, allowing closed-form expressions for infinitely many states. Beyond individual trajectories, we explore internal regularities of the spectrum and establish relations among families of trajectories, extending the concept of a Regge trajectory to more general constructions. Our results expose a highly ordered and recursive structure underlying the open-string spectrum, suggesting that its massive excitations form an algorithmically constructible network.

To date, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has provided stringent consistency tests of General Relativity predictions. In this work, we present forecasts for the accuracy with which General Relativity can be tested using third-generation ground-based interferometers, focusing on Einstein Telescope (ET) and binary black hole mergers. Given the expected high detection rate, performing full Bayesian analyses for each event becomes computationally challenging. To overcome this, we adopt a Fisher matrix approach, simulating parameter estimation in an idealized observation scenario, which allows us to study large populations of compact binary coalescences with feasible computational efforts. Within this framework, we investigate the constraints that ET, in its different configurations, can impose on inspiral post-Newtonian coefficients, by jointly analyzing events using a Bayesian hierarchical methodology. Our results indicate that ET could in principle achieve an accuracy of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ on the dipole radiation term and $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ on higher-order post-Newtonian coefficients, for both the triangular and the two L-shaped designs, with $10^4$ catalog events.

This study presents the integration of continuum transport modeling with design optimization in a simplified two-dimensional flow reactor setup for electrochemical CO$_2$ reduction, as a proof of concept towards constructing an optimization-based reactor design framework. Ag catalysts provide the CO$_2$ $\\rightarrow$ CO reaction capability, and Cu catalysts provide the CO $\\rightarrow$ high-value products reaction capability. Given a set of input parameters -- applied surface voltage, electrolyte flow rate, and number of catalyst sections -- the optimization algorithm uses adjoint methods to modify the Ag/Cu surface patterning in order to maximize the current density toward high-value products, such as ethylene. The optimized designs, which strongly depend on these input parameters, yield significant performance enhancement especially at more negative applied voltages (i.e., stronger surface reactions) and for larger numbers of patterning sections. For an applied voltage of $-1.7$ V vs. SHE, the $12$-section optimized design increases the current density towards ethylene by up to $65\\%$ compared to the unoptimized $2$-section design.

Modeling the waveforms of such systems is a challenging task, requiring precise computation of energy and angular momentum fluxes as well as proper treatment of orbital resonances, during which two fundamental orbital frequencies become commensurate. In this work, we perform a systematic comparison of fluxes derived from three approaches: the quadrupole formula, post-Newtonian approximations, and time-domain solutions of the Teukolsky equation. We show that quadrupole-based fluxes remain in good agreement with Teukolsky results across a broad range of orbital configurations, including perturbed orbits.

Supplementary: 2 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "By applying the conventional two-liquid model to the magnetoresistivity tensor, we reveal a record-high carrier mobility for surface states in tetradymite topological insulators ($\\sim$ 20000 cm$^2$/Vs) in both bulk crystals and thin flakes of Sn-Bi$_{1.1}$Sb$_{0.9}$Te$_2$S. Bulk crystals of this 3D topological insulator exhibit a transition from bulk to surface-dominated conductivity below 100 K, whereas in thin flakes, bulk conductivity is suppressed at even higher temperatures. Our data therefore suggest that a key ingredient for elevated mobility is the absence of bulk carriers at the Fermi level. A fingerprint of the high-mobility carriers, i.e a steep low-field magnetoresistance along with a strong Hall effect nonlinearity below 1 T, signifies the presence of at least two surface-related carrier species, even when bulk states are frozen out. To explain the magnetoresistance and the Hall effect in a wider range of magnetic fields ($>1$ T), one must assume that the carrier mobility drops with the field. The influence of Zeeman splitting on mobility and the contribution of anomalous Hall conductivity provide a much better description of the magnetoresistance and the nonlinearity of the Hall coefficient. Our data call for a revision of the surface state mobility in 3D topological insulators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8868\u9762\u6001\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4_topological_insulators\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u60ca\u4eba\u768420000 cm\u00b2/Vs\uff0c\u5728\u6676\u4f53\u548c\u8584\u7247\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f4e\u4e8e100 K\u65f6\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u4ece\u4f53\u5916\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8f6c\u4e3a\u8868\u9762\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u8584\u7247\u4e2d\u66f4\u9ad8\u6e29\u5ea6\u65f6\u4f53\u5916\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u88ab\u6291\u5236\u3002\u6750\u6599\u7684\u9ad8\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u6e90\u4e8e\u4f53\u5916\u6001\u5728\u8d39\u7c73\u80fd\u7ea7\u9644\u8fd1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\uff0c\u8868\u9762\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u7684\u7279\u6027\u5982\u5f3a\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u5de8\u963b halls\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027 hall\u6548\u5e94\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u5b58\u5728\u81f3\u5c11\u4e24\u79cd\u8868\u9762\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u3002\u5f53\u78c1\u573a\u589e\u52a0\u5230\u8d85\u8fc71 T\u65f6\uff0c\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14zeeman\u5206\u88c2\u5bf9\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u548canomalous_hall_conduction\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u8f83\u597d\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5efa\u8bae\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f303d_topological_insulators\u8868\u9762\u6001\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4_topological_Insulators\u4e2d\u8868\u9762\u6001\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u53ca\u5176\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6750\u6599\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7535\u5bfc\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u7684two-liquid\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u78c1\u963b\u5e94\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u5728\u6676\u4f53\u548c\u8584\u7247\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u9762\u6001\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u78c1\u573a\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "3d_topological_insulators\u7684\u8868\u9762\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4f53\u5916\u6001\uff0c\u5176\u7279\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u9762\u6001\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u3002"}}

We discuss the corresponding characteristic initial value problem both in the metric and Newman-Penrose formalisms, and establish an explicit dictionary between the two. This allows us to identify Weyl-covariant structures in the solution space, including hierarchies of recursion relations encoding the flux-balance laws. We then establish a correspondence between the gravitational phase space at null infinity and the subleading phase space around the null hypersurface at finite distance. This connection is naturally formulated within the Newman-Penrose formalism by performing a partially off-shell conformal compactification and identifying the analogue of the Ashtekar-Streubel symplectic structure in the radial expansion near the null hypersurface. Using this framework, we identify the celestial $Lw_{1+\\infty}$ symmetries in the subleading phase space at finite distance by constructing their canonical generators and imposing self-duality conditions. This allows us to define a notion of covariant radiation, whose absence gives rise to an infinite tower of conserved charges, revealing physical quantities relevant to observers near black hole or cosmological horizons. As a concrete illustration, we consider the case of the self-dual Taub-NUT black hole.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a Bulk\u4e2d\u7684Null Hypersurface\u5904\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86Metric\u548cNewman-Penrose formalism\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e24\u8005\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5b57\u5178\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Weyl-\u534f\u53d8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c42\u6b21\u9012\u5f52\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u6d41\u91cf-\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86Null Hypersurface\u9644\u8fd1\u548cNull Infinity\u5904\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u975e\u58f3\u5c42\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u7d27\u51d1\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5f84\u5411\u5c55\u5f00\u9644\u8fd1\u7684Ashtekar-Streubel\u7c7b symplectic\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5171\u8f6d\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5e76\u65bd\u52a0\u81ea\u5bf9\u5076\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u534f\u53d8\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u8f90\u5c04\u6d88\u5931\u65f6\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9650\u7ea7\u6570\u7684\u5b88\u6052\u7535\u8377\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6216\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u89c6\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u3002\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u5bf9\u5076\u7684Taub-NUT\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e3a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u8bf4\u660e\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76 Black Hole\u6216\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u89c6\u754c\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c formalism \u548c\u6784\u9020\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u89e3\u4e86\u5728 Null Hypersurface\u5904\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b88\u6052\u7535\u8377\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": " \u901a\u8fc7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u5b88\u6052\u7535\u8377\u7684\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u5177\u4f53\u6848\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

This SH-US signal was observed only in samples containing MNPs and consequently originated from the EMF interaction on samples containing MNPs. These findings suggest that US generation due to magneto-acoustic interaction in the MNPs could be responsible for the cell damage induced by EMF in cells containing MNPs without increasing the temperature.

This state is reached no matter the initial distribution of modes and independent of the bands dispersions and gaps.

The source is based on the dissociation of solid molecular tritium films below 1 K by electrons from a pulsed RF discharge, a technique recently demonstrated for atomic hydrogen, combined with buffer-gas cooling and magnetic confinement. We analyze the key processes limiting the source performance, adsorption, spin exchange and recombination, and show that atomic tritium fluxes exceeding 1e15 per second at kinetic energies of 100 mK can be achieved at the entrance of a magnetic trap. Such a source would enable Doppler-free two-photon 1S-2S spectroscopy in atomic tritium for high-precision measurements of the triton charge radius, provid- ing a crucial benchmark for bound-state QED and improving the comparison between electronic, muonic, and scattering determinations of nuclear sizes in light systems. Beyond spectroscopy, an atomic tritium source avoids molecular final-state broadening in beta-decay and is therefore neces- sary for next-generation neutrino-mass measurements; combined with detector technologies such as sub-eV resolution quantum sensors or cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy, it enables order-of- magnitude improvement compared to the current KATRIN sensitivity, reaching sensitivities below the inverted ordering regime. Additionally, the source can be used to generate a beam of low- field-seeking deuterium atoms for loading magnetic traps, an important benchmark before trapping tritium atoms and useful for precision spectroscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u548c\u4f4e\u80fd\u4e0b\u5229\u7528\u56fa\u6001\u5206\u5b50 Tritium \u5206\u79bb\u6e90\u751f\u6210\u7684\u539f\u5b50 Tritium \u6e90\uff0c\u8be5\u6e90\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u5b50\u4ece\u8109\u51b2 RF \u653e\u7535\u4e2d\u91ca\u653e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f13\u51b2\u6c14\u4f53\u51b7\u5374\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8be5\u6e90\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bcf\u79d2\u8d85\u8fc7 10^15 \u4e2a\u52a8\u80fd\u4e3a 100 mK \u7684\u539f\u5b50 Tritium \u6d41\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6e90\u5c06\u7528\u4e8e Doppler-free \u4e24\u5149\u5b50 1S-2S \u63cf\u8ff0 spectroscopy \u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6838\u5b50\u6bd4\u8377\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u672c\u6838\u5b50 QED \u7684\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8f7b\u539f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6838\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u3001(muonic)\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u786e\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6e90\u8fd8\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u6700\u7ec8\u6001\u5c55\u5bbd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728 beta \u5c04\u7ebf\u8870\u53d8\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5fae\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u73af\u72b6\u8f90\u5c04\u53d1\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6bd4\u76ee\u524d\u7684 KATRIN \u611f\u5e94\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u6e90\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u78c1\u901a\u5bfb\u6c42\u7684 deuterium \u539f\u5b50\u675f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u78c1\u6027\u7ea6\u675fTrap \u524d\u6d4b\u8bd5 traps\uff0c\u5bf9\u7cbe\u786e spectroscopy \u4e5f\u5f88\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u4f4e\u6e29\u3001\u5f31\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u6e90\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u539f\u5b50\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6838\u5b50\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6 QED \u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u6838\u7269\u7406\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u6e90\u5728 beta\u8870\u53d8\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u5fae\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u7387\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e-basic \u7269\u7406\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u6d4b\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e86\u4ece\u5206\u5b50 Tritium \u5206\u79bb\u5230\u539f\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56fa\u6001\u5206\u5b50 Tritium \u7684\u5236\u5907\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u4ece\u8109\u51b2 RF \u653e\u7535\u91ca\u653e\uff0c\u7f13\u51b2\u6c14\u4f53\u51b7\u5374\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u78c1\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u3002\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5206\u79bb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5982\u5438\u79ef\u3001\u81ea\u65cb\u4ea4\u6362\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u7ed3\u5408\u7b49\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5206\u79bb\u6548\u7387\u548c\u539f\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u5206\u79bb\u6e90\u5728\u5165\u53e3\u5904\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5 100 mK \u52a8\u80fd\u7684\u539f\u5b50 Tritium \u6d41\u7387\u8fbe\u5230\u6bcf\u79d2 10^15 \u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6d41\u4f53\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e spectroscopy \u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5728 beta \u8870\u53d8\u4e2d\u907f\u514d\u5206\u5b50\u6700\u7ec8\u6001\u5c55\u5bbd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5fae\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u7387\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u6e90\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u78c1\u80cc sought \u7684 deuterium \u539f\u5b50\u675f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u78c1\u6027 traps \u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u6838\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u539f\u5b50 Tritium \u6e90\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6 spectroscopy \u548c\u5fae\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u7387\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u6838\u7269\u7406\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u6838\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u6280\u672f\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

For zero field, the classical ground state of the model presents an accidental degeneracy, which has a particularly simple form and which can be expressed in terms of a simple symmetry of the classical energy. The model thus offers a particularly transparent realization of a theory with quantum order-by-disorder and a pseudo-Goldstone mode. We analyze the spectrum at zero magnetic field by calculating the self-energy at one-loop order, using a self-consistent renormalization of the gap and the energy scale.

The effective theory reveals a rich phase structure comprising a spin-wave phase, a weakly interacting Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, and a strong-interaction quantum critical point. The monopole fermions, which are the emergent excitations in the effective model, exhibit robust behavior that gives rise to a pronounced even-odd effect in the bulk gap across the quantum critical point. The analysis of the spectrum using self-energy calculations at one-loop order reveals intricate scale-dependent behaviors.

Pati"], "title": "Localization transitions in an open quasiperiodic ladder", "comment": null, "summary": "We investigate localization transition in an open quasiperiodic ladder where the quasiperiodicity is described by the Aubry-Andr\u00e9-Harper model. While previous studies have shown that higher-order hopping or constrained quasiperiodic potentials can induce a mixed-phase zone in one dimension, we demonstrate that the dissipation can induce mixed phase zone in a one dimensional nearest-neighbor system without imposing any explicit constraints on the quasiperiodic potential or hopping param- eter. Our approach exploits an exact correspondence between the eigenspectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator and that of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, valid for quadratic fermionic systems un- der linear dissipation. Using third quantization approach within Majorana fermionic representation, we analyze two dissipation configurations: alternating gain and loss at every site, and at alternate sites under balanced and imbalanced conditions. By computing the inverse and normalized partici- pation ratios, we show that dissipation can drive the system into three distinct phases: delocalizd, mixed, and localized. Notably, the mixed-phase zone is absent for balanced dissipation at every site but emerges upon introducing imbalance, while for alternate site dissipation it appears in both balanced and imbalanced cases. Furthermore, the critical points and the width of the mixed-phase window can be selectively tuned by varying the dissipation strength.

Our analysis reveals a rich variety of phases, including both uniform and spatially modulated symmetry-broken states, some of which feature an order parameter oscillating at half the drive frequency. When coupled to a background electromagnetic potential, these phases exhibit a Meissner effect, in the sense that the photon acquires a mass term. However, if the order parameter oscillates around a sufficiently small value, a fraction of an externally applied magnetic field can penetrate the sample in the form of a standing wave.

Magnetometry is among the most promising applications, where chip-scale optomechanical sensors offer high sensitivity without the cryogenics or magnetic shielding required by competing technologies. However, lack of compatibility with integrated photonics and electronics has posed a major barrier. Here we introduce silicon-on-insulator optomechanical magnetometers to address this barrier. A new post-release lithography process enables high-quality metallisation of released mechanical structures, overcoming the incompatibility between silicon-on-insulator fabrication and functional magnetic films. This allows us to employ photonic-crystal cavities that enhance motion-to-optical signal transduction by over an order of magnitude. The resulting devices achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 800 pT Hz^-1/2, three orders of magnitude beyond previous waveguide-integrated designs.

Our study identifies top candidates with inverted STGs, revealing how substitution and symmetry-lowering modulate these gaps to uncover new stable AP cores that provide promising targets for designing molecular light-emitters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In the zero- to ultralow-field (ZULF) regime, population and coherence decay reveal nontrivial behavior due to strong coupling between nuclear spins. We note, in particular, the surprising effects that different resonances show different relaxation rates, depending on (i) the (pre)polarizing magnet field and the shuttling trajectory to the detection region at nano- and microtesla fields, (ii) the strength of the measurement field, (iii) the detection method (single-channel or quadrature), and even (iv) the nutation angle induced by the excitation pulse. We describe herein experimental data of relaxation rates measured for a 13C-labeled formic acid sample, with an atomic-magnetometer-based ZULF setup, and develop a theoretical framework to explain the detected effects and extract molecular properties.

Starting from the halo-only geometry determined by the rotation curve relation, we solve the Einstein equations with the Burkert stress-energy and enforce a Schwarzschild boundary condition, obtaining closed form metric functions in which the halo contribution deforms the redshift or shape functions and reduces to the Schwarzschild limit when the halo parameters vanish. On this background we study linear perturbations of test fields with spins $s=0,1,2$ and compute their quasinormal spectra using both a high order WKB scheme and continued fraction method, complemented by time domain evolutions. We find that increasing either the Burkert core radius $r_0$ or the central density $\u03c1_0$ generically shifts the real part of the frequencies upward and enhances damping, while the multipole index $l$ primarily increases the oscillation frequency with a milder impact on the decay rate.

The magnetic phase of this material has not previously been studied with the field along its magnetisation axis. The measured optical spectra indicate three magnetic phases -- antiferromagnetic, intermediate, and paramagnetic -- where the intermediate phase likely forms a different magnetic structure from typical spin-flop phases. The observed absorptions were classified into two distinct families of optical transitions: single-Nd and two-Nd absorptions. We demonstrate that the optical transitions in the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases can be modelled using a standard single-ion crystal-field Hamiltonian that interacts with a mean magnetisation from the rest of the lattice, and we expand that model to encompass pairs of ions, explaining the origins of the two-Nd transitions. This study offers a deeper understanding of the optical transitions in rare-earth antiferromagnetic crystals, which have been recently attracting significant interest for microwave-to-optical quantum transduction, despite being relatively unexplored to date.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5149\u5b66\u80fd\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u7684\u4e09\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u6001\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u78c1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5149\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5355\u6838\u548c\u53cc\u6838\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u96be\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5149\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63a8\u52a8\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u5149\u81f4\u9274\u5170\u59c6\u65af\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u9ad8\u8fbe3T\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u6d4b\u91cfNdGaO3\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u80fd\u8c31\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u4e09\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u2014\u2014\u6297\u94c1\u78c1\u6001\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\u6001\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6001\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u6001\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u78c1\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u6001\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u7a00\u6709\u91d1\u5c5e\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b0\u9636\u6bb5\u3002"}}

Combining our results with existing perturbative computations further yields the complete five-loop scaling dimensions in the $\u03b5$-expansion for the family of $\u03c6^n$ operators.

In this work, we theoretically study magnons and phonons coupled by spin-lattice interaction in a two-dimensional square-lattice $d$-wave altermagnet. We show that phonon-chirality-selective magnon-phonon hybridization can be caused by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction leading to the emergence of hybrid quasiparticles that possess finite phonon angular momentum. These hybrid quasiparticles are called magnon polarons and consist of spin-polarized magnons and chiral phonons. Their phonon angular momentum texture follows the $d$-wave character of the magnon spin texture opening up the possibility of phononic counterparts to the electronic response effects in altermagnets, such as a \\emph{phonon angular momentum splitter effect}, i.e., the generation of a transverse phonon angular momentum current induced by a temperature gradient -- the bosonic analogue of the spin-splitter effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4d-\u6ce2\u534a\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\u78c1\u58f0\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u754c\u9762\u7684Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u58f0\u5b50\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u78c1\u58f0\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u58f0\u5b50\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u6742\u5408\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u2014\u2014\u78c1\u58f0\u805a\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7531\u6781\u5316\u78c1\u58f0\u548c\u8272\u6563\u7684\u58f0\u5b50\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u5176\u58f0\u5b50\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u9075\u5faad-\u6ce2\u78c1\u77e9\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u58f0\u5b66\u7c7b\u6bd4\u81ea\u8d39\u7c73\u5f27\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5982\u6e29\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6a2a\u5411\u58f0\u5b50\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7535\u6d41\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u534a\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u58f0\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u58f0\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u7c7b\u6bd4\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66 development\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u4e8c\u7ef4d-\u6ce2\u534a\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u7684\u78c1\u58f0\u8026\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u754c\u9762\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u78c1\u58f0\u805a\u5408\u7269\u53ca\u5176\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u58f0\u5b66\u7c7b\u6bd4\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u754c\u9762Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u78c1\u58f0\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u805a\u5408\u7269\u5728\u58f0\u5b66\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u7535\u5b50\u81ea\u8d39\u7c73\u5f27\u6548\u5e94\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u6e29\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u58f0\u5b50\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7535\u6d41\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u534a\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u58f0\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

The thermodynamic properties of the system in the coexistence region of the black hole and cosmological horizons are discussed. We find that under certain conditions, the heat capacity of the effective thermodynamic system in the two-horizon coexistence region of de Sitter hairy spacetime, as a function of either temperature or the ratio of the horizon positions, exhibits a peak-like behavior similar to that observed in paramagnetic systems. Further analysis reveals that, under specific conditions, the heat capacity of this effective thermodynamic system in dS spacetime resembles that of a two-level system composed of two horizons with different radiation temperatures. By comparing these results, we derive the expressions for the number of microscopic particles on the two horizons within the coexistence region. This outcome reflects the quantum nature of dS spacetime and provides a new pathway for further in-depth investigation into the thermodynamic and quantum properties of the two-horizon coexistence region in dS spacetime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e865\u7ef4\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u3001\u6bdb\u53d1\u548c cosmological \u5e38\u6570\u7684 de Sitter \u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u91cf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ee1\u8db3\u666e\u904d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c cosmological horizon \u5171\u5b58\u533a\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u5728 de Sitter \u6bdb\u53d1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e24horizon \u5171\u5b58\u533a\u57df\u5185\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6e29\u5ea6\u6216\u4e24\u4e2ahorizon \u4f4d\u7f6e\u6bd4\u503c\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u70ed\u5bb9\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u53c2\u6570\u78c1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5cf0\u72b6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f53\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0cde Sitter \u6076\u53d1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4e24horizon \u5171\u5b58\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6709\u6548\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u70ed\u5bb9\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u8f90\u5c04\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u4e24\u6c34\u5e73\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e24horizon \u5728\u5171\u5b58\u533a\u57df\u5185\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\u76ee\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86 de Sitter \u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8 de Sitter \u7a7a\u95f4\u4e24horizon \u5171\u5b58\u533a\u57df\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5e26\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5982\u5e26\u6709\u6bdb\u53d1\u7684 de Sitter \u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u666e\u904d\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f8b\u6784\u5efa\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6765\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e24horizon \u5171\u5b58\u533a\u57df\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u70ed\u5bb9\u5cf0\u503c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u78c1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5fae\u89c2\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\u76ee\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24horizon \u5171\u5b58\u533a\u57df\uff0cde Sitter \u6076\u53d1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u70ed\u5bb9\u5f53\u6e29\u5ea6\u6216\u4e24horizon \u4f4d\u7f6e\u6bd4\u503c\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u5cf0\u72b6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u78c1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u70ed\u5bb9\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u8f90\u5c04\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u4e24\u6c34\u5e73\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e24horizon \u5728\u5171\u5b58\u533a\u57df\u5185\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\u76ee\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86 de Sitter \u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u4e865\u7ef4 de Sitter \u6076\u53d1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e24horizon \u5171\u5b58\u533a\u57df\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u53c2\u6570\u78c1\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4e24\u6c34\u5e73\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u8be5\u533a\u57df\u5185\u6709\u6548\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u70ed\u5bb9\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24horizon \u5fae\u89c2\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\u76ee\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86 de Sitter \u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7d22 de Sitter \u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Recognizing that black hole mass variation is inherently a continuous and dynamic process, but the extended timescales required for such variations allow us, to employ a static, frame-by-frame approach. We're assuming constant mass within individual frames, while permitting inter-frame mass evolution to prob the effects of mass loss on orbital dynamics. Using this method, we investigate whether the Periapsis Shift in the extremal limit can serve as evidence for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), addressing the conjecture's role in preserving black hole integrity during evaporation. Subsequently, we analyze the Periapsis Shift under Aschenbach-like conditions, where a stable photon sphere generates non-monotonic orbital velocity profiles, to assess its dynamical impact on relativistic precession. Finally, we synthesize the combined effects of extremality and the presence of stable photon sphere, revealing profound modifications to the Periapsis Shift profile, including prograde-to-retrograde transitions and radial dependencies. Our results demonstrate that the Periapsis Shift--not merely its magnitude but its qualitative orbital behavior--allows a meaningful experimental probe for the WGC in strong-field regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper examines how a black hole's varying mass, especially in a chaotic timeframe, affects the periapsis shift of nearby particles.

Rooted in the inviolable fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, QSDC enables ultrasensitive detection of even the faintest eavesdropping attempts, guaranteeing true communication security solely when no interference exists. If eavesdropping or intrusion is detected mid-transmission, the system instantly alerts users and severs data flow, shielding them from unauthorized tracking and mitigating hacker threats. Over two decades, QSDC has seen extraordinary advancements, currently attaining kilobit-per-second transmission over 100 km of commercial optical fiber. However, its practical scalability remains constrained by insufficient transmission rates, a critical bottleneck. Semantic communication, which drastically boosts transmission efficiency by extracting core information features, nevertheless stays vulnerable to malicious intrusions. Integrating these paradigms promises to simultaneously enhance equivalent data rate and security. Herein, we propose and experimentally validate a quantum semantic communication scheme, applying it to 3D point clouds. It achieves a 46.30-fold efficiency gain over direct transmission, surpassing both Wyner and Shannon capacity limits.

The approach discussed in this work provides a useful and realistic application of existing quantum annealing technology, applicable across many research areas in which lattice problems with resummable long-range interactions are relevant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u8bbe\u5907\u786e\u5b9a\u5177\u6709\u4ee3\u6570\u5f0f\u8870\u51cf\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684Ising\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u5143\u683c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5546\u4e1a\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u786c\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u5143\u683c\u6709\u9650\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u957f\u8ddd\u79bbIsing\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7eb5\u5411\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u5316\u9636\u68af\uff0c\u53d7\u539f\u5b50\u5206\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u542f\u53d1\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09 Kagome\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\u65e0\u573a\u6001\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d7\u4eba\u5de5\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5bb9\u7247\u5143\u542f\u53d1\uff1b\uff08iii\uff09\u5177\u6709\u989d\u5916\u8fd1\u90bb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53d7\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u65e0\u5e8fIsing\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u79cd\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6676\u683c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u8bbe\u5907\u89e3\u51b3\u6676\u683c\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u6280\u672f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5355\u5143\u683c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u9010\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u8bbe\u5907\u6765\u786e\u5b9aIsing\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5143\u683c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5355\u5143\u683c\u7684\u6709\u9650\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u5546\u4e1a\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u786c\u4ef6\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4ee3\u6570\u5f0f\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u5177\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7279\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u6676\u683c\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u9996\u5148\u662f\u957f\u8ddd\u79bbIsing\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u5316\u9636\u68af\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u78c1\u5316\u9636\u68af\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u5176\u6b21\u662fKagome\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u65e0\u573a\u6001\u57fa\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u786e\u5b9a\u57fa\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\u3002\u6700\u540e\u662f\u5305\u542b\u989d\u5916\u8fd1\u90bb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u57fa\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6676\u683c\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5355\u5143\u683c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u6676\u683c\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u5f0f\u8870\u51cf\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Shortly thereafter, a comment by M. Han [4] challenged our findings, citing \"physical and technical issues concerning the original experiment and the new characterisation\" inclusing purported contributions from Auger electrons, unfiltered low-energy harmonics, and uncompensated intrinsic chirp. These concerns, however, stem from misinterpretation of the experimental regime, selective citation of context, and disregard for well-established results in the peer-reviewed literature. In this reply, we address and clarify these points, demonstrating that the issues raised are not relevant under our experimental conditions. Given the highly specialized nature of attosecond genertaion and metrology in the soft X-ray water-window regime, we consider it essential to clarify these aspects of different regimes and reaffirm teh validity of our conclusions.", "AI": {"tldr": "An evaluation of attosecond X-ray pulses confirmed the original findings.", "motivation": "Clarifying the validity of pulsed attosecond X-ray pulses under new metrological insights.", "method": "Initial experiment using SXR attosecond streaking, re-analysis with VPGTA algorithm.", "result": "Revealed an 19.2 attosecond pulse consistent with prior work.", "conclusion": "Responses address experimental concerns, reaffirm conclusions on pulse characteristics and validity."}}

Motivated by recent progress in pulsar polarization arrays, we study the response of pulsar polarimetry to GWs and evaluate its potential to detect circular polarization in isotropic stochastic GW backgrounds, which characterizes parity violation. Based on geometric optics, we derive the rotation of the polarization of electromagnetic waves induced by propagation through a GW background. We show that the cross-correlation between pulsar timing and polarimetry signals isolates the circular polarization component from the GW intensity, sharing the same Hellings-Downs angular pattern. With future facilities such as the SKA, timing-polarimetry correlations could reach sensitivities to the circular polarization of GWs comparable to those of the current astrometric methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u6781\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u63a2\u6d4b\u5fae\u6ce2\u8ddd\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u73af\u5f62\u6781\u5316\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u6781\u5316\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u6781\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u8ba1\u65f6\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4e92\u76f8\u5173\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u73af\u5f62\u6781\u5316\uff0c\u6a21\u4effHellings-Downs\u89d2\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u672a\u6765SKA\u7b49\u8bbe\u65bd\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u624b\u6bb5\u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u6765\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u6781\u5316\u9635\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u73af\u5f62\u6781\u5316\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u5947\u5076\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u5149\u5b66\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7535\u78c1\u6ce2\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u6781\u5316\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u6781\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u8ba1\u65f6\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4e92\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u9694\u79bb\u73af\u5f62\u6781\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6781\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u8ba1\u65f6\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4e92\u76f8\u5173\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u73af\u5f62\u6781\u5316\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u540c\u6837\u5177\u5907 Hellings-Downs \u89d2\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u6781\u5316\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709 Similarly Astrometric methods \u63d0\u4f9b\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u73af\u5f62\u6781\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We find that collective effects dramatically alter the interplay of electronic, vibrational and cavity angular momenta, giving rise to markedly different polaritonic spectra and dynamics even when going from one to two JT molecules. Starting from the ground vibronic state, we find that JT molecules collectively coupled to a common cavity can access a cascade of high-angular-momentum vibronic states in the presence of a single cavity photon, in sharp contrast to the single molecule case where the range of accessible vibronic angular momentum values are bounded. The observable consequences are a broadening of the cavity-molecular polariton spectrum and a suppression of photon polarization dynamics under broadband excitation of the system.

To this end we consider a holographic Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dimensions with pure gauge and a mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms, coupled with a scalar field.

We have studied the anomalous effects by using Kubo formulae involving correlators of the charged currents and the energy current. Our findings reveal that, in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking, anomaly-induced transport phenomena can extend beyond anomalous currents and affect non-anomalous sectors as well. In particular, we find that all the conductivities display a distinct sensitivity to the mass parameter controlling the symmetry breaking, thus reflecting the interplay between anomaly coefficients and explicit symmetry breaking terms.

While these edge states have become the hallmark of topological systems as they can facilitate non-reciprocal transport in potential applications, the topology is fundamentally encoded in the bulk band structure. In particular, the momentum-dependence of the eigenstates, i.e., the wave functions, determines the topology, usually reflected in a bulk band inversion. We present a band inversion in the paradigmatic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, characterised by a reversal of the sublattice symmetry, quantified by the expectation value $\\langle \u03c3_\\mathrm{x} \\rangle$, when going from the centre of the Brillouin zone to the zone boundary. Here, we show direct experimental access to this bulk band inversion in SSH exciton-polariton chains, using two-dimensional momentum-space ($k$-space) mapping - without the need for real-space imaging. This technique enables the direct observation of the momentum-dependent inversion of the sublattice symmetry in the bulk bands, providing a unique perspective on topological phases beyond conventional edge state measurements. Our approach establishes effective momentum-resolved sublattice phase measurements as a powerful tool for accessing the wave function and bulk topology in photonic and polaritonic systems and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The electron density distribution is chosen to preserve a generalized Carter constant. We explore the shadow cast by this class of rotating wormhole in the presence of both homogeneous and non homogeneous plasma as seen by an asymptotic observer. The photon regions are visualized, and the influence of geometric parameters, plasma parameters, and the observer inclination angle with the rotation axis on the resulting shadow morphology is analyzed. We tried to implement constraints on the plasma and the geometrical parameters of the wormhole such as the spin parameter and the deviation (from Kerr) parameter in the back drop of recent observational bounds coming from the deviation from circularity of the shadow boundary ($\u0394C$) and deviation of the average shadow radius from Schwarzschild ($\u03b4$). The bound on $\u0394C$ is satisfied by the theoretically allowed range of parameters thus not found very useful to put any constraint, we could impose stringent constraints on the parameters based on the observed value of $\u03b4$.

Many-body decoherence plays a key role in this transition, yet connecting microscopic dynamics to emergent macroscopic behavior remains challenging. Here, in a doubly disordered electron-nuclear spin network, we uncover an emergent decoherence law for nuclear polarization, $e^{-\\sqrt{R_{p}t}}e^{-R_{d}t}$, that is robust across broad parameter regimes. We trace its microscopic origins to two interdependent decoherence channels: long-range interactions mediated by the electron network and spin transport within the nuclear network exhibiting anomalous, sub-diffusive dynamics. We demonstrate the capacity to control--and even eliminate--either channel individually through a combination of Floquet engineering and (optical) environment modulation. We find that disorder, typically viewed as detrimental, here proves protective, generating isolated electron-free clusters that localize polarization and prolong coherence lifetimes.

We formulate the problem of bounding the two-point correlator as a semidefinite programming problem, subject to the constraints of reflection positivity, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition or ground-state positivity. In the dual formulation, the Heisenberg equations of motion become \"inequalities of motion\" on the Lagrange multipliers that enforce the constraints. This enables us to derive rigorous bounds on continuous-time two-point correlators using a finite-dimensional semidefinite or polynomial matrix program. We illustrate this method by bootstrapping the two-point correlators of the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, from which we extract the spectrum and matrix elements of the low-lying adjoint states. Along the way, we provide a new derivation of the energy-entropy balance inequality and establish a connection between the high-temperature two-point correlator bootstrap and the matrix integral bootstrap.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e24\u70b9\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u534a\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4e24\u70b9\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e24\u70b9\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u534a\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u53cd\u5c04\u6b63\u6027\u548c\u5e93\u5e03-\u9a6c\u4e01-\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u4e24\u70b9\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u754c\u9650\uff0c bootstrapping \u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u8026\u5408\u5355\u77e9\u9635\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u70b9\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u548c\u57fa\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u4f4e\u9636\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6b63\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This link invariant was originally introduced by M. Khovanov and L. Rozansky through a sophisticated matrix factorization technique based on the bicomplex structure, which depends on entire link diagrams and rapidly increases in complexity with the growth of a link. However, for particular link diagrams a local reduction is possible, allowing to eliminate vertices in a regular way, and thus, simplifying the KR polynomial and making it as simple as the Khovanov polynomial in the $N=2$ case. In particular, for a distinguished family of bipartite links, matrix factorization defined on MOY diagrams reduces just to planar cycles - very similar to the original Kauffman-Khovanov construction at $N=2$ for the Jones polynomial and its $t$-deformation. In the bipartite case, this can be done for any $N$. We make a further step of simplification and reduce from cohomology factor-rings in even variables crucially depending on a MOY diagram to vector spaces spanned by odd variables, so that the initial bicomplex of matrix factorizations becomes a monocomplex of just tensor products of $N$-dimensional vector spaces. We also find the explicit form of three universal morphisms which were guessed in a recent paper on this subject.

The presence of massive objects breaks homogeneity and isotropy, allowing for new interactions between different GW polarizations, and opening up the intriguing opportunity to test modified gravity theories. This setup generalizes the notion of gravitational deflection and lensing, revealing novel phenomena in modified theories. Any non-minimal theory introduces effective mass terms for GWs, causing \\textit{lens-induced dispersion} (LID), a frequency-dependent phase shift on the waveform. We compute GW dispersion in Einstein's general relativity (GR) for a spherical matter distribution, finding a small but non-zero phasing that is potentially accessible to next-generation detectors. We then extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories, focusing on symmetron gravity as an example of screened theory, combining cosmological deviations and consistency with local gravity tests. We find enhanced GW dispersion in a large region of the symmetron parameter space, compared to both GR and Brans-Dicke theory. We argue that dispersion, associated to an effective mass for the metric fluctuations, can in some cases prevent the propagation of GWs through some astrophysical bodies, turning them into reflectors. Our analysis shows that the Earth becomes an efficient GW shield for a hitherto unconstrained region of the symmetron parameter space, leading to a $\\sim 50\\%$ fraction of events becoming unobservable or at least displaying a dramatic modification of the detector antenna response.

However, advances in this field often rely on simplifying assumptions regarding the quantum light's generation and its source. In this work, we relax some of these assumptions and probe the behavior of entangled photon pairs passing through a disordered layer after being generated by a randomly scattered pump via spontaneous parametric down conversion. We experimentally demonstrate that, even when both the pump and the down-converted photons propagate through a dynamic scattering medium, the pairs maintain a sharp peak in their correlations. A comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis shows that these correlations persist regardless of when the pairs are generated, whether immediately after the pump is scattered or under other conditions. More specifically, we detail how the shape of the angular correlation depends on the pump's scattering and how it varies with the distance between the pair-generation region and the entrance of the disordered medium.

However, achieving strong and robust macroscopic entanglement remains a long-standing challenge due to the inherently linear nature of the beam-splitter interaction. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to generate and enhance macroscopic entanglement between two remote magnon modes by injecting squeezed vacuum fields (SVFs) into coupled microwave cavities. We demonstrate that even a single SVF applied to one cavity can induce steady magnon-magnon entanglement, while applying two SVFs (the double-squeezed configuration) enables selective activation of two independent entanglement channels associated with the cavity supermodes. Remarkably, quantum interference between the two SVFs allows for phase-controlled enhancement of entanglement, resulting in significantly improved robustness against cavity dissipation and thermal noise. Under realistic parameters, the survival temperature of quantum entanglement increases from approximately $260$ mK to $450$ mK. Our results open a promising route toward controllable and thermally resilient macroscopic entanglement in cavity magnonics.

Their detection will measure the astrophysical properties of the MBH in the center of our galaxy (SgrA$^\\ast$) with unprecedented accuracy and provide a unique probe of gravity in the strong field regime. Here, we estimate the benefit of using the GWs from XMRIs to constrain the Chern-Simons theory. Our results show that XMRI signals radiated from the late stages of the evolution are particularly sensitive to differences between Chern-Simons theory and general relativity. For low-eccentricity sources, XMRIs can put bounds on the Chern-Simons parameter $\u03b6$ at the level of $10^{-1}$ to an accuracy of $10^{-3}$. For high-eccentricity sources, XMRIs can put bounds on the parameter $\u03b6$ at the level of $10^{-1}$ to an accuracy of $10^{-6}$. Furthermore, using the time-frequency MCMC method, we obtain the posterior distribution of XMRIs in the Chern-Simons theory. Our results show that almost all the parameters can be recovered within $1\u03c3$ confidence interval. For most of the intrinsic parameters, the estimation accuracy reaches $10^{-3}$.

Di Pinto, S. Klemm, and A. Vigan\u00f2, J. High Energy Phys. {\\bf 06}, 150 (2025)]. We note that the swirling parameter $j$ and magnetic field strength $B$ make the equations of motion for particles nonseparable, and confirm the presence of chaotic behavior in the motion in this dyonic Kerr-Newman-Melvin-swirling spacetime and its sub-cases by removing the conical singularities and removing both the conical singularities and the Dirac strings. We observe that both the number of chaotic orbits and the chaotic region increase with the increase of the parameters $j$ and $B$, but decrease as the electric charge $Q$, magnetic charge $H$ or spin parameter $a$ increases. Moreover, we find that the presence of $j$ changes the ranges of $B$, $Q$, $H$ and $a$ where the chaotic motion appears for particles. The swirling parameter together with the magnetic field strength, electric charge, magnetic charge and spin parameter yields richer physics in the motion of particles for the spacetime of a dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in the Melvin-swirling universe.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u3001\u78c1\u8377\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\u7684Kerr-Newman\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Poincar\u00e9\u622a\u9762\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u6307\u6570\u3001\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5206\u5c94\u56fe\u548c\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53 swirling \u53c2\u6570 $j$ \u548c\u78c1\u611f\u5e94\u5f3a\u5ea6 $B$ \u589e\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u6df7\u6c8c\u8f68\u9053\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u6df7\u6c8c\u533a\u57df\u9762\u79ef\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46 $Q$\u3001$H$ \u548c $a$ \u589e\u5927\u65f6\u53cd\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b8c\u5584\u590d\u6742\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5916\u56f4\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u7684Kerr-Newman- Melvin\u65f6\u7a7a\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u3001\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6216\u8bb8\u63ed\u793a\u5f15\u529b\u3001\u78c1\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Poincar\u00e9\u622a\u9762\u6cd5\u89c2\u5bdf\u533a\u57df\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u6307\u6570\u5ea6\u91cf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0cemploy\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u5206\u8fa8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u7ed8\u5236\u5206\u5c94\u56fe\u63a2\u8ba8\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d44\u6599\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u5206\u6790 chaos \u53d1\u751f\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u5728Melvin-\u65b0\u65cb\u6d41Trouble\u4e0b\u7684Kerr -Newmanrgb hole\u5468\u56f4\uff0c\u7c92\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5448\u73b0\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0cswirling \u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6df7\u4e71\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5f53\u78c1\u611f\u5e94\u5f3a\u5ea6 $B$ \u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6df7\u6c8c\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72b6\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u5207\u6362\u6240\u9700\u7684\u80fd\u91cf-barrier \u589e\u52a0\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u53c2\u6570 $j$ \u548c $B$ \u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c\u73af\u9053\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u901f\u5ea6\u53cd\u800c\u51cf\u6162\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Kerr-Newman- Melvin\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f15\u5165swirling \u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6df7\u4e71\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

While previous studies have primarily focused on magic in single systems, its interactions and distribution in multipartite settings remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce mutual mana as a measure of magic correlations defined in close analogy with quantum mutual information. Our definition builds upon mana, which is the established quantifier of magic based on discrete Wigner function negativity. We characterize magic correlations generated by discrete beamsplitters, whose Gaussian counterparts are fundamental components in quantum optics and quantum technologies. We show that coupling a magic state with a stabilizer vacuum state via a discrete beamsplitter will induce a full conversion of local magic into mutual mana, thereby establishing a mechanism for redistributing magic resources as magic correlations. We reveal the fundamental properties of mutual mana and derive its explicit expressions for several prototypical qutrit states subject to a discrete beamsplitter. We make a comparative study of mutual mana with several established quantifiers of correlations generated by the qutrit beamsplitter, including quantum mutual information, mutual $L^1$-norm magic, and mutual stabilizer 2-R\u00e9nyi entropy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we generalize fluctuation engineering to a multi-mode scenario in which multiple Raman-active modes interact nonlinearly with multiple cavity modes. We demonstrate the emergence of resonant and non-resonant collective fluctuations that can be non-reciprocally controlled by engineering the band dispersion of photons and phonons. As an example we show how Raman fluctuations can be selectively attenuated by tuning the photonic bandgap or even nonresonantly amplified, in marked contrast to the single-mode scenario. We also identify a regime in which the amplification of cavity fluctuations in a specific mode is boosted, surpassing a $\\sqrt{N}$ scaling with increasing number of $N$ Raman and cavity modes.

Our coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) scheme offers a broadband cancellation capability with a tunable, wavelength-flexible, and compact system. This is achieved through the implementation of an optical equivalent of an opto-mechanical interaction, facilitated by a down-conversion and a beam-splitting process. The intricate nature of the system and its multiple interacting components made characterizing the interdependent parameters with conventional methods ineffective, leading to the development of an in-situ characterization scheme. The obtained parameters meet the targets for CQNC set in previous studies.

This result provides a clear classification of the existence of axions in these theories and highlights the role of the gauge group structure in determining their presence or absence.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that the presence of axions in the spectrum of stable QCD strings is closely tied to the gauge group of the underlying Yang-Mills theory. This conclusion supports the idea that the axion spectrum depends on the gauge group structure and opens up new avenues for future lattice studies of QCD strings for gauge algebras of B, C, D, and E-type. The findings also suggest that the phenomenon of axion existence is not universal across all SU(N) Yang-Mills theories, but rather depends on specific group-theoretic conditions. These results have implications for the AdS/CFT correspondence and the holographic realization of gauge theories in higher dimensions."}}

Using the zoom-whirl taxonomy, which is characterized by three topological numbers $(z, w, v)$, we classify these orbits and calculate several representative gravitational waveforms for certain periodic orbits. We find that the noncommutative parameter $\u0398$ and the quintessence field significantly modify both the orbital structure and the emitted waveforms. In particular, increasing $\u0398$ leads to a phase shift and a change in amplitude in the waveform, while higher zoom numbers produce more complicated substructures. The characteristic strain spectra peak in the millihertz range, lying within the sensitivity band of the LISA detector. Moreover, the presence of the quintessence field introduces significant modifications to these waveforms, imprinting measurable deviations that could be tested or constrained by future space-based gravitational wave detectors. These results suggest that future space-based gravitational wave missions could probe or constrain noncommutative effects in strong gravitational fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Fundamental interactions are either extremely short-range or decay inversely with the separation distance, such as the Coulomb potential between charges or the gravitational attraction between masses. In contrast, emergent quantum van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir interactions decay considerably faster ($R^{-6}$ or $R^{-7}$) with distance $R$. Here we apply perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) to a many-body (MB) system of atoms modeled as charged harmonic oscillators, and reveal a persistent inverse-distance MB-QED interaction stemming from the coupling between virtual photons and molecular plasmons in the non-retarded regime. This interaction, scaling with the third power of the fine-structure constant, is reminiscent of the Lamb shift for a single atom. Although weaker than vdW forces, this MB-QED $R^{-1}$ interaction may substantially surpass gravitational attraction in future experiments probing quantum gravity at microscopic scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In particular, the decoherence induces an unconventional critical mixed state, where the logical information is preserved but the rest of the system exhibits mixed state criticality. For a fixed point, the decohered subsystem code is understood by the ``gauging out\" prescription. By mapping the GHM to the toric code subject to decoherence, we can understand the properties of the subsystem code. We further discuss and investigate the robustness of the logical space of the subsystem code. Although this kind of subsystem code can be produced by using any bulk mixed state in the GHM, its robustness is a subtle problem due to the mixed critical gauge qubits.

Consequently, we assess three chain variants: the full network including all colours, a network without black, and a network without black and white, to quantify the effect of hub pruning under realistic circuit depths and measurement budgets. Across networks aggregated from multiple retailers, hub pruning consistently improves quantum and classical agreement at shallow depth; total-variation distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence typically decrease by approximately a factor of two relative to the full network, while state fidelities remain close to unity. A bias-and-contraction analysis explains these gains through reduced cross-terms and an effectively widened spectral gap.

Here we extend the EF formalism to incorporate the case of a system under the action of an electromagnetic field. An important interplay between the physical magnetic and the Berry-curvature fields is revealed and discussed within the fully non-adiabatic theory.

We show that when the quantum walk parameters, such as the coin operator and initial state, satisfy the conditions of the ergodic theorem for random walks on finite groups, the resulting sequence converges asymptotically to the uniform distribution. Although correlations between successive outcomes are unavoidable, they can be significantly reduced by a suitable choice of the evolution time. By analyzing the iterated convolution of the quantum walk transition probability and exploiting the ergodic theorem, we demonstrate convergence of the marginal distributions toward the uniform distribution in the asymptotic limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By operating in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, quantum circuits enable exponential speed-ups and provide access to richer representations of cost landscapes compared to purely classical methods. These capabilities are particularly relevant for machine learning, where state-of-the-art models especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) suffer from prohibitive time complexity due to massive matrix multiplications and high-dimensional optimization.\n  In this manuscript, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Classical selection mechanism for the Mamba architecture, designed specifically for temporal sequence classification problems. Our approach leverages Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) as quantum gating modules that both enhance feature extraction and improve suppression of irrelevant information. This integration directly addresses the computational bottlenecks of deep learning architectures by exploiting quantum resources for more efficient representation learning.\n  We analyze how introducing quantum subroutines into large language models (LLMs) impacts their generalization capability, expressivity, and parameter efficiency. The results highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced gating mechanisms as a path toward scalable, resource-efficient NLP models, in a limited simulation step. Within the first four epochs on a reshaped MNIST dataset with input format (batch, 784, d_model), our hybrid model achieved 24.6% accuracy while using one quantum layer and achieve higher expressivity, compared to 21.6% obtained by a purely classical selection mechanism. we state No founding", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u57284\u4e2aepoch\u5185\u5373\u53ef\u5728reshaped MNIST\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523024.6%\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u5728NLP\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Mamba\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u6291\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3001 expressivity\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, for example, depend only on pairwise information -- expectations and correlations between binary variables -- yet standard quantum circuits explore exponentially large state spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometry problem: the minimal representation should match the $O(N^2)$ structure of quadratic objectives. The key insight is that the local-consistency problem -- ensuring that pairwise marginals correspond to a realizable global distribution -- coincides exactly with the Sherali-Adams level-2 polytope $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$, the tightest convex relaxation expressible at the two-body level. Previous qubit-efficient approaches enforced this consistency only implicitly. Here we make it explicit: (a) anchoring learning to the $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$ geometry, (b) projecting via a differentiable iterative-proportional-fitting (IPF) step, and (c) decoding through a maximum-entropy Gibbs sampler. This yields a logarithmic-width pipeline ($2\\lceil\\log_2 N\\rceil + 2$ qubits) that is classically simulable yet achieves strong empirical performance. On Gset Max-Cut instances (N=800--2000), depth-2--3 circuits reach near-optimal ratios ($r^* \\approx 0.99$), surpassing direct $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$ baselines. The framework resolves the local-consistency gap by giving it a concrete convex geometry and a minimal differentiable projection, establishing a clean polyhedral baseline. Extending beyond $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$ naturally leads to spectrahedral geometries, where curvature encodes global coherence and genuine quantum structure becomes necessary.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The ansatz does not compress information as effectively as tensor networks, but it has the advantages (i) of allowing accurate extraction of information, (ii) of being structurally independent of the geometry of the system, (iii) of being readily parallelizable, and (iv) of allowing analytical shortcuts. We first study the typical properties of the SPS ansatz for spin-$1/2$ systems, including its entanglement entropy, and its trainability.

Fourier transforming exponentially decaying time domain signals gives Lorentzian line shapes which can be manipulated by apodization methods. The underlying transitions of spectral lines can be visualized by a Bloch vector or equivalent phase-space representations. Here, we study and generalize a surprisingly elegant geometric transform, the hyperbolism of curves originally found by Isaac Newton, which allows to transform ellipses into Lorentzian lines, and vice versa. With this, we show that the Bloch picture and especially corresponding phase-space representations are directly geometrically related to the Lorentzian line shape. We also introduce a novel continuous parametrization of Newton's transform which results in further interesting line shapes.

The contemporary solution, halting the entire quantum computation for recalibration, is unsustainable for the long runtimes of the future algorithms. We address this challenge by unifying calibration with computation, granting the quantum error correction process a dual role: its error detection events are not only used to correct the logical quantum state, but are also repurposed as a learning signal, teaching a reinforcement learning agent to continuously steer the physical control parameters and stabilize the quantum system during the computation. We experimentally demonstrate this framework on a superconducting processor, improving the logical error rate stability of the surface code 3.5-fold against injected drift and pushing the performance beyond what is achievable with state-of-the-art traditional calibration and human-expert tuning. Simulations of surface codes up to distance-15 confirm the scalability of our method, revealing an optimization speed that is independent of the system size.

This is particularly true when we focus on highly-constrained early fault-tolerant devices. Many attempts to optimize algorithms for early fault-tolerance focus on simple metrics, such as the circuit depth or T-count. These metrics fail to capture critical overheads, such as the spacetime cost of Clifford operations and routing, or miss they key optimizations. We propose the FLuid Allocation of Surface code Qubits (FLASQ) cost model, tailored for architectures that use a two-dimensional lattice of qubits to implement the two-dimensional surface code. FLASQ abstracts away the complexity of routing by assuming that ancilla space and time can be fluidly rearranged, allowing for the tractable estimation of spacetime volume while still capturing important details neglected by simpler approaches. At the same time, it enforces constraints imposed by the circuit's measurement depth and the processor's reaction time. We apply FLASQ to analyze the cost of a standard two-dimensional lattice model simulation, finding that modern advances (such as magic state cultivation and the combination of quantum error correction and mitigation) reduce both the time and space required for this task by an order of magnitude compared with previous estimates. We also analyze the Hamming weight phasing approach to synthesizing parallel rotations, revealing that despite its low T-count, the overhead from imposing a 2D layout and from its use of additional ancilla qubits will make it challenging to benefit from in early fault-tolerance.

We work in the setting of deep thermalization from many-body physics: starting from a bipartite state on a global system $(A,B)$ drawn from a $k$-design, we measure system $B$ in the computational basis, keep the outcome and examine the state that remains in system $A$, approximating the overall ensemble (the 'projected ensemble') by a $k'$-design. We ask: how does the design quality change due to this procedure, or how does $k'$ compare to $k$? We give the first rigorous example of unitary dynamics generating a state such that, projection at very early (constant) times can boost design randomness. These dynamics are those of quantum chaos, modeled by the evolution of a Hamiltonian drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We show that, even though a state generated by such dynamics at constant time only forms a $k=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ design, the projected ensemble is Haar-random (or a $k'=\\infty$ design) in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. when $N_B=\\infty$). This phenomenon persists even with weaker and more physically realistic assumptions; our results can be appropriately applied to non-GUE Hamiltonians that nevertheless show likely chaotic signatures in their eigenbases. Moreover, we show that with no assumption on how the global state was generated, a $k$-design experiences a degradation in design quality to $k' = \\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor$. This improves upon best prior results on the deep thermalization of designs. Together, our contributions argue for design boosting as a result of chaos and showcase a novel mechanism to generate good designs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
