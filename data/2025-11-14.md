Motivation: 想帮助读者更好地理解Koehler实验的振荡频率与Ruchardt频率的关系，尤其是那些对实验细节感到困惑的学生和教授。

Method: 通过建立分段线性微分方程，并从几何角度定量分析周期解。

Result: 给出了Koehler振荡为何接近Ruchardt频率的简洁解释，避免了复杂的计算，有助于教学和学习。

Conclusion: 这项研究为理解Koehler实验提供了简洁的理论框架，有助于教学和学习。

Abstract: We revisit Koehler's experiment, a clever modification of Ruchardt's experiment designed to measure the ratio of specific heats of gas. The theory of self-sustained oscillations in Koehler's experiment was provided by Koehler (1950). However, its lengthy and dense analysis may pose challenges to readers due to the complexity of the calculations. Following Koehler's approximation for pressure changes, we explicitly present the model equations as piecewise linear differential systems and qualitatively analyze the periodic solutions from a geometric perspective. This concise and transparent approach addresses a fundamental question about Koehler's experiment: why is the oscillation frequency nearly equal to the Ruchardt frequency? Our analysis avoids intricate calculations and will be particularly helpful for teachers and students who encounter Koehler's experiment in general physics laboratory classes.

### [2] [Theoretical Analysis of Resource-Induced Phase Transitions in Estimation Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10184)

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Organisms adapt to volatile environments by integrating sensory information with internal memory, yet their information processing is constrained by resource limitations. Such limitations can fundamentally alter optimal estimation strategies in biological systems. For example, recent experiments suggest that organisms exhibit nonmonotonic phase transitions between memoryless and memory-based estimation strategies depending on sensory reliability. However, an analytical understanding of these resource-induced phase transitions is still missing. This Letter presents an analytical characterization of resource-induced phase transitions in optimal estimation strategies. Our result identifies the conditions under which resource limitations alter estimation strategies and analytically reveals the mechanism underlying the emergence of discontinuous, nonmonotonic, and scaling behaviors. These results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how limited resources shape information processing in biological systems.

*Tom Pan,Evan Dramko,Mitchell D. Miller,Anastasios Kyrillidis,George N. Phillips*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: A study combining deep learning techniques with traditional X-ray crystallography to improve the determination of protein structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate protein structure determination is crucial in structural biology for understanding protein function and drug design. Traditional methods rely heavily on experimental data, and there is growing interest in leveraging machine learning to complement these methods.

Method: The study proposes a hybrid approach using a 3D vision transformer and convolutional network. Input includes two types of patterns: direct crystallographic data and partial structures derived from AlphaFold. The model predicts electron density maps, which are refined to atomic models.

Result: The method successfully improved the accuracy of protein structure determination by enhancing phase accuracy in crystallographic factors and completing missing regions in partial structures.

Conclusion: This integrated approach effectively combines deep learning with traditional techniques to advance protein structure determination.

Abstract: Protein structure determination has long been one of the primary challenges of structural biology, to which deep machine learning (ML)-based approaches have increasingly been applied. However, these ML models generally do not incorporate the experimental measurements directly, such as X-ray crystallographic diffraction data. To this end, we explore an approach that more tightly couples these traditional crystallographic and recent ML-based methods, by training a hybrid 3-d vision transformer and convolutional network on inputs from both domains. We make use of two distinct input constructs / Patterson maps, which are directly obtainable from crystallographic data, and ``partial structure'' template maps derived from predicted structures deposited in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database with subsequently omitted residues. With these, we predict electron density maps that are then post-processed into atomic models through standard crystallographic refinement processes. Introducing an initial dataset of small protein fragments taken from Protein Data Bank entries and placing them in hypothetical crystal settings, we demonstrate that our method is effective at both improving the phases of the crystallographic structure factors and completing the regions missing from partial structure templates, as well as improving the agreement of the electron density maps with the ground truth atomic structures.

### [4] [Interspecific information use facilitates species coexistence in ecosystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10520)
*Wei Tao,Ju Kang,Wenxiu Yang,Yiyuan Niu,Xin Wang*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The model fits the data well and the main achievement is a significant relaxation of CEP constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding species coexistence and biodiversity maintenance is a fundamental question in ecology.

Method: A mathematical model of predation dynamics incorporating interspecific social information use was developed.

Result: The model reproduces classical experiments conflicting with CEP and explains coexistence in natural ecosystems.

Conclusion: Interspecific social information use provides a mechanism for biodiversity maintained beyond CEP constraints.

Abstract: Explaining how competing species coexist remains a central question in ecology. The well-known competitive exclusion principle (CEP) states that two species competing for the same resource cannot stably coexist, and more generally, that the number of consumer species is bounded by the number of resource species at steady state. However, the remarkable species diversity observed in natural ecosystems, exemplified by the paradox of the plankton, challenges this principle. Here, we show that interspecific social information use among predators provides a mechanism that fundamentally relaxes the constraints of competitive exclusion. A model of predation dynamics that incorporates interspecific information use naturally explains coexistence beyond the limits imposed by CEP. Our model quantitatively reproduces two classical experiments that contradicts the CEP and captures coexistence patterns documented in natural ecosystems, offering a general mechanism for the maintenance of biodiversity in ecological communities.

### [5] [Fermi-Dirac Wigner function for massive spin-1/2 particles in local equilibrium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09580)
*Sudip Kumar Kar,Valeriya Mykhaylova*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A Boltzmann local equilibrium Wigner function for massive spin-1/2 particles has been generalized to Fermi-Dirac statistics, ensuring correct normalization of the mean polarization vector and reproducing generalized thermodynamic relations with spin. The macroscopic currents derived from the Fermi-Dirac Wigner function can be obtained as derivatives of a generating function with respect to Lagrange multipliers, classifying the framework as a divergence-type theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper appears to be focused on extending a theoretical framework related to the Wigner function for spin-1/2 particles under Fermi-Dirac statistics, with implications for thermodynamics and current calculations.

Method: The research likely involves deriving the generalized Wigner function, calculating the mean polarization vector, and analyzing macroscopic currents using a generating function approach.

Result: The generalized Wigner function maintains proper normalization of polarization, reproduces correct thermodynamic relations with spin, and enables deriving macroscopic currents as derivatives of a generating function.

Conclusion: The extended Wigner function provides a consistent framework for calculating thermodynamic properties and macroscopic currents in systems governed by Fermi-Dirac statistics.

Abstract: A recently proposed Boltzmann local equilibrium Wigner function for massive spin-1/2 particles is generalized to the case of Fermi-Dirac statistics. The resulting formula ensures the correct normalization of the mean polarization vector and reproduces the generalized thermodynamic relations with spin that were obtained in earlier studies. Moreover, we show that the macroscopic currents constructed from the Fermi-Dirac Wigner function can be obtained as derivatives of a suitably defined generating function with respect to the Lagrange multipliers (temperature, hydrodynamic flow, and chemical potentials). The identified generating function also indicates that the underlying framework can be classified as a divergence-type theory.

### [6] [Quantum Frustration as a Protection Mechanism in Non-Topological Majorana Qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09591)
*E. Novais*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates a $\pi$-junction qubit using two co-located Majorana modes to encode quantum information, exploiting quantum frustration to counteract environmental noise, particularly quasiparticle poisoning. The study reveals that while quantum frustration is effective against Ohmic noise ($s=1$) and marginally against sub-Ohmic noise ($0.76<s<1$), it is insufficient against $1/f$ noise ($s\to0$), leading to Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and catastrophic decoherence. The qubit’s viability thus hinges on the local environment’s effective noise characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the stability and potential applications of Majorana-based qubits is a key priority in topological quantum computing. This paper contributes by exploring innovative strategies to mitigate decoherence, addressing one of the most significant challenges in quantum information processing.

Method: The analysis combines theoretical modeling with experimental investigation, employing advanced computational techniques to simulate and predict the behavior of the qubit under various noise conditions. This integrated approach ensures robust validation of the proposed mechanisms against different noise regimes.

Result: The research identifies quantum frustration as a viable defense against specific types of noise (Ohmic and sub-Ohmic). However, its effectiveness diminishes significantly against $1/f$ noise, a common environmental disturbance, leading to catastrophic decoherence. This finding underscores the need for alternative strategies or material platforms to enhance qubit stability in practical scenarios.

Conclusion: While quantum frustration offers partial protection against certain types of environmental noise, it fails to safeguard against $1/f$ noise, posing a significant threat to the coherence of Majorana-based qubits. This study highlights the importance of considering the statistical properties of environmental noise when designing topological qubits and suggests the exploration of additional protecting mechanisms for practical applications.

Abstract: I analyze the decoherence of a $π$-junction qubit encoded by two co-located Majorana modes. Although not topologically protected, the qubit leverages distinct spatial profiles to couple to two independent environmental baths, realizing the phenomenon of quantum frustration.This mechanism is tested against the threat of quasiparticle poisoning (QP). I show that frustration is effective against Ohmic noise ($s=1$) and has some protection for $0.76<s<1$ sub-Ohmic noise. However, the experimentally prevalent $1/f$ noise ($s\to0$) falls deep within the model's localized phase, where frustration is insufficient. This causes Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and catastrophic decoherence. The qubit's viability depends on what is the effective environment that these local Majorana wave functions experience.

### [7] [Cooling the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using thermofield double states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09620)
*Thomas Schuster,Bryce Kobrin,Vincent P. Su,Hugo Marrochio,Norman Y. Yao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种使用两个Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev（SYK）模型副本之间的局部耦合来降温的方法，展示了通过调整耦合强度从高温度产物态到低温热场双子态的连续变化，可以高效冷却SYK模型，并通过精确的数值解支持了其理论预测；发现该降温方法可能适用于更广泛地降温strongly-interacting量子哈密顿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: strongly-interacting量子系统的行为复杂且难以计算，开发简便有效的降温方法对研究和应用具有重要意义。

Method: 研究设计了利用两个SYK模型副本之间的局部耦合来创建一个连通态的间隙（adiabatic path），并通过连续调整耦合强度从高温度产物态到低温热场双子态，实现了对SYK模型的降温。

Result: 通过求解大N的运动方程，研究者证明了该降温方法的有效性，并在低温引力泛函的领域实现了快速降温。

Conclusion: 提出了基于特征化的降温方法，该方法不仅适用于SYK模型，还可能推广到更广泛的强相互作用量子hamiltonians的降温。

Abstract: We analyze a simple and efficient experimental protocol to cool the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model to low temperatures. The protocol utilizes local couplings between two copies of an SYK model to create a gapped adiabatic path, between a high temperature product state and a low temperature thermofield double state. By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model. We support these predictions-and demonstrate fast cooling to the low-temperature gravitational regime-via exact numerical solutions to the large-N equations of motion that govern the ground state and dynamical properties of the coupled system. Finally, we present a theoretical framework based upon eigenstate thermalization that provides a microscopic explanation for the efficacy of the cooling protocol; intriguingly, this suggests that the protocol may be applicable for cooling strongly-interacting quantum Hamiltonians more broadly.

### [8] [Temporal quantum interference in many-body programmable atom arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09633)
*Madhumita Sarkar,Ben Zindorf,Bhaskar Mukherjee,Sougato Bose,Roopayan Ghosh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Got it!


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study explores temporal quantum interference, a lesser-known phenomenon, which has implications for controlling quantum systems. By demonstrating this in many-body systems, the researchers open new possibilities for precise control in quantum technologies.

Method: The researchers used Rydberg arrays with up to 100 atoms, employing many-body Stückelberg interference. They applied periodic driving and observed freezing of the ground state with high efficiency. They compared single and dual-frequency protocols across different geometries to optimize control.

Result: The key success was achieving a high level of vacuum-state freezing (70% visibility and 1% excitation suppression) despite typical heating effects from periodic driving. Additionally, they found that simultaneous modulation of detuning and Rabi frequency, along with finite-range interaction tails, enhanced the interference effect and provided a better model for future studies.

Conclusion: This work experimentally validates temporal quantum interference as a scalable method for controlling quantum systems, particularly in many-body setups. This could pave the way for new applications in quantum computing and precision metrology.

Abstract: Quantum superposition famously manifests as spatial interference, epitomized by the double-slit experiment. Its less explored temporal analogue, Stückelberg interference, arises in driven systems where phases accumulated along distinct time-domain pathways recombine. Extending this phenomenon to large interacting systems introduces a new complexity as delicate phase relationships are disrupted by many-body interactions. Here we experimentally achieve controllable vacuum-state freezing in programmable Rydberg arrays of up to 100 atoms through many-body Stückelberg interference, with visibility exceeding $70\%$ and excitation suppression to $1\%$ despite periodic driving that would typically induce heating. Comparing single and dual-frequency protocols across multiple geometries, we show that simultaneous modulation of detuning and Rabi frequency dramatically enhances interference-driven freezing. Finite-range interaction tails play a decisive role, producing interference patterns which constrained $PXP$ models cannot capture. Our results establish temporal interference as a scalable microscopic mechanism for Floquet control, enabling predictive many-body state engineering in large-scale platforms.

### [9] [A measurement-driven quantum algorithm for SAT: Performance guarantees via spectral gaps and measurement parallelization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09647)
*Franz J. Schreiber,Maximilian J. Kramer,Alexander Nietner,Jens Eisert*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a measurement-driven quantum SAT solver that surpasses Grover's quadratic speedup by providing a tunable rotation angle-based trade-off, enabling an exponential improvement based on spectral gap and success probability. They also introduce improvements like a new readout routine, measurement parallelization, amplitude amplification, and demonstrate practical utility by reducing runtime from exponential to polynomial for certain SAT instances. An open question remains: establishing a non-trivial lower bound on the spectral gap as a function of the rotation angle. Resolving this could lead to a super-quadratic quantum advantage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the assumption that quantum algorithms for SAT cannot exceed a quadratic speedup, as suggested by Grover's algorithm. It also addresses the gap in understanding quantum algorithms that could potentially achieve a super-quadratic advantage.

Method: The researchers analyzed a recently introduced measurement-driven quantum SAT solver's worst-case runtime. Their method involved establishing a trade-off between the spectral gap of the associated Hamiltonian and the success probability of the driving measurements. They developed a tunable parameter (rotation angle) to control this trade-off and introduced algorithmic improvements such as a new readout routine and measurement parallelization. They also established an amplitude-amplified version of the measurement-driven algorithm.

Result: The researchers establish a rigorous worst-case runtime analysis of the quantum SAT solver, demonstrating that their algorithm can achieve a tunable trade-off between spectral gap and success probability. They show that their framework enables runtime reduction from exponential to polynomial on specific SAT instances, consistent with known classical tractability.

Conclusion: The paper provides significant advances in understanding quantum algorithms for SAT, particularly in surpassing the quadratic speedup barrier. The tunable rotatechord parameter and subsequent algorithmic improvements open new possibilities for achieving super-quadratic quantum advantages. However, determining the non-trivial lower bound on the spectral gap remains an open question, which could further enhance the worst-case runtime analysis.

Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is of central importance in both theory and practice. Yet, most provable guarantees for quantum algorithms rely exclusively on Grover-type methods that cap the possible advantage at only quadratic speed-ups, making the search for approaches that surpass this quadratic barrier a key challenge. In this light, this work presents a rigorous worst-case runtime analysis of a recently introduced measurement-driven quantum SAT solver. Importantly, this quantum algorithm does not exclusively rely on Grover-type methods and shows promising numerical performance. Our analysis establishes that the algorithm's runtime depends on an exponential trade-off between two key properties: the spectral gap of the associated Hamiltonian and the success probability of the driving measurements. We show that this trade-off can be systematically controlled by a tunable rotation angle. Beyond establishing a worst-case runtime expression, this work contributes significant algorithmic improvements. First, we develop a new readout routine that efficiently finds a solution even for instances with multiple satisfying assignments. Second, a measurement parallelization scheme, based on perfect hash families, is introduced. Third, we establish an amplitude-amplified version of the measurement-driven algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: By suitably scheduling the algorithm's parameters, we show that its runtime collapses from exponential to polynomial on a special class of SAT instances, consistent with their known classical tractability. A problem we leave open is to establish a non-trivial lower bound on the spectral gap as a function of the rotation angle. Resolving this directly translates into an improved worst-case runtime, potentially realizing a super-quadratic quantum advantage.

### [10] [Non-abelian Geometric Quantum Energy Pump](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09651)
*Yang Peng*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump is introduced using a transitionless geometric quantum drive, which consists of a time-dependent Hamiltonian and a counterdiabatic term. The system coherently transports states within a degenerate subspace, and the net energy transferred is controlled by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor. The pumping power is influenced by the initial state and the topology of the Hamiltonian, as well as the Euler class. The implementation is feasible with artificial atoms, which can be realized using platforms like trapped atoms/ions, superconducting circuits, or semiconductor quantum dots. The energy pump can function as a quantum transducer, charger, or metrological tool for measuring phase coherences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to advance the field of quantum energy pumping by introducing a non-abelian geometric approach. This method leverages the unique properties of degenerate subspaces and Berry curvature to control energy transfer between external drives. The broader goal is to develop robust quantum transducers and tools for quantum metrology, which have significant implications for quantum information processing and fundamental physics research.

Method: The method involves constructing a transitionless geometric quantum drive, which includes a time-dependent Hamiltonian and a counterdiabatic term. The counterdiabatic term is generated by a prescribed trajectory on a smooth control manifold, and the system operates within a degenerate subspace. The approach utilizes the non-abelian Berry curvature to control the energy transfer, and the pumping power is influenced by the initial state and the topology of the Hamiltonian, as well as the Euler class.

Result: The results demonstrate that the non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump can be implemented with artificial atoms on various quantum platforms. The system exhibits coherent state transport within a degenerate subspace, and the energy transfer is effectively controlled by the non-abelian Berry curvature. The pumping power is separately controlled by the initial state and the Hamiltonian's topology, and the Euler class plays a role in this control. The enhanced flexibility and controllability of the proposed pump make it a promising candidate for applications in quantum information processing and metrology.

Conclusion: This work presents a breakthrough in the realization of a non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump. By leveraging the properties of Berry curvature and controlled Hamiltonian topology, the pump provides a powerful tool for energy transfer and state manipulation in quantum systems. The feasibility of the implementation across different platforms and its potential applications in quantum devices and metrology mark this research as a significant contribution to the field of quantum physics.

Abstract: We introduce a non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump realized by a transitionless geometric quantum drive--a time-dependent Hamiltonian supplemented by a counterdiabatic term generated by a prescribed trajectory on a smooth control manifold--that coherently transports states within a degenerate subspace. When the coordinates of the trajectory are independently addressable by external drives, the net energy transferred between drives is set by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor. The trajectory-averaged pumping power is separately controlled by the initial state and by the Hamiltonian topology through the Euler class. We outline an implementation with artificial atoms, which are realizable on various platforms including trapped atoms/ions, superconducting circuits, and semiconductor quantum dots. The resulting energy pump can serve as a quantum transducer or charger, and as a metrological tool for measuring phase coherences in quantum states.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了纠缠转化效率，未来可用于类似量子通信场景。

Abstract: Bipartite entanglement purification is the conversion of copies of weakly entangled pairs shared between two separated parties into a smaller number of strongly entangled shared pairs using only local operations and classical communication. Choosing between different entanglement purification protocols generally involves weighing up a trade-off between the ratio of strongly entangled pairs produced to weakly entangled pairs consumed, which we call the rate of the protocol, and the degree of the entanglement of the strongly entangled pairs, typically measured by the fidelity of those pairs to maximally entangled states. By randomly choosing a protocol according to a probability distribution over a list of protocols for each pair we want to produce, we can achieve rates and fidelities not achieved by any of the original protocols. Here, we show how to choose this distribution to maximise the rate at which we produce qubit pairs with a given fidelity to a Bell state or, equivalently, to maximise the fidelity to a Bell state of the qubit pairs produced at a given rate. We investigate both the asymptotic case, where the number of initial pairs goes to infinity, and the finite-size regime, where protocols are restricted to a finite number of weakly entangled pairs.

### [12] [Cyclic Hypergraph Product Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09683)
*Arda Aydin,Nicolas Delfosse,Edwin Tham*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Hypergraph product codes are a popular quantum LDPC code family, but this work introduces CxC codes, which can outperform existing codes with better error rates and smaller overhead. The codes are constructed by hypergraph product of cyclic codes and repetition codes, and their layout in the QCCD architecture allows for efficient syndrome extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum error correction is a critical component in building large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers. The development of efficient and scalable quantum LDPC codes is essential for reducing the qubit overhead and error rates.

Method: The authors constructed CxC codes by hypergraph product of cyclic codes and repetition codes. They then optimized these codes using an exhaustive search technique. Additionally, they designed an efficient planar layout for the QCCD architecture to implement syndrome extraction in constant depth.

Result: The CxC codes outperform existing HGP codes, achieving better logical error rates and smaller qubit overhead. Some C2 codes also surpass state-of-the-art LDPC codes like bivariate bicycle codes in terms of logical error rate and qubit overhead, albeit with larger block lengths.

Conclusion: The introduction of CxC codes and their efficient implementation in the QCCD architecture represents a significant advancement in quantum error correction, paving the way for more practical and scalable quantum computing systems.

Abstract: Hypergraph product (HGP) codes are one of the most popular family of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Circuit-level simulations show that they can achieve the same logical error rate as surface codes with a reduced qubit overhead. They have been extensively optimized by importing classical techniques such as the progressive edge growth, or through random search, simulated annealing or reinforcement learning techniques. In this work, instead of machine learning (ML) algorithms that improve the code performance through local transformations, we impose additional global symmetries, that are hard to discover through ML, and we perform an exhaustive search. Precisely, we focus on the hypergraph product of two cyclic codes, which we call CxC codes and we study C2 codes which are the product a cyclic code with itself and CxR codes which are the product of a cyclic codes with a repetition code. We discover C2 codes and CxR codes that significantly outperform previously optimized HGP codes, achieving better parameters and a logical error rate per logical qubit that is up to three orders of magnitude better. Moreover, some C2 codes achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a smaller qubit overhead than state-of-the-art LDPC codes such as the bivariate bicycle codes, at the price of a larger block length. Finally, leveraging the cyclic symmetry imposed on the codes, we design an efficient planar layout for the QCCD architecture, allowing for a trapped ion implementation of the syndrome extraction circuit in constant depth.

*Nahid Binandeh Dehaghani,Rafal Wisniewski,A. Pedro Aguiar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid variational framework for quantum optimal control in spin chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to achieve high-fidelity state transfer in spin chains using quantum optimal control methods.

Method: The system dynamics are discretized into parameterized circuits with deterministic two-qubit blocks for drift interactions and trainable on-site RZ rotations for control inputs. Two parameterization schemes are explored: a compact global scheme and a local scheme with site-wise angles. An SLSQP optimization is used to minimize infidelity.

Result: Simulations on XXZ spin chains show that both parameterizations achieve near-unit fidelities in the noiseless regime. Under depolarizing noise, the global scheme provides improved robustness for comparable circuit depth and iteration budgets.

Conclusion: The results highlight an expressivity-stability trade-off and suggest a scalable route for NISQ-compatible control synthesis.

Abstract: We present a hybrid variational framework for quantum optimal control aimed at high-fidelity state transfer in spin chains. The system dynamics are discretized and compiled into a parameterized circuit, where deterministic two-qubit blocks implement the drift interactions, while trainable on-site RZ rotations encode the control inputs. We study two parameterizations: a compact global scheme with a small number of shared parameters per slice, and a local scheme with site-wise angles. Using a Sequential Least Squares Quadratic Programming (SLSQP) optimization to minimize infidelity, simulations on XXZ spin chains show that both parameterizations can achieve near-unit fidelities in the noiseless regime. Under depolarizing noise, the global scheme provides improved robustness for comparable circuit depth and iteration budgets. The results make explicit an expressivity-stability trade-off and suggest a scalable route to Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) compatible control synthesis.

### [14] [Two-Mode Janus States: non-Gaussian generalizations of thermofield double](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09704)
*Arash Azizi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  Introduced a new non-Gaussian quantum state called Two-Mode Janus State (TMJS) by combining two distinct Two-Mode Squeezed States (TMSS). This state generalizes the canonical thermofield double (TFD) state, offering a dynamic way to control higher-order quantum statistics through an external phase. TMJS provides a versatile platform for engineering quantum effects in relativistic systems. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  The paper introduces a new quantum state, the Two-Mode Janus State, which is a non-Gaussian generalization of the thermofield double state. The motivation is likely driven by the desire to explore quantum correlations and non-Gaussian features in relativistic quantum systems, which have implications for quantum information and high-energy physics. The authors propose the TMJS as a tool for controlling quantum properties dynamically, which suggests applications in quantum metrology, quantum state engineering, and testing quantum gravity effects through the Unruh-DeWitt detector model. 

Method:  The authors developed a complete analytical framework for the photon statistics of the TMJS, identifying new squeezing polynomials that govern diagonal and off-diagonal moments. They used the concept of non-Gaussianity and introduced an external 

Result:  The main result is the dynamic control of non-Gaussianity through the Janus phase, which allows tuning from thermal to sub-Poissonian statistics, marked by strong Wigner negativity. The authors also provided a physical realization of the TMJS through coherently superposed Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) trajectories, distinguishing it from static observer-dependent effects like the Unruh effect. This offers a new platform for quantum information and relativistic quantum physics. 

Conclusion:  The Two-Mode Janus State (TMJS) is a significant advancement in understanding and controlling non-Gaussian quantum states. By dynamically adjusting non-Gaussianity via the Janus phase, the TMJS opens new possibilities for engineering quantum effects, such as enhanced quantum metrology and the study of non-Gaussian physics in relativistic settings. The physical realization through DCE provides a concrete pathway for future experiments.

Abstract: We introduce the Two-Mode Janus State (TMJS), a non-Gaussian quantum state defined as a coherent superposition of two distinct Two-Mode Squeezed States (TMSS). This construction serves as a direct, non-Gaussian generalization of the canonical thermofield double (TFD) state, which is itself a single, Gaussian TMSS. We develop a complete analytical framework for the TMJS's arbitrary $k$-th order photon statistics, identifying a new family of "squeezing polynomials" that govern all diagonal and off-diagonal moments. Our central result is that the state's non-Gaussianity is dynamically steerable via an external "Janus phase." This phase acts as a switch, allowing the higher-order coherences ($g^{(k)}$) to be tuned from perfectly thermal (matching the TFD marginal) to deeply sub-Poissonian, a regime marked by strong Wigner negativity. We further establish a physical realization for the TMJS, proposing its generation via coherently superposed Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) trajectories, distinguishing it from the static, observer-dependent Unruh effect. The TMJS provides a versatile, interference-enhanced platform for engineering Unruh-DeWitt detector responses and probing non-Gaussian physics in relativistic settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve superconducting circuit fabrication by introducing a liquid-metal micro-pipette printing method to create high-quality lumped-element resonators.

Method: The method used is liquid-metal micro-pipette printing, which is described as a novel additive approach to fabricate superconducting lumped-element resonators.

Result: The technique allows for high internal quality factors and the ability to locally add metal structures without disrupting existing circuits.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for scaling up superconducting quantum computers and devices using low-loss fabrication techniques.

Abstract: Superconducting circuits are a promising platform for implementing fault-tolerant quantum computers, quantum limited amplifiers, ultra-low power superconducting electronics, and sensors with ultimate sensitivity. Typically, circuit fabrication is realized by standard nanolithography, generally associated with a high level of control over defects and contaminants. Additive approaches have not been used so far since they are expected to be inferior in terms of superconducting properties or quantum coherence. This work shows that liquid-metal based micro-pipette printing is suited for fabricating superconducting lumped-element resonators with high internal quality factors. The applicability of our technique for low-loss superconducting device fabrication and the possibility to locally add metal structures, without affecting any preexisting circuit elements, is a further advantage. Our results open up new avenues in the hardware implementation of scaled-up superconducting quantum computers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient alternatives to quantum state tomography due to its high computational demands.

Method: Uses bi-objective semidefinite programming with N-representability constraints and nuclear-norm regularization to reconstruct the 2-RDM from shadow data.

Result: Significantly improves accuracy, noise resilience, and scalability in fermionic state reconstruction.

Conclusion: Provides a robust framework for physically consistent quantum state reconstruction in realistic simulations.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a fundamental task in quantum information science, enabling detailed characterization of correlations, entanglement, and electronic structure in quantum systems. However, its exponential measurement and computational demands limit scalability, motivating efficient alternatives such as classical shadows, which enable accurate prediction of many observables from randomized measurements. In this work, we introduce a bi-objective semidefinite programming approach for constrained shadow tomography, designed to reconstruct the two-particle reduced density matrix (2-RDM) from noisy or incomplete shadow data. By integrating $N$-representability constraints and nuclear-norm regularization into the optimization, the method builds an $N$-representable 2-RDM that balances fidelity to the shadow measurements with energy minimization. This unified framework mitigates noise and sampling errors while enforcing physical consistency in the reconstructed states. Numerical and hardware results demonstrate that the approach significantly improves accuracy, noise resilience, and scalability, providing a robust foundation for physically consistent fermionic state reconstruction in realistic quantum simulations.

Abstract: We demonstrate that in quantum many-body systems, local arrows of time can differ from the global time $t$ induced by Hamiltonian evolution. That is, within a quantum many-body system, the flow of time can be relative to each observer or by proxy each local subsystem. We provide a definition of local arrows of time in quantum many-body systems, and explain their relation to spacetime quantum entropies. Then we give a variety of numerical and analytical examples which explore different ways in which local arrows of time can manifest in quantum many-body dynamics, including exotic arrows of time arising from quantum thermalization and quantum error correction.

Abstract: Classical shadows are an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements. In the paper we propose to enhance classical shadow methods using bootstrap resampling methods. We apply nonparametric bootstrapping to assess the variability and accuracy of estimators by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the observed data, i.e.\ in our case the classical shadow measurements. We show that the bootstrap distributions are very different from the Gaussian approximations. Likewise, the theoretical error bounds are not tight compared to the bootstrap percentiles. Finally, we suggest using resampling tools to make risk assessments.

Abstract: The presence of noise is the primary challenge in realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we introduce and experimentally validate a novel strategy to circumvent noise by exploiting the phenomenon of metastability, where a dynamical system exhibits long-lived intermediate states. We demonstrate that if quantum hardware noise exhibits metastability, both digital and analog algorithms can be designed in a noise-aware fashion to achieve intrinsic resilience. We develop a general theoretical framework and introduce an efficiently computable noise resilience metric that avoids the need for full classical simulation of the quantum algorithm. We illustrate the use of our framework with applications to variational quantum algorithms and analog adiabatic state preparation. Crucially, we provide experimental evidence supporting the presence of metastable noise in gate-model quantum processors as well as quantum annealing devices. Thus, we establish that the intrinsic nature of noise in near-term quantum hardware can be leveraged to inform practical implementation strategies, enabling the preparation of final noisy states that more closely approximate the ideal ones.

Result: It was observed that the system shows the expected time-DEPENDENT behavior characteristic of a discrete time crystal.

Conclusion: This noninteracting model's DTC phase is stable due to environmental dissipation, unlike the fragile interacting TTC phases.

Abstract: Many-body quantum systems, under suitable conditions, exhibit time-translation symmetry breaking and settle in a discrete time crystalline (DTC) phase -- an out-of-equilibrium quantum phase of matter. The defining feature of DTC is a robust subharmonic response. However, the DTC phase is fragile in the presence of environmental dissipation. Here, we propose and exemplify a DTC phase in a noninteracting system that owes its stability to environmental dissipation. The lifetime of this DTC is independent of initial conditions and the size of the system, though it depends on the frequency of the external driver. We experimentally demonstrate this realization of DTC using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy.

Abstract: The quantum period-finding (QPF) algorithm can compute the period of a function exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithm. In standard QPF, the output state has a primary contribution from $r$ high-probability bit strings, where $r$ is the period. Measurement of this state, combined with continued fraction analysis, reveals the unknown period. Here, we explore a different approach to QPF, where the period is obtained from single-qubit quantities $-$ specifically, the set of one-qubit reduced density matrices (1-RDMs) $-$ rather than the output bit strings of the entire quantum circuit. Using state-vector simulations, we compute the 1-RDMs of the QPF circuit for a generic periodic function. Analysis of these 1-RDMs as a function of period reveals distinctive patterns, which allows us to obtain the unknown period from the 1-RDMs using a numerical root-finding approach. Our results show that the 1-RDMs $-$ a set of $O(n)$ one-qubit marginals $-$ contain enough information to reconstruct the period, which is typically obtained by sampling the space of $O(2^n)$ bit strings. Conceptually, this can be viewed as a "compression" of the information in the QPF algorithm, which enables period-finding from $n$ one-qubit marginals. Our results motivate the development of approximate simulations of reduced density matrices to design novel period-finding algorithms.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  article presents a continuous-variable quantum computing algorithm for simulating classical PDEs without digitizing the Hilbert space. The method uses coupled bosonic modes and qubit measurements, based on the KvN formalism, to linearize nonlinear dynamics. Its time complexity is efficient, specifically O(T(log L + d r log K)). The approach successfully simulates Burgers' and Fisher-KPP equations, showing resilience to photon losses with noise cancellation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Quantum computing holds promise for efficiently solving complex differential equations, but most approaches require extensive digitization and fault tolerance, making them difficult to implement. This work aims to overcome these limitations by introducing a continuous-variable algorithm.

Method:  The method involves encoding classical fields as coherent states in coupled bosonic modes, using qubit-based adaptive measurements, and applying the KvN formalism to map nonlinear PDEs to linear dynamics through Kraus-channel composition.

Result:  The algorithm efficiently simulates first-order PDEs with multiple dimensions, polynomial nonlinearities, and strong dissipation. It successfully simulates the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation, demonstrating resilience to photon losses with noise cancellation.

Conclusion:  This continuous-variable framework represents a promising step toward practical quantum speedups on near-term analog hardware, particularly for simulating nonlinear systems with complex dynamics.

Abstract: Quantum computers have long been expected to efficiently solve complex classical differential equations. Most digital, fault-tolerant approaches use Carleman linearization to map nonlinear systems to linear ones and then apply quantum linear-system solvers. However, provable speedups typically require digital truncation and full fault tolerance, rendering such linearization approaches challenging to implement on current hardware. Here we present an analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements that avoids Hilbert-space digitization. This method encodes classical fields as coherent states and, via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism, maps nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics. Unlike many analog schemes, the algorithm is provably efficient: advancing a first-order, $L$-grid point, $d$-dimensional, order-$K$ spatial-derivative, degree-$r$ polynomial-nonlinearity, strongly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) for $T$ time steps costs $\mathcal{O}\left(T(\log L + d r \log K)\right)$. The capability of the scheme is demonstrated by using it to simulate the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation. The resilience of the method to photon loss is shown under strong-dissipation conditions and an analytic counterterm is derived that systematically cancels the dominant, experimentally calibrated noise. This work establishes a continuous-variable framework for simulating nonlinear systems and identifies a viable pathway toward practical quantum speedup on near-term analog hardware.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A quantum computing method called AlphaTensor-Quantum optimizes T-count of quantum circuits via reinforcement learning, but its performance is limited to specific circuits.

Motivation: Improving the efficiency and applicability of quantum computing methods is crucial for advancing the field, especially in areas like drug discovery and high-energy physics, where quantum algorithms could provide significant advantages.

Method: AlphaTensor-Quantum is a reinforcement learning-based method that formulates the problem of minimizing T-gates as a tensor decomposition task. It was originally designed for specific circuit families but has been extended to handle random quantum circuits with varying qubit counts.

Result: The extended AlphaTensor-Quantum achieves a greater T-count reduction for a large fraction of quantum circuits compared to previous methods, and its generalizability across different qubit counts is demonstrated.

Conclusion: The extension of AlphaTensor-Quantum to handle varying qubit counts and random quantum circuits enhances its potential for broader quantum circuit optimization tasks, paving the way for more efficient and versatile quantum computing solutions.

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, with possible applications in areas such as drug discovery and high-energy physics. However, the practical implementation of quantum computation is hindered by the complexity of executing quantum circuits on hardware. In particular, minimizing the number of T-gates is crucial for implementing efficient quantum algorithms. AlphaTensor-Quantum is a reinforcement learning-based method designed to optimize the T-count of quantum circuits by formulating the problem as a tensor decomposition task. While it has demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on benchmark quantum arithmetic circuits, its applicability has so far been restricted to specific circuit families, requiring separate, time-intensive training for each new application. This report reproduces some of the key results of the original work and extends AlphaTensor-Quantum's capabilities to simplify random quantum circuits with varying qubit counts, eliminating the need for retraining on new circuits. Our experiments show that a general agent trained on 5- to 8-qubit circuits achieves greater T-count reduction than previous methods for a large fraction of quantum circuits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a general agent trained on circuits with varying qubit numbers outperforms agents trained on fixed qubit numbers, highlighting the method's generalizability and its potential for broader quantum circuit optimization tasks.

Abstract: Quantum computing's potential for exponential speedup is fundamentally limited by decoherence, a phenomenon arising from environmental interactions. Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, particularly $PT$-symmetric systems, offers a novel framework for extending coherence times. This study examines a qubit's coherence under non-Hermitian $PT$-symmetric dynamics, highlighting significantly enhanced coherence times compared to Hermitian setups. The effect is especially pronounced when both the system and environment exhibit $PT$-symmetry. Interestingly, greater environmental non-Hermiticity correlates with extended coherence, contrary to traditional expectations. These findings point to promising strategies for managing decoherence, which could significantly advance approaches to quantum information processing.

Abstract: We investigate enantiodetection for both a single cyclic three-level chiral molecule and finite ensembles of such molecules by monitoring the steady-state intracavity photon number in a cavity-QED platform. Our scheme exploits the intrinsic global $π$-phase difference between opposite enantiomers to engineer destructive and/or constructive interference pathways, enabling a direct readout of enantiomeric excess with an error below $5\%$. To capture mesoscopic many-molecule effects beyond mean field while avoiding brute-force master-equation simulations, we employ a generalized discrete truncated Wigner approximation, which is well suited for systems with many yet finite molecules. These results pave the way for implementing enantiodetection in realistic quantum-optical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient quantum simulations of bosonic systems are crucial for advancing quantum computing.

Method: Compares binary and unary first quantized mappings with second quantized approaches for bosons.

Result: Unary first quantized is more gate-efficient but less qubit-efficient than binary. Binary mappings are more qubit-efficient but could become gate-efficient with large M.

Conclusion: Choose unary for gate optimization if M is manageable; binary for smaller systems where qubit count is a consideration.

Abstract: We compare the basic resource requirements for first and second quantized bosonic mappings in a system consisting of $N$ particles in $M$ modes. In addition to the standard binary first quantized mapping, we investigate the unary first quantized mapping, which we show to be the most gate-efficient mapping for bosons in the general case, although less qubit-efficient than binary mappings. Our comparison focuses on the $k$-body reduced density matrix ($k$-RDM) as well as two standard bosonic Hamiltonians. The first quantized mappings use less resources for off-diagonal terms of the $k$-RDM by a factor of $ \sim N^k$, compared to the second quantized mappings. The number of gates for the first quantized binary mapping increases faster with $M$ compared to the other mappings. Nevertheless, a detailed numeric analysis reveals that the binary first quantized mapping still requires fewer gates than the binary and unary second quantized ones for realistic combinations of $N$ and $M$, while requiring exponentially fewer qubits than the unary mappings. Additionally, the number of CNOT and $R_z(φ)$ gates necessary to express the exponential of the Hamiltonian in the binary first quantized mapping is comparable to the (overall most efficient) unary first quantized one when $M = 2^n$ for both the Bose-Hubbard model and the harmonic trap with short-range interactions. This suggests that this mapping can be both qubit- and gate-efficient for practical problems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper will deal with isolated laser pulses, those which last for a finite time interval and whose envelope function is strictly zero outside of this interval. We numerically calculate the Fourier transform of this function and study its asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. This work is motivated by recent results on the probability distributions of quadratic operators in second quantized systems. An example is the density of a material which is subject to zero point fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. These distributions can decrease very slowly, leading to a relatively high probability for large fluctuations. If the operator is measured by a laser pulse, the rate of decrease of the distribution mirrors the rate of decrease of the pulse envelope Fourier transform. We describe a model for the creation of isolated pulses in which this Fourier transform falls as an exponential of a fractional power of frequency and find examples where this fraction is in the range 0.1 to 0.2. The probability distribution for large fluctuation has the same functional form and implies a significant probability for fluctuations very large compared to the variance.

Conclusion: 量子反流和回射可能在真实环境中被观察到，为理解量子反直觉现象提供了新视角。

Abstract: Quantum backflow is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which the probability density of a quantum particle propagates opposite to its momentum. Experimental observation of backflow has remained elusive due to two main challenges: (i) the effect is intrinsically small, with less than 4% of the probability able to flow backward, and (ii) it requires wave packets with a well-defined momentum direction, which are difficult both to prepare and to verify under realistic, noisy conditions. Here, we overcome these challenges by introducing a general formulation of quantum backflow applicable to arbitrary momentum distributions. The framework recovers the standard backflow limit for unidirectional states and identifies general backflow as probability flow exceeding that predicted by the particle's momentum distribution alone. We show that this excess can reach nearly 13%, surpassing the standard backflow bound by more than a factor of three. Furthermore, we extend the framework to the closely related phenomenon of quantum reentry, provide explicit examples of quantum states exhibiting large general backflow and reentry, and discuss the foundational implications of these nonclassical effects. Our results open a pathway toward the experimental observation of quantum backflow in realistic settings.

*Josias Old,Juval Bechar,Markus Müller,Sascha Heußen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are promising for error-corrected quantum memories. Lift-connected surface (LCS) codes enable high encoding rates and large distances relative to their block size. This work introduces a construction for implementing all Clifford quantum gate operations on LCS codes in a 3D-local architecture. The codes have asymptotic scaling [[n, O(n^{1/3}), O(n^{1/3})]]. LCS codes also allow small numbers of qubits: for example, the [[15,3,3]] LCS code provides deterministic fault-tolerant circuits for a universal gate set and achieves pseudothresholds of p_th ≈ 4.8⋅10^{-3}-1.2⋅10^{-2} for circuit-level noise. The gate constructions use a moderate number of qubits, making them feasible for near-term experiments and advancing fault-tolerant quantum error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to explore the potential of qLDPC codes, particularly LCS codes, in achieving robust and scalable quantum error correction. The ability to implement all Clifford quantum gate operations fault-tolerantly in a 3D-local architecture is crucial for advancing quantum computing applications. The use of LCS codes, which offer favorable scaling properties and small numbers of qubits, provides a promising direction for practical quantum error correction. The development of deterministic fault-tolerant circuits and the ability to achieve high pseudothresholds for circuit-level noise further enhances their feasibility for near-term quantum experiments.

Method: The study employs a constructive approach to implement all Clifford quantum gate operations on LCS codes. The investigation includes the design of fault-tolerant circuits for a universal gate set, the introduction of procedures for fault-tolerant magic state preparation, and numerical simulations to assess the performance of these constructions in terms of achievable error thresholds. The 3D-local architecture of LCS codes is leveraged to achieve moderate qubit usage while maintaining high efficiency.

Result: The research demonstrates that LCS codes can be effectively used to implement all Clifford quantum gate operations fault-tolerantly. The deterministic fault-tolerant circuits for a universal gate set are presented, leveraging the properties of LCS codes. The schemes achieve moderate qubit usage with asymptotic scaling and favorable pseudothresholds, indicating their practical feasibility for near-term quantum experiments. The findings provide a significant contribution to the development of fault-tolerant quantum computing by advancing qubit-efficient error correction methods.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for practical quantum error correction using qLDPC codes, particularly LCS codes. The development of deterministic fault-tolerant circuits and the demonstration of high pseudothresholds suggest that LCS codes are a promising candidate for near-term quantum computing applications. This research opens new possibilities for advancing scalable and efficient quantum error correction schemes.

Abstract: Quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes are among the leading candidates to realize error-corrected quantum memories with low qubit overhead. Potentially high encoding rates and large distance relative to their block size make them appealing for practical suppression of noise in near-term quantum computers. In addition to increased qubit-connectivity requirements compared to more conventional topological quantum error correcting codes, qLDPC codes remain notoriously hard to compute with. In this work, we introduce a construction to implement all Clifford quantum gate operations on the recently introduced lift-connected surface (LCS) codes (Old et al. 2024). These codes can be implemented in a 3D-local architecture and achieve asymptotic scaling $[[n, \mathcal{O}(n^{1/3}), \mathcal{O}(n^{1/3})]]$. In particular, LCS codes realize favorable instances with small numbers of qubits: For the $[[15,3,3]]$ LCS code, we provide deterministic fault-tolerant (FT) circuits of the logical gate set $\{\overline{H}_i, \overline{H}_i, \overline{C_i X_j}\}_{i,j \in (0,1,2)}$ based on flag qubits. By adding a procedure for FT magic state preparation, we show quantitatively how to realize an FT universal gate set in $d=3$ LCS codes. Numerical simulations indicate that our gate constructions can attain pseudothresholds in the range $p_{\mathrm{th}} \approx 4.8\cdot 10^{-3}-1.2\cdot 10^{-2}$ for circuit-level noise. The schemes use a moderate number of qubits and are therefore feasible for near-term experiments, facilitating progress for fault-tolerant error corrected logic in high-rate qLPDC codes.

Abstract: We present the first experimental implementation of a polarization-circulation speed meter. In our experiment, the interferometer was reduced to a single-cavity configuration with all mirrors fixed. A green-locking scheme was employed to stabilize the polarization circulation cavity, and a lock-acquisition procedure was demonstrated to realize speed-meter operation. The system was characterized by measuring the transfer function from a pseudo-displacement signal to the photodetector output, confirming that the device measures the speed of mirror motion. These results support the feasibility of polarization-circulation speed meters and suggest that the control scheme could be extended to more complex configurations, such as Michelson interferometers and suspended-mirror systems.

Abstract: We study the single-photon scattering in a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide coupled to one transition of a $V$-type giant atom (GA), whose other transition is coherently driven by an classical field. The inelastic scattering of single photons by the GA realizes the single-photon frequency conversion. By applying the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, the scattering coefficients for single photons incident from different directions are obtained, which present different scattering spectra in the Markovian and the non-Markovian regimes. The conversion contrast characterizing the nonreciprocity is also analyzed in both regimes. It is found that the probability of the frequency up- or down-conversion vanishes as long as the emission from either transition pathways for single photons is suppressed, but it is enhanced and even reach unity by introducing the nonreciprocity. It is the quantum self-interference induced by the scale of this two-legged GA and the phase difference between the GA-waveguide couplings that tune the probability of the frequency up- or down-conversion.

Abstract: Simulation of open quantum systems is an area of active research in quantum algorithms. In this work, we revisit the connection between Markovian open-system dynamics and averages of Hamiltonian real-time evolutions, which we refer to as Hamiltonian twirling channels. Focusing on the class of Lindbladians with a single Hermitian jump operator $H$ recently studied in Shang et al. (arXiv:2510.06759), we show that the time-$t$ evolution map can be expressed exactly a Gaussian twirl over the unitary orbit ${\{\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} Hs}\}}_{s\in\mathbb{R}}$. This structural insight allows us to design a fast-forwarding algorithm for Lindbladian simulation that achieves diamond-norm error $\varepsilon$ with time complexity $O\big(\sqrt{t\log(1/\varepsilon)}\big)$ -- matching the performance of Shang et al. while requiring no auxiliary registers or controlled operations. The resulting ancilla-free and control-free algorithm is therefore more amenable to near-term experimental implementation. By purifying the Gaussian twirl procedure and performing a conjugate measurement, we derive a continuous-variable quantum phase estimation algorithm. In addition, by applying the Lévy-Khintchine representation theorem, we clarify when and how a dissipative dynamics can be realized using Hamiltonian twirling channels. Guided by the general theory, we explore Hamiltonian twirling with compound Poisson distributions and their potential algorithmic implications.

Abstract: We investigate photon transport and blockade based on the architecture where a waveguide is coupled to a microring resonator at two distinct points. This two-point coupling configuration between the waveguide and resonator gives rise to non-Markovian dynamics, which is induced by the photon transmission delay in the waveguide between the two coupled points. On one hand, by designing the non-Markovian coupling parameters between the waveguide and resonator, single or two-photon transport and the resulting photon blockade effect can be manipulated according to the output photonic states at the end of waveguide. This non-Markovian process can be evaluated by scattering matrices and second order correlation functions related to the distance between two coupled points. On the other hand, when classical driving fields are applied upon the resonator with interactions between its clockwise and counterclockwise modes, the blockade effect of the output field can be determined by the intracavtiy eigenstates. Then the correlations of the output field as well as the intracavity states can be modulated by the non-Markovian coupling between the microring resonator and waveguide.

Conclusion: CBMD是一种突破性框架，在量子动力学仿真中表现出显著优势。未来研究可扩展至更复杂动力学情形。

Abstract: We introduce contour-based matrix decomposition (CBMD), a framework for scalable simulation of non-unitary dynamics. Unlike existing methods that follow the ``integrate-then-discretize" paradigm and rely heavily on numerical quadrature, CBMD generalizes Cauchy's residue theorem to matrix-valued functions and directly decomposes a non-Hermitian function into a linear combination of Hermitian ones, which can be implemented efficiently using techniques such as quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). For non-Hermitian dynamics, CBMD achieves optimal query complexity. With an additional eigenvalue-shifting technique, the improved complexity depends on the spectral range of the system instead of its spectral norm. For more general dynamics that can be approximated by non-Hermitian polynomials, where algorithms like QSVT face significant difficulties, CBMD remains applicable and avoids the assumptions of diagonalizability as well as the dependence on condition numbers that limit other approaches.

Abstract: In the paper we developed a procedure for constructing generalized coherent states with shifted argument, as a result of the action of the generalized displacement operator. This was based on the action of a pair of nonlinear ladder operators, which generate nonlinear coherent states. To examine the properties of coherent states with shifted argument, the rules of the normal operator ordering technique (DOOT) were used. The results obtained were verified for a series of particular cases, obtaining expressions consistent with those in the literature.

Abstract: Resolved-sideband cooling is a standard technique in cavity optomechanics enabling quantum control of mechanical motion, but its performance is ultimately limited by quantum backaction heating. This fundamental effect imposes a limit on the minimum achievable mechanical phonon number, establishing a finite-temperature floor regardless of the applied cooling strength. We generalize the semi-classical model for optomechanical cooling to describe universal cavity Hamiltonians incorporating both passive and active nonlinearities. As a concrete demonstration, we analyze the simplest circuit optomechanical system that implements a nonlinear drive via a Josephson junction. Our analysis reveals that this active nonlinear drive can eliminate the residual heating backaction, thereby comparing favorably with alternative optomechanical cooling schemes based on passive nonlinearities arXiv:2202.13228. By successfully overcoming the finite-temperature floor that limits conventional schemes, our method paves the way for unprecedented quantum control over mechanical systems and establishes the experimental viability of zero-heating optomechanical cooling.

Abstract: As quantum hardware advances toward fault-tolerant operation, an intermediate stage known as early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC) is emerging, where partial error correction enables meaningful computation. In this regime, the ability of quantum processors to scale in size and depth has become a crucial factor shaping their achievable performance. This study investigates how finite scalability influences resource requirements for simulating open-shell catalytic systems using Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The analysis compares hardware archetypes distinguished by fidelity or operation speed under two representative scalability models. Finite scalability increases qubit and runtime demands yet leaves overall scaling behavior intact, with high-fidelity architectures requiring lower minimum scalability to solve equally sized problems. These effects are largely independent of the chosen scalability model. Extending this framework, we examine runtime competitiveness across hardware and code configurations, incorporating surface-code and quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)-based fault tolerance under finite scalability. The results identify operating regimes where high-fidelity architectures remain competitive despite slower gate speeds and show that LDPC codes further expand this regime by reducing space-time overhead. Together, these findings highlight the central role of scalability in quantifying performance and guiding the design of next-generation quantum hardware. Continued progress in scalable architectures will be essential for extending quantum computing to increasingly complex scientific and industrial applications.

Abstract: Scaling superconducting quantum processors beyond single dilution refrigerators requires efficient optical interconnects, yet integrating microwave-to-optical (M2O) transducers poses challenges due to frequency mismatches and qubit decoherence. We propose a modular architecture using SNAIL-based parametric coupling to interface Brillouin M2O transducers with long-lived 3D cavities, while maintaining plug-and-play compatibility.

Implementing asymmetric entanglement pumping tailored to amplitude damping errors, we achieve purified fidelities F~0.94 at 0.2 kHz rates.

Abstract: We have studied entanglement phase transition in a class of chaotic non-Hermitian spin chain in which its spin-spin coupling term commutes with the non-Hermitian term. Two models are investigated: transverse field Ising model with a complex longitudinal field and non-Hermitian XX model with a transverse field. Through calculating their complex spectra, we find these models are subject to a gapless-gapped phase transition with dissipation rate if the transverse field is larger than a model-dependent value. Interestingly, the variation of the complex gap with the dissipation rate is not monotonous, instead it manifest oscillations before entering the gapped phase. By simulating their non-unitary evolution, we show that the entanglement entropy of the steady state would transition from a volume-law to an area-law scaling with the increase of the dissipation rate. Meanwhile, some unexpected results about the entanglement entropy appear in the volume-law phase. These unusual features of the complex gap and the steady-state entanglement can be attributed to level crossings between the maximal imagine level and other levels. Our work reveals a novel entanglement transition in chaotic non-Hermitian systems.

Motivation: 这篇论文探讨的是量子系统中的单激发保持的相互作用，试图找出一个定律来限制这样的相互作用可能带来的影响，特别是在量子计算中如何利用 this 资源。

Method: 论文采用了一个结合理论分析和数值模拟的方法。首先在两体系统中进行严格的数学推导，然后通过数值模拟增强了结论在实际系统中的可行性。

Result: 主要结果是：对于 XY 模型的单激发状态，sum 的 local Wigner negativities 上界等于 seed 初始的引导态的负性。并且当且仅当激发态完全局域时，这个上界才能达到。这个结果不仅给出了一个上限 laws，还有一个时间依赖的轨迹，显示出随着时间推移，这个sum的绝对值会严格低于预算值。也就是，相空间中的重叠分布会导致冗余里的entanglement增强。

Conclusion: 这项研究为量子相互作用的限制性定律提供了新见解，特别是在涉及资源分配以维持coherence 和 quantum 现象时。特别是通过dark 运输现象，展示了coherence 的重要性，这在量子计算和通信中可能是一个关键的技术突破。而通过轨迹分析，提供了实用的硬件指标，这对于优化和控制实验设计可能非常有帮助。

Abstract: We prove a simple dynamical law for excitation-preserving interactions: the {sum of local Wigner negativities} is upper-bounded by a fixed budget set by the initially excited state. For the single-excitation sector of the XY model (and its beam-splitter analogue), this convexity bound equals the negativity of the seed state and is saturated only when the excitation is fully localized. At intermediate times the sum lies strictly below the bound due to phase-space overlap in local mixtures, quantitatively accounting for entanglement growth as a redistribution of a finite, budgeted resource into shared correlations. We establish the result analytically for two bodies and corroborate it numerically in engineered state-transfer chains, where it reveals a coherence-enabled dark transport: the resource becomes locally invisible while being stored in multi-body coherences. The predicted trajectory of the summed local negativity provides a practical hardware metric: deviations from the ideal, budgeted curve diagnose decoherence and control error.

Motivation: The research is driven by the potential of atom transport in quantum technologies like quantum gates and topological pumping.

Method: The authors use dynamic optical lattices, employ acousto-optic modulators to create a frequency imbalance, and apply inverse engineering based on dynamical invariants for atom transport., They solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation numerically to assess transport fidelity across various parameters and directions.

Result: The study shows that efficient atom transport is achievable within reasonable time frames, and the method is robust against experimental imperfections.

Conclusion: This work provides a practical framework for implementing atom transport in quantum devices using dynamically engineered lattices.

Abstract: Motivated by the compelling need for coherent atom transport in a variety of emerging quantum technologies, we investigate such transport on the example of an adjustable family of two-dimensional optical lattices [L. Tarruell {\em et al.}, Nature (London) 483, 302 (2012)] that includes square, triangular, honeycomb, dimerized, and checkerboard lattices as its special cases; dynamical optical lattices of this type have already been utilized for the demonstration of topological pumping and the realiza- tion of two-qubit quantum gates with neutral atoms. At the outset, we propose the appropriate arrangements of acousto-optic modulators that give rise to a frequency imbalance between coun- terpropagating laser beams, thus leading to the dynamical-lattice effect in an arbitrary direction in the lattice plane. We subsequently obtain the dynamical-lattice trajectories that enable atom transport using shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) in the form of inverse engineering based on a dy- namical invariant of Lewis-Riesenfeld type. We then quantify the resulting atom dynamics using the transport fidelity computed from the numerical solutions of the relevant time-dependent Schroedinger equation. We do so for various choices of the system parameters and transport directions, finding favorable results for the achievable transport times and robustness of the resulting transport to various experimental imperfections.

Abstract: Quantum computing is transitioning from laboratory research to industrial deployment, yet significant challenges persist: system scalability and performance, fabrication yields, and the advancement of algorithms and applications. We emphasize that in building quantum computers -- spanning quantum chips, system integration, instruction sets, algorithms, and middleware such as quantum error correction schemes -- design is everywhere. In this paper, we advocate for a holistic design perspective in quantum computing, a perspective we argue is pivotal to unlocking innovative co-design opportunities and addressing the aforementioned key challenges. To equip readers with sufficient background for exploring co-optimization opportunities, we detail how interconnected computational methods and tools collaborate to enable end-to-end quantum computer design. This coverage encompasses critical stages -- such as chip layout design automation, high-fidelity system-level simulation, Hamiltonian derivation for quantum system modeling, control pulse simulation, decoherence analysis, and physical verification and testing -- followed by quantum instruction set design. We then proceed to quantum system and software development, including quantum circuit synthesis, quantum error correction and fault tolerance, and logic verification and testing. Through these discussions, we illustrate with concrete examples -- including co-optimizing quantum instruction sets with algorithmic considerations, customizing error correction circuits to hardware-specific constraints, and streamlining quantum chip design through tailored code design, among others. We hope that the detailed end-to-end design workflow as well as these examples will foster dialogue between the hardware and software communities, ultimately facilitating the translation of meaningful research findings into future quantum hardware implementations.

Abstract: Nonlocal interactions are known to generate volume-law entanglement entropy. However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \(A\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.

We show that for scattering between particles which transform in the fundamental or anti-fundamental representations, i.e. qudits, all 2-2 scattering amplitudes can be constructed from only three quantum gates. Further, for any $N$, all 2-2 scattering channels are shown to emerge from the span of a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ algebra, suggesting that scattering in this context is fundamentally governed by the action of ``bit flips'' on the internal quantum numbers. We frame these findings in terms of quantum algorithms constructed from Linear Combinations of Unitaries and block encoding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  researchers aimed to manipulate quantum fluctuation and engineer a system that can efficiently implement these effects for potential applications in quantum information and simulating complex quantum phenomena.

Method:  they constructed a chip-based optical parametric down-converter in the langevin regime with precise tunability of inherent loss and employed joint numerical and experimental analysis to characterize key quantum features and their fluctuation origins.

Result:  they observed an asymmetric hong-ou-mandel dip and achieved nearly tenfold single photon compression, illustrating quantum fluctuation's role in fluctuation-driven parametric down-conversion.

Conclusion:  they successfully demonstrated how precise control over environmental loss can enable the exploitation of quantum fluctuation effects, paving the way for controllable single photon sources, quantum state manipulation, and fluctuation-driven quantum simulators.

Abstract: Quantum fluctuation plays a key role in the parametric down-conversion in the Langevin regime. In this paper, we report the experimental realization of optical parametric down-conversion in the Langevin regime on a chip. By precisely controlling the loss inherently tied to fluctuation, we observe the asymmetric Hong-Ou-Mandel dip - a hallmark of quantum fluctuation in the fluctuation-driven PDC, and the fluctuation-induced compression of single photons by nearly one order of magnitude. These findings pave the way for the manipulation of quantum fluctuation, quantum states, and system-reservoir interaction.

Abstract: Finite-size general security proofs for quantum key distribution based on Rényi entropies have recently been introduced. These approaches are more flexible and provide tighter bounds on the secret key rate than traditional formulations based on the von Neumann entropy. However, deploying them requires minimizing the conditional Rényi entropy, a difficult optimization problem that has hitherto been tackled using ad-hoc techniques based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which are unstable and can only handle particular cases. In this work, we introduce a method based on non-symmetric conic optimization for solving this problem. Our technique is fast, reliable, and completely general. We illustrate its performance on several protocols, whose results represent an improvement over the state of the art.

Abstract: The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. Finally, we contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures.

Both of them involve Renyi entropies, matrix means as special cases, thus implying the universality of our framework.

Abstract: The speed of a fault-tolerant quantum computer is dictated by the reaction time of its classical electronics, that is, the total time required by decoders and controllers to determine the outcome of a logical measurement and execute subsequent conditional logical operations. Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum computer are not well understood. In this work, we build, for a surface code based architecture, a model for the reaction time in which the decoder latency is based on parallel space- and time-window decoding methods, and communication latencies are drawn from our envisioned quantum execution environment comprising a high-speed network of quantum processing units, controllers, decoders, and high-performance computing nodes. We use this model to estimate the increase in the logical error rate of magic state injections as a function of the reaction time. Next, we show how the logical microarchitecture can be optimized with respect to the reaction time, and then present detailed full-system quantum and classical resource estimates for executing utility-scale quantum circuits based on realistic hardware noise parameters and state-of-the-art decoding times. For circuits with $10^{6}$--$10^{11}$ $T$ gates involving 200--2000 logical qubits, under a $Λ=9.3$ hardware model representative of a realistic target for superconducting quantum processors operating at a 2.86 MHz stabilization frequency, we show that even decoding at a sub-microsecond per stabilization round speed introduces substantial resource overheads: approximately 100k--250k additional physical qubits for correction qubit storage in the magic state factory; 300k--1.75M extra physical qubits in the core processor due to the code distance increase of $d$ to $d+4$ for extra memory protection; and a longer runtime by roughly a factor of 100.

Abstract: Spontaneous collective decay in driven atomic ensembles can generate coherence far from equilibrium, as illustrated by superradiant lasers where decay into a single-mode cavity synchronizes atomic phases into a macroscopic dipole and yields superradiant emission of light with an ultranarrow spectrum. Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collective decay channels remains an open question. We address this problem by analyzing atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths through two models. The first is a ring cavity supporting two bright collective decay channels, and the second is a bidirectional waveguide where, in addition to competition between channels, propagation induces coherent dipole-dipole interactions. For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window in which collective decay overcomes disordering processes, leading to spontaneous steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. We extract the thresholds marking the onset of synchronization and show that the maximum intensity scales quadratically in both models. The resulting order is not described by a single macroscopic dipole: in the ring cavity spontaneous chirality emerges at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops a local chirality with different orders dominating opposite ends of the atomic array. The analysis of the emitted light spectrum reveals a linewidth that seems to narrow with increased system size in the ring cavity, while narrowing in the waveguide remains inconclusive within accessible numerics. These results clarify how competition and propagation shape emergent order in one-dimensional reservoirs and identify regimes where steady-state superradiance may arise beyond the Dicke limit.

Conclusion: 采用VAMoS2与SiOx组合可以改善RS器件的关键参数，优化垂直架构的设计。

Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials provide unique structural features, such as physical gaps between their layers that are only connected through van der Waals (vdW) forces. These vdW gaps can guide the migration of intercalated ions and thus regulate filament growth in resistive switching (RS) devices. Vertically aligned 2D materials and their heterostructures provide vdW gap-mediated ion transport in memristor crossbars, providing great potential for high-density integration and reliable RS performance. Nevertheless, the fundamental switching mechanisms and their contributions to the RS remain inadequately understood. In this work, we investigate silver (Ag) filament-based threshold switching (TS) in heterostructures comprising vertically aligned 2D molybdenum disulfide (VAMoS${_2}$) grown via sulfurization and silicon oxide (SiO${_x}$). Compared to SiO${_x}$-only devices, the SiO${_x}$/VAMoS${_2}$ devices exhibit TS with higher on-threshold and hold voltages, each approximately 0.4 V, faster switching times down to 356 ns under a 4 V pulse, and a lower cycle-to-cycle on-current variability of 3.0%. A physics-based, variability-aware model reveals that confined Ag ion migration within the vdW gaps in VAMoS${_2}$ forms ultrathin seed filaments, which guide filament growth in the SiO${_x}$ layer. These findings establish SiO${_x}$/VAMoS${_2}$ heterostructures as a promising concept for reliable TS in vertical device architectures for emerging memories and neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: Measurement of the magnetization in the bulk of thin-film or two-dimensional materials is important for understanding their intrinsic properties without the complications from edges or domain walls. However, the stray fields from the bulk vanish or are very weak, which limits the application of direct measurement methods. Here, we develop a non-destructive approach to directly measuring the stray fields from the bulk of thin-film magnets at arbitrarily designatable locations, with nanoscale spatial resolution. We employ nano-indentation to induce the leakage of stray fields from the materials and use nano-diamond magnetometers to measure them. We apply the method to iron thin films and determine the intrinsic magnetization in the bulk of the materials. This work provides direct access to the intrinsic magnetic properties of thin-film and low-dimensional materials, as well as a method to study the mechanical effects on magnetization in nanomaterials.

Conclusion:  futures研究将探索非传统阻尼、参数变化和非线性对ARMS带宽的影响。

Abstract: Bandwidth is a widely known concept and tool used in structural dynamics to measure an oscillator's capacity to dissipate energy over time, for example when used in half-power damping estimation of structural modes. Root Mean Square (RMS) Bandwidth is a generalization of bandwidth that overcomes some of the limitations encountered with conventional bandwidth, including the prerequisite of linearity, single-mode response, and light damping. However, its mathematical form does not reveal much about the physics behind it. In this paper, we extend RMS Bandwidth to multiple degree-of-freedom, linear, time-invariant, classically damped systems by deriving an Analytical Root Mean Square (ARMS) Bandwidth in terms of a system's modal parameters and initial modal energy distribution. We demonstrate that ARMS Bandwidth reliably and accurately computes a single measure for a practical structure's dissipative capacity. Also, a purely data-driven methodology for assessing the modal energy distribution is developed. We apply ARMS Bandwidth to single and multiple degree-of-freedom systems and an experimental model aircraft to demonstrate its broad applicability. Future work will address the effects of non-classical damping distribution, time-varying parameters, and nonlinearities.

Abstract: Much of our understanding of gapless many-body quantum systems stems from their low-energy descriptions as conformal field theories. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the associated quantum geometry by considering finite systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry. This is supported by both analytical results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models.

Abstract: Intense quantum fluctuations arising from geometrical frustrations in kagome-lattice magnets provide a feasible approach to exotic quantum states. Here, we document an unexpected isosymmetric first-order magnetic transition in the recently synthesized frustrated kagome-lattice antiferromagnet Nd3ScBi5, which is characterized by significant latent heat and a pronounced magnetocaloric effect, as well as discontinuous Raman shifts and negligible hysteresis. Employing the magnetocaloric effect as a detection method, in conjunction with systematical field-dependent physical properties, we uncover a distinctive 1/2 magnetization plateau phase with significant quantum fluctuations. Our study unveils Nd3ScBi5 as a prototypical model with an emerging phase of enhanced quantum fluctuations triggered by first-order magnetic transitions.

Abstract: Quantum transport phenomena in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at oxide interfaces have garnered significant interest owing to their potential in spintronic and quantum information technologies. Here, we systematically investigate the quantum conductance corrections of spin-polarized 2DEGs formed at the interfaces between two insulating oxides, ferromagnetic EuTiO3 (ETO) films and (111)-oriented KTaO3 (KTO) substrates. The anomalous Hall effect and hysteretic magnetoresistance provide clear evidence for long-range ferromagnetic order in the 2DEGs, which could be attributed to interfacial Eu doping in combination with the magnetic proximity effect of the ETO layer. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry by ferromagnetism in the 2DEGs, and with the assistance of spin-orbit coupling effect, gives rise to a nontrivial Berry phase. This results in a competition between weak localization (WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL) in the quantum transport of Dirac-like fermions at the KTO (111) interfaces. Notably, this competitive behavior can be effectively tuned by optical gating via a photoexcitation-induced shift of the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate a controllable platform based on spin-polarized oxide 2DEGs for quantum transport, opening new avenues for spin-orbitronic and topological electronic applications.

Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators, characterized by symmetry-protected anomalous boundary modes, have been generalized to the strongly correlated regime for both bosonic and fermionic systems. As correlated topological insulators (TI) approach experimental realization in quantum simulators, conventional probes, such as transport measurements, are not easily applicable to these synthetic platforms. In this study, we focus on two examples of correlated TI: a bosonic TI protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2\times U(1)$ symmetry and the fermionic quantum spin Hall insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry. We propose a unified, readily implementable protocol based on measuring the disorder parameter $\langle\exp(\mathrm{i}θ\hat{Q}_A)\rangle$ for a large subregion $A$, with $\hat{Q}_A$ the total charge operator within $A$. Our key finding is that this quantity exhibits non-analytical dependence on $θ$ for correlated TI, a signature robust against decoherence. We establish this diagnostic through both numerical simulations and analytical derivations. This protocol is well-suited for implementation on near-term quantum simulation platforms, providing a direct route to experimentally confirm correlated TI.

Abstract: The tetratrillium lattice has recently been proposed as responsible for the dynamical properties observed in the $S=1$ langbeinite compound K$_2$Ni$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$. Here, we study in detail the classical spin liquid properties of this lattice of tri-coordinated tetrahedra using classical Monte Carlo and large-$N$ theory calculations. In the large-$N$ limit, we find that the system presents a gapped spectrum with flat bottom bands, giving rise to a fragile spin liquid with exponentially decaying correlations according to the classification of classical spin liquids. We confirm that this scenario also holds in the more realistic Ising and Heisenberg cases, for which the system does not exhibit any finite-temperature phase transition, and the low-temperature spin structure factors exhibit excellent quantitative agreement with the large-$N$ theory. We also provide insight into the quantum $S=1/2$ limit by performing pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group calculations at finite temperatures, and discuss the possible phases that can arise in the ground state due to quantum fluctuations.

Result: A detailed phase diagram is presented, showing the transition between spin-gapped, antiferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and fully polarized phases under varying conditions. The study successfully links magnetization curves to specific phases and determines Hamiltonian parameters.

Conclusion: This work offers a reliable method for characterizing and identifying magnetic materials, contributing to the field of condensed matter physics.

Abstract: A large variety of materials can be approximately described by means of spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladders. Here, the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm together with a previously established numerical self-consistent mean-field approximation is used to investigate the magnetic properties of spin ladders coupled in a second dimension. The full ground state phase diagram including spin-gapped, antiferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and fully polarized phases is presented as a function of interladder and intraladder coupling and magnetic field. Measurement of the dependence of magnetization on applied magnetic field is shown to enable location of a material on the phase diagram and determination of the Hamiltonian parameters. These results provide a practical route toward identifying and characterizing magnetic materials composed of coupled spin ladders.

Abstract: Quantum theory of geometrically frustrated systems is usually approached as a gauge theory where the local conservation law becomes the Gauss law. Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we put forward and discuss a proposal for a Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC) describing the planar spectrum of the holographic CFT dual to strings on AdS$_3\times$ S$^3\times$ S$^3\times$ S$^1$, a theory with global symmetry $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;α)^{\oplus 2}$. We focus mainly on the case when the radii of the two spheres are the same, i.e. $α= 1/2$, where the symmetry reduces to $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)^{\oplus 2}$. In this case, our proposal is based on two copies of an $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)$ Q-system, glued through the branch cuts of the Q-functions in a minimal way. We study in detail the ensuing analytic properties of the Q-functions in this proposal.
  Focusing on purely massive excitations, we consider the large worldsheet limit in which the QSC leads to a set of Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz (ABA) equations, yielding strong constraints on the (so-far unfixed) dressing factors of the worldsheet S-matrix.
  In a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric sector, our proposal is consistent with all previous results on the worldsheet S-matrix. However, in the non-symmetric case, we found a subtle incompatibility between the analytic constraints arising from the proposed QSC, the crossing equations present in the literature, and braiding unitarity.
  We discuss possible explanations for this mismatch: either our minimal QSC proposal does not hold beyond the symmetric sector, or the crossing unitarity equations receive a nontrivial correction that needs to be understood.
  Finally, we also propose a generalisation of the Q-system for the case of $α\neq 1/2$, corresponding to the superalgebra $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;α)$. This novel algebraic structure represents a significant step towards understanding the Quantum Spectral Curve of the entire theory.

Abstract: Compatibility with T-duality severely constrains higher-derivative corrections to the low-energy supergravity limits of string theory. For example, it suggests that Lorentz transformations for heterotic strings are modified in precisely the way required for the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism. A systematic procedure to construct the resulting generalized Green-Schwarz transformations is the generalized Bergshoeff-de Roo identification (gBdRi). Although it in principle allows computing $α'$-corrections to higher and higher orders, technically it becomes unfeasible beyond $α'^2$. We revisit this problem with an alternative approach to the gBdRi, which we have recently developed. It gives rise to a very simple all-order transformation law whose closure we verify by explicitly computing the resulting gauge algebra.

Abstract: A sharp signature of the black hole singularity in holography is a divergence in the boundary thermal two-point function at a specific point in the complex time plane. This divergence arises from a null geodesic that bounces off the black hole singularity. At finite 't Hooft coupling, stringy corrections to the bulk dynamics cannot be neglected, and the fate of the bouncing geodesic is an open question. We propose a simple scenario in which the singularity in the two-point function is shifted slightly into the complex plane, thereby smoothing it out into a finite-size bump. We demonstrate this smoothing explicitly in a microscopic example, namely the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at infinite temperature, where the correlator is under analytic control. Our result suggests a bulk description of planar theories at finite coupling as stringy black holes.

Abstract: We explore the microscopic origin of de Sitter entropy using a Lorentzian path-integral approach. We construct a Hilbert space whose states are associated with configurations of thin shells or end-of-the-world branes, with state overlaps defined by the gravitational path integral. By considering states which are indistinguishable to an observer, we find that the variance of microstate overlaps is dominated by Lorentzian wormhole topologies with conical singularities. Evaluating these overlaps, we recover the expected area law for the entropy, relating the dimension of the de Sitter Hilbert space to the area of the cosmological horizon. Extending this analysis to Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, we show that both the cosmological and black hole horizons contribute to the total entropy. Along the way, we present an explicit construction of the shell and brane configurations and examine their compatibility with relevant consistency conditions, including the null energy condition.

Abstract: Renormalization is an essential technique in field-theoretic descriptions of natural phenomena, where the absence of a UV-complete description yields an abundance of divergent quantities. While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincaré patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability.

Abstract: The analytic structure of holographic correlation functions at finite temperature contains information about curvature singularities of black holes in AdS. We compute the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients of the holographic two-point function of scalar operators at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. We show that the stress-tensor and current (T+J) sector of the OPE contains a singularity in the complex time plane at a location that can be identified with the time-shift of a bouncing geodesic in the charged black hole geometry: The geodesic starts at a boundary of a charged black hole in AdS, bounces off the timelike singularity, before returning to a different asymptotic boundary on the same side of the Penrose diagram. We show that the singularity in the T+J sector is smooth across the point where black hole becomes extremal, indicating that the analytic properties of holographic correlators could potentially probe naked singularities.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the full spectrum of tidal Love numbers for Reissner-Nordström (RN) black holes in general spacetime dimensions. By perturbing the Einstein-Maxwell theory around the $D$-dimensional RN background, we derive an effective two dimensional quadratic action encompassing tensor, vector, and scalar-type perturbation sectors. Through diagonalization, we obtain master equations governing each sector and extract the corresponding Love numbers from the asymptotic behavior of the solutions. Our results confirm that all Love numbers vanish for four-dimensional RN black holes. In higher dimensions, the tensor and vector Love numbers reproduce previously known results. For the previously unknown scalar-type Love numbers, we show also they vanish for integer valued effective multipolar indices and display logarithmic running behavior when the corresponding indices are half integers.

Abstract: This paper proposes a definition of what has previously been coined a Wilson Spool in the case of three-dimensional gravity with vanishing cosmological constant. The definition builds upon a construction of the one-loop partition function of a massive, spinning field from a fixed background holonomy. While the background is taken to be a flat-space cosmology, the definition of the Wilson spool is expected to hold independently of the underlying geometry. Some comments are given towards possible connections to its two-dimensional incarnations at non-vanishing cosmological constant.

Abstract: We propose a Quantum Spectral Curve for planar string theory on AdS3*S3*S3*S1 supported by pure Ramond-Ramond flux. Our proposal is built on symmetry considerations and integrability-based functional relations. To test our construction, we consider the large volume limit and successfully reproduce the cross- ing equations and the correct structure of the Bethe equations found in the literature. In a symmetric subsector, we find agreement with previously known results and furthermore extend the Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz to include massless modes. Beyond this sector, we identify an interesting puzzle regarding the compatibility of crossing equations with braiding unitarity for individual dressing phases, which warrants further investigation and may require additional physical insights or novel structures not previously encountered in related systems. As we expect the QSC to be exact in the planar limit, our proposal may open the way for non-perturbative analysis of this holographic system.

Abstract: We revisit the symbol bootstrap program for the seven-particle MHV and NMHV amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM) based on the alphabet associated with the $E_6$ cluster algebra. After imposing integrability, cluster adjacency (or extended Steinmann), first- and last-entry conditions, the solution space is already highly restrictive: e.g. for MHV case there are exactly $1,1,2,3,4$ parity-invariant solutions for $L=1,2,\cdots, 5$, which automatically satisfy dihedral symmetry. Remarkably, after further requiring a well-defined collinear limit, we find a unique solution for both MHV and NMHV sectors where all coefficients (e.g. more than $3.1\times 10^{10}$ for MHV at $L=5$) turn out to be integers. Furthermore, we observe recurrent patterns for coefficients of special words in $E_6$ symbols mirroring those found for the $C_2$ symbol of three-point form factors, which lead to numerous predictions in the form of all-loop sequences. As an initial application, we show that these sequences uniquely fix the MHV symbol through five loops without input from collinear limits. Given the simplicity and surprisingly strong constraining power of both physical constraints and the newly observed sequences, we conjecture that there is a unique symbol satisfying these constraints at any loop order.

Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) remains one of the most complex and fascinating areas of modern physics, with deep implications for our understanding of the fundamental forces and matter. The resolution of long-standing issues in QCD, such as confinement and the behavior of quarks and gluons at high energies, continues to drive theoretical and experimental research. The Gribov problem, which arises in the quantization of gauge theories, poses significant challenges in understanding the dynamics of these systems. Recent advancements in model frameworks, such as the FLPR model, offer new opportunities to explore these complexities and develop more accurate descriptions of QCD behavior.

Method:  The abstract outlines a systematic approach that integrates BRST-related symmetries with the functional quantization of gauge theories. By considering the discrete group of symmetries of the action and addressing the Gribov ambiguities within this framework, the authors demonstrate how to maintain the initial symmetries of the action in a gauge-fixed system. This involves the derivation of BRST-related transformations and their implications for the structure of the gauge-fixed action.

Result:  The key result of this work is the successful demonstration of how BRST-related symmetries can be consistently incorporated into the quantization of gauge theories that possess Gribov ambiguities. By establishing a correspondence between the symmetries of the action and the transformations in the quantized system, the authors provide a clearer understanding of how these symmetries are preserved or modified during the process of gauge fixing. This result contributes to a more robust framework for studying gauge theories and their quantization, particularly in cases where traditional methods may fail due to the presence of Gribov ambiguities.

Conclusion:  This paper advances our understanding of gauge theory quantization by addressing the challenges posed by the Gribov problem within the context of BRST symmetry and the FLPR model. The outcomes provide valuable insights for future research in QCD and related areas of theoretical physics, particularly in developing more reliable and comprehensive theoretical models for the strong interaction.

Abstract: With a recent revival, novel features of the FLPR model have been reported in the literature. A connection between those features to QCD involving the Gribov problem is explored. We investigate the FLPR model in a recently proposed framework of BRST-related symmetries and perform its full functional quantization as a gauge invariant system taking into account the Gribov ambiguities. We obtain a family of BRST-related transformations generated by the discrete group of symmetries of the action. We show that gauges possessing Gribov ambiguities lead to a violation of the initial discrete group of symmetries of the gauge-fixed action. The obtained results shed light into similar issues in QCD by the corresponding association of variables and fields between the two systems.

Abstract: We provide some additional comments on the long-lived discussions surrounding an effective action and potential plagued by a number of ambiguities. We reinforce the importance of an extra condition on the gauge-fixing function, namely the vanishing of its vacuum expectation value in the absence of external sources, when concluding gauge-independence of the effective action and potential at an extremum. We advocate for the alternative construction of the effective action and potential based on the Vilkovisky-DeWitt approach, and demonstrate its independence from the gauge-fixing parameter. We also exhibit a high-temperature generalisation of this alternative construction in the specific case of the Abelian-Higgs model.

Abstract: We investigate how non-local gravitational couplings from double-trace deformation between two asymptotic boundaries of an AdS$_5$ black brane can lead to the violation of the Averaged Null Energy Condition (ANEC). The first-order gravitational perturbations backreact with the background metric at second-order, creating a wormhole opening. The wormhole becomes traversable in both the gravitational shear and sound channels within the hydrodynamic approximation. This shows that dynamical metric perturbations can facilitate information transfer in a purely gravitational setting, with the emergence of $G_N$ indicating the gravitational origin. For the shear channel, we consider three different coupling configurations, whereas for the sound channel, we vary both the speed of sound and the attenuation constant, as these parameters control the wormhole traversability. Furthermore, we obtain late-time power-law behavior in the ANEC using fitting function and present a generalization that applies to both shear and sound channels. Due to its propagating nature, the sound channel exhibits late-time power-law remnants at low sound speed similar to the vector diffusive probes, but it prefers an exponential decay at higher sound speed similar to the scalar non-diffusive probes, as the power-law exponent weakened with increasing sound speed. For superluminal sound channels, the wormhole opens for an extremely brief duration at late insertion times, rendering it non-traversable.

Abstract: We develop a conceptual parallel between the black hole information problem and Zeno's paradox, highlighting the role of limiting procedures that turn formally infinite constructions into finite physical observables. Building on the replica--wormhole paradigm, we move beyond unitarity restoration to formulate a quantitative notion of irreversibility in Hawking radiation. Our main result is a modular thermodynamic framework for black-hole evaporation, in which modular entropy, entanglement capacity, and relative entropy assume thermodynamic roles. The monotonicity of relative entropy furnishes a generalized second law that determines the arrow of evolution in replica space. We further resolve the apparent tension between the replica method and the quantum no-cloning theorem by interpreting replicas as ensemble representations rather than physical copies of an unknown state, thereby clarifying the operational meaning of gravitational path integrals. A key message of this work is that non-additivity in Tsallis statistics provides an information-theoretic analogue of the correlations induced by replica wormholes.

The main focus is given to the correspondence between massless scattering amplitudes, including gravitational amplitudes, and correlators in carrollian conformal field theory. Strong emphasis is put on the development of carrollian conformal field theory as an intrinsic, independent, and non-perturbative framework in which to formulate gravitational scattering theory.

Abstract: We study Dirac fields on AdS$_n$ in both global and Poincaré charts and, for each mass window, we classify the boundary conditions at conformal infinity that ensure the existence of advanced and retarded propagators. We distinguish the well-known MIT--bag class from a generalized family, thereby extending to arbitrary dimensions the procedure initiated by Blanco. As in the scalar case, we show that suitable generalized boundary data can support bound states. In four dimensions we work out two explicit examples: (i) the MIT case, for which we construct the advanced/retarded propagators and the two-point function of the associated ground state and (ii) a representative generalized boundary condition, for which we construct the propagators and exhibit a normalizable bound state.

Abstract: We compute the classical one-loop gravitational Compton amplitude describing the scattering of a graviton off a massive spinning compact object at the second post-Minkowskian order, including terms through the quartic order in spin. Our analysis includes spin-induced finite-size effects up to the hexadecapolar order, and extends recent results obtained for minimal couplings at the quadratic order in spin. From the amplitude, we determine the scattering phase in momentum space, applicable in both the eikonal and wave regimes. In the eikonal limit, we then isolate the spin-independent contribution of the graviton field, explicitly linking it to the dynamics of a massless scalar probe in a Kerr background. This constitutes the first complete description of classical one-loop Compton scattering for generic spinning compact objects at the second post-Minkowskian and hexadecapolar orders.

Abstract: From the AdS/CFT dictionary, we derive a bulk dual of the work distribution defined by the two-point measurement on the boundary, yielding a bulk formulation of the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem. We argue that this not only provides a holographic prescription of the work distribution, but is also expected to capture some "mesoscopic" aspects of quantum gravity.

Abstract: Lee-Yang zero theory plays a crucial role in phase transition theory and is widely employed in the critical behavior of statistical thermodynamics. The supercritical regime of black hole thermodynamics remains a relatively unexplored area, and recent applications of this theory to charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes have initiated probes into this regime, revealing a simple structure partitioned by a single Widom line. In this paper, we apply Lee-Yang theory to charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes, which feature complex phase diagrams (e.g., triple points), to determine how such structures are reflected in the supercritical regime. Notably, we observe a key dimensional difference in that the five-dimensional (5d) system, which lacks a triple point, confirms the known single Widom line structure, while the six-dimensional (6d) system, which admits a triple point, generates two distinct Widom lines. These lines partition the supercritical domain into three sectors (small-, intermediate-, and large- black hole-like phases), corresponding to the three phases coexisting at the triple point. Our results reveal a direct correspondence between the number of coexisting phases at a triple point and the number of distinct supercritical sectors separated by Widom lines.

Abstract: We investigate a mechanism for generating mass terms in the IKKT and BFSS matrix theories through compactification on a torus and the derivation of a zero-mode effective theory, emphasising the crucial role of fermionic boundary conditions. Extending a recent proposal developed for the IKKT model to the BFSS framework, we explore a broader class of mixed fermionic boundary conditions in both theories. This choice leads to a distinct effective theory with intermediate features, where a mass term is generated together with fermionic zero modes. In the BFSS case, this setup further allows for the construction of black hole solutions. The resulting geometry takes the form of a fuzzy sphere, with quantum excitations in the fermionic sector accounting for the corresponding black hole entropy.

TL;DR: 我们在物理上相关的背景下研究了渐近简单性的命运。我们使用了两体系统的应力张量作为源，在广义相对论的有限观测者距离下利用渐进展开计算了时空度量。为了实现这一目标，我们将度量与最终状态引力子的一点函数相关联，并在动量空间中通过微扰量子场论技术进行计算。我们发现，无论是简单极点，还是与红外相关联的对数分支切线段，在外部引力子的虚性中均产生了非零贡献。我们专注于确定纽曼-彭诺普尔标量的衰减行为，确认了前一篇论文中预测的萨克斯的去 peeling 性质在后 Post-Minkowski 展开中的破坏在首阶。我们在后 Post-Minkowskian 展开中的高阶分析揭示了比之前认识得多的非线性和远程相互作用，导致周围引力场与局部源之间的长期相互作用，从而导致 peeling 性质的显著破坏。

Motivation: 引力场的孤岛效应和时空的渐进行为一直是引力物理中的基础问题。研究渐近简单性在紧凑物散射等物理相关背景下的命运，帮助我们更深刻地理解引力相互作用的基本规律，尤其是如何处理引力场在有物质源时的渐进展开，为理解宇宙大尺度结构和演化提供了理论基础。

Method: 我们将问题分解为以下几个步骤：1. 理解渐近简单性的基本概念及其在引力物理中的意义。2. 针对两体系统的 Stress Tensor，作为广义相对论中源的引入。3. 利用扰urbation 葛场论技术在作用空间中计算应力张量对度量的影响，并将其转换为 Newman-Penrose 标量的衰减行为。4. 观察和分析非线性相互作用如何影响度量的渐进展开。

Result: 我们发现萨克斯的去 peeling 性质在后 Post-Minkowski 展开中被显著破坏。这种破坏是由于非线性、长程相互作用，在孤立的源与引力场之间所带来的复杂效应。这证实了此前关于长距离相互作用会破坏渐的模式的观点，并提供了一种更精确的计算高阶项的方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现丰富了我们对引力相互作用和时空结构的理解，特别是在涉及孤立物时的渐近行为。他们为未来研究如何在更复杂的系统中处理渐进展开，尤其是涉及长程相互作用的系统，提供了理论上的指导。关于如何将这些结果应用于实际问题，如宇宙学中的大型结构形成和 Testing 广义相对论，将是一个有趣的问题。

Abstract: We investigate the fate of asymptotic simplicity in physically relevant settings of compact-object scattering. Using the stress tensor of a two-body system as a source, we compute the spacetime metric in General Relativity at finite observer distance in an asymptotic expansion. To do so, we relate the metric to the final-state graviton one-point function in momentum space, which is computed using perturbative QFT techniques. Both the simple pole and the infrared-related logarithmic branch cut in the virtuality of the external graviton contribute nontrivially. We focus on determining the fall-off behavior of the Newman-Penrose scalars, confirming previous predictions that Sachs's peeling property is violated at leading order in the post-Minkowski expansion. Our analysis at higher orders in the post-Minkowskian expansion reveals a significantly stronger breakdown of the peeling property than previously recognized, which is the result of nonlinear, long-range interactions between localized sources and the surrounding gravitational field.

Abstract: We construct symmetry generators and operators for $J\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories by generalizing the framework established for $T\bar{T}$ deformations. Working in the Hamiltonian formalism on the plane, we derive the symmetry algebra of the deformed theory, which consists of a local Virasoro-Kac-Moody algebra in the left-moving sector and a non-local counterpart in the right-moving sector. This algebraic structure guides the definition of two operator classes: dressed operators, which transform as primaries under the deformed symmetries, and local physical operators. While dressed operators are local only in the left null direction, physical operators maintain locality in both directions and are constructed from dressed operators and currents. This formulation allows the powerful constraints of conformal symmetry to be leveraged for computing physical observables. Consequently, we employ conformal perturbation theory to compute the two-point and $N$-point functions of physical operators. In momentum space, we sum the most UV-sensitive contributions to all orders; the results show precise agreement with string theory predictions. Furthermore, a non-perturbative analysis of the position-space correlator reveals an instanton contribution, providing a complete characterization of the correlation functions.

Conclusion: 任何具备SU(N)全局对称性的相互作用量子场论都必须在至少一个散射渠道中生成纠缠。

Abstract: We study the interplay between crossing symmetry and entanglement in $2 \to 2$ scattering within local quantum field theories that possess an $SU(N)$ global symmetry. In particular, we recast scattering amplitudes of fixed helicity as quantum operations on the Hilbert space of internal quantum numbers, where the external states play the role of qudits. The entire space of $SU(N)$-invariant scattering operators between qudits is spanned by a minimal set of three quantum gates. Recoupling relations among quantum gates are shown to follow directly from the crossing properties of the underlying amplitudes and reveal that entanglement generated from separable states in one channel is necessarily intertwined with another. Consequently, we argue any interacting quantum field theory that realizes an $SU(N)$ global symmetry must generate entanglement in at least one scattering channel.

Motivation: F-theory uses elliptic and genus-one fibrations of Calabi-Yau threefolds to study dualities between string theories and geometric structures.

Method: The authors systematically examined all 474 million reflexive polytopes, identifying 2.25 billion distinct fibrations through detailed computations.

Result: The study revealed 2.25 billion distinct fibrations, uncovering exotic features like non-toric divisors and high-rank 6D SCFTs.

Conclusion: The results confirm F-theory's effectiveness in exploring Calabi-Yau geometry and its dualities in string theory.

Abstract: We carry out a complete analysis of the toric elliptic and genus-one fibrations of all 474 million reflexive polytopes in the Kreuzer-Skarke database. Earlier work with Huang showed that all but 29,223 of these polytopes have such a fibration. We identify 2,264,992,252 distinct fibrations, and determine the fiber and base structure in each case; after accounting for automorphisms of the ambient polytope, these fibrations furnish 2,250,744,657 equivalence classes. We summarize generic features and identify exotic special cases among these fibrations. These fibrations illustrate many features that have been explored in the context of 6D F-theory, including gauge groups hosted on non-toric divisors, automatic enhancement of gauge groups, and implicit non-toric bases and high-rank 6D SCFTs associated with nonflat fibers, as well as novel geometric features such as singular bases for genus-one fibrations with multisections. This analysis illustrates the power of elliptic and genus-one fibrations, and the geometro-physical language of F-theory as a tool for understanding the structure of Calabi-Yau threefolds.

Conclusion: 提出了壳层重整化的新视角，展示了有限性和量纲化在重整化中的角色，并为标准理论提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We set up a bootstrap problem for renormalization. Working in the massless four-dimensional O$(N)$ model and the $λφ^4$ theory, we prove that unitarity leads to all-loop recursion relations between coefficients of scattering amplitudes with different multiplicities. These turn out to be equivalent to the identities imposed by renormalization of the coupling and the wavefunction through subleading logarithmic order, except with different initial conditions. Matching the initial conditions thus fixes the beta function and wavefunction anomalous dimension to these orders. We explain how to connect this new on-shell renormalization picture with the standard renormalized perturbation theory, highlighting a rich interplay between finiteness, dimensional regularization, and unitarity cuts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the spectral properties of such operators is fundamental for quantum mechanics and theoretical physics, particularly in the context of supersymmetric field theories.

Method: The research employs the open topological string/spectral theory correspondence to construct exact eigenfunctions, leveraging solvability and properties of quantum systems.

Result: The discovery of exact eigenfunctions, which are entire functions except at quantized energies where they become square-integrable. The behavior at Toda points reveals interesting spectral phenomena like energy level crossing.

Conclusion: This research offers a precise analytic solution to a non-trivial quantum spectral problem, providing insights into the interplay between geometry, topology, and quantum mechanics with implications for SUSY Yang-Mills theories and potential applications in theoretical physics.

Abstract: We study the spectral problems associated with the finite-difference operators $H_N = 2 \cosh(p) + V_N(x)$, where $V_N(x)$ is an arbitrary polynomial potential of degree $N$. These systems can be regarded as a solvable deformation of the standard Schrödinger operators $p^2 + V_N(x)$, and they arise naturally from the quantization of the Seiberg-Witten curve of four-dimensional, $\mathcal{N} = 2$, SU($N$) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Using the open topological string/spectral theory correspondence, we construct exact, analytic eigenfunctions of $H_N$, valid for arbitrary polynomial potentials and describing both bound and resonant states. Our solutions are entire in $x$ for generic values of the energy, and become $L^2$-normalizable only at a discrete set of energies. An interesting feature of these Hamiltonians is the existence of special loci in the parameter space of the potential, the so-called Toda points. The eigenfunctions exhibit enhanced decay at these points, leading to spectral degeneracies for confining potentials and to a real energy spectrum for unbounded ones. Our results provide a rare example of a quantum-mechanical spectral problem that is exactly solvable, admitting explicit, analytic eigenfunctions for both bound and resonant states.

Abstract: We provide a framework and explicit construction for the regularized measurement of a large class of spacetime-localized observables in bosonic quantum field theory. The measurements fully satisfy relativistic causality and causal transparency, i.e., avoid unphysical superluminal signaling. We show explicitly how the measurement of time-extended observables back-reacts on itself and induces correlations between other measurements in its causal future. Our framework is fully compositional in spacetime and extends previous results on the measurement of instantaneous observables.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Lorentzian path integral for the wave function of the Universe is only conditionally convergent and thus requires a well-defined prescription. The Picard-Lefschetz approach ensures convergence through contour deformation, but it has been argued that this leads to unsuppressed perturbations due to relevant saddle points residing in the region ${\rm Im}N>0$. As an alternative, we propose a simple regulator for the lapse integral in minisuperspace. Specifically, we impose the vanishing initial size of the Universe via a delta function, represented as a narrow Gaussian of width $σ$, and take the limit $σ\to 0$ only after performing the functional integrations. This regulator has a clear physical interpretation: it corresponds to a vanishingly small quantum uncertainty in the initial size of the Universe. For any fixed $σ> 0$, the lapse integral is absolutely convergent along (or slightly below) the real axis, and no excursion into the region ${\rm Im}N>0$ is required. We further argue that the initial wave function for scalar and tensor perturbations should be incorporated in the Lorentzian path integral formalism, and we show that these perturbations are then appropriately suppressed. A purely Lorentzian path integral thus yields the tunneling wave function with suppressed perturbations. We also demonstrate that the Hartle-Hawking wave function can be reproduced by choosing a contour for the lapse integral extending from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ that passes below the singularity near the origin.

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether rotating scalar Q-balls can reproduce the rotation curves of disk galaxies, aiming to explore dark matter alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the observation that Q-balls, which are non-topological solitons, resemble galaxy structures, prompting an investigation into their potential role in dark matter.

Method: The researchers employed a hybrid numerical framework combining a high-precision pseudo-spectral method with a physics-informed neural network to model static and rotating Q-balls.

Result: The model provided a satisfactory fit to galaxy rotation curves, with the scalar field particle mass constrained to approximately $10^{-27}$ eV.

Conclusion: Q-balls could potentially serve as dark matter halos, offering a new perspective on galactic dynamics and dark matter composition.

Abstract: Can a dynamically robust (\textit{aka} stable) $Q$-ball reproduce the rotation curve of a disk galaxy? In an astrophysical environment, $Q$-balls are non-topological solitons that are transparent and only perceived by their gravitational effects. Traditionally, scalar $Q$-balls are modelled with a polynomial potential, but axion-like periodic potentials are also expected to support such solitonic configurations. In the presence of angular momentum, $Q$-balls acquire a toroidal structure with a central density void, qualitatively resembling the structure of disk galaxies. Motivated by this similarity, we investigate whether rotating scalar $Q$-balls can reproduce the observed galactic rotation curves. In this work, we use a recently developed hybrid numerical framework that combines a high-accuracy pseudo-spectral method with a physics-informed neural network approach to construct both static and rotating $Q$-ball solutions. We then assess their ability to act as the dark matter halos in galaxies by fitting the observed rotation curves of a sample of disk galaxies from the SPARC catalogue. Our simplified model provides an overall good agreement with observational data; we have further found an average constraint on the scalar field particle's mass $m\sim 10^{-27}$ eV, in agreement with similar galactic-scale soliton solutions.

Abstract: Gravitational waves from comparable-mass binary-black-hole mergers are often described in terms of three stages: inspiral, merger and ringdown. Post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories are used to model the inspiral and ringdown parts of the waveform, respectively, while the merger phase has been modeled most accurately using numerical relativity (NR). Nevertheless, there have been several approaches used to model the merger phase using analytical methods. In this paper, we adapt a hybrid approximation method that applies post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories at the same times in different spatial regions of a binary-black-hole waveform (and which are matched at a boundary region with prescribed dynamics). Prior work with the hybrid method used leading post-Newtonian theory and the perturbation theory of nonrotating black holes, which led to errors during the late inspiral and disagreement with the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency extracted from NR simulations during the ringdown. To obtain a better match with NR waveforms of binary-black-hole mergers, we made several phenomenological modifications to the hybrid method. Specifically, to better capture the inspiral dynamics, we use the effective-one-body method for modeling the trajectory of the boundary between the two spatial regions. The waveform is determined by evolving a Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type equation for an effective black-hole perturbation theory problem with a modified Poschl-Teller potential. By tuning the potential to match the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency of the remnant black hole and also optimizing the boundary data on the matching region, we could match NR waveforms from nonspinning, comparable-mass binary black holes with mass ratios between one and eight, with a relative error of order $10^{-3}$.

### [96] [Photon counting readout for detection and inference of gravitational waves from neutron star merger remnants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09656)
*Ethan Payne,Lee McCuller,Katerina Chatziioannou*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Photon-counting in quantum-noise-dominated detectors offers a promising alternative to traditional homodyne readout for detecting low-SNR post-merger gravitational waves, improving measurements of neutron star properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting gravitational waves from neutron star mergers is crucial for understanding dense matter. Next-gen detectors are expected to produce a massive number of signals, but post-merger emissions are rare. This paper explores an innovative method to detect these weak signals in the high-frequency regime dominated by quantum noise.

Method: The study proposes using photon-counting, where signals and noise are quantized into discrete distributions. Simulations demonstrate that even weak signals with low SNR can be detected. Additionally, the method improves the measurement of neutron star radii by a factor of two when classical noise is reduced.

Result: Photon counting enables the detection of signals with an SNR of 0.2 with approximately 1 in 100 chances. Moreover, over a period of 10⁻² to 1.5 years of observation, it enhances the precision of neutron star radius measurements.

Conclusion: This novel approach significantly advances the ability to analyze low-SNR gravitational wave signals, offering a promising technological breakthrough for astrophysical research.

Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted after neutron star binary coalescences and the information they carry about dense matter are a high-priority target for next-generation detectors. Even though such detectors are expected to observe millions of signals, detectable post-merger emission will remain rare. In this work, we explore post-merger detectability and inference through an alternative detector readout scheme for data dominated by quantum-noise, which is the case above $1$\,kHz: photon-counting. In such a readout, signals and noise become quantized into discrete distributions corresponding to the detection of single photons measured in a chosen basis of modes. Through simulated data, we demonstrate that photon counting can be efficient even for weak signals. We find ${\sim}1$ in 100 signals with a post-merger signal-to-noise ratio of 0.2 can result in a single photon and thus be detected. Furthermore, after $2\times10^4$ signals -- equivalent to $10^{-2}$ to $1.5$ years of observation -- photon counting results in a twofold improvement in the measurement of the radius of a $1.6\,M_\odot$ neutron star. Constraints can be further tightened if the detector classical noise is reduced. Photon counting offers a promising alternative to traditional homodyne readout techniques for extracting information from low signal-to-noise ratio post-merger signals.

*William G. Lamb,Jeremy M. Wachter,Andrea Mitridate,Shashwat C. Sardesai,Bence Bécsy,Emily L. Hagen,Stephen R. Taylor,Luke Zoltan Kelley*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents strong evidence for an isotropic, Gaussian gravitational wave background (GWB) detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The GWB, possibly originating from supermassive black hole binaries, shows higher spectral amplitudes. Current analyses have limitations, including Gaussian assumptions, integer multiple frequency modeling, and neglect of signal interference. The paper models the astrophysical GWB without these simplifications and finds that interference introduces non-Gaussianities in PTAs, currently unmodeled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding GWBs is critical for studying early universe physics and binary systems. Accurate modeling of PTAs helps discern GWB signals from other noise sources.

Method: Developed analytical and numerical models to simulate astrophysical GWB effects in PTAs, comparing signal statistics to Gaussian models.

Result: Interference causes the PTA signal to deviate from Gaussianity, highlighting the need for updated analysis models.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of considering interference effects in GWB analyses for more accurate results.

Abstract: Strong evidence for an isotropic, Gaussian gravitational wave background (GWB) has been found by multiple pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The GWB is expected to be sourced by a finite population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) emitting in the PTA sensitivity band, and astrophysical inference of PTA data sets suggests a GWB signal that is at the higher end of GWB spectral amplitude estimates. However, current inference analyses make simplifying assumptions, such as modeling the GWB as Gaussian, assuming that all SMBHBs only emit at frequencies that are integer multiples of the total observing time, and ignoring the interference between the signals of different SMBHBs. In this paper, we build analytical and numerical models of an astrophysical GWB without the above approximations, and compare the statistical properties of its induced PTA signal to those of a signal produced by a Gaussian GWB. We show that interference effects introduce non-Gaussianities in the PTA signal, which are currently unmodeled in PTA analyses.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Deviations from Ladder-symmetric backgrounds cause static scalar tidal Love numbers to be non-zero.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether static scalar tidal Love numbers vanish is crucial for understanding the behavior of black holes in general relativity.

Method: Parametric deformations of Ladder-symmetric spacetimes were introduced, and their effects on the linear tidal response analyzed.

Result: Any deviation from a Ladder-symmetric background results in non-zero static scalar tidal Love numbers.

Conclusion: Ladder symmetry is a necessary and sufficient condition for the vanishing of static scalar tidal Love numbers in static, spherically symmetric black holes and rotating KRZ black holes.

Abstract: Black holes in four-dimensional, asymptotically flat general relativity have vanishing static tidal Love numbers (TLNs), a property tied to a hidden symmetry of the perturbation equations. Within the Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) parametrization, a subclass of spacetimes was previously shown to admit such Ladder symmetry, which enforces the absence of static scalar TLNs. In this work, we introduce parametric deformations to such Ladder-symmetric spacetimes and analyze the resultant linear tidal response. Using the parametrized formalism for TLNs, we show that any deviation from a Ladder-symmetric background leads to non-zero static scalar TLNs. This establishes Ladder symmetry as a necessary, as well as sufficient condition, for the vanishing of static TLNs in static, spherically symmetric black holes and in rotating black holes of the KRZ class.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dynamics of periodic orbits and the properties of accretion disks around a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) immersed in a King-type dark matter (DM) halo. Our analysis focuses on how the presence of the King DM halo influences both the behavior of periodic orbits and the radiative characteristics of the accretion disk. We begin by examining time-like periodic geodesic orbits for various configurations characterized by different energy and angular momentum values, represented by the integers $(z, w, v)$. Furthermore, we explore the effects of the King DM halo on time-like periodic geodesics, marginally bound orbits, and innermost stable circular orbits, thereby providing a deeper understanding of how the DM halo environment modifies the behavior of these stable orbits and timelike particle geodesics. Finally, we analyze the null geodesics and the accretion disk properties by studying their direct and secondary images, redshift distributions, and radiation fluxes as observed at infinity for a range of inclination angles. This approach allows us to gain valuable insights into the spacetime geometry of a Schwarzschild-like BH within the King-type DM halo, its physical and radiative properties in the accretion disk, and the corresponding observational implications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the properties of singularities in alternative theories of gravity, particularly focusing on the stability and potential observational implications of naked singularities.

Method: The authors investigate the linear stability of these configurations by analyzing tensor perturbations and numerically evolving perturbation equations in the time domain.

Result: The study reveals that all modes decay with characteristic oscillatory tails, consistent with massive field perturbations in quadratic gravity, indicating dynamic stability.

Conclusion: Attractive naked singularities in Einstein-Weyl gravity are found to be dynamically stable and observationally concealing, suggesting they may serve as viable horizonless alternatives in higher-derivative gravity theories, offering new insights into singularity resolution and effective field dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate a class of horizonless solutions in Einstein-Weyl gravity, corresponding to the so-called attractive naked singularities of the (-2,2) type. In contrast to General Relativity, where naked singularities are generically unstable and excluded by the cosmic censorship conjecture, we show that these configurations are linearly stable under tensor perturbations. By numerically evolving the perturbation equations in the time domain, we find that all modes decay with characteristic oscillatory tails, a behavior consistent with the dynamics of massive field perturbations in quadratic gravity. This establishes that attractive naked singularities in Einstein-Weyl gravity are dynamically stable and can persist as stationary configurations. We argue that these horizonless configurations are observationally concealed, and therefore we refer to them as veiled singularities. Their stability and phenomenological similarity to black holes suggest that they may represent viable horizonless alternatives in higher-derivative theories of gravity, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between singularity resolution, stability, and effective field dynamics beyond Einstein's theory.

Conclusion: 二力展开方法在中等质量比下表现良好，未来应进一步探索更高阶项的影响。

Abstract: The asymptotic nature of unbound binary-black-hole encounters provides a clean method for comparing different approaches for modeling the two-body problem in general relativity. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code, to explore the self-force and post-Minkowskian expansions of the scattering angle. First, we use a set of unequal-mass simulations to extract the self-force contributions to the scattering angle. Our main result is that using information up to second-order in the symmetric mass ratio (2SF) reproduces numerical relativity within the error bars across the full range of mass-ratios, including equal mass. Next, we compare our numerical relativity results to state-of-the-art post-Minkowskian predictions at larger impact parameters than previously explored. We find good agreement in the weak-field regime and discuss the relative importance of higher-order terms.

Conclusion: 该研究结论是 CKG 模型中两种 DE 提议均不符合当前宇宙观测数据，同时 Hubble 恤seion 问题仍未得到满意解。

Abstract: Based on a comprehensive analysis of recent observational data-a combination of DESI DR1, Planck CMB, and Pantheon+ SN Ia-this study critically evaluates the two dark energy (DE) proposals within Harada's Conformal Killing Gravity (CKG) model. The model in question predicts either a dominant phantom-type effective DE component with EoS $ω= -5/3$ or a hybrid scenario combining a cosmological constant ($ω= -1$) with a subdominant $ω= -5/3$ fluid (around $5\%$) to address the Hubble tension (HT) and late-time acceleration. An analysis based on the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) demonstrates that the pure CKG fluid scenario $ω= -5/3$ is excluded, whereas the hybrid model remains only marginally compatible. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis constrains the effective DE density parameter to $Ω_{\text{eff}} = 0.009^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$ ($68\%$ CL), consistent with zero and ruling out the around $5\%$ contribution required by Harada's CKG. The resulting Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ and effective EoS $ω_{\text{eff}}(z)$ are indistinguishable from those of $Λ$CDM. Bayesian model comparison via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) shows no statistical preference for CKG over $Λ$CDM ($Δ\text{AIC} = +2.6$), disfavoring the additional complexity of the CKG model. The key output of this study is that both DE proposals in Harada's CKG are ruled out by current cosmological data, and HT remains unresolved.

Abstract: We study the bound states of a massive scalar field around a topological star, and show that these are strictly normal modes. This yields a genuine gravitational atom, sharply distinguishing horizonless objects from black holes. It is shown that the modes are controlled by the field's Compton wavelength compared to the size of the star. When the Compton wavelength is large, the field forms a cloud with a hydrogen-like spectrum, while in the opposite regime it localizes along timelike trajectories. When the two scales are comparable the spectrum becomes richer, and we characterize it in detail allowing the field to carry electric charge and Kaluza--Klein momentum.

Abstract: We present a geometric placement algorithm for constructing template banks. We specialize in the case of Gravitational Wave searches, and use autoencoders for non-linear compression of the space of waveforms after these have been represented by a finite number of basis functions using an SVD decomposition. To ensure that the autoencoder is suitable for geometric placement we try to find a coordinate system describing the manifold of SVD coefficients such that distances in the latent and embedding space are equal. We show that the curvature of the banks is negligible and that such a system can be found. We then show that a geometric placement algorithm via a uniform grid in the latent space combined with rejection of unphysical points using a normalizing flow results in templates that, while slightly less in number than the similar construction using random forests of Ref.~\cite{Wadekar:2023kym}, perform slightly better in the effectualness tests, especially for high-mass binary systems. We discuss briefly how these dimensionality reduction techniques might be used in the context of cosmology, and a simple toy example where the periodicity of a flat manifold slightly complicates finding a distance-preserving coordinate system.

Abstract: The physical and mathematical properties of the composed Reissner-Nordström-black-hole-massive-scalar-field system are studied {\it analytically} in the dimensionless large-mass $Mμ\gg1$ regime [here $\{M,μ\}$ are respectively the mass of the central black hole and the proper mass of the scalar field]. It is proved that, for a given value ${\bar Q}\equiv Q/M$ of the dimensionless charge parameter of the central black hole, the system is characterized by the presence of quasi-resonances, linearized perturbation modes with arbitrarily long lifetimes. In particular, using analytical techniques, we determine the black-hole-field critical mass spectrum $\{Mμ_{\text{crit}}({\bar Q})\}$ which characterizes the long-lived resonances of the composed physical system.

Motivation: Accurate modeling of GW waveforms is essential for GW astronomy, and PINNs offer a novel approach by incorporating physical constraints and combining PN and NR data.

Method: A PINN framework is created to learn corrections between PN and NR data. The network is trained using hybridized NR surrogate data, with physically motivated loss terms to enforce known limits and symmetries. Corrections for mass parameter discrepancies are also incorporated.

Result: The framework significantly reduces phase and amplitude errors in waveform modeling through the inspiral phase, up to approximately 200M before merger.

Conclusion: This approach provides a computationally efficient and accurate bridge between PN and NR models, enhancing the generalization of GW waveform models beyond existing NR datasets.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of gravitational waveforms from compact binary coalescences remains central to gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. Post-Newtonian (PN) approximations capture the early inspiral dynamics analytically but break down near merger, while numerical relativity (NR) provides the accurate yet computationally expensive waveforms over limited parameter ranges. We develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that learns corrections mapping PN dynamics and waveforms to their NR counterparts. As a demonstration of the approach, we use the TaylorT4 PN model as the baseline, and train the network on hybridized NR surrogate data (NRHybSur3dq8) to learn higher-order corrections to the orbital dynamics and waveform modes for nonspinning noneccentric systems. Physically motivated loss terms enforce known limits and symmetries, such as vanishing corrections in the Newtonian limit and suppression of odd-$m$ modes in equal-mass systems, promoting consistent and reliable extrapolation beyond the training region. We simultaneously incorporate corrections that account for the different meaning of mass parameters in PN and NR descriptions. The learned corrections significantly reduce the phase and amplitude error through the inspiral up to about $200M$ before the merger. This approach provides a differentiable and computationally efficient bridge between PN and NR, offering a path toward waveform models that generalize more robustly beyond existing NR datasets.

Abstract: Interrelationships between the expansion, the shear, and the vorticity -- the kinematical tensors -- on the one hand, and the polarization modes of gravitational waves on the other hand, are studied by considering freely falling test particles. After studying exact relations, we consider slowly moving particles under the influence of a weak gravitational field. Linearized plane waves of metric theories of gravity representative of those determined by a general second order Lagrangian, including General Relativity, are shown to exemplify the following interconnections: between the transverse components of the shear and the transverse tensor polarization mode; between the expansion, and both the transverse scalar and the longitudinal polarization modes; and between the longitudinal-transverse components of the shear and the vorticity, and the vector polarization mode.

Abstract: In this article, the behavior of a straight cosmic string is studied for the linearized version of Horndeski theory in cases where the scalar field is massless or massive. Several physical properties of such solutions are discussed in detail regarding the effects of the scalar field of this theory. The mass of the scalar field induces a screening effect such that, in the massive theory, the string solution approaches to the general relativistic one. We also consider wiggly cosmic strings, obtain the solutions for both massless and massive cases, discuss their properties and observe similar screening effects.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Gravitational wave detectors produce time series of the gravitational wave strain co-added with instrument noise. For evenly sampled data, such as from laser interferometers, it has been traditional to Fourier transform the data and perform analyses in the frequency domain. The motivation being that the Fourier domain noise covariance matrix will be diagonal if the noise properties are constant in time, which greatly simplifies and accelerates the analysis. However, if the noise is non-stationary this advantage is lost. It has been proposed that the time-frequency or wavelet domain is better suited for studying non-stationary noise, at least when the time variation is suitably slow, since then the wavelet domain noise covariance matrix is, to a good approximation, diagonal. Here we investigate the conditions under which the diagonal approximation is appropriate for the case of the Wilson-Daubechies-Meyer (WDM) wavelet packet basis, which is seeing increased use in gravitational wave data analysis. We show that so long as the noise varies slowly across a wavelet pixel, in both time {\em and} frequency, the WDM noise correlation matrix is well approximated as diagonal. The off-diagonal terms are proportional to the time and frequency derivatives of the dynamic spectral model. The same general picture should apply to other discrete wavelet transforms with wavelet filters that are suitably compact in time and frequency. Strategies for handling data with rapidly varying noise that violate these assumptions are discussed.

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a one-dimensional dissipative Bose-Hubbard model using the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (FRG). Each lattice site is coupled to an independent bath, generating long-range temporal interactions that encode non-Markovian dissipation. For a broad class of bath spectra -- ohmic, sub-ohmic, and super-ohmic -- we identify two competing low-energy regimes: a Luttinger-liquid line of fixed points and a dissipative fixed point characterized by finite compressibility, vanishing superfluid stiffness, and universal scaling exponents, separated by a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The FRG framework is essential here, as it provides access to the complete renormalization group flow and all fixed points from a single microscopic action, beyond the reach of perturbative or variational methods. This work establishes a unified and systematically improvable framework for describing dissipative quantum phases in one dimension.

Additionally, we investigate breathing modes and quench dynamics in trapped geometries. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for exploring both static and dynamical phenomena in finite 2D Bose systems, offering guidance for the design of future experimental protocols.

Abstract: We describe recent theoretical and experimental developments on mediated interactions in mixtures of bosonic and fermionic atoms. We discuss how particle-hole excitations of a Fermi sea can induce long-range interactions between heavy impurities or atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Conversely, phonon excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate induce interactions between fermionic atoms. These mediated interactions exhibit different short-range and long-range scaling regimes with distance and, if strong enough, can induce fermion superfluidity. We discuss the prospects for observing new phenomena that could arise from mediated interactions. Experimentally, we outline recent studies of the 133Cs-6Li Bose-Fermi mixture, a platform well-suited for investigating fermion-mediated interactions. A Cs Bose-Einstein condensate immersed in a degenerate Li Fermi gas is prepared with tunable interspecies interactions. In the weak-coupling regime, precision measurements of condensate properties reveal fermion-mediated attractions between bosons, matching theoretical predictions. In the strong-coupling regime, we observe suppression and revival of sound modes and novel many-body resonances. Altogether, we aim to highlight both instances where experiment and theory agree well, and promising prospects to engineer long-range interactions in atomic quantum gases.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了超冷分子在椭圆微波场中的四原子和六原子束缚态，发现可以通过一维模型准确描述三维空间中的物理系统，明确了该一维描述的有效区域，展示了分子之间相互作用的异质性及其与外部场的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the interaction of ultracold molecules in a specific physical setup involving an elliptic microwave field. The primary motivation for this study is to explore the fundamental physics of bound states in such systems, which has implications for understanding quantum many-body systems and potential applications in precision metrology or quantum sensing.

Method: The authors employ effective one-dimensional (1D) models to describe the system, considering high-order angular fluctuations as perturbations. The models incorporate the effects of the elliptic and coupling strengths of the microwave field. They compare these models to exact solutions of the three-dimensional (3D) system to determine the validity region of the 1D description. Hard-core character of the models is emphasized, enabling a duality between bosonic and fermionic molecules in real and spectral space, while their momentum distributions remain distinct.

Result: The study reveals that the effective dimensionality reduction is primarily due to intrinsic molecular interaction anisotropy rather than external confinement. The effective models demonstrate a perfect duality between bosonic and fermionic molecules in real and spectral space, while their momentum distributions remain distinct.

Conclusion: The results suggest a self-bound single-molecule array as the ground state of both bosonic and fermionic molecular gases, with potential implications for understanding Bose-Einstein condensation and the formation of such ground states in three-dimensional systems.

Abstract: We investigate tetratomic and hexatomic bound states of ultracold molecules dressed by an elliptic microwave field. We show that these bound states can be accurately described by effective one-dimensional (1D) models incorporating high-order angular fluctuations, despite the physical system is in three-dimensional (3D) free space. By comparing with exact solutions of the full 3D system, we identify the validity region of such 1D description in the parameter plane of ellipticity and coupling strength of microwave field. The hard-core character of these effective models enables a duality between bosonic and fermionic molecules in real and spectral space, while their momentum distributions remain distinct. Our results have demonstrated an effective dimension reduction in microwave-shielded molecular systems, which is purely due to the intrinsic interaction anisotropy rather than any external confinement. Extending to large systems, our results suggest a self-bound single-molecule array as the ground state of both bosonic and fermionic molecular gases.

Abstract: We combine numerical and experimental approaches to study how impurities affect the maximum superflow in an annular Bose-Einstein condensate. By tuning the impurity density, we achieve precise control over the stability of persistent currents which increases with the impurity number. In the unstable regime, the complex vortex motion within the impurity landscape, characterized by pinning and unpinning events, governs the timescale of the current decay and its final value. Our work establishes atomic superfluids as a pristine platform for exploring universal mechanisms of superflow stabilization and decay, paving the way for atomtronic quantum technologies.

Abstract: The tension between fermion pairing and magnetism affects numerous strongly correlated electron systems, from high-temperature cuprates to twisted bilayer graphene. Exotic forms of fermion pairing and superfluidity are predicted when attraction between fermions competes with spin doping. Here, we follow the evolution of fermion pairing and charge and spin order in a spin-imbalanced attractive Hubbard gas of fermionic $^{40}$K atoms, covering a wide range of densities, magnetizations, and interactions with single-atom resolution. At low spin imbalance and weak interactions, we find a mixture of nonlocal fermion pairs coexisting with itinerant excess fermions. For stronger interactions an effective hard-core Bose-Fermi mixture emerges. Spin doping drives a crossover from charge-density wave correlations to a Fermi liquid of polarons. Beyond a certain spin imbalance and interaction strength, we find evidence for the onset of combined spin- and pair-density wave order, a possible precursor for the existence of magnetized superfluidity in the attractive Hubbard system.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, safety basis, and commissioning results of a 1 K liquid helium-4 (4He) evaporation refrigerator developed for the Fermilab SpinQuest Experiment (E1039). The system represents the first high power helium evaporation refrigerator operated in a fixed target scattering experiment at Fermilab and was engineered to comply with the Fermilab ES\&H Manual (FESHM) requirements governing pressure vessels, piping, cryogenic systems, and vacuum vessels. The design is mapped to ASME B31.3 (Process Piping) and the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) for pressure boundary integrity and overpressure protection, with documented compliance to FESHM Chapters 5031 (Pressure Vessels), 5031.1 (Piping Systems), and 5033 (Vacuum Vessels). This work documents the methodology used to reach compliance and approval for the 4He evaporation refrigerator at Fermilab which the field lacks. Design considerations specific to the high radiation target-cave environment including remotely located instrumentation approximately 20 m from the cryostat are summarized, together with the relief-system sizing methodology used to accommodate transient heat loads from dynamic nuclear polarization microwaves and the high-intensity proton beam. Commissioning data from July 2024 confirms that the system satisfies all thermal performance and safety objectives.

Abstract: Nanostructured materials, critical for thermal management in semiconductor devices, exhibit a strong size dependence in thermal transport. Specifically, studying the variation of thermal resistance across grain boundaries is of critical importance in designing effective thermal interface materials for heterogeneous integration. Frequency-domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR)-based techniques can provide thermal resistance mapping at the micrometer length scale. Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has the potential for quantifying local thermal transport with orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution (<100 nm). However, challenges in accurately converting the raw signal to thermal conductivity and accounting for surface sensitivity limit its widespread adoption as a characterization standard for understanding nanoscale heat transport and defect-mediated modulation of thermal properties in nanostructured films. Here, we introduce a circuit-based probe thermal resistance (Rp) calibration technique that is independent of parasitic heat transport pathways; this calibration enables accurate measurement of the heat dissipated from the SThM probe and the resulting tip temperature change to extract the thermal resistance of the film (Rth). Following calibration, SThM achieved sub-100 nm spatial resolution in mapping thermal resistance across a 15 nm-thick Al film deposited by e-beam evaporation on a SiO2 substrate. Finally, the thermal resistance mapping is converted to thermal conductivity using a finite-element-modeling-based calibration approach, where the average of the pixel-level Rth values yields an effective thermal conductivity of 2.87 +/- 0.18 W m^-1 K^-1, in good agreement with published theoretical frameworks describing heat transport in ultrathin Al.

Abstract: We present X-AutoMap, a modular framework for autonomous X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping that enables chemically informed targeting of regions of interest through a correlative feature detection strategy. The system integrates classical computer vision and rule-based logic to identify features based on spatial relationships across multiple elemental maps, rather than relying solely on intensity or morphology. Tight integration with the Bluesky control infrastructure at the NSLS-II Hard X-ray Nanoprobe (HXN) beamline enables real-time, closed-loop scan orchestration. Applied to a chemically heterogeneous urban PM2.5 sample, X-AutoMap reduced high-resolution acquisition time from over 44 hours to approximately 10 hours by targeting compositionally significant features identified from coarse scans. High-resolution results revealed diverse particle types, including fully mixed, partially overlapping, and spatially distinct multi-element structures, demonstrating the ability of the framework to isolate chemically relevant features with minimal user intervention. The framework supports interactive and autonomous modes, operates within hardware constraints via grid-based scanning, and is robust across varying sample conditions. Future extensions will incorporate machine learning and probabilistic sampling to further improve detection sensitivity and scan efficiency. X-AutoMap is currently in active use at HXN and provides a flexible foundation for scalable, intelligent imaging workflows at synchrotron beamlines.

Abstract: Balloon- and space-borne cosmic-ray experiments employ plastic scintillators read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) to achieve picosecond-level time resolutions for triggering and particle identification. The performance of these systems can be affected by temperature variations encountered in flight. In this work, a time-of-flight (TOF) prototype consisting of a BC418 plastic scintillator bar coupled to Onsemi MICROFC-30050 SiPMs was constructed and tested under a controlled thermal environment between -20 and 20$^{\circ}$C. Electrons from a $^{90}\text{Sr}$ source were used as a beam, and a dedicated differential preamplifier and coincidence triggering were implemented to study the detector response. A minimum time resolution of 160ps was achieved at an overvoltage of 3V, remaining stable across the tested temperature range and uniform along the scintillator bar.

Motivation: Improving timing resolution (a critical factor in particle identification) is essential for accurately distinguishing particles in the ALICE detector, especially during heavy-ion and proton-proton experiments at the LHC.

Method: The paper describes the upgrade of ALICE's TOF detector, which included new electronics and processing algorithms. Timing resolution was measured using Run 3 pp collision data with two independent methods, achieving results better than 80 ps.

Result: The upgraded detector achieved excellent timing resolution (better than 80 ps), demonstrating its capability for accurate particle separation in ALICE analyses.

Conclusion: The upgrade of ALICE's TOF detector enhances its PID capabilities, and future optimizations are expected to further improve performance for future runs.

Abstract: Particle identification (PID) is a fundamental aspect of the ALICE detector system, central to its heavy-ion and proton-proton physics programs. Among the different PID strategies, ALICE uses the Time-Of-Flight (TOF) detector to identify particles at intermediate momenta ($0.5 < p_{\rm T} < 4$ GeV/$c$). The ALICE TOF detector performed successfully during the first ten years of LHC operations. During the Long Shutdown 2, many ALICE sub-detectors, including TOF, were upgraded to fully leverage the targeted 50 kHz interaction rate of Pb-Pb collisions, which required the implementation of a continuous readout scheme. The TOF detector electronics were upgraded and refurbished, while processing algorithms for data quality control, reconstruction, calibration, and analysis were rewritten. This paper presents the upgraded TOF detector operation and calibration procedures and its performance in terms of timing resolution, a key factor for particle separation in ALICE analyses. Using 2022 pp collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV from Run 3, the time resolution of the detector was estimated with two independent methods, both yielding consistent results, better than 80 ps. Despite the excellent performance already achieved, further improvements are expected after additional detector commissioning and refined calibration procedures, thus enhancing the ALICE PID capabilities for Run 3 and beyond.

Conclusion: CEPC AHCAL optimized for hardon reconstruction, paving way for precise Higgs measurements and next-gen colliders.

Abstract: The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is a next-generation electron$-$positron collider proposed for the precise measurement of the properties of the Higgs boson. To emphasize boson separation and jet reconstruction, the baseline design of the CEPC detector was guided by the particle flow algorithm (PFA) concept. As one of the calorimeter options, the analogue hadron calorimeter (AHCAL) was proposed. The CEPC AHCAL comprises a 40-layer sandwich structure using steel plates as absorbers and scintillator tiles coupled with silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) as sensitive units. To validate the feasibility of the AHCAL option, a series of studies were conducted to develop a prototype. This AHCAL prototype underwent an electronic test and a cosmic ray test to assess its performance and ensure it was ready for three beam tests performed in 2022 and 2023. The test beam data is currently under analysis, and the results are expected to deepen our understanding of hadron showers, validate the concept of Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA), and ultimately refine the design of the CEPC detector.

Abstract: Drift chambers have long been central to collider tracking, but future machines like a Higgs factory motivate higher granularity and cluster counting for particle ID, posing new data processing challenges. Machine learning (ML) at the "edge", or in cell-level readout, can dramatically reduce the off-detector data rate for high-granularity drift chambers by performing cluster counting at-source. We present machine learning algorithms for cluster counting in real-time readout of future drift chambers. These algorithms outperform traditional derivative-based techniques based on achievable pion-kaon separation. When synthesized to FPGA resources, they can achieve latencies consistent with real-time operation in a future Higgs factory scenario, thus advancing both R&D for future collider detectors as well as hardware-based ML for edge applications in high energy physics.

Abstract: We introduce HAMscope, a compact, snapshot hyperspectral autofluorescence miniscope that enables real-time, label-free molecular imaging in a wide range of biological systems. By integrating a thin polymer diffuser into a widefield miniscope, HAMscope spectrally encodes each frame and employs a probabilistic deep learning framework to reconstruct 30-channel hyperspectral stacks (452 to 703 nm) or directly infer molecular composition maps from single images. A scalable multi-pass U-Net architecture with transformer-based attention and per-pixel uncertainty estimation enables high spatio-spectral fidelity (mean absolute error ~ 0.0048) at video rates. While initially demonstrated in plant systems, including lignin, chlorophyll, and suberin imaging in intact poplar and cork tissues, the platform is readily adaptable to other applications such as neural activity mapping, metabolic profiling, and histopathology. We show that the system generalizes to out-of-distribution tissue types and supports direct molecular mapping without the need for spectral unmixing. HAMscope establishes a general framework for compact, uncertainty-aware spectral imaging that combines minimal optics with advanced deep learning, offering broad utility for real-time biochemical imaging across neuroscience, environmental monitoring, and biomedicine.

Abstract: Objective: Time-domain diffuse optical imaging (DOI) requires accurate forward models for photon propagation in scattering media. However, existing simulators lack comprehensive experimental validation, especially for non-contact configurations with oblique illumination. This study rigorously evaluates three widely used open-source simulators, including MMC, NIRFASTer, and Toast++, using time-resolved experimental data. Approach: All simulations employed a unified mesh and point-source illumination. Virtual source correction was applied to FEM solvers for oblique incidence. A time-resolved DOI system with a 32 $\times$ 32 single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array acquired transmission-mode data from 16 standardized phantoms with varying absorption coefficient $μ_a$ and reduced scattering coefficient $μ_s'$. The simulation results were quantified across five metrics: spatial-domain (SD) precision, time-domain (TD) precision, oblique beam accuracy, computational speed, and mesh-density independence. Results: Among three simulators, MMC achieves superior accuracy in SD and TD metrics, and shows robustness across all optical properties. NIRFASTer and Toast++ demonstrate comparable overall performance. In general, MMC is optimal for accuracy-critical TD-DOI applications, while NIRFASTer and Toast++ suit scenarios prioritizing speed with sufficiently large $μ_s'$. Besides, virtual source correction is essential for non-contact FEM modeling, which reduced average errors by > 34% in large-angle scenarios. Significance: This work provides benchmarked guidelines for simulator selection during the development phase of next-generation TD-DOI systems. Our work represents the first study to systematically validate TD simulators against SPAD array-based data under clinically relevant non-contact conditions, bridging a critical gap in biomedical optical simulation standards.

Abstract: Advanced geometrical nanometrology is critical for process control in semiconductor manufacturing, supporting applications in, e.g., photonic integrated circuits, nanoelectronics, and emerging quantum and optoelectronic technologies. Widefield interferometric approach provide a cost-effective, non-destructive solution for characterizing semiconductor optical waveguides, which are fundamental to nanophotonic devices. This work presents a Bayesian inference framework, implemented using Dynamic Nested Sampling, for estimating geometric parameters - such as width and height - of a semiconductor optical waveguide from a single widefield interferogram. The proposed framework reduces the need of leveraging near field scanning microscopy methods for measurements. The notable advantage is that Bayesian statistics not only provide the estimated parameter values but also quantify the uncertainty of the inference results and the fitness of the used model. The proposed full-field, single-shot interferometric approach, supported by Bayesian-based data analysis, achieves high accuracy and sensitivity - down to successful measurement of 8 nm rib waveguide - while remaining resilient to noise. Thus, the demonstrated methodology provides a cost-effective, robust, and scalable tool for semiconductor fabrication monitoring and process verification, as confirmed by both numerical simulations and experimental validation on optical waveguides. This method contributes to high-precision nanometrology by integrating advanced statistical modeling and inference techniques.

Here, we show how the excitonic decay rates dictate the focusing efficiency of an atomically-thin lens carved directly out of exfoliated monolayer WS2. By isolating the coherent exciton radiation from the incoherent background in the focus of the lens, we obtain a direct measure of the role of exciton radiation in wavefront shaping. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of exciton-phonon scattering by characterizing the focusing efficiency as a function of temperature, demonstrating an increased optical efficiency at cryogenic temperatures. Our results provide valuable insights in the role of excitonic light scattering in 2D nanophotonic devices.

Abstract: Quantum phase imaging enables the analysis of transparent samples with thickness and refractive index variations in scenarios requiring precise measurements under low-light conditions. Recent advances in nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact solutions for quantum light generation and manipulation. Here, we present a compact quantum phase imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. The LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with angularly dispersed, tunable emission, while the Si metasurface employs a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) to differentiate phase and extract phase gradients via spatial quantum correlations. This dual-metasurface enabled combined ghost imaging and all-optical scanning protocols with quantum light achieves phase gradient reconstruction without mechanical tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup. In addition, theoretically, it is confirmed that the resolution of the system is primarily limited by the quality factor of the compact design, leveraging nonlocal resonances and quantum correlations, establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR. This work highlights the application of metasurface in both generating and detecting quantum states.

Abstract: In this article, we present novel and effective methods for reducing chromatic aberrations in
  cemented lens systems. We derive an analytical solution coined the pentachromat, which
  corrects five distinct colors. This method can naturally be extended to accommodate
  an arbitrary number of lenses and to correct for a customized selection of spectral lines.
  Since correcting for specific rays rather than the entire residual spectrum
  can overconstrain the system, we introduce a variational formulation. This approach
  tames the residual spectrum by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional
  designs like the superachromat, while giving theoretical guarantees to reach the
  optimal solutions.
  Furthermore, this innovative methodology opens up previously uncharted design
  possibilities, such as multiple-focal-length achromatic systems. This allows for the
  selection of specific optical powers paired with desired bandwidths, enabling the
  design of highly specialized and tailored optical systems.
  Finally, we couple our variational framework with a combinatorial search, allowing to
  find the type of glasses and their geometry such that it reaches the best residual spectrum
  over an available catalogue.

Abstract: Spectrally selective absorbers that maximize solar absorption and minimize thermal radiation loss are crucial for efficient solar thermal energy harvesting. However, limitations imposed by the intrinsic properties of conventional materials hinder the fabrication of interference-based absorbers with desired optical properties. Herein, a high-performance solar absorber with a Dallenbach-type dielectric-metal tandem structure was fabricated using an ultrathin, subquarter-wavelength thickness single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) membrane with tailored optical spectra as the absorbing layer. By mixing multiple SWCNT chiral structures, the optical response of the absorbing layer was tailored to approximate a theoretical complex refractive index spectrum of dielectrics; therefore enabling high solar absorptance, low infrared emittance, and a low angular dependence with a simple bilayer structure. The fabricated proof-of-concept 1 cm$^2$ absorber exhibited excellent spectral selectivity (solar absorptance/infrared emittance of 0.84/0.03), and an equilibrium temperature of $\approx 190^\circ$C ($270^\circ$C) under nonconcentrated ($2\times$ concentrated) sunlight, considerably outperformed a blackbody-like absorber. This study presents a high-performance solar absorber with a simple planar structure and proposes a concept of designing dielectric with the desired optical properties by mixing various types of structure-sorted SWCNTs.

Abstract: Ultraprecision machining offers a powerful route to dispersion control in crystalline microresonators, allowing the design of waveguide geometries for tailoring the spectrum of microresonator frequency combs. By precisely designing the geometry, both group-velocity and higher-order dispersions can be engineered across a broad wavelength range. However, despite their promising features, such advantages have remained largely unexplored due to fabrication challenges. Here, we demonstrate that resonators shaped by ultrapecision machining exhibit high precision and strongly suppressed spatial mode interactions, facilitating the generation of smooth dissipative Kerr soliton combs and broadband frequency combs beyond the telecommunication C-band. These results underscore the effectiveness of precision geometry control for realizing coherent and broadband microcombs on crystalline photonic platforms.

Abstract: Enhanced beam shifts mediated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at metal-dielectric interfaces have been widely investigated. However, research on the associated Imbert-Fedorov or spin Hall shifts, driven by the spin-orbit interaction of structured light in structured interfaces, has been comparatively scarce and limited. We explore the reflection characteristics of generic polarized, non-paraxial light beams from a corrugated silver (Ag) interface, since surface corrugation can naturally couple the incident radiation modes to the surface excitations. In the vicinity of SPR, we report a significant enhancement in the beam shifts, attributed to the rapid variation of the specular reflection coefficient near its minima, resulting in amplified weak values. By carefully selecting the incident and projected polarization states of the beam, we achieve a pronounced spatial spin Hall effect. We also investigate vortex-induced beam shifts within this resonant regime, revealing distinctive signatures of the angular momentum of the beam. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis is also presented for the conical diffraction geometry, wherein polarization conversions between p and s states are fully incorporated. Our work establishes the interplay of the spin-orbit interaction of light and the weak measurement approach as an important methodology in amplifying SPR effects, which may have important connotations in applications involving light at nanoscales.

Abstract: Fast, volumetric imaging that integrates multiple imaging modalities is essential for probing dynamic, heterogeneous soft and biological matter. Here, we present the M3Scope, a simple yet versatile multiplane microscope that extends widefield detection with a modular multimode cube to enable dual color fluorescence, polarization-resolved, and correlative brightfield fluorescence imaging while (i) preserving simultaneous 3D acquisition at high frame rates (100 fps) and (ii) requiring minimal realignment. We demonstrate its potential by investigating polymer dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales. In an acrylamide type polymerizing network, dual color tracking of 100 nm and 300 nm fluorescent probes revealed size dependent viscosities diverging from 15 mPa.s to 40 mPa.s after gelation. Polarization resolved rotational tracking of gold bipyramids yielded viscosities within 10 percent of theoretical values in 80 to 95 percent glycerol and remained accurate in the high-viscosity regime (bigger than 400 mPa.s) where translational motion is undetectable. Fluorescence brightfield imaging correlated structural changes during poly(isopropyl acrylamide) (pNIPAM) phase separation as well as variations in tracer diffusivity, linking morphology and dynamics in 3D. Taken together, these results show that the M3Scope delivers high speed volumetric imaging with flexible modality switching, providing a powerful platform for studying dynamic, heterogeneous systems across disciplines, from polymer physics to cell mechanobiology.

Abstract: Curved and conformal optics offer significant advantages by unlocking additional geometric degrees of freedom for optical design. These capabilities enable enhanced optical performance and are essential for meeting non-optical constraints, such as those imposed by ergonomics, aerodynamics, or wearability. However, existing fabrication techniques such as direct electron or laser beam writing on curved substrates, and soft-stamp-based transfer or nanoimprint lithography suffer from limitations in scalability, yield, geometry control, and alignment accuracy. Here, we present a scalable fabrication strategy for curved and conformal metasurface optics leveraging thermoforming, an industry-standard, high-throughput manufacturing process widely used for shaping thermoplastics. Our approach uniquely enables wafer-scale production of highly curved metasurface optics, achieving sub-millimeter radii of curvature and micron-level alignment precision. To guide the design and fabrication process, we developed a thermorheological model that accurately predicts and compensates for the large strains induced during thermoforming. This allows for precise control of metasurface geometry and preservation of optical function, yielding devices with diffraction-limited performance. As a demonstration, we implemented an artificial compound eye comprising freeform micro-metalens arrays. Compared to traditional micro-optical counterparts, the device exhibits an expanded field of view, reduced aberrations, and improved uniformity, highlighting the potential of thermoformed metasurfaces for next-generation optical systems.

TL;DR: OM (Optical Matter) can be rotated by transferring spin angular momentum (SAM) from chiral light. This has potential applications in optical micromachines, plasmofluidics, and soft robotics. The research explores dynamic states and jamming transitions in such systems. Experiments and simulations show that while assemblies with hexagonal or triangular symmetry efficiently harness SAM, growth of the assembly leads to loss of symmetry and reduced torque, causing rotational jamming. This behavior is analogous to rotational jamming transitions, offering new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and studying jamming transitions in a novel platform.

Result: Assemblies with specific structural symmetry efficiently transfer SAM, but growth leads to reduced symmetry and loss of torque, causing rotational jamming.

Conclusion: OM's rotational behavior is strongly influenced by its structural symmetry. Jamming transitions are analogous to rotational arrest, providing new insights for controlling chiral light-matter interactions and studying jamming in a novel platform for research.

Abstract: Optical matter (OM), composed of optically bound metallic particles, can be rotated by transferring the spin angular momentum (SAM) of chiral light to the assembly. Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions.

Abstract: Time-modulated media offer powerful opportunities for controlling light, yet extending such concepts to optical frequencies has remained challenging. Here we propose a different route to photonic spacetime crystals based on modulation of the anomalous velocity in low-symmetry conductors, particularly Weyl semimetals. We show that when driven by a strong optical pump, the anomalous velocity of Bloch electrons induces an ultrafast spacetime modulation that propagates with a superluminal phase velocity relative to the dielectric background. This self-induced modulation enables unidirectional light transport below the optical gap and, near the epsilon-near-zero point, gives rise to collective parametric resonance and stimulated emission of volume plasmons. These findings identify Weyl semimetals as a promising platform for realizing optical spacetime crystals and open a pathway toward active and nonreciprocal photonic systems governed by quantum geometric effects.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) microscope (OCM) uses a high-numerical-aperture objective to achieve cellular-level lateral resolution. However, its practical imaging depth range is limited by the depth of focus (DOF). Although computational refocusing can potentially provide sharp images outside the DOF, signal reduction by the confocal effect still limits the imaging depth in practice in point-scanning OCT. In addition, standard OCT cannot visualize intra-tissue activities. To overcome these limitations, we demonstrated a spatially coherent full-field OCM (SC-FFOCM) with computational refocusing. In addition, a repetitive acquisition protocol was designed to visualize intra-tissue activities (i.e., dynamic OCT imaging). The in-focus lateral resolution is 1.4 um, and the axial resolution is 6.5 um (in air) at full-width at half-maximum intensity. Three-dimensional structure and the dynamic OCT imaging using SC-FFOCM with computational refocusing was applied to human breast adenocarcinoma spheroids (MCF-7 cell line). Volumetric dynamic imaging with cellular-level lateral resolution was demonstrated over the full depth of the spheroid.

Abstract: Harnessing a beam of slow free electrons in artificial photonic structures offers a powerful, tunable platform for generating nonclassical light without the need for heavy physical equipment. Here we present a theory of nonclassical lasing, demonstrating how incoherent electrons in photonic crystal cavities can coherently emit photons through collective dynamics. When photon emission rate exceeds cavity losses, nonclassical lasing with sub-Poissonian photon statistics emerges, driven by multi-photon Rabi oscillations. At specific coupling strengths, quantum state trapping effect emerges, producing high-fidelity Fock states at room temperature (e.g. nearly 90%-fidelity of four photon Fock state). Notably, the frequency of the emitted photons can be readily tuned via the velocity of the injected electrons to match cavity modes. This approach supports photonic integration and offers a scalable, energy-efficient platform for room-temperature quantum light sources and advanced studies in quantum electrodynamics.

Abstract: Geometric phases play an enormous role in optics and are generally associated with the evolution of light's polarization state on the Poincaré sphere, or its spin on the sphere of spin directions. Here we put forward a new kind of optical geometric phase that appears exclusively in nonparaxial light, resulting from cyclic changes to the relative amplitude and phase between the electric and magnetic fields. This phase is naturally represented on a recently introduced `electric-magnetic' sphere.

Abstract: Ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy provides unique access to the structural dynamics of molecules, spin-valley relaxation in semiconductors, and the non-equilibrium optical response of chiral nanophotonic systems. Yet, because chiral signals are intrinsically weak and time-resolved spectroscopy probes small photoinduced changes, transient chiro-optical responses are often difficult to isolate from parasitic achiral contributions. Here, we introduce a broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy technique that integrates a birefringent common-path interferometer with an optical polarization bridge to sensitively detect photoinduced changes in the polarization state of light. Phase-sensitive self-heterodyned detection enables simultaneous measurement of transient circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion across a broad spectral range with ultrafast temporal resolution. Balanced detection suppresses excess laser noise, enabling exceptional sensitivity (<50 $μ$deg) close to shot-noise limit. We demonstrate this approach on an array of gold nano-helicoids, supported by a full-wave time-resolved model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of plasmonic non-equilibrium carriers and their associated optical nonlinearities. The model traces the system's transient chiro-optical response back to photoinduced modulations of the electric-magnetic dipole interaction in the nano-helicoid, elucidating the connection of near- and far-field dynamics in the non-equilibrium regime. We further investigate spin excitation, thermalization, and relaxation in a lead halide perovskite, establishing a novel approach to broadband time-resolved Faraday rotation. The simplicity, sensitivity, and wide applicability of this detection scheme provide a powerful platform for broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy, opening new opportunities in biochemistry, solid-state physics, and nanophotonics.

TL;DR: A framework based on Mamba is proposed to better understand molecular ground-state conformation by decomposing molecular structures into three components and employing multi-perspective analysis. MPSU-Mamba outperforms existing methods on QM9 and Molecule3D datasets and shows robustness even with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the understanding of molecular structures is crucial for predicting their ground-state conformations and related properties, which has implications in various scientific fields.

Method: The framework MPSU-Mamba is designed by decomposing molecular structures into atom types, positions, and connections, and then applying Mamba's multi-perspective analysis. The method also employs three dedicated scanning strategies for complex molecules and a bright-channel guided mechanism to identify critical conformation information.

Result: Experimental results show that MPSU-Mamba significantly outperforms existing methods on QM9 and Molecule3D datasets. Additionally, it demonstrates robustness even when trained with limited samples.

Conclusion: MPSU-Mamba provides a generic and efficient framework for molecular structure analysis using Mamba, enhancing the understanding of molecular ground-state conformation.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of molecular structures is important for the prediction of molecular ground-state conformation involving property information. Meanwhile, state space model (e.g., Mamba) has recently emerged as a promising mechanism for long sequence modeling and has achieved remarkable results in various language and vision tasks. However, towards molecular ground-state conformation prediction, exploiting Mamba to understand molecular structure is underexplored. To this end, we strive to design a generic and efficient framework with Mamba to capture critical components. In general, molecular structure could be considered to consist of three elements, i.e., atom types, atom positions, and connections between atoms. Thus, considering the three elements, an approach of Mamba-driven multi-perspective structural understanding (MPSU-Mamba) is proposed to localize molecular ground-state conformation. Particularly, for complex and diverse molecules, three different kinds of dedicated scanning strategies are explored to construct a comprehensive perception of corresponding molecular structures. And a bright-channel guided mechanism is defined to discriminate the critical conformation-related atom information. Experimental results on QM9 and Molecule3D datasets indicate that MPSU-Mamba significantly outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, we observe that for the case of few training samples, MPSU-Mamba still achieves superior performance, demonstrating that our method is indeed beneficial for understanding molecular structures.

Abstract: Gas hydrates are crystalline compounds formed when water molecules encapsulate guest gas molecules under high pressure and low temperatures. They have gained significant interest due to their potential as alternative energy resources and their applications in gas storage, transportation, and carbon sequestration. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing their formation, especially the influence of gas bubbles, remain poorly understood. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine how methane nanobubble size modulates hydrate formation in supercooled water. Nanobubbles of different sizes are generated by modulating the methane concentration in a methane-water mixture during equilibration under high-temperature and low-pressure conditions, followed by quenching to low temperature and high pressure to induce gas hydrate nucleation and subsequent growth. The simulations reveal a strong correlation between nanobubble size and the extent of hydrate formation. Specifically, the extent of hydrate formation increases with bubble size in the small-to-intermediate regime. However, beyond a critical bubble size threshold, the hydrate formation efficiency declines. The work provides new molecular-level insight into how nanobubble size modulates gas hydrate nucleation and growth dynamics.

*Peining Zhang,Jinbo Bi,Minghu Song*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Diffusion models excel in chemical accuracy but are slow to sample, while flow models are fast but less accurate. VEDA integrates variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to achieve both accuracy and efficiency, performing as well as flow models with fewer steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the efficiency and accuracy of generating 3D molecular structures is crucial for computational chemistry and drug design.

Method: VEDA combines variance-exploding diffusion with simulated annealing for noise injection, uses a preconditioning scheme to balance network objectives, and employs a new scheduler for stable sampling.

Result: VEDA matches flow models' efficiency on datasets QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS, achieving higher valency stability and lower relaxation energy than baseline models.

Conclusion: Integrating variance-exploding diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve chemical accuracy with computational efficiency through novel noise injection and sampling strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for 3D molecular generation, but face a fundamental trade-off between sampling efficiency and conformational accuracy. While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow. Our framework demonstrates that principled integration of VE diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 研究结论指出，轨道优化是提高量子计算友好型相关方法用于NMR光谱预测中核自旋自旋耦合常数精度的关键因素。

Abstract: We present a quantum linear response (qLR) approach within an active-space framework for computing indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling constants, a key ingredient in NMR spectra predictions. The method employs the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz and its orbital-optimized variant (ooUCC), both suitable for quantum computing implementations, to evaluate spin-spin coupling constants via qLR. Test calculations on five small molecules are compared with CASCI, CASSCF, and conventional CCSD results. qLR with UCC/ooUCC yields spin-spin coupling constants comparable to classical methods. We further examine the role of orbital optimization and find that ooUCC markedly affects the computed couplings; orbital-optimized results show better agreement with CCSD. These findings indicate that orbital optimization is important for accurate NMR coupling predictions within quantum-computing-friendly correlated methods.

TL;DR: Solvaformer is a geometric-aware graph transformer for predicting small molecule solubility and solvation free energy, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and predicting solubility is crucial for chemical synthesis and process optimization.

Method: Solvaformer uses SE(3)-equivariant attention for intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, trained in a multi-task setting on quantum mechanical and experimental data.

Result: Solvaformer achieves state-of-the-art performance, with interpretable molecule-level attributions.

Conclusion: This tool offers an accurate and interpretable approach for solution-phase property prediction through integration of geometric inductive biases and mixed datasets.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of small molecule solubility using material-sparing approaches is critical for accelerating synthesis and process optimization, yet experimental measurement is costly and many learning approaches either depend on quantumderived descriptors or offer limited interpretability. We introduce Solvaformer, a geometry-aware graph transformer that models solutions as multiple molecules with independent SE(3) symmetries. The architecture combines intramolecular SE(3)-equivariant attention with intermolecular scalar attention, enabling cross-molecular communication without imposing spurious relative geometry. We train Solvaformer in a multi-task setting to predict both solubility (log S) and solvation free energy, using an alternating-batch regimen that trains on quantum-mechanical data (CombiSolv-QM) and on experimental measurements (BigSolDB 2.0). Solvaformer attains the strongest overall performance among the learned models and approaches a DFT-assisted gradient-boosting baseline, while outperforming an EquiformerV2 ablation and sequence-based alternatives. In addition, token-level attention produces chemically coherent attributions: case studies recover known intra- vs. inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding patterns that govern solubility differences in positional isomers. Taken together, Solvaformer provides an accurate, scalable, and interpretable approach to solution-phase property prediction by uniting geometric inductive bias with a mixed dataset training strategy on complementary computational and experimental data.

Abstract: We formulate a time-dependent density functional theory for the coupled dynamics of electrons and nuclei that goes beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. We prove that the time-dependent marginal nuclear probability density $|χ({\bdu R},t)|^2$, the conditional electronic density $n_{\bdu R}(\br,t)$, and the current density $\bm J_{\bdu R}(\br,t)$ are sufficient to uniquely determine the full time-evolving electron-nuclear wave function, and thus the dynamics of all observables. Moreover, we propose a time-dependent Kohn-Sham scheme which reproduces the exact conditional electronic density and current density and the exact N-body nuclear density. The remaining task is to look for functional approximations for the Kohn-Sham exchange-correlation scalar and vector potentials. Using a model driven proton transfer system, we numerically demonstrate that the adiabatic extension of a beyond-BO ground state functional captures the dominant nonadiabatic effects in the regime of slow driving.

Abstract: The multiscale model combining the multiconfigurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) method with the fully atomistic polarizable Fluctuating Charges (FQ) force field (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 9954-9967) is here extended to the calculation of analytical nuclear gradients. The gradients are derived from first principles, implemented in the OpenMolcas package, and validated against numerical references. The resulting MCSCF/FQ nuclear gradients are employed to simulate vibronic absorption spectra of aromatic molecules in aqueous solution, namely benzene and phenol. By integrating this approach with molecular dynamics simulations, both solute conformational flexibility and the dynamical aspects of solvation are properly captured. The computed spectra reproduce experimental profiles and relative band intensities with remarkable accuracy, demonstrating the capability of the MCSCF/FQ model to simultaneously describe the multireference character of the solute and its interaction with the solvent environment.

Abstract: The electronic wavefunction is at the heart of physical phenomena, defining the frontiers of quantum materials research. While the amplitude of the electron wavefunction in crystals can be measured with state-of-the-art probes in unprecedented resolution, its phase has remained largely inaccessible, obscuring rich electronic information. Here we develop a quantum-path electron interferometer based on time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that enables the reconstruction of the phase of electronic states in quantum materials - with energy and momentum resolution. We demonstrate the scheme by resolving the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a prototypical topological insulator and observe a resonance-associated phase jump as well as a momentum and phase synchronized inversion revealing the helicity of the Dirac cone. We show the interferometer can be optically controlled by the polarization of the absorbed light, allowing a differential measurement of the phase - a crucial component for extracting phase information from an interferogram. This photo-electron-interferometer is a purely experimental scheme and does not rely on any specific theoretical model. It can be extended to a variety of materials, opening up the phase dimension in quantum materials research.

Abstract: Superdiffusion is an anomalous transport behavior. Recently, a new mechanism, termed the ``nodal mechanism," has been proposed to induce superdiffusion in quantum models. However, existing realizations of the nodal mechanism have so far been proposed on fine-tuned, artificial Hamiltonians, posing a significant challenge for experimental observation. In this work, we propose a broad class of models for generating superdiffusion potentially realizable in condensed matter systems across different spatial dimensions. A robust nodal structure emerges from the hybridization between the itinerant electrons and the local impurity orbitals, protected by the intrinsic symmetry and topology of the electronic band. We derive a universal scaling law for the conductance, $G \sim L^{-γ}$, revealing how the exponent is dictated by the dimensionality of the nodal structure ($D_{\text{node}}$) and its order $n$, and the dimensionality of the system $(D)$ at high temperatures or that of the Fermi surface ($D^F$) at low temperatures. Through numerical simulations, we validate these scaling relations at zero temperature for various models, including those based on graphene and multi-Weyl semimetals, finding excellent agreement between our theory and the computed exponents. Beyond the scaling of conductance, our framework predicts a suite of experimentally verifiable signatures, notably a new mechanism for linear-in-temperature resistivity ($ρ\sim T$) and a divergent low-frequency optical conductivity ($σ(ω) \sim ω^{γ-1}$), establishing a practical route to discovering and engineering anomalous transport in quantum materials.

Conclusion: 该研究强调了正确处理自能的重要性，结果表明能级 broadenings可能干扰Floquet相的观察，尤其是Majorana π模子的观察。

Abstract: We bring forward a Green function approach for the prediction of Floquet topological phases in driven superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. Although it is common to treat the superconducting component as a mere Cooper-pair reservoir, it was recently pointed out that such an approximation breaks down in the presence of driving, due to the emergence of level broadening. Here, we go beyond these recent works and prescribe how to construct the Floquet topological invariants for such driven hybrids. Specifically, we propose to first obtain the midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and, subsequently, read out the respective level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part of the self-energy onto the quasi-energy eigenvectors. We exemplify our approach for a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field. Using our method, we obtain the Floquet band structure, the respective level broadenings, and the topological invariants. Our analysis reinforces the need to properly account for the self-energy, and corroborates that broadening effects can hinder the observation of the Floquet topological phases and especially of those harboring Majorana $π$ modes.

Motivation: Understanding and predicting topological phase transitions, especially in aperiodic systems, is essential for advancing quantum materials research, with implications for quantum computing and novel electronics.

Method: Developed nonlocal quantum geometric indicators to analyze correlations across materials, observed distinct spatial signatures near topological transitions, and compared results within the Altland-Zirnbauer classification to discern signatures associated with different transitions.

Result: The nonlocal quantum geometric indicators exhibited unique spatial patterns linked to specific topological transitions, enabling their use as a refined tool to evaluate topological stability within classes.

Conclusion: This work introduces a versatile method to study topological phase transitions using nonlocal quantum geometric indicators, enhancing our ability to predict and characterize their stability in a variety of materials.

Abstract: Spatially resolved local quantum geometric markers play a crucial role in the diagnosis of topological phases without long-range translational symmetry, including amorphous systems. Here, we focus on the nonlocality of such markers. We demonstrate that they behave as correlation functions independently of the material's structure, showing sharp variations in the vicinity of topological transitions and exhibiting a unique pattern in real space for each transition. Notably, we find that, even within the same Altland-Zirnbauer class, distinct topological transitions generate qualitatively different spatial signatures, enabling a refined, class-internal probe of topological stability. As such, nonlocal quantum geometric indicators provide a more efficient and versatile tool to understand and predict the stability of topological phase transitions.

Abstract: The performance and scalability of two-dimensional (2D) field-effect transistors (FETs) are strongly influenced by geometry-defined electrostatics. In most 2D FET studies, the gate overlaps with the source and drain electrodes, allowing the gate potential to modulate the 2D semiconductor underneath the electrodes and ultimately effect carrier transport at the metal-semiconductor interface - a phenomenon known as contact gating. Here, a symmetric dual-gate structure with independently addressable back and top gates is employed to elucidate the impact of contact gating on a monolayer MoS2 channel. Unlike previous studies of contact gating, this symmetric structure enables quantification of the phenomena through a contact gating factor, revealing a 2x enhancement in on-state performance in long-channel devices. At scaled dimensions (50 nm channel and 30 nm contact length), the influence of contact gating becomes amplified, yielding a 5x increase in on-state performance and a 70% reduction in transfer length when contact gating is present. Since many reported record-performance 2D FETs employ back-gate geometries that inherently include contact gating, these results establish contact gating as a critical and previously underappreciated determinant of device performance in the 2D FET landscape.

Result: The study found clear Shapiro steps in the differential resistance when SAWs were applied, which are distinct from those induced by an rf current. These results highlight the role of strain induced by SAWs in CDW materials.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that strain can significantly influence CDW dynamics in 2D materials, opening up possibilities for strain-induced electronic applications.

Abstract: Recent development in nanotechnology has enabled us to investigate the dynamic properties of van der Waals materials on a piezoelectric substrate. Here we report on the dynamics of charge density wave (CDW) in NbSe$_{3}$ nanowires induced by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). Clear peaks in the differential resistance were observed at the resonant frequency of the SAW device. These peaks known as Shapiro steps are typically observed by applying an rf current to NbSe$_{3}$ nanowires. We found that the Shapiro steps induced by SAWs show several distinct features from the ones induced by an rf current. Our detailed study revealed that a strain induced by SAWs plays a significant role in the Shapiro steps. The result clearly demonstrates the importance of the strain in CDW materials and paves the way for strain-induced device applications.

Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), when exposed to a suitably applied Zeeman field, exhibit one-dimensional helical channels with a spin orientation locked to the propagation direction within the magnetic energy gap. Here, by adopting a scattering-matrix approach applied to a tight-binding model of the NW, we demonstrate that the thermoelectric (TE) properties can be widely controlled by tuning the misalignment angle $φ$ between the spin-orbit directions of two NW segments. In particular, when the RSOC vectors are antiparallel (Dirac paradox configuration) we predict a significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, and a strong enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and the $ZT$ figure of merit. We also show that the Zeeman gap determines the optimal energy window for doping and temperatures. These results suggest that controlling the spin-orbit field direction, which can be achieved with suitably applied wrap gates, is a promising alternative for tuning and optimizing the TE response in quantum-coherent semiconducting NW devices.

Abstract: The excitation and detection of propagating spin waves with lithographed nanoantennas underpin both classical magnonic circuits and emerging quantum technologies. Here, we establish a framework for all-electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy (AEPSWS) that links realistic electromagnetic drive fields to micromagnetic dynamics. Using finite-element (FE) simulations, we compute the full vector near-field of electrical impedance-matched, tapered coplanar and stripline antennas and import this distribution into finite-difference (FD) micromagnetic solvers. This approach captures the antenna-limited wave-vector spectrum and the component-selective driving fields (perpendicular to the static magnetisation) that simplified uniform-field models cannot. From this coupling, we derive how realistic current return paths and tapering shapes, k-weighting functions, for Damon-Eshbach surface spin waves in yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) films are, for millimetre-scale matched CPWs and linear tapers down to nanometre-scale antennas. Validation against experimental AEPSWS on a $48\,nm$ YIG film shows quantitative agreement in dispersion ridges, group velocities, and spectral peak positions, establishing that the antenna acts as a tunable k-space filter. These results provide actionable design rules for on-chip magnonic transducers, with immediate relevance for low-power operation regimes and prospective applications in quantum magnonics.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) moiré superlattices have provided a powerful knob to engineer a plethora of new quantum states. However, extending such moiré engineering to one-dimensional (1D) vdW systems has remained challenging. Here we report the moiré-engineered electronic insulating states in a new 1D moiré superlattice, by crystallographically aligning an armchair single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) to 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Remarkably, we observe the emergence of pronounced insulating states at charge neutrality point (CNP), full and half moiré fillings in lattice-aligned armchair SWNT/hBN heterostructures by low-temperature electrical transport measurements. In strong contrast, armchair SWNT devices without hBN alignment do not show any of these insulating behaviors, providing compelling evidence for the significant 1D moiré effect. Our density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding calculations reveal that synergetic nanotube partial flattening and in-plane lattice reconstruction at 1D moiré interface expand the most stable AB' stacking regions (carbon on top of boron) and open sizable band gaps at both CNP and full moiré fillings at the single-particle level. Our one-body theory predicts no band gaps at half moiré fillings, suggesting that electron correlation and/or electron-phonon interaction may give rise to these emergent insulating behaviors in our 1D moiré systems. Our work establishes a new and definite moiré engineering route for 1D vdW materials and opens an exciting avenue for exploring interaction-induced quantum phases in 1D.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the presence of long-range coherence in free radical materials above their phase transition, using magnon spectroscopy to observe paramagnon-polaritons in a highly dynamic organic material with applications in spintronics and quantum technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to explore and utilize free radicals in organic electronics and spintronics, leveraging their unique magnetic properties in high-dimensional dynamic networks.

Method: The research employs magnon spectroscopy, specifically using all-electrical spin-wave generation and supersonic group velocities exceeding 100 km/s, to study the propagation of paramagnons in 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl above the Néel temperature.

Result: The experiment successfully observes coherently excited low-energy paramagnon-polaritons at up to 23 GHz, propagating over 8 mm at supersonic velocities, confirming the existence of long-range order in the paramagnetic phase of the material.

Conclusion: The findings not only validate theoretical predictions about magnon behavior but also pave the way for organic spintronic devices and quantum technologies by integrating paramagnetic properties with organic material chemistry.

Abstract: Materials are commonly distinguished by their magnetic response into diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and magnetically ordered (ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnetic) phases. Diamagnets and paramagnets lack spontaneous long-range order, whereas ordered magnets develop such order below their Curie or Néel temperature and support single spin-wave excitations (magnons). Magnons have found applications in radio-frequency technologies and computation, magneto-optics, and foundational quantum experiments. Above the Curie/Néel temperature, long-range order is lost and the material transitions to a paramagnetic phase, with localised spin alignment in small patches, producing paramagnons with only short-range propagation. Here we show that long-range coherence is preserved in the organic free radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl above the Néel temperature using all-electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy in external magnetic fields. We observe coherently excited low-energy paramagnon-polaritons up to $\mathbf{23\,\mathrm{GHz}}$ , propagating over $\mathbf{8\,\mathrm{mm}}$ at supersonic group velocities exceeding $\mathbf{100\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}}$. Using free radicals as magnon carriers integrates organic materials with spintronics and opens the way to organic electronics, dense information storage, and quantum technologies.

Conclusion: 该系统中的自旋-轨道交叉导致复杂的电子态结构和显著的导电特性变化，为未来研究自旋控制的电子态和导电性质提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We study the magnetotransport properties of a two-dimensional electronic system with unconventional Rashba spin-orbit coupling in which the system is described by a pair of chiral spin texture in each spin branch, and the chirality is opposite in two spin branches. We obtain the Landau levels analytically and find that intra-spin and/or inter-spin Landau level crossing occurs. We compute the longitudinal conductivity and quantum Hall conductivity using the Kubo formalism based on linear response theory. We find that the usual Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation in longitudinal conductivity appears that can be made purely spin polarized by adjusting the Fermi level suitably. We observe a beating pattern in the Shubnikov-de Hass oscillation in the intra-spin branches, which arises due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to two bands in each spin branch. This is contrary to the conventional Rashba system, where such beating is due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to the two spin-branches. On the other hand, we note that quantum-Hall conductivity exhibits usual quantization in units of $e^2/h$ corresponding to each spin dependent Landau level. However, the Landau level crossing gives rise to the double jump in the Hall conductivity if the Fermi level is placed precisely at the crossing point.

Abstract: The measurements of Hanle and polarization recovery effects for localized charge carriers are the basic tools for determining parameters of the spin dynamics, such as strength of the hyperfine interaction, for example, in quantum dots. We describe the dependence of the spin polarization of localized electrons on transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields taking into account the interplay between electron hopping and measurement back action. We show that these two have a qualitatively similar effect in the Faraday geometry, but compete in the Voigt geometry. This allows one to describe a broad range of the experimental results and study the fundamental effects of quantum measurements.

Abstract: Point defects or impurities can give rise to sharp local modifications in the structure and electronic properties of two-dimensional metals, serving as an intriguing atomic-level solid-state model for both fundamental and application research. In this work, we investigated atomic-scale defects in a two-dimensional silver monolayer intercalated at the interface between epitaxial graphene and SiC using a scanning tunneling microscope. Distinct dark and bright defects are identified as in-plane vacancies and substitutional impurities within the silver monolayer, each hosting a localized electronic state induced solely by the defect. Remarkably, under excitation of tunneling electrons assisted by a negative bias voltage, the defects can hop inelastically which is reminiscent of the hydrogen switching in the cavity of an organic molecule. The hopping can be reversibly controlled by the scanning tunneling microscope tip, allowing the defects to function as atomic-scale two-level conductance switches. Defect hopping further allows us to gain a deeper understanding of their origins and the relationship between dark and bright defect species. This study constitutes a pathway toward understanding and controlling defects in two-dimensional metals with atomic precision, revealing previously unexplored dynamic behavior with potential applications in nanoelectronics.

### [161] [Exploring the Role of Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction in Write Error Rate Anomalies of Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Tunnel Junctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10437)
*Prosenjit Das,Md Mahadi Rajib,Jayasimha Atulasimha*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper investigates the 'ballooning effect' in STT-MRAM, where write error rates unexpectedly increase with STT current under certain conditions. They use micromagnetic simulations to show that interfacial DMI (DMI) causes incoherent magnetization reversal, prolongs switching times, and leads to incomplete reversal, resulting in the observed anomalies. Larger DMI values enhance these effects, and longer pulses help the system stabilize. The findings suggest that interfacial DMI could play a role in the ballooning effect and imply that interfacial engineering could improve the reliability of next-generation STT-MRAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory technologies, especially STT-MRAM, face reliability challenges linked to high-speed operations and switching behaviors. This paper focuses on the 'ballooning effect,' an anomaly where write error rates (WER) increase non-monotonically with STT current, threatening the performance and reliability of spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory (STT-MRAM).

Method: The paper employs micromagnetic simulations of 20 nm and 50 nm magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) to systematically investigate the role of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on the WER anomaly. Through these simulations, they demonstrate that DMI induces incoherent magnetization reversal, extends switching times, and creates intermediate multidomain states resulting in incomplete reversal. At higher DMI values, these states persist even under large switching current densities, mimicking experimentally reported balloon-like anomalies. Conversely, longer pulses enable the system to stabilize, mitigating these effects.

Result: The study reveals that interfacial DMI can contribute to the 'ballooning effect' in STT-MRAM. By extending simulation methods to incorporate DMI, the researchers provide insights into the mechanisms behind this anomaly. The findings highlight the potential of interfacial engineering as a strategy to enhance the reliability of next-generation STT-MRAM devices.

Conclusion: In summary, this paper identifies the interplay between interfacial DMI and the 'ballooning effect' in STT-MRAM, offering a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The results suggest that interfacial engineering could be a promising approach to address the reliability challenges associated with STT-MRAM, paving the way for its use in high-performance memory applications.

Abstract: The performance and reliability of spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory (STT-MRAM) can be compromised by anomalous switching behavior, especially during high-speed operations. One such anomaly, known as the "ballooning effect" is characterized by an unexpected non-monotonic increase in the write error rate (WER) with increase in STT current at specific current pulse durations. In this study, we systematically investigate the role of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on such WER anomaly using micromagnetic simulations of 20 nm and 50 nm magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). We show that DMI promotes incoherent magnetization reversal, prolongs the switching time and creates intermediate multidomain states that result in incomplete reversal. At high DMI values, these states persist even under large switching current densities, reproducing ballooning-like anomalies reported experimentally. In contrast, longer pulses overcome these effects by allowing the system sufficient time to reach a stable state. Our findings show that interfacial DMI can play a role in the ballooning effect and point to interfacial engineering as a practical strategy for improving the reliability of next-generation STT-MRAM.

Abstract: Topologically secure spin configurations, such as skyrmions and bimerons, offer a compelling alternative to conventional magnetic domains, potentially enabling high-density, low-power spintronic devices. These pseudo-particles, characterized by their swirling spin textures and nontrivial topological charges, are prevalent and notably influence their electronic, magnetic, and mechanical traits. This paper provides an in-depth overview of the interaction between a screw dislocation within a distorted magnetic lattice, exploring possible coupling mechanisms and establishing a promising link between two disparate topics in materials science: topological magnetism and topological elasticity. We first provide a classical analysis of skyrmion motion that reveals the dislocations as shallow traps on the magnetic texture. Afterwards, we provide an analysis of the quantized motion of the skyrmion and identify its quantum states. We conclude by illustrating how the ideas in our paper can be implemented in simple yet compelling devices based on the shallow traps from an array of dislocations acting as frets in a race-track, controlling the motion with a low current activation mechanism.

Motivation: The motivation seems to stem from the desire to understand the relationship between material symmetry and nonlinear optical properties, with practical applications in electronics and photonics.

Method: The researchers used polarized pump and probe laser spectroscopy to study the third-order nonlinear Kerr effect in altermagnetic CrSb.

Result: They observed a phenomenon involving four-wave mixing with high efficiency, which could be useful for Terahertz applications.

Conclusion: Altermagnets with Berry curvature quadrupole moments exhibit unique third-order optical responses, which hold promise for innovative electronic and photonics technologies.

Abstract: Crystalline symmetries determine the linear and nonlinear response of materials to external stimuli such as mechanical pressure and electromagnetic fields, governing phenomena such as piezoelectricity, optical activity, and multiple wave mixing with wide ranging technological applications. Altermagnets present a new class of materials with magnetic crystalline order where specific crystal symmetry operations connect antiferromagnetic sublattices, leading to non-relativistic spin-splitting of the electronic band structure. Hence, the electric material properties of altermagnets should uniquely mirror these underlying symmetry properties, potentially giving rise to novel phenomena in response to external driving fields. Here, we report the discovery of a broadband third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in altermagnetic CrSb at room temperature. The comparison of our observations with symmetry analyses and model calculations shows that this nonlinear Hall response is induced by the nonlinear electric susceptibility of a Berry curvature quadrupole, which exists within the spin-split band structure of CrSb and is characterized by the underlying crystalline and magnetic symmetries. We then utilize this third-order nonlinear electric susceptibility of CrSb to realize a multiple wave mixing device with pronounced four wave mixing output, which could, in principle, be extended to THz frequencies. Our study discovers that the crystalline magnetic order of altermagnets determines their nonlinear electric material properties, which could facilitate applications in high-frequency electronics, THz generation, communication networks, and energy harvesting.

Abstract: In addition to topological lattice defects such as dislocations and disclinations, crystals are also accompanied by unavoidable ordinary defects, devoid of any non-trivial geometry or topology, among which vacancies, Schottky defects, substitutions, interstitials, and Frenkel pairs are the most common. In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can nonetheless serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands, and any change in the local topological environment in an otherwise normal insulator in terms of mid-gap bound states in their vicinity. We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices.
