### [1] [Creation and precise spectroscopy of $^{86}$Sr$_2$ halo molecules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06319)
*Brandon Iritani,Jingjing Huang,Wenwei Xu,Gisung Sim,Robert Moszynski,Tanya Zelevinsky*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

Abstract: We report on the creation of $^{86}$Sr$_2$ molecules in the halo state and neighboring weakly bound states. Efficient molecule production via one-photon photoassociation relies on sufficient wavefunction overlap between the target vibrational states in the electronic excited- and ground-state potentials. Using Autler-Townes spectroscopy, transition strengths are measured to identify optimal pathways for production of weakly bound molecules. Vibrational splittings for the three least-bound vibrational states are measured, and dominant systematic uncertainties are evaluated with uncertainties below 100 Hz. From these splittings, absolute binding energies for these weakly bound vibrational states are determined. The results pave the way to a molecular isotope shift measurement with Sr$_2$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Rydberg atoms represent a platform underpinning many recent developments in quantum computation, simulation, sensing, and metrology. They further facilitate optical nonlinearity at the single-photon level when coupled to photons propagating in atomic clouds, which form collective atomic excitations called Rydberg polaritons, strongly interacting with each other. Here, we experimentally explore interactions between a Rydberg polariton in an atomic ensemble and a single, adjacent, Rydberg atom. We discover three different regimes of quantum dynamics corresponding to polariton blockade, coherent exchange, and probabilistic hopping, which are defined by their distinct transmission characteristics, with a transition through an exceptional point occurring between blockade and coherent exchange. We investigate the applications of such interactions for fast, non-destructive detection of Rydberg atoms and present proof-of-principle demonstrations for their potential application in nonlinear photonic networks.

Abstract: We present the design and fabrication of an endcap-type Paul trap. The trap is designed for studies with Ca$^{+}$ and Yb$^{+}$. The design, fabrication process, and characterization are presented in detail with a focus on trapping a single compensated ion at the rf node. A custom-built imaging system of $NA = 0.14$ and magnification $\approx 22 \times$ performs close to diffraction-limit and resolves multi-ion clusters. Controlled ion loading and characterization of the trap are performed using $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$. The experimentally determined quadrupole coefficient of the trap is $\approx 0.3$, which is very close to the design value. The relative frequency shift along the spectroscopy beam due to excess micromotion (EMM) is at the level of $3.5\times 10^{-18}$ for $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$. Applications of this trap encompass single-ion-based optical frequency standards, tests of fundamental physics, the study of mesoscopic Coulomb clusters, and the controlled interaction of a single ion with co-trapped atoms.

### [5] [On Causality and Predictivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06346)
*Damiano Anselmi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the trade-offs between causality and quantum gravity. It suggests that some approaches, like fakeons, may give up strict cause-effect at tiny scales to make quantum gravity work. Reiterates that causality might not be as fundamental as we think. Emphasizes that breaking causality is necessary for a predictive theory but points out that rejecting microcausality isn’t the end of the world.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper likely builds on previous discussions about quantum gravity and causality, aiming to explore new angles and implications. It probably wants to challenge existing assumptions about causality in physics.

Method: The paper takes a speculative approach, examining theoretical frameworks and their implications. It assesses different approaches, theoretical underpinnings, and supports its conclusions with modifications in quantum theory.

Result: The leading result is the exploration that dropping microcausality is a acceptable cost for a consistent theory. Also, it casts doubt on causality as a fundamental principle, which might inspire new theories.

Conclusion: Quantum gravity likely cannot be built on strict cause-effect relations. Causality might not be fundamental. Researchers should focus on non-causal frameworks or tentative new theories about how causation might function in quantum gravity. This challenges the traditional view on causality in physics and opens avenues for new theories.

Abstract: Certain approaches to quantum gravity, such as the one based on the concept of purely virtual particles (fakeons), sacrifice the cause-effect relation at very small scales to reconcile renormalizability with unitarity. Other developments have also urged caution regarding the idea of causality as a fundamental principle. In this paper, we examine the problem from multiple perspectives, including locality and predictivity, and extend the existing skepticism in several directions. Emphasizing the impact of unruly "disruptors", we point out that the illusory arrow of time associated with causality and predictivity is inherently statistical. This renders the cause-effect relation strained at the microscopic level. We also show that causation is a borderline concept that demands belief in entities which can act on nature without being part of it. Ultimately, not only is renouncing microcausality a reasonable price to pay for a consistent and predictive theory of quantum gravity (as is the one based on the fakeon idea), but the very notion of causality is misleading. Resting as it does on metaphysical assumptions, it should therefore be abandoned in fundamental physics.

Conclusion: 表明在带有Killing-Yano张量的时空中，二次自旋系统在特定条件下不存在可积解。

Abstract: We develop a covariant Hamiltonian formulation of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon dynamics at quadratic order in spin under the Tulczyjew-Dixon spin supplementary condition (TD SSC). In four-dimensional, type-D Einstein (vacuum/$Λ$-vacuum) spacetimes admitting a non-degenerate Killing-Yano (KY) tensor, we reduce via a Dirac bracket to the 10-dimensional physical phase space and model the quadratic sector with a spin-induced quadrupole characterized by a deformability $κ$ ($κ=1$ for black-hole--like; $κ\neq 1$ for material or exotic compact objects). For $κ=1$, we construct five independent first integrals -- an autonomous Hamiltonian, two KY-generated Killing invariants, a linear Rüdiger constant, and a quadratic Carter-Rüdiger constant -- establishing Liouville-Arnold integrability at quadratic order in spin. For $κ\neq 1$, the symmetry-generated invariants are not conserved in general and integrability does not persist at this order. The proof proceeds via covariant Poisson-bracket computations using a null bivector decomposition; Kerr is recovered as a special case. These results show that integrability can persist beyond Kerr and beyond the linear-in-spin regime, laying groundwork for symmetry-based, beyond-Kerr modelling of asymmetric-mass, spinning compact binaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates whether a modified symmetric teleparallel gravity model within the $f(Q)$ framework can explain the observed cosmic expansion history.

Method: A Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis is performed using a dataset that combines cosmic chronometers, PantheonPlus SH0ES, and DESI BAO DR2 data.

Result: The model parameters $m$ and $n$ have best-fit values of -0.386 ± 0.090 and -1.055 ± 0.047 respectively. The model also shows evidence of a transition from early deceleration to late-time cosmic acceleration at $z_{tr} = 0.573$, supported by a positive slope in the $om(z)$ diagnostic.

Conclusion: The model is viable and consistent with the data, suggesting it could explain the late-time加速 expansion of the universe.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the cosmological viability of a modified symmetric teleparallel gravity model within the $f(Q)$ framework. We derive observational constraints on the model parameters by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using a combined dataset consisting of cosmic chronometers, PantheonPlus SH0ES, and DESI BAO DR2. Our analysis yields the best-fit values for the model parameters $m=-0.386 \pm 0.090$ and $n=-1.055 \pm 0.047$, along with the cosmological parameters at present: $H_0 = 73.19 \pm 0.25$, $q_0 = -0.51 \pm 0.6$, and $ω_{0} = -0.73 \pm 0.3$, at 68\% CL. Furthermore, we examine the physical behavior of the model, focusing on the effective equation of state and deceleration parameter. Our findings indicate that the model experiences a transition from the early deceleration phase to the late-time cosmic acceleration, and the transition occurs at a redshift $z_{tr} = 0.573$. We also analyse the $om(z)$ diagnostic, which reflects a positive slope, supporting the behavior of the equation of state parameter in the quintessence region.

### [8] [A simple ghost free and caustic free mimetic scalar field dark matter model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05290)
*Emmanuel Kanambaye*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR:  Ghost and caustic instabilities are present in Chamseddine and Mukhanov's mimetic dark matter model, but a proposed alternative is presented as a simpler ghost free and caustic free scalar field dark matter extension that challenges the ΛCDM model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding dark matter and its role in cosmology is crucial. The ΛCDM model is widely accepted, but finding alternatives that can challenge or improve upon it is of great interest.

Method: Papers often employ a combination of theoretical analysis, mathematical modeling, and empirical comparison with observational data to evaluate and propose new theories. In this case, the authors likely performed a theoretical analysis of the existing model and its instabilities and then proposed modifications to create a new model.

Result: The proposed model eliminates ghost and caustic instabilities, making it a viable alternative to the ΛCDM model with the potential to challenge existing theories.

Conclusion: The paper presents a promising new approach to dark matter that could impact our understanding of cosmology. Further testing and observations would be necessary to validate its effectiveness.

Abstract: Chamseddine and Mukhanov have promoted the concept of mimetic dark matter as alternative dark matter candidate coming from gravitation. Unfortunately although being very interesting, their proposition turned out to have weakness among which ghost and caustic instabilities. In this paper I propose among the simplest ghost free and caustic free scalar field dark matter extension of their model; a proposition capable of challenging $Λ$CDM model or even capable of doing better.

### [9] [Distinguishing Black Holes and Neutron Stars through Optical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06488)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper employs the backward ray tracing method to study the optical images of neutron stars under the conditions of a spherical light source and a thin accretion disk, considering a polynomial equation of state given by $p = K ρ^{1 + 1/n_c}$. By numerically solving the TOV equations, we obtain the interior solutions of neutron stars for different densities. The results indicate that as the polynomial index $n_c$ increases, the mass, radius, and compactness of the neutron star all increase, which has a significant impact on its optical properties. Under the assumption that the light is truncated at the surface of the neutron star, we find that for a spherical light source, an increase in $n_c$ leads to an enlargement of the Einstein ring radius. For a thin accretion disk, the light intensity always reaches its maximum at the surface of the neutron star. The increase in $n_c$ also causes the outline of the neutron star to grow. When the observer inclination angle $θ_o$ changes, the neutron star's outline deforms from a circular shape to a D shape, with the left side being significantly brighter than the right side. In addition, this paper also investigates the distribution characteristics of the redshift factor. At lower observer inclination angles, gravitational redshift dominates, while at higher inclination angles, the Doppler effect induces noticeable blueshift. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole, the optical appearance of the neutron star shows significant differences. The study provides a theoretical basis for distinguishing neutron stars from black holes using high-resolution imaging and for constraining the equation of state.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 该研究利用S2星的轨道数据和双The study investigates the testing of Lorentz symmetry in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole Sgr~A* within the framework of bumblebee gravity. By analyzing the orbital data of S2, the researchers derived constraints on a Lorentz-violating parameter, $	ilde{

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental pillar of modern physics, and its testing in strong gravitational fields helps explore extensions of general relativity and understand Planck-scale physics.

Method: The research employed Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis with a 14-dimensional parameter space under uniform and Gaussian priors to measure the Lorentz-violating parameter $	ilde{
u}$. The analysis focused on the Schwarzschild-like black hole model within bumblebee gravity.

Result: The study successfully constrained the Lorentz-violating parameter $	ilde{
u}$ with two estimates at $1	ilde{
u}$ confidence level: $	ilde{
u} = {-8.01 	imes 10^{-5}}^{+2.77 	imes 10^{-4}}_{-2.09 	imes 10^{-4}}$ and $	ilde{
u} = {1.00 	imes 10^{-5}}^{+2.90 	imes 10^{-4}}_{-2.91 	imes 10^{-4}}$. These results represent a significant improvement over previous limits from the Event Horizon Telescope.

Conclusion: This research advances our understanding of Lorentz symmetry in strong gravitational fields and provides new, tighter constraints on deviations from general relativity, contributing valuable insights into the nature of spacetime near massive compact objects.

Abstract: Testing Lorentz symmetry in strong gravitational fields provides a promising probe of extensions to general relativity. The supermassive black hole Sgr~A* and the orbit of the S-stars offer a laboratory for such tests in a regime beyond weak field limit. We analyze the S2 orbital data focusing on the Schwarzschild-like black hole within bumblebee gravity, where deviations from general relativity are encoded in a single Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$. Using a full 14-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis under uniform and Gaussian priors, we obtain $\ell = {-8.01 \times 10^{-5}}^{+2.77 \times 10^{-4}}_{-2.09 \times 10^{-4}} $ and $\ell = {1.00 \times 10^{-5}}^{+2.90 \times 10^{-4}}_{-2.91 \times 10^{-4}} $ at $1σ$ confidence level, respectively. These constraints are about three orders of magnitude tighter than those from Event Horizon Telescope imaging of Sgr~A*.

### [11] [Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes in $f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature: horizon structure and extremality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06661)
*Alikram N. Aliev,Göksel Daylan Esmer*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a detailed analysis of black hole solutions in $f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature, focusing on the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter case. They derive closed analytic expressions for horizon radii and analyze extremal configurations, revealing non-universal extremality conditions unless the background curvature is zero. They also identify an ultra-extremal configuration and discuss a scenario where black holes with specific charge and mass must have a minimum rotation. Finally, they show that under certain conditions, the quartic horizon equation factorizes, leading to a chiral-like structure in the extremal regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the properties of black holes in modified gravity theories like $f(R)$ gravity is important for exploring alternative theories of gravity and their implications for astrophysics and cosmology. This paper contributes to this understanding by analyzing specific solutions and their characteristics.

Method: The authors use analytical methods to derive closed-form expressions for the horizons of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes in $f(R)$ gravity. They solve a quartic equation to find the event horizons and analyze extremal configurations by exploring functions of charge, rotation, and curvature radius. They also identify a factorization of the quartic equation under specific conditions.

Result: The key results include closed-form expressions for the radii of the horizons, the dependence of extremal conditions on charge and rotation, and the factorization of the quartic equation leading to an ultra-extremal horizon structure. The paper also discusses the physical implications of these results, such as the minimum rotation requirement for certain black holes and the chiral-like horizon structure in the extremal regime.

Conclusion: This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of rotating and charged black holes in $f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature. Their findings offer new insights into the behavior of black holes in modified gravity theories and highlight the importance of horizon structure and extremal conditions in understanding these objects compared to general relativity.

Abstract: The theory of $f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature (i.e. constant scalar curvature) admits rotating and charged black hole solutions obtained from the Kerr-Newman-(A)dS metrics of general relativity through appropriate rescalings of the metric parameters. In this paper, we focus on the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter case and present a unified analytic treatment of the horizon structure and its physical properties, allowing for a transparent comparison between general relativity and $ f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature. We solve the quartic equation determining the horizon locations and derive closed analytic expressions for the horizon radii. Focusing on extremal configurations, we obtain analytic formulas for the squared rotation parameter $ a^2 $ and the inverse square of the curvature radius $ l^{-2} $ as functions of the horizon location and the electric charge. For generic values of these parameters, the extremality conditions are non-universal, reducing to the familiar Kerr-Newman bound only in the limit of vanishing background curvature. We identify an ultra-extremal configuration in which $ a^2 $ attains its maximal value at zero charge and decreases monotonically to zero as the charge approaches its limiting value, while $ l^{-2 }$ increases correspondingly. As an illustrative example, we show that black holes with charge $ q=M/2 $ necessarily possess a minimum rotation, which emerges naturally as an intersection point in our analytic description of $ a^2 $ and $ l^{-2 }$, when embedded in a universe characterized by a critical value of $ l^{-2} $ (equivalently, the scalar curvature or the cosmological constant). Finally, we demonstrate that when the mass satisfies $ M^2= (a^2+q^2)(1-a^2/l^2)$, the quartic horizon equation factorizes, leading in the extremal regime to a chiral-like horizon structure that allows only the outer-cosmological horizon merger.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of gravitational wave (GW) dephasing due to gas accretion on the subtraction of massive black hole (MBH) binary signals over 4 yr of LISA data in the context of the global-fit. Based on state of the art predictions for the population of merging MBHs, we show that imperfect subtraction with vacuum waveform templates leaves a GW residual with an SNR of $3.2^{+5.4}_{-1.9}\times \sqrt{f_{\rm Edd} \langle \dot n \rangle/(20\, {\rm yr}^{-1})}$, where $f_{\rm Edd}$ is the typical Eddington ratio and $\langle \dot n \rangle$ the mean merger rate of LISA MBH binaries. We characterize the dependence of the residual on key population hyper-parameters, provide a simple fitting function and discuss detection and mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: Extended a 4D regular black hole solution to higher dimensions using smooth matter distribution, found photon orbits unstable, black hole shadow depends on scale and dimensionality, Hawking temperature and energy emission dependent on dimensionality, compared with EHT for constraints and signatures


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring higher-dimensional regular black holes for potential observational signatures and understanding their thermodynamic properties requires extending 4D models to higher dimensions and comparing with observations

Method: Used smooth matter distribution to generalize the 4D Dymnikova regular black hole to higher dimensions, studied photon motion, analyzed black hole shadow and thermodynamic properties

Result: Found that the size of the black hole shadow grows with the black hole scale but decreases slightly as the number of dimensions increases. Also found that the Hawking temperature and energy emission show a strong dependence on dimensionality

Conclusion: Extended Dymnikova solution to higher dimensions and studied its properties, which opens possibilities for understanding higher-dimensional black holes and comparing theoretical predictions with EHT observations, potentially leading to identification of higher-dimensional black holes in future observations

Abstract: Black holes are among the most compelling predictions of general relativity (GR) and are now strongly supported by observations from gravitational-wave detectors and the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). While standard black hole solutions suffer from central singularities, regular black holes avoid this issue by introducing a nonsingular core. In this work, we extend the Dymnikova regular black hole to higher dimensions using a smooth matter distribution. The resulting spacetime features a de Sitter-like core and two horizons. We analyze photon motion and show that circular photon orbits remain unstable, giving rise to a well-defined black hole shadow. Our results indicate that the shadow size grows with the black hole scale but decreases slightly as the number of dimensions increases. We also investigate thermodynamic properties, including Hawking temperature and energy emission, and find a strong dependence on dimensionality. Finally, we compare our model with EHT observations to place constraints on the parameters and highlight potential observational signatures of higher-dimensional regular black holes.

Conclusion: 量子大气的存在有助于解释 Hawking 辐射的形成，并为量子信息处理提供了潜在的平台。

Abstract: Recently, the concept of quantum atmosphere has been introduced as a potential origin of Hawking quanta. This study investigates the properties of quantum fields by exploring the quantum coherence of a two-mode Gaussian state near a black hole, where Hawking quanta originate from the quantum atmosphere region. It is demonstrated that both physically accessible and inaccessible quantum coherence for continuous variable quantum states distinctly exhibit hallmark features of the quantum atmosphere. Specifically, the quantum coherence for these states varies continuously with changes in the normalized distance; it undergoes rapid decreases (or increases) just outside the event horizon before gradually stabilizing through subsequent increases (or decreases). This behavior contrasts with the behaviors of quantum coherence where originates solely from the black hole's event horizon. The quantum features of the fields distinctly reflect characteristics attributable to the quantum atmosphere, thereby deepening our understanding of the origins of Hawking radiation. We also find that the continuous variable coherence is highly dependent on both the squeezing parameter and field frequency of the prepared state; therefore, appropriately adjusting these values can enhance our ability to detect features within the quantum atmosphere. It is noteworthy to observe that quantum features of fields do not entirely dissipate in the quantum atmosphere region, indicating that tasks related to quantum information processing can still be executed there.

Abstract: We derive the gravitational radiation-reaction (RR) force in the harmonic coordinate system at the fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian (4.5PN) order in the case of compact binary systems. Dimensional regularization is used to treat the ultra-violet divergences which appear at that order. We prove that the RR acceleration implies the known radiation fluxes at infinity associated with energy, angular momentum, linear momentum, and center-of-mass position. As a consistency check, we verify the manifest Lorentz invariance of the RR acceleration in harmonic coordinates. Our result should be useful for comparisons with other approaches such as the gravitational self force (GSF) and the post-Minkowskian (PM) effective field theory.

Abstract: The black hole singularity problem was proposed by Hawking and Penrose, and regular black holes serve as an important class of models to address this issue. However, the study of regular black hole thermodynamics has long faced a fundamental difficulty: an inconsistency between the Hawking temperature derived from thermodynamics and the geometrically defined Hawking temperature. To address this issue, we systematically investigated the thermodynamics of rotating regular black holes based on the method of thermodynamic phase space reduction. Our research shows that this approach naturally yields a self-consistent and complete thermodynamic description for rotating regular black holes, thereby establishing a universal thermodynamic framework for this type of black hole and laying the foundation for further research on complex thermodynamic phenomena.

Abstract: We develop a boundary only method for computing weak gravitational deflection angles at finite source and receiver distances within the Gauss-Bonnet theorem formulation of optical geometry. Exploiting the fact that the relevant equatorial optical manifold is two dimensional, we introduce isothermal (conformal) coordinates in which the optical metric is locally conformal to a flat reference metric and the Gaussian curvature reduces to a Laplacian of the conformal factor. Such an identity converts the curvature area term in the Gauss-Bonnet theorem into a pure boundary contribution via Green/Stokes-type relations, yielding a deflection formula that depends only on boundary data and controlled closure terms. The residual normalization freedom of the isothermal radius is isolated as an additive freedom in the conformal factor and is shown to leave physical observables invariant, eliminating the need for orbit dependent calibration prescriptions. We explicitly implement the boundary only formalism in weak deflection, where the leading bending reduces to elementary one-dimensional integrals evaluated on a flat reference ray in the conformal plane, with finite distance dependence entering solely through endpoint data. We validate the construction by reproducing finite distance weak deflection for Schwarzschild, deriving the leading finite distance charge correction for Reissner-Nordström, and applying the same boundary only framework to the Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) geometry as a representative non-asymptotically flat test case, recovering the standard finite distance expansion including the explicit $\mathcal{O}(Λ)$ and mixed $\mathcal{O}(ΛM)$ contributions to the total deflection angle.

Abstract: The solution space of differentially rotating polytropes with n=1 has been studied numerically. The existence of three different types of configurations: from spheroids to thick tori, hockey puck-like bodies and spheroids surrounded by a torus, separate from or merging with the central body has been proved. It has been shown that the last two types appear only at moderate degrees of rotation differentiality, sigma~2. Rigid-body or weakly differential rotation, as well as strongly differential, have not led to any "exotic" types of configurations. Many calculated configurations have had extremely large values of parameter tau, which has raised the question of their stability with respect to fragmentation.

Abstract: In this work, within exterior algebra formalism, we revisit and study the matter coupling in Exotic General Massive 3D Gravity (EGMG), previously introduced in \cite{ozkan_1}. Considering that the matter Lagrangian is both metric co-frame and connection dependent in general, we explicitly construct associated source 2-form by algebraically solving auxiliary 1-form fields in terms of gravitational field variables, energy-momentum and hyper-momentum 2-forms. It is seen that that the source 2-form involves terms that are quadratic in energy-momentum and hyper-momentum 2-forms as well as terms that depend on covariant derivatives of them. In addition, we derive the consistency relation in order that matter-coupled EGMG field equation be third-way consistent. In general, the consistency requires a particular relation that should be satisfied by energy-momentum and hyper-momentum 2-forms. We note that our construction and formalism allows to investigate non-minimal matter couplings with gravitational fields. It also enables to construct the higher order curvature extensions of EGMG.

Abstract: In this work we study rescaled effective single scalar field theories, and we confront these with the ACT constraint on the spectral index of the scalar primordial perturbations and the updated BICEP/Planck constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Rescaled scalar theories of gravity may be the result of an effective $f(R,φ)$ gravity at strong curvature regimes, which may result on a rescaling of the Einstein-Hilbert term of the form $\sim αR$. It turns out that canonical scalar field theories with stronger gravity compared to standard Einstein-Hilbert gravity can be compatible with the ACT and updated Planck/BICEP constraints, with stronger gravity meaning that the rescaling parameter $α$ takes values smaller than unity.

Method: 研究者对两个F(R)模型进行了全面的宇宙演化分析，使用了包括Ia型超新星数据、暗物质光谱声波振荡、哈勃参数估计和宇宙微波背景辐射数据在内的多组观测数据。

Result: 尽管存在某些参数空间的不可行区域，但最佳拟合参数并未落在这些区域之中，并且与ΛCDM相比，这两个模型在χ²统计、AIC和BIC等方面表现更为优越。

Abstract: Two $F(R)$ gravity models are tested on the basis of their viability during all stages of cosmological evolution. It is shown that these models can describe both the early-time inflationary epoch and the dark energy epoch. The models are confronted with the latest observational data, including the Pantheon+ catalogue with Type Ia supernovae, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations, the Hubble parameter estimations and data from cosmic microwave background radiation. Investigation of the viability conditions for these models, in particular, the condition $\frac{dF}{dR}>0$ required a deep analysis. Both models appeared to be viable during the early-time era, but for the late-time evolution the viability conditions are not fulfilled in definite domains in the parameter spaces of these models. However the best fitted parameters, determined in confrontation with the mentioned observational data, lie far from the forbidden domains for both models. These $F(R)$ gravity models describe the observations with the large advantage over the $Λ$-Cold-Dark-Matter model, not only in $χ^2$ statistics, but also with Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. This success of the two $F(R)$ gravity scenarios is connected with their capability to mimic dynamical dark energy, similarly to models with variable equation of state, that is necessary for describing the latest Pantheon+ and DESI observational data.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: IndIGO-D is a decihertz gravitational-wave mission focused on studying intermediate-mass black-hole binaries and binary neutron stars, with sensitivity comparable to LISA and Voyager-class interferometers, and potential multi-band coverage using telescopes like the Rubin Observatory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this mission is to fill the gap between observations in the millihertz and higher frequency ranges by studying binaries in the decihertz band. This will allow for early warnings and Multi-Band Multi-Messenger detections.

Method: The mission proposes a configuration with three spacecraft in formation to form an L-shaped interferometer in a heliocentric orbit. The interferometer operates with ppm-level arm-length stability, and its sensitivity is analyzed across the 0.1 to 10 Hz frequency band.

Result: The results show that IndIGO-D can detect binary neutron stars within a horizon distance of $z 
sim 0.3$ and intermediate-mass black-hole binaries at much greater distances ($z 
sim 10^{3}$). Additionally, the mission's Bayesian parameter estimation study demonstrates significant improvements in sky localization of gravitational wave sources.

Conclusion: IndIGO-D offers a promising approach to enhance our understanding of compact binary systems across a wide range of frequency bands, complementing existing and upcoming ground- and space-based interferometers.

Abstract: We study IndIGO-D, a decihertz gravitational-wave mission concept, focusing on a specific configuration in which three spacecraft fly in formation to form an L-shaped interferometer in a heliocentric orbit. The two orthogonal arms share a common vertex, providing a space-based analogue of terrestrial Michelson detectors, while operating in an optimised configuration that yields ppm-level arm-length stability. Assuming 1000 km arm length, we analyse the orbital motion and antenna response, and assess sensitivity across the [0.1 - 10] Hz band bridging LISA and next-generation ground-based interferometers. Using fiducial sensitivity curves provided by the IndIGO-D collaboration, we compute horizon distances for different source classes. Intermediate-mass black-hole binaries with masses $10^{2}$ - $10^{3} \, M_\odot$ are detectable to redshifts $z \sim 10^{3}$, complementing the reach of LISA and terrestrial detectors. Binary neutron star systems are observable to a horizon distance of $z \lesssim 0.3$, allowing continuous multi-band coverage with Voyager-class interferometers from the decihertz regime to merger. A Bayesian parameter-estimation study of a GW170817-like binary shows that the sky localization area improves from $\sim 21 \,\mathrm{deg}^2$ at one month to $0.3 \,\mathrm{deg}^2$ at six hours pre-merger! These sky areas are readily tiled by wide-field time-domain telescopes such as the Rubin Observatory, whose $9.6 \,\mathrm{deg}^2$ field of view and r-band depth enable high-cadence, repeated coverage of GW170817-like kilonovae at this distance and beyond. IndIGO-D exploits the rapid evolution of binaries in the decihertz band to bridge the gap between millihertz and terrestrial observations, enabling early warnings on timescales from months to hours and enhancing the prospects for multi-band and multi-messenger discoveries.

### [23] [The past stability of Kasner singularities for the $(3+1)$-dimensional Einstein vacuum spacetime under polarized $U(1)$-symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06957)
*Kai Dong*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a new proof of a past stability result for Kasner solutions of the $(3+1)$-dimensional Einstein vacuum equations under polarized $U(1)$-symmetry, utilizing a $(2+1)$ orthonormal-frame decomposition and Fuchsian techniques introduced by the authors to analyze the asymptotic behavior near the Big Bang singularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stability analysis of solutions in general relativity is a fundamental problem in theoretical physics, particularly in understanding the behavior of spacetimes near singularities.

Method: The authors employ a $(2+1)$ orthonormal frame decomposition and apply Fuchsian techniques, building on their earlier work [1907.04071, 2502.09210]. They reduce the Einstein equations to a Fuchsian system coupled with constraint equations, exploiting the symmetry to simplify the analysis.

Result: The perturbed solutions are shown to be asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete, and exhibit crushing singularities at the Big Bang, achieved by global existence results for the Fuchsian system coupled with constraint propagation up to singularities.

Conclusion: This work extends the understanding of the stability of Kasner solutions under polarized $U(1)$-symmetry and provides a robust framework for analyzing singularities in Einstein's equations using Fuchsian methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we give a new proof to a past stability result established in Fournodavlos-Rodnianski-Speck (arXiv:2012.05888), for Kasner solutions of the $(3+1)$-dimensional Einstein vacuum equations under polarized $U(1)$-symmetry. Our method, inspired by Beyer-Oliynyk-Olvera-Santamar{\'ı}a-Zheng (arXiv:1907.04071, arXiv:2502.09210), relies on a newly developed $(2+1)$ orthonormal-frame decomposition and a careful symmetrization argument, after which the Fuchsian techniques can be applied.
  We show that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete and crushing at the Big Bang singularity. They are achieved by reducing the $(3+1)$ Einstein vacuum equations to a Fuchsian system coupled with several constraint equations, with the symmetry assumption playing an important role in the reduction. Using Fuchsian theory together with finite speed of constraints propagation, we obtain global existence and precise asymptotics of the solutions up to the singularities.

*Jihao Yu,Victor Guedes,Shu Yan Lau,Siddarth Ajith,Kent Yagi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: In this paper, they calculate the effect of pressure anisotropy on w-modes in neutron stars. They find that as tangential pressure dominates, both the real and imaginary w-mode frequencies decrease. However, unstable w-modes appear only when tangential pressure is too dominant. The real frequency relation to compactness is quasi-universal, but the imaginary frequency is related to anisotropy. They discuss mode crossings and approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying neutron star oscillations helps understand nuclear physics and spacetime properties under extreme conditions.

Method: Used perturbative framework for stellar oscillations and anisotropy model to compute w-modes.

Result: Anisotropy affects w-mode frequencies differently depending on whether tangential pressure is dominant. Real frequencies are universal, but imaginary ones are influenced by anisotropy. Mode behavior in isotropic cases may not hold true here.

Conclusion: This paper advances understanding of neutron star structure through studying anisotropic w-modes, revealing new insights into nuclear physics under intense conditions.

Abstract: Neutron star asteroseismology offers a unique opportunity to probe nuclear physics through stellar oscillations. Although the pressure inside of a neutron star is typically assumed to be isotropic, pressure anisotropy can arise from various physical mechanisms, including elasticity, viscosity, and magnetic fields. Previous studies of nonradial stellar quasi-normal mode oscillations with anisotropic pressure have focused primarily on fluid modes. In this paper, we compute, for the first time, spacetime oscillation modes (so-called w-modes) of anisotropic neutron stars. Using a perturbative framework for stellar oscillations with pressure anisotropy, developed previously by some of the authors, together with a phenomenological anisotropy model, we find that both the real and imaginary parts of the w-mode frequencies decrease as the tangential pressure becomes dominant over the radial pressure. Although we do not find any unstable w-modes within the physically viable parameter space, unstable w-modes appear in an unphysical branch of solutions when the tangential pressure strongly dominates the radial one. We also find that the relation between the real part of the w-mode frequency and the stellar compactness is quasi-universal with respect to variations in the equation of state and the degree of pressure anisotropy. In contrast, the relation between the imaginary part of the w-mode frequency and the stellar compactness depends on the degree of anisotropy, but remains equation-of-state universal when the anisotropy is fixed. Finally, we discuss potential mode crossings and the validity of certain approximations that have been shown to work well for w-mode calculations in the isotropic case.

Abstract: We study a generalized holographic dark energy model in which the infrared cutoff depends on the Hubble parameter and its first two time derivatives. The inclusion of the $\ddot H$ term introduces a finite relaxation timescale for the horizon degrees of freedom, which can be interpreted as an effective entropic inertia of the holographic vacuum energy. The resulting background dynamics admit late--time solutions in which the cosmic expansion gradually halts.
  In the underdamped regime, the Hubble parameter undergoes exponentially damped oscillations and asymptotically approaches $H\to0$. The scale factor grows monotonically but by a finite amount, while curvature invariants decay exponentially, leading to an asymptotically Minkowski spacetime without future singularities. We confront the full nonlinear background evolution with cosmic chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and find good agreement with current late--time expansion data, with a reduced chi--squared $χ^2/ν\simeq0.52$. At observable redshifts, oscillatory features are strongly suppressed and remain consistent with existing constraints.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了计算广义相对论扩展理论中平衡定律的方法，并验证了Isaacson方法与协变相空间形式化的兼容性。

Abstract: Balance flux laws of asymptotic symmetries in general relativity provide fully non-perturbative constraint equations on gravitational strain. They have proven useful for constructing numerical gravitational waveforms and for characterizing gravitational memory. As the precision of current and future detectors continues to improve, such constraints become increasingly important for high-precision tests of gravity, including searches for deviations from general relativity. This motivates a systematic understanding of analogous balance laws in theories beyond general relativity. In this work, we investigate the existence and structure of flux laws at null infinity in diffeomorphism-invariant extensions of general relativity. Our analysis is based on the covariant phase space formalism and the definition of conserved quantities, as presented by Wald and Zoupas. For a particularly relevant class of Horndeski theories, we derive a general expression for the flux and formulate the corresponding balance equation via the associated non-conserved charges. We cross-check our general results by comparing them with previous studies of Brans-Dicke gravity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the employed methods extend straightforwardly to a broader class of diffeomorphism-invariant theories. The null part of the resulting flux laws associated with null memory is compared with and validated against the alternative derivation based on the Isaacson approach to gravitational radiation. Beyond the specific results obtained, this work is intended to serve as a practical guide for computing balance laws in generic diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity and paves the way for an in-depth comparison between the Isaacson approach and the covariant phase space formalism.

Abstract: We investigate how spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking in bumblebee gravity modifies particle dynamics, thermodynamics, and vacuum energy around a static black hole background. Starting from the optical-mechanical correspondence, we derive a modified dispersion relation that encodes the influence of the Lorentz-violating parameter $λ$ on the propagation of massive and massless modes. We analyze the resulting optical properties, including the effective refractive index, group velocity, and energy-dependent time delay, and show how the non-asymptotically flat geometry reshapes signal propagation. From the same dispersion relation, we construct the interparticle potential for massive and massless excitations and evaluate the electron scattering cross section within the Born approximation, identifying characteristic Lorentz-violating corrections. We then develop a statistical-ensemble description based on the deformed energy-momentum relation and obtain analytic expressions for the thermodynamic observables of a massless bosonic gas. The pressure, mean energy, entropy, and heat capacity are examined in three representative regimes--extremely close to the horizon, near the photon sphere, and in the asymptotic region -- where Lorentz violation systematically increase the magnitude of these quantities and leads to finite asymptotic plateaus. Finally, we analyze the vacuum state in the curved background and compute the regularized Casimir energy at zero and finite temperature.

Motivation: The paper aims to explore the interaction between gravitational waves and photon spin angular momentum, potentially opening new avenues for studying modified gravity and parity violation.

Method: The authors analyze the angular momentum exchange between photons and gravitational waves, derive selection rules based on field spin properties, and explore observational implications.

Result: Potential new ways to constrain modified gravity, study compact binaries' asymmetry, and investigate parity-violating physics in the early universe are identified.

Conclusion: This work opens a new theoretical and observational window in gravitational wave physics and photon interactions.

Abstract: We propose the gravitational analog of the chiroptical effect for the first time, demonstrating that gravitational waves (GWs) can induce a reversal of photon chirality through the exchange of angular momentum, namely the spin-2-gravitation chiroptical effect. By analyzing the interaction between photon spin angular momentum (SAM) and GWs, we derive the selection rules governing this exchange, which are strictly dictated by the spin-1 and spin-2 nature of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, respectively. We find that the gravitational chiroptical effect reflects the local nature of SAM which prevents the accumulation of gravitational perturbations over spatial phase windings, and offers a theoretically rigorous tool to probe the chiral structure of GWs. This mechanism provides a novel observational pathway to constrain modified gravity theories, measure the asymmetric properties of compact binaries, and explore parity-violating physics in the early universe.

Abstract: Using the ADM formalism, we demonstrate that the Hamiltonian formulation of Quantum Gravity is exactly in the form of a worldline (WL) formalism in the superspace. We then show that the Keldysh partition function reduces to the partition function of Euclidean 3D gravity. After discussing the meaning of the time parameter, we show that in the gauge fields formalism, our Keldysh partition function reduces to a generating functional of a 2D Conformal Field Theory (CFT). This functional exhibits a minimal time-lapse proportional to the square root of the cosmological constant. From the viewpoint of the Chern-Simons/Liouville correspondence, we calculate the exchange of virtual gravitons between two massive probes from the cosmological boundary.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Einstein-bumblebee gravity, as a class of massive non-minimally coupled vector-tensor theories, provides a useful framework for constraining Lorentz symmetry breaking through astrophysical observations, largely due to the existence of exact static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions. These solutions are typically obtained under the assumption that the vector-field potential vanishes everywhere once the vector field acquires a nonzero radial vacuum expectation value. However, imposing this assumption globally obstructs the construction of self-consistent compact-star solutions. In this work, we elucidate the origin of this inconsistency through a detailed analysis of the field equations and construct neutron-star configurations by abandoning the global vanishing-potential assumption. Crucially, we show that even without enforcing this condition everywhere, it is violated only in the strong-field interior region and is dynamically restored in the weak-field regime by asymptotic boundary conditions at spatial infinity. As a result, consistency with existing black-hole solutions and observational constraints is preserved. Our results establish massive vector-tensor gravity as a unified, natural, and self-consistent framework for compact objects, significantly extending its astrophysical viability beyond black holes and Solar System tests.

Abstract: The photon sphere, a hypersurface of circular null geodesics, plays a fundamental role in characterizing black hole spacetimes, influencing phenomena such as black hole shadows, gravitational lensing, and quasinormal modes. While universal upper bounds on the photon sphere radius have been established for both four-dimensional and higher-dimensional black holes, the question of a corresponding lower bound in higher-dimensional black holes remains less explored. In this work, we derive a universal lower bound for the photon sphere radius in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes of arbitrary dimension $n\ge 4$. Under the assumptions of the weak energy condition, a non-positive trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and a monotonicity condition on the radial pressure function $|r^{n-1}p_r(r)|$, we prove that the photon sphere radius $r_γ$ satisfies $r_γ\ge (\frac{n-1}{2})^{1/(n-3)}r_H$, where $r_H$ is the radius of the outer event horizon. For $n=4$, this reduces to the known result $r_γ\ge \frac{3}{2}r_H$. Our result generalizes Hod's four-dimensional theorem to higher dimensions, and provides a new geometric constraint on the structure of black holes in extended theories of gravity.

TL;DR: 研究了Brans--Dicke标量场驱动的引力坍缩，在无普通物质的框架下，标量场的自相互作用势$V(Φ)$和与Ricci标量的非最小耦合作用 govern 了时空动力学。数值模拟显示，在$ρ	hicksim 1/a$和$ρ	hicksim -	ext{ln}a$下，坍缩一定会导致中心曲率奇点形成，并且弱能量条件得到满足。进一步分析发现，奇点具有可及性，未来directed null geodesics可以从奇点传播到未来null无穷远处，使奇点在全局可见。利用Tipler的强曲率条件，扩展到了Brans--Dicke场方程，研究了奇点的强度。整体而言，标量--张量重力下的引力坍缩可以产生挑战宇宙恒星假说的场景，同时强调了由BD标量场驱动坍缩形成的奇点的观测相关性。

Abstract: We investigate gravitational collapse driven solely by a self-interacting Brans--Dicke (BD) scalar field in the absence of ordinary matter. In this framework, the spacetime dynamics are governed solely by the scalar field $Φ$, endowed with a self-interaction potential $V(Φ)$ and non-minimally coupled to the Ricci scalar through the Brans--Dicke action. We numerically solve for the evolution of $Φ(t)$ and the corresponding potential $V(Φ)$ in order to track the collapse dynamics leading to singularity formation. Our analysis demonstrates that, for the energy densities $ρ\approx 1/a$ and $ρ\approx -\ln a$, the collapse inevitably leads to the formation of a central curvature singularity while consistently satisfying the weak energy condition. We further examine the causal structure of the resulting singularity and find that future-directed null geodesics originating from the singularity can propagate to future null infinity, making the singularity globally visible. The strength of the singularity is also examined by extending Tipler's strong curvature condition to the Brans--Dicke field equations. Overall, our findings indicate that gravitational collapse in scalar--tensor gravity can give rise to scenarios that challenge the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, while underscoring the potential observational relevance of singularities formed through BD scalar-field-driven collapse.

Abstract: We model the inspiral and merger dynamics of two co-planar rings in Newtonian mechanics with GR motivated corrections and illustrate their similarity with those of black hole binary systems on the orbital plane. Our simulation reveals a banana-shape deformation of the ``black holes'' involved, and a typhoon-like spiral structure in the merger product. Using an eXact One-Body approach, we compute the full gravitational waveform of this process and qualitatively reproduce results consistent with those of numerical relativity. Our simulation offers a transparent link between the feature of gravitational waveforms and the internal structure of black holes, thus a complementary interpretation of physics behind numerical relativity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The so-called $I$-Love-$Q$ relations link some normalized versions of the moment of inertia, the Love number, and the quadrupole moment of a star. These relations, in principle, enable the inference of two of the quantities given the third. However, their use has been limited because the normalized versions of the multipole moments rely on the static mass derived from the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, which is not directly observable. In this work, using perturbation theory, we find that the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations can also be formulated in terms of an alternative set of normalized quantities that do not depend on the static mass, but on the actual (observable) mass.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of gravitational-wave signals is essential for reliable inference of compact-binary source parameters, particularly for future space-based detectors operating in the milli- and deci-Hertz bands. In this work, we systematically investigate the parameter-estimation biases induced by neglecting orbital eccentricity when analyzing eccentric compact-binary coalescences with quasi-circular waveform templates. Focusing on the deci-Hertz detector B-DECIGO and the milli-Hertz detector LISA, we model eccentric inspiral signals using a frequency-domain waveform that incorporates eccentricity-induced higher harmonics and the time-dependent response of spaceborne detectors. We quantify systematic biases in the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, and luminosity distance using both Bayesian inference and the Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) formalism, and assess their significance relative to statistical uncertainties. By constructing mock gravitational-wave catalogs spanning stellar-mass and massive black-hole binaries, we identify critical initial eccentricities at which systematic errors become comparable to statistical errors. We find that for B-DECIGO, even very small eccentricities, $e_0\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ at 0.1 Hz, can lead to significant biases, whereas for LISA such effects typically arise at larger eccentricities, $e_0\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ at $10^{-4}$ Hz, due to the smaller number of in-band cycles. Comparisons between FCV predictions and full Bayesian analyses demonstrate good agreement within the regime where waveform mismatches remain small, especially when extrinsic parameters are pre-aligned to minimize mismatches. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating eccentricity in waveform models for future space-based gravitational-wave observations.

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the low-energy physics of a quarter-hole-filled two-orbital bilayer Hubbard model motivated by transition-metal bilayer systems with strong orbital-selective interlayer hybridization. By explicitly treating the strong interlayer bonding of dz2 orbitals within a molecular orbital basis and projecting out high-energy electronic states, we derive a low-energy effective Kugel-Khomskii Hamiltonian describing the interplay between electron spin and emergent layer pseudospin degrees of freedom. We map out a rich ground state phase diagram featuring diverse spin and charge ordered states. These include conventional ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases with layer staggered charge densities, a layer-coherent phase characterized by spontaneous interlayer quantum coherence, and a novel maximally spin-layer-entangled phase with a hidden composite spin-layer order. We show that this exotic hidden ordered phase arises from the spontaneous breaking of an emergent O(4) symmetry down to a O(3), manifesting a unique excitation spectrum with three entangled gapless Goldstone modes. Our results uncover a geometrically driven mechanism for realizing composite entanglement in strongly correlated bilayer systems and provide a concrete theoretical framework relevant to bilayer nickelate superconductors and other multi-component correlated materials.

Abstract: Altermagnet (AM), a recently identified class of collinear magnet, has garnered significant attention due to its unique combination of zero net magnetization and spin-split energy bands, leading to a variety of novel physical phenomena. Using numerically exact lattice Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate AM-like phases within the Ising-Kondo lattice model which is commonly employed to describe heavy-fermion materials. By incorporating an alternating next-nearest-neighbor hopping (NNNH) term, which arises from the influence of non-magnetic atoms in altermagnetic candidate materials, our results reveal key signatures of AM-like states, including spin-splitting quasiparticle bands and spectral functions, and demonstrate that d-wave AM remains stable across a broad range of interaction strengths, doping levels, NNNH amplitudes and temperatures, highlighting its robustness. Furthermore, through an analysis of non-magnetic impurity effects, we further confirm the d-wave symmetry of the AM phase. These findings establish a solid theoretical foundation for exploring AM-like phases in f-electron compounds, paving the way for future investigations into their exotic magnetic and electronic properties.

Abstract: The density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) is one of the most powerful numerical methods for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. We extend DMRG to the case with the $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ symmetry with $N_c > 2$, including two-dimensional systems. As a killer application, we simulate the ground state of the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, which can potentially be realised in cold atomic systems and solid state systems like $α$-ZrCl$_3$. We keep up to 12800 $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ states equivalent to more than a million $\mathrm{U}(1)$ states. This supermassive DMRG simulation reveals the quantum spin-orbital liquid ground state, which has been conjectured for more than a decade. The methodology developed here can be extended to any classical Lie groups, paving the way to a next-generation DMRG with a full symmetry implementation.

Abstract: Engineering sublattice imbalance within the unit cell of bottom-up synthesized graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) represents a versatile tool for realizing custom-tailored quantum nanomaterials. The interaction between low-energy zero-modes (ZMs) not only contributes to frontier bands but can form the basis for magnetically ordered phases. Here, we present the bottom-up synthesis of a non-centrosymmetric GNR that places all ZMs on the majority sublattice sites. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy reveal that strong electron-electron correlation drives the system into a ferromagnetically ordered insulating ground state featuring a sizeable band gap of Eg ~ 1.2 eV. At higher temperatures, a chemical transformation induces an insulator-to-metal transition that quenches the ferro-magnetic order. Tight-binding (TB) and first-principles density functional theory calculations corroborate our experimental observations. This work showcases how control over molecular symmetry, sublattice polarization, and ZM hybridization in bottom-up synthesized nanographenes can open a path to the exploration of many-body physics in rationally designed quantum materials.

Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in the study of altermagnetism, or unconventional magnetism, and in the realization and manipulation of two-impurity Kondo physics in real materials, we propose a phase-sensitive method to explore unconventional magnetic symmetries. Our method can be implemented with spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy to study two-impurity Kondo phenomena on altermagnetic metals by varying the distance and orientation between magnetic impurities. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze the spin splitting of the Kondo resonance, whose spatial distribution sensitively captures the symmetry of the underlying altermagnetic order. Furthermore, the impurity spin correlations reflects the anisotropy of the RKKY interaction due to the altermagnetic Fermi surface splitting. This work provides a framework for studying the competition between the Kondo effect, the RKKY interaction and altermagnetism, in the simplest possible system.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) instabilities and ferromagnetism in SmNiC$_2$ using diffuse and inelastic x-ray scattering together with Raman spectroscopy. We identify a soft acoustic phonon driving the incommensurate CDW (I-CDW) and uncover a second Kohn anomaly at the wave vector of the commensurate CDW (C-CDW) stabilized in other $R$NiC$_2$ members ($R=$ rare earth). The marked softening of both phonons and their contrasting evolution with temperature reveal a competition between the two ordering tendencies. Alongside pronounced anomalies in the temperature dependence of the zone center and soft phonons, we observe the collective amplitude mode of the CDW, which collapses abruptly as ferromagnetism sets in. Surprisingly, the Kohn anomalies persist in the ferromagnetic state despite the degradation of Fermi-surface nesting conditions. Our experimental findings, supported by ab initio calculations, highlight the central role of the electron-phonon interaction in driving the CDW formation and tuning the balance between competing charge and magnetic orders.

Abstract: Magnetic topological materials hosting non-zero Berry curvature have emerged as a focus of intensive research due to their exceptional magnetoelectric coupling phenomena and potential applications in next-generation spintronic devices. In this work, we successfully synthesized high-quality GdAlSi single crystals, a prototypical member of RAlX (R = rare earth elements; X = Si/Ge) family that has been theoretically predicted to sustain a non-trivial Weyl semimetal state. Through systematic investigations of magnetic and transport properties, we identified two successive antiferromagnetic transitions at critical temperatures TN1 31.9 K and TN2 31.1 K, as evidenced by temperature-dependent resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements. Notably, applied magnetic fields exceeding 8 T induce a third magnetic transition (TN3), generating a cascade of metamagnetic transitions that collectively form a dendritic phase diagram. This complex magnetic behavior is attributed to the interplay between localized Gd-4f moments and itinerant conduction electrons, possibly mediated by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Transport measurements revealed striking stepwise anomalies in magnetoresistance when crossing phase boundaries, accompanied by pronounced hysteresis loops arising from magnetic moment flopping processes. Our results not only establish GdAlSi as a rich platform for investigating correlated topological states, but also demonstrate its potential for engineering topological phase transitions through magnetic symmetry manipulation in Weyl semimetals.

Abstract: Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ is a honeycomb iridate which has been studied recently as a candidate Kitaev quantum spin liquid. Its magnetic ground state however, has been reported to be quantum disordered, spin glassy, or magnetically ordered depending on synthesis details. We have prepared a Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ sample with large antisite disorder and studied in detail its structure (global and local), charge states, and thermodynamic properties to try to quantify and characterize the disorder and its connection to the magnetic ground state. X-ray diffraction, Extended x-ray absorption fine structure(EXAFS) and X-ray pair distribution function analysis revealed a large site disorder ($\sim$25\%), while XPS and XANES reveal mixed valence of Cu and Ir following Cu$^{1+}$ + Ir$^{4+}$ $\rightarrow$ Cu$^{2+}$ + Ir$^{3+}$. This combination of site disorder and charge redistribution generates competing antiferromagnetic interactions and magnetic frustration, resulting in dynamically fluctuating AFM clusters near 80K that freeze below 29K. These results demonstrate the crucial role of synthesis dependent disorder in determining the magnetic ground state of Cu$_2$IrO$_3$.

Abstract: An incommensurate CDW may have the ability to slide, i.e., to generate an excess of current when the system is submitted to an external field. Sliding phenomenon is closely related to deformation of the periodic lattice distortion associated to the CDW. In principle, however, the sliding state can also be observed through the band structure. Here we show that broken symmetry in k-space is observed by Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) in the sliding regime of TbTe$_3$, which could be consistent with theoretical predictions.

It is based on the belief that collinear magnets always feature an inversion-symmetric band structure, which forbids odd-wave magnetism. Here, we show that collinear magnets, which break time reversal symmetry in the non-magnetic sector, can have an inversion symmetry broken band structure and lead to unconventional types of collinear magnets. Hence, collinear odd-wave magnets do exist, and we explain that a magnetic field-induced Edelstein effect is their unique signature. We propose minimal models based on the coexistence of AFM order with compensated loop current orders for all types of collinear magnets. Our work provides a new perspective on collinear magnets and the spin-space group classification.

Abstract: We investigate the magnetic orders and excitations in a half-filled Hubbard model that continuously interpolates between the Lieb and kagome lattices. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation combined with real-time two-particle response functions from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the random phase approximation, we map the $U-t'$ phase diagram of the Lieb-kagome lattices, identifying the typical magnetic states and the corresponding magnetic excitation spectra. In addition to gapless Goldstone magnons, the ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic symmetry-broken phases also exhibit gapped Higgs magnon bands, which originate from amplitude fluctuations in the order parameter characterizing spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Abstract: Nonequilibrium electronic forces play a central role in voltage-driven phase transitions but are notoriously expensive to evaluate in dynamical simulations. Here we develop a machine learning framework for adiabatic lattice dynamics coupled to nonequilibrium electrons, and demonstrate it for a gating induced insulator to metal transition out of a charge density wave state in the Holstein model. Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials.

Abstract: We construct rigorous Anderson-type lower bounds on the ground-state energy of the spin-$S$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice. By formulating and optimizing a hierarchy of local cluster motifs ordered by size, we generate a sequence of increasingly tight bounds. A seven-site "hourglass" cluster composed of two corner-sharing tetrahedra furnishes an optimal lower bound that admits a closed-form expression for arbitrary spin $S$. We also derive exact lower bounds for generalized models with further-neighbor exchange, ring exchange, and scalar spin-chirality interactions. For $S=1/2$ and $S=1$, numerical optimization of an 18-site "crown" cluster containing a hexagonal loop yields rigorous lower bounds on the ground-state energy per site of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model with unit exchange, $e_\mathrm{GS} \geq -0.549832$ and $e_\mathrm{GS} \geq -1.632985$, respectively. We compare the resulting bounds with numerical ground-state energy estimates from the literature.

Abstract: The celebrated analogy between the pressure-temperature phase diagram of a liquid-gas system and the field-temperature phase diagram of an Ising ferromagnet has long been a cornerstone for understanding universality in critical phenomena. Here we extend this analogy to a highly frustrated antiferromagnet, the kagome-layered spiral Ising compound Nd$_3$BWO$_9$. In its field-temperature phase diagram, we identify a critical endpoint (CEP) and an associated Ising supercritical regime (ISR). The CEP of the metamagnetic transition is located at ${μ_0H_c} \simeq 1.04$ T and $T_c \simeq 0.3$ K. Above this point, the ISR emerges with supercritical crossover lines that adhere to a universal scaling law, as evidenced by the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Remarkably, we observe a universally divergent Grueneisen ratio near the emergent CEP, $Γ_H \propto 1/t^{β+γ-1}$, with $β + γ \simeq 1.563$ the critical exponents of the 3D Ising universality class and $t \equiv (T - T_c)/T_c$ the reduced temperature. Our adiabatic demagnetization measurements on Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ reveal a lowest temperature of 195 mK achieved from 2 K and 4 T. Our work opens new avenues for studying supercritical physics and efficient cooling in layered-kagome, rare-earth RE$_3$BWO$_9$ family and, more broadly, in Ising-anisotropic magnets like spin ices.

Abstract: Interfaces in three-dimensional many-body systems can exhibit rich phenomena beyond the corresponding bulk properties. In particular, they can fluctuate and give rise to massless low energy degrees of freedom even in the presence of a gapped bulk. In this work, we present the first tensor-network study of the paradigmatic interface roughening transition of the 3-D Ising model using highly asymmetric lattices that are infinite in the $(xy)$ direction and finite in $z$. By reducing the problem to an effective 2-D tensor network, we study how truncating the $z$ direction reshapes the physics of the interface. For a truncation based on open boundary conditions, we demonstrate that varying the interface width gives rise to either a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking transition (for odd $L_z$) or a smooth crossover(for even $L_z$). For antiperiodic boundary conditions, we obtain an effective $\mathbb{Z}_q$ clock model description with $q=2L_z$ that exhibits an intermediate Luttinger liquid phase with an emergent $\U(1)$ symmetry.

Conclusion: Direct experimental evidence of peculiar quantum structures in weakly interacting bosonic systems, supporting theoretical predictions about particle-hole superposition.

Abstract: In many-body quantum systems, interactions drive the emergence of correlations that are at the heart of the most intriguing states of matter. A remarkable example is the case of weakly interacting bosonic systems, whose ground state is a squeezed vacuum state, and whose elementary excitations have a collective nature. In this work, we report on the direct observation of the peculiar microscopic quantum structure of these elementary excitations. We perform time- and frequency-resolved two-photon correlation measurements on the fluctuations of weakly interacting polaritons in a resonantly-driven microcavity, and observe that upon decreasing the average number of fluctuation quanta below unity, large pair correlations build up together with strong time-ordering of the emitted photons. This behavior is a direct signature of the particle-hole quantum superposition which is at the heart of Bogoliubov excitations.

Abstract: We present a unified geometric approach for spin-1 systems that connects seemingly distinct geometric representations such as the nematic director, the Cartesian representation and the Majorana stellar representation. Starting from a product state of two distinguishable spin-1/2 particles, we provide a direct way to capture crucial geometric information. This perspective reveals the fundamental interplay between subspace projection and geometric constraints. This approach effectively maps magnetic solitons onto a kink model, allowing us to derive their equations of motion, a task not readily achieved with traditional methods. This simplified dynamical description reveals that the novel transition of these solitons in a harmonic trap corresponds to a fundamental transformation between kink and dip structures in the underlying geometry.

The formation of a localized blob (i.e., a ``bright" solitary wave) for sufficiently strong interactions provides an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We evaluate analytically and numerically the excitation spectrum for both cases of a homogeneous and of a localized density distribution. We identify in the excitation spectrum the emergence of the analogous to the Goldstone and the Higgs modes, evaluating various relevant observables, gaining insight into these two fundamental modes of excitation.

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: The paper presents a new design for a quantum fluid of microwave photons using superconducting transmission lines with Josephson junctions. The system supports strongly interacting photons, which the authors argue can be achieved through an adiabatic conversion of an incident coherent field into a Tonks-Girardeau gas of fermionized photons. The paper's main contribution appears to be proposing this innovative platform for quantum photonics, with simulations and theoretical analysis supporting the design's feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advances in quantum optics have shown the potential for creating macroscopic quantum states of light, such as photon Bose-Einstein condensates and Fermi gases, which could have profound implications for quantum information processing and precision metrology. Superconducting transmission lines, particularly those with non-linear Josephson junctions, offer a promising platform for realizing such phenomena due to their macroscopic and controllable nature.

Method: The authors construct a theoretical framework based on the coupled-cavity framework, derived from the quantum hydrodynamics formalism, and simulate the system using a numerical solution of the non-linear Schrödinger equation. The simulations model the conversion process, examining the bosonic to fermionic transition and analyze the resulting quantum correlations.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that the system supports a strongly-interacting bosonic state, which undergoes adiabatic conversion into a fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas. The non-linear interactions within the system lead to significant correlations in the transmitted light, consistent with many-body fermionic physics.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical evidence that superconducting transmission lines with non-linear Josephson junctions can host a strongly-interacting photon gas, offering a new platform for studying quantum fluids in a propagating geometry. The results imply promising applications in quantum photonics and quantum information science, particularly in the development of macroscopic quantum states.

Abstract: We investigate superconducting transmission lines as a novel platform for realizing a quantum fluid of microwave photons in a propagating geometry. We predict that the strong photon-photon interactions provided by the intrinsic nonlinearity of Josephson junctions are sufficient to enter a regime of strongly interacting photons for realistic parameters. A suitable tapering of the transmission line parameters allows for the adiabatic conversion of an incident coherent field into a Tonks-Girardeau gas of fermionized photons close to its ground state. Signatures of the strong correlations are anticipated in the correlation properties of the transmitted light.

Abstract: We investigate the superradiant phase transition in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with distinct atomic detunings, confined in an optical cavity and driven by a transverse pump laser. By combining perturbation theory and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the phase transition is dominated by the red-detuned component, resulting in a phase diagram completely different from that of a single-component case under blue-detuned condition. The system exhibits spontaneous phase separation between the two components, manifested as alternating stripe patterns in the normal phase and distinct Bragg gratings in the superradiant phase. Furthermore, the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum reveals roton-type mode softening, indicating that the phase transition also corresponds to the superfluid-to-lattice supersolid transition. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between atomic detunings and collective quantum many-body phenomena, offering potential applications in quantum simulation and optical switching technologies.

Abstract: Plasma discharge devices have recently emerged as compact and versatile tools for particle beam manipulation. Building upon the Active Plasma Lens (APL) and its curved extension, the Active Plasma Bending (ABP), this work introduces the concept of the Plasma Discharge Undulator (PDU). In a PDU, a high-current discharge within a capillary generates an azimuthal magnetic field providing strong linear focusing ($O(1)$ (kT/m)), while a controlled and periodical spatial modulation of the discharge axis acts as a geometric driving term. The resulting beam dynamics can be modeled as a forced harmonic oscillator, yielding a well-defined oscillation at wavelength $λ_{\mathrm{PDU}}$, distinct from the natural betatron wavelength $λ_β$ related to APL focusing. Proper injection conditions result in the suppression of collective betatron oscillations, significantly reducing the intrinsic undulator strength spread typical of conventional plasma undulators, while allowing for matched beam transport thanks to APL strong focusing. Analytical models for particle trajectories and radiation emission are developed, and the one-dimensional requirements for free-electron laser (FEL) emission are evaluated, providing scaling relations and feasibility criteria for FEL operation in the proposed scheme. Theoretical estimates and multi-particle simulations indicate that the PDU can operate in the short-period regime ($λ_{\mathrm{PDU}} = $ mm-cm) with tunable undulator strength $K_{\mathrm{PDU}}$, supporting narrow-band radiation emission. The PDU thus provides a pathway toward miniaturized, tunable, fully-plasma-based light sources with enhanced control over focusing and spectral properties.

TL;DR: The study examines the stability of the CUR radiation peak associated with positron channelling in bent C(110) crystals. Simulations show that parameters like bending amplitude and period significantly influence both the energy and stability of the peak, with enhanced dechannelling observed as these parameters change. Results indicate that the peak remains relatively stable even as bending parameters vary within certain ranges, which helps in designing gamma-ray crystal-based light sources. Simulated values align with experimental results from MAMI.

Motivation: Understanding the stability of the CUR radiation peak is essential for optimizing gamma-ray sources and advancing applications in fields like nuclear physics and imaging.

Method: The research employed relativistic molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the effect of bending parameters on the peak's characteristics. Isolines of constant energy were identified using the continuous potential approximation.

Result: Simulations reveal that bending amplitude decreases photon energies, while period increases them, both accompanied by enhanced dechannelling. Peak energies near 0.515 MeV were simulated for MAMI parameters.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that the CUR peak remains stable across a range of bending parameters, aiding in manufacturing tolerances and optimizing gamma-ray source designs.

Abstract: We investigate the stability of crystalline undulator radiation (CUR) peaks emitted by 530 MeV positron channelling in periodically bent C(110) crystals with varying bending amplitudes and bending periods. Relativistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed to quantify how these parameters affect the intensity and position of the CUR peak. The continuous potential approximation was used to identify isolines of constant peak energy, providing a reference for regions of spectral stability. MD results show that increasing the bending amplitude shifts the CUR peak to lower photon energies, while decreasing the period shifts it to higher energies, with both trends accompanied by enhanced dechannelling. For crystal parameters similar to recent experiments conducted at the MAinz MIkrotron (MAMI), the simulated CUR peak appears near 0.515 MeV. These results demonstrate that the CUR peak remains stable across a broad range of bending amplitudes and periods, establishing estimates of manufacturing tolerances for the design of gamma-ray crystal-based light sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores how biological soft matter, specifically hydrated DNA, responds to electromagnetic fields, which is relevant for understanding biological systems under ambient conditions.

Method: The study involves measuring the transverse voltage and polarization signals in DNA under magnetic fields at varying temperatures, analyzing the threshold and temperature dependence of these responses.

Result: The results show a sharp voltage threshold and phase-stable oscillations in polarization, consistent with collective mode formation in the DNA-water interface. The voltage is attributed to coherent dipolar dynamics, not steady carrier transport.

Conclusion: This research provides insights into the collective polarization dynamics of hydrated DNA, which can be applied to study other biological soft matter systems under electromagnetic fields.

Abstract: Understanding how biological soft matter responds to electromagnetic fields under ambient conditions remains a central challenge, as thermal fluctuations are generally expected to suppress long-range organization. Here, we report that hydrated DNA exhibits a reproducible magnetic-field-induced transition characterized by a sharp transverse-voltage threshold (40-50 mV), followed by a regime of regular, phase-stable oscillations in the transverse polarization signal. These features emerge only beyond the threshold and display a pronounced temperature dependence, consistent with the formation of a collective mode within the hydrogen-bond network of the DNA-water interface. Motivated by recent studies of Hall-like responses carried by neutral excitations, including phonons, magnons, and excitons, we interpret the observed transverse signal in terms of coherent polarization dynamics of proton-proton-hole dipoles confined to a quasi-two-dimensional hydrated layer. Within this framework, the transverse response is attributed to a field-organized polarization mode; the measured transverse voltage arises from collective dipolar dynamics rather than steady carrier transport. These results identify hydrated DNA as a soft-matter system in which magnetic field and temperature jointly modulate collective polarization dynamics, providing a biologically relevant platform for exploring coherence and transverse responses in hydrogen-bonded media.

Abstract: We address the problem of inferring the location of a target that releases odor in the presence of turbulence. Input for the inference is provided by many sensors scattered within the odor plume. Drawing inspiration from distributed chemosensation in biology, we ask whether the accuracy of the inference is affected by proprioceptive noise, i.e., noise on the perceived location of the sensors. Surprisingly, in the presence of a net fluid flow, proprioceptive noise improves Bayesian inference, rather than degrading it. An optimal noise exists that efficiently leverages additional information hidden within the geometry of the odor plume. Empirical tuning of noise functions well across a range of distances and may be implemented in practice. Other sources of noise also improve accuracy, owing to their ability to break the spatiotemporal correlations of the turbulent plume. These counterintuitive benefits of noise may be leveraged to improve sensory processing in biology and robotics.

Abstract: We report reproducible track-detector signals consistent with slow neutron capture events, recorded in D$_2$O electrolysis involving D-Pd deposited on Pt cathode. Sensitivity to slow neutrons was achieved using boron-coated CR-39 (BCR) detectors, which register charged particle tracks arising from the $^{10}$B$(n,α)^{7}$Li reaction. These detectors were positioned adjacent to identically prepared uncoated CR-39 control detectors (CCR), which are effectively insensitive to slow neutrons and serve to quantify background contributions from charged particles and fast neutrons under the present experimental conditions. A reproducible differential detector signature (BCR $>$ CCR) would thus indicative of slow neutron fluences. Across multiple independent D$_2$O electrolysis experiments in $0.25~\mathrm{T}$ field, the BCR exhibited significantly excess track signals relative to CCRs. Under these conditions, the observed differential response corresponds to an inferred detector-equivalent slow neutron flux of approximately $(6.7 \pm 0.2)~\mathrm{cm^{-2},s^{-1}}$. Removal of the magnetic field resulted in a reduction of the differential signal by a factor of $\sim6$, indicating a strong empirical dependence on the applied field. In contrast, H$_2$O electrolysis performed under otherwise identical conditions produced no measurable differential detector response, establishing the necessity of deuterated electrochemical conditions for the observed effect. The results are reported strictly as detector signatures consistent with slow neutron capture and do not assert any theoretical explanation. Instead, this work establishes a control verified and detector validated experimental protocol for detecting low flux slow neutrons, and provides empirical constraints relevant to slow neutron studies in experiments involving metal-deuteride systems.

Abstract: This study aims to improve the TauFinder reconstruction algorithm for the MAIA detector concept. Through this work, we seek to increase the reconstruction efficiency and identification of hadronically decaying tau leptons. Through our work, we introduce a dynamic signal cone, known as a shrinking cone, which adjusts its size based on the transverse momentum of the tau candidate. In addition to the already studied one charged hadron and three charged hadron decay modes we extend TauFinder to include decays that consist of one charged hadron and up to two neutral pions. Furthermore, we have developed a tagger that prevents electrons being misidentified as one-prong tau candidates. Applying this tagger results in near-perfect electron rejection with negligible decrease in one-prong tau reconstruction efficiency.

Abstract: The operation of instruments and detectors in laboratory or beamline environments presents a complex challenge, requiring stable operation of multiple concurrent devices, often controlled by separate hardware and software solutions. These environments frequently undergo modifications, such as the inclusion of different auxiliary devices depending on the experiment or facility, adding further complexity. The successful management of such dynamic configurations demands a flexible and robust system capable of controlling data acquisition, monitoring experimental setups, enabling seamless reconfiguration, and integrating new devices with limited effort.
  This paper presents Constellation, a flexible and network-distributed control and data acquisition software framework tailored to laboratory and beamline environments, that addresses the limitations of existing solutions. The framework is designed with a focus on extensibility, providing a streamlined interface for instrument integration. It supports efficient system setup via network discovery mechanisms, promotes stability through autonomous operational features, and provides comprehensive documentation and supporting tools for operators and application developers such as controllers and logging interfaces.
  At the core of the architectural design is the autonomy of the individual components, called satellites, which can make independent decisions about their operation and communicate these decisions to other components. This paper introduces the design principles and framework architecture of Constellation, presents the available graphical user interfaces, shares insights from initial successful deployments, and provides an outlook on future developments and applications.

TL;DR: Luxium's BCF-XL fibers show improved temporal resolution compared to the multi-clad Y-11 fiber.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comparing the performance of single-clad and multi-clad fibers is crucial for applications in optical communication and sensing, where temporal resolution and attenuation length are key factors.

Method: The study involves measuring the decay times and attenuation lengths of Luxium's BCF-92XL, BCF-9929AXL, and BCF-9995XL fibers versus the multi-clad Kuraray Y-11 fiber.

Result: Luxium's BCF-XL fibers exhibit faster decay times—92XL: 2.10±0.01 ns, 9929AXL: 2.10±0.02 ns, 9995XL: 2.41±0.03 ns—compared to the Y-11 fiber's 7.44±0.06 ns. Their attenuation lengths are within comparable ranges up to 3.2 m.

Conclusion: Luxium's BCF-XL fibers demonstrate superior temporal resolution alongside near-equivalent attenuation performance, making them a strong contender forEnhanced time resolution while maintaining comparable light yields compared to single-clad Y-11 fibers application in high-speed optical communication and sensing systems.

Abstract: We evaluate the performance of single-clad wavelength-shifting fibers newly developed by Luxium Solutions, BCF-92XL, BCF-9929AXL, and BCF-9995XL and compare them with the multi-clad Kuraray Y-11 fiber. The BCF-XL fibers exhibit faster decay times (92XL: $2.10\pm0.01$ ns, 9929AXL: $2.10\pm0.02$ ns, 9995XL: $2.41\pm0.03$ ns) than Y-11 ($7.44\pm0.06$ ns). The attenuation lengths are comparable to that of Y-11 within the measurement range up to 3.2 m. When coupled to an EJ-204 plastic scintillator, the BCF-XL fibers achieve superior time resolution while maintaining light yields comparable to those expected for a single-clad Y-11 fiber.

### [66] [Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments: A Hierarchical Taxonomy for Autonomous Large-Scale Facilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06978)
*James Le Houx*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: We propose a 6-level taxonomy called BASE Scale to benchmark autonomy in scientific experiments, addressing the limitations of the current SAE J3016 standard and owner-operator models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving full autonomy in scientific experiments requires a standardized benchmarking system that fits the operational rigidities of Large-Scale User Facilities, which are incompatible with existing frameworks.

Method: We define the BASE Scale with six levels (0-5), each specifying technical requirements, focusing on zero-shot deployment, inference barriers, and semantic digital twins to enable real-time decision-making.

Result: The proposed BASE Scale provides a standardized metric for evaluating autonomy, facilitating risk assessment, liability definition, and workflow intelligence quantification.

Conclusion: The BASE Scale offers a solution for operational automation in scientific experiments, enabling efficient and standardized performance evaluation without relying on an operator for training or involvement.

Abstract: The transition from automated data collection to fully autonomous discovery requires a shared vocabulary to benchmark progress. While the automotive industry relies on the SAE J3016 standard, current taxonomies for autonomous science presuppose an owner-operator model that is incompatible with the operational rigidities of Large-Scale User Facilities. Here, we propose the Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments (BASE) Scale, a 6-level taxonomy (Levels 0-5) specifically adapted for these unique constraints. Unlike owner-operator models, User Facilities require zero-shot deployment where agents must operate immediately without extensive training periods. We define the specific technical requirements for each tier, identifying the Inference Barrier (Level 3) as the critical latency threshold where decisions shift from scalar feedback to semantic digital twins. Fundamentally, this level extends the decision manifold from spatial exploration to temporal gating, enabling the agent to synchronise acquisition with the onset of transient physical events. By establishing these operational definitions, the BASE Scale provides facility directors, funding bodies, and beamline scientists with a standardised metric to assess risk, define liability, and quantify the intelligence of experimental workflows.

Abstract: Thin polymer films are widely used as functional and protective coatings. However, determining the composition and processing conditions that produce a desired function is a tedious process due to the large number of factors that must be considered and the manual nature of most synthesis and characterization methods. Self-driving labs (SDLs), or robotic systems that prepare and test materials samples, are designed to overcome this bottleneck by enabling the efficient exploration of complex parameter spaces. In this paper, we report the development and testing of the polymer analysis and discovery array (PANDA)-film, a modular SDL for electrochemically synthesizing polymer films and then determining their water contact angle as a measure of surface energy. The system is designed to be highly modular and based upon a lowcost gantry platform to facilitate adoption. In addition to validating fluid handling and electrochemical tasks, we introduce two novel modular capabilities that enable PANDA-film to run sustained campaigns to study the wetting properties of films: (1) an electromagnetic capping/decapping system to mitigate fluid evaporation, and (2) a top-down optical method to determine water contact angle based upon reflectance. These capabilities are validated by depositing and characterizing a poly(allyl methacrylate) (PAMA) film using electrodeposition of polymer networks (EPoN). Comprehensive details for replicating the hardware and software of PANDA-film are included.

Abstract: Ionizing radiation (X-rays, proton beams) causes structural changes in materials. If a vibrating metallic wire is subjected to such radiation, the natural frequency of the wire is affected as a result of changes in the elastic characteristics of the material. This paper presents the results of experiments on the impact of X-ray radiation in the range of 100-165 keV and a proton beam with energy 18 MeV on the structure of stainless steel wire. In case of proton irradiation an irreversible change in the wire frequency was observed, which indicated residual changes in the structure of the wire material. X-ray diffractometry methods were used to analyze the structural changes.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: During the LHC Long Shutdown 3 (2026-29) ALICE will replace its three innermost tracking layers by a new detector, the "ITS3". It will be based on newly developed, wafer-scale monolithic active pixel sensors, which are bent into truly cylindrical layers and held in place by light mechanics made from carbon foam. Unprecedented low values of material budget (0.09\% $X_0$ per layer) and proximity to the interaction point (19 mm) lead to a factor two improvement in pointing resolutions for particles from very low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ (O(100 MeV/$c$)), achieving, for example, 20 $μ$m and 15 $μ$m in the transversal and longitudinal directions, respectively, for 1 GeV/$c$ particles. After a successful R&D phase (2019-2023), which demonstrated the feasibility of this innovative detector and led to the Technical Design Report (https://cds.cern.ch/record/2890181/), the final sensor and mechanics are being developed right now.
  This contribution will review the conceptual design and the main R&D achievements, as well as the current activities and road to completion and installation. It includes a projection of the improved physics performance, in particular for heavy-flavor mesons and baryons, as well as for thermal dielectrons that will come into reach with this new detector installed.

*Sara Zoccheddu,Shah Rukh Qasim,Patrick Owen,Nicola Serra*

TL;DR: LLMs can generate valid and effective physics instrument designs without task-specific training, complementing RL-based methods for hybrid workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the use of LLMs and RL in physics instrument design to find a hybrid approach that combines their strengths.

Method: The study compares prompting LLMs with RL by evaluating their designs via simulators and reward functions, focusing on resource-awareness and knowledge transfer.

Result: While RL yields stronger designs, LLMs generate valid and meaningful configurations, suggesting they are suitable as meta-planners.

Conclusion: LLMs and RL can complement each other in automated, closed-loop design processes, reducing human effort in optimization.

Abstract: We study the use of large language models (LLMs) for physics instrument design and compare their performance to reinforcement learning (RL). Using only prompting, LLMs are given task constraints and summaries of prior high-scoring designs and propose complete detector configurations, which we evaluate with the same simulators and reward functions used in RL-based optimization. Although RL yields stronger final designs, we find that modern LLMs consistently generate valid, resource-aware, and physically meaningful configurations that draw on broad pretrained knowledge of detector design principles and particle--matter interactions, despite having no task-specific training. Based on this result, as a first step toward hybrid design workflows, we explore pairing the LLMs with a dedicated trust region optimizer, serving as a precursor to future pipelines in which LLMs propose and structure design hypotheses while RL performs reward-driven optimization. Based on these experiments, we argue that LLMs are well suited as meta-planners: they can design and orchestrate RL-based optimization studies, define search strategies, and coordinate multiple interacting components within a unified workflow. In doing so, they point toward automated, closed-loop instrument design in which much of the human effort required to structure and supervise optimization can be reduced.

Motivation: The motivation behind the research is accurate measurement of photon flux, especially for experiments involving GlueX and precise cross-section measurements.

Method: The method involves using electron-positron pairs produced in a thin converter within the photon beam to determine the energy spectrum of the photons.

Result: The Pair Spectrometer enables precise determination of photon flux, enhances the energy spectrum's accuracy, and serves as a test facility for calorimeter prototypes.

Conclusion: The Pair Spectrometer effectively contributes to both real-time photon flux measurements and prototype testing, supporting high-precision physics analyses.

Abstract: This article describes the performance of the pair spectrometer installed in experimental Hall D at Jefferson Lab and its operation in multiple experiments with the GlueX detector. The primary purpose of the pair spectrometer is the precise determination of the flux of beam photons incident on the GlueX target, a critical input for physics analyses such as absolute cross-section measurements. The photon energy spectrum is determined by reconstructing electron-positron pairs produced in a thin converter inserted into the photon beam. The spectrometer is integrated into the GlueX trigger system, enabling continuous real-time monitoring of the photon flux and the recording of $e^+e^-$ pair candidates for offline analysis. In addition, the pair spectrometer provides a versatile test facility for evaluating calorimeter prototypes using leptons with well-defined energies produced via electromagnetic pair production.

TL;DR: 3-View fiber geometries significantly reduce ghost hits and improve vertex and angular resolution compared to 2-View geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing precision requirements in nuclear and particle physics necessitate the development of more accurate detector technologies.

Method: Comprehensive simulation benchmarks were conducted to evaluate the performance differences between 2-View and 3-View geometries in terms of ghost hit reduction, vertex resolution, and angular resolution.

Result: 3-View geometries reduce ghost hits by 30-90% depending on event topology, provide robust vertex resolution, and maintain superior angular resolution.

Conclusion: The findings support the use of 3-View geometries in the design optimization of future detectors and provide valuable insights for reconstruction algorithm development in various experimental contexts.

Abstract: Fine-grained scintillator detectors are critical for precision measurements in nuclear and particle physics, where accurate reconstruction of interaction vertices and secondary particle directions enables separation of signal from background events. A well-known design choice is the fiber readout geometry: traditional 2-View systems use orthogonal X and Y fibers, while next-generation 3-View designs add a third Z-fiber layer that provides unambiguous 3D voxel identification. The 2-View approach suffers from combinatorial ghost hits, that the false 3D candidates arising from fiber projection ambiguities, degrading reconstruction performance in high-multiplicity events. This paper presents comprehensive simulation benchmarks quantifying the performance difference between 2-View and 3-View geometries across key metrics. We find that the 3-View geometry reduces ghost hits by 30--90\% depending on event topology, provides robust vertex resolution across complex topologies, and maintains superior angular resolution for shower direction reconstruction. These benchmarks inform the design optimization of future detectors and provide quantitative guidance for reconstruction algorithm development across a broad range of experiments including neutrino physics, rare kaon/pion decays, and collider calorimetry.

Conclusion: 该研究通过创新的实验方法，为杂散电子探测器在电子成像中的应用提供了有效解决方案，标志着在高分辨率电子显微镜中的重要进展。

Abstract: Due to their radiation hardness, kilohertz frame rates, and high dynamic range, hybrid pixel detectors have recently expanded their application range to electron diffraction and recently also electron imaging. However, these detectors typically have pixel sizes about ten times larger than those of direct electron detectors commonly used for imaging and more prominent electron multiple scattering effects. To overcome these limitations, machine learning approaches can be utilized to reconstruct the electron entrance point and achieve super-resolution. As this process is inherently stochastic, and machine learning relies on suitable training data, high-quality, representative training data are essential for developing models that achieve the best possible resolution. In this work, we present two novel experimental methods for generating such training data. The first method employs precise microscope alignment to scan the detector plane using a finely focused electron beam of 2 μm diameter, enabling controlled sub-pixel mapping. The second method utilizes specially designed aperture masks with sub-pixel-sized holes to accurately localize electron entry points. We developed and validated two experimental strategies for collecting training data at acceleration voltages of 60, 80, 120, and 200 keV, which enable sub-pixel labeling for hybrid pixel detectors. Notably, our methodology is broadly applicable to a wide range of hybrid pixel detectors.

Result: Silicate bioceramics have shown potential in medical applications, but the role of co-doping remains unclear.

Conclusion: Research into co-doped silicate bioceramics is needed to explore their enhanced properties and applications.

Abstract: Silicate bioceramics have attracted significant attention in medical applications, particularly in hard tissue regeneration, because of their controllable chemical, physical, and biological functionalities, while ensuring biocompatibility. The coordination of silicate bioceramics with mono-dopants has been extensively studied to enhance their osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and antibacterial activity. However, the concept of employing dual or multiple co-doping to further enhance these biomaterials still demands more attention. This review paper originally focuses on the effect of chemical interactions among co-dopants and the principal constituents of the silicates, on the bio-behavior of these bioceramics. Additionally, future prospects of co-doped silicate bioceramics are outlined, including in vivo studies, clinical trials, and potential commercialization.

TL;DR: A computational and theoretical study shows that the vibrational modes commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor are the main source of deviation from Förster's theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the deviation from Förster's theory is important for improving exciton transfer models in organic semiconductors and OLEDs.

Method: Electronic couplings are estimated using time-dependent density function theory and the transition dipole approximation, and the contributions of bridge electronic states and vibrational modes are analyzed.

Result: The main source of deviation from Förster's theory is the vibrational modes commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor.

Conclusion: The vibrational modes that are shared between donor and acceptor are the primary contributors to the enhanced exciton transfer.

Abstract: The rates of exciton transfer within dyads of perylene diimide and terrylene diimide connected by oligophenylene bridge units have been shown to deviate significantly from those of Förster's resonance energy transfer theory, according to single molecule spectroscopy experiments. The present work provides a detailed computational and theoretical study investigating the source of such discrepancy. Electronic spectroscopy data are calculated by time-dependent density function theory and then compared with experimental results. Electronic couplings between exciton donor and acceptor are estimated based on both transition density cube method and transition dipole approximation. These results confirm that the delocalization of exciton to the bridge parts contribute to significant enhancement of donor-acceptor electronic coupling. Mechanistic details of exciton transfer are examined by estimating the contributions of the bridge electronic states, vibrational modes of the dyads commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor, inelastic resonance energy transfer mechanism, and dark exciton states. These analyses suggest that the contribution of common vibrational modes serves as the main source of deviation from Förster's spectral overlap expression.

*Ademola Soyemi,Tibor Szilvasi*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the electrolyte-graphene interface and discovers that SO4^2- ions accumulate in the interfacial water layer, contradicting the conventional understanding of cation preference. Using machine learning simulations and SFG spectra, the study reveals the molecular origins of this phenomenon, showing that Na+ ions are more likely to accumulate in the outer water layers and SO4^2- within the second interfacial water layer, leading to a negatively charged interfacial region due to a sub-stoichiometric Na+/SO4^2- ratio. The SFG spectra support this finding through the enhanced and red-shifted spectra in the hydrogen-bonded region as Na2SO4 concentration increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of ions at interfaces is crucial for various applications, such as battery technology and sensing devices. This study specifically addresses the unexpected accumulation of SO4^2- ions at the Na2SO4,aq-graphene interface, which deviates from the conventional cation preference.

Method: The study employs machine learning interatomic potential-based simulations and simulated sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra. The machine learning model helps predict the interatomic interactions, while the SFG spectra are used to analyze the orientational order of water molecules and identify the regions of charge accumulation.

Result: The research demonstrates that Na+ ions accumulate in the outermost and second water layers, while SO4^2- ions are found within the second interfacial water layer. The interfacial region close to the graphene sheet is negatively charged due to a sub-stoichiometric Na+/SO4^2- ratio. Additionally, the simulated SFG spectra exhibit enhanced and red-shifted features in the hydrogen-bonded region, correlating with the changes in water molecular order as the Na2SO4 concentration increases.

Conclusion: The findings reveal that ion stratification and ion-induced water reorganization are key mechanisms in determining the structure and properties of electrolyte-graphene interfaces. This challenges the conventional understanding of ion accumulation at such interfaces and provides a deeper insight into the factors influencing the distribution of ions and water molecules near the interface.

Abstract: The distribution of ions and their impact on the structure of electrolyte interfaces plays an important role in many applications. Interestingly, recent experimental studies have suggested the preferential accumulation of $SO_4^{2-}$ ions at the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interface in disagreement with the generally known tendency of cations to accumulate at graphene-electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we resolve the atomistic structure of the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interfaces in the 0.1-2.0 M concentration range using machine learning interatomic potential-based simulations and simulated sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra to reveal the molecular origins of the conundrum. Our results show that Na+ ions accumulate between the outermost and second water layers whereas $SO_4^{2-}$ ions accumulate within the second interfacial water layer indicating cation dominated interfaces. We find that the interfacial region (within ~10 $Å$ of the graphene sheet) is negatively charged due to sub-stoichiometric $Na^+$/$SO_4^{2-}$ ratio at the interface. Our simulated SFG spectra show enhancement and a red-shift of the spectra in the hydrogen bonded region as a function of $Na_2SO_4$ concentration similar to measurements due to $SO_4^{2-}$-induced changes in the orientational order of water molecules in the second interfacial layer. Our study demonstrates that ion stratification and ion-induced water reorganization are key elements of understanding the electrolyte-graphene interface.

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of key isomers of C2H4N2 using state-of-the-art quantum chemical methods. The objective is to characterize their molecular structures, spectroscopic constants, and electronic energies, and to elucidate plausible formation and destruction pathways, providing data critical for astrochemical and atmospheric detection. High-accuracy ab initio methods were employed, notably CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 for optimized geometries. Additional calculations were performed at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ, CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ, MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ, and CIS levels. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to explore reaction pathways. Zero-point energy corrections were determined for all isomers considered. Six low-energy C2H4N2 isomers were identified, all within 1 eV of the global minimum. Among them, methylcyanamide (MCA) exhibits the lowest relative energy (~0.2 eV) and a significant electric dipole moment of 5.00 D, making it a strong candidate for gas-phase detection. The rotational constants for MCA, computed at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level, are Ae = 34932.44 MHz, Be = 4995.31 MHz, and Ce = 4520.30 MHz. The V3 torsional barrier was found to be 631.19 cm^{-1}. Centrifugal distortion constants were computed up to sextic order for all isomers. Formation pathways for MCA, such as CH3N + HCN -> CH3NHCN and related isomers, were characterized. The combination of large dipole moments and distinct rotational signatures supports the detectability of methylcyanamide and related C2H4N2 isomers via radioastronomy, infrared, and microwave spectroscopy. Isomerization and reaction pathways involving radical-neutral and neutral-neutral processes were found to be key to their formation in gas-phase environments. These results provide a robust foundation for future observational and modeling efforts.

Abstract: The electric field gradients (EFGs) at the (non-spherical) nucleus contribute to atomic and molecular hyperfine structure and govern Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) and Mössbauer spectra. EFGs provide a highly sensitive probe of local bonding, symmetry, and crystal defect geometry and electronic structure. The EFGs can be obtained from electronic structure calculations and can also be extracted from spectroscopic measurements, thus linking electronic structure theory and spectroscopic observables. In this work, we present a methodological study of EFGs for a range of molecules and crystalline materials, using both periodic boundary conditions and embedded cluster models, and compare the results with reported experimental data. We analyze the sensitivity of EFG values to details of the calculations, such as the selection of the model Hamiltonians, basis sets, and the geometries of molecules and crystals. We also address persistent differences in EFG sign conventions and tensor definitions employed in the literature and in widely used quantum chemistry codes. While the EFG sign does not affect zero B-field NQR spectra, they can become critical in Mossbauer spectroscopy or when the quadrupolar interactions are combined with other interactions of the nucleus with the environment. Together, our systematic study results provide practical guidelines for computing, interpreting, and exploiting EFGs as quantitative descriptors of electronic structure and chemical environment.

*Tianlv Xu,Jiawen Kong,Tianjing Zhou,Yan Wang,Jingqin Tu,Alireza Azizi,Steven R. Kirk,Samantha Jenkins*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Attosecond science demonstrates that iodoacetylene, a geometrically achiral molecule, can exhibit the fastest chirality reversals using simulated non-ionizing ultrafast circularly polarized laser pulses, achieving a reversal speed of 3.87 attoseconds. Quantum chemical physics theory and electronic/nuclear dynamics simulations support this finding by quantifying the motion of the electronic charge density in specific directions, forming a cardioid-like morphology during and a toroidal shape afterward. This work opens avenues for exploring chiral induced spin selectivity and applications in opto-spintronics and exotic superconductors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is the exploration of chirality in attosecond science and its potential applications in opto-spintronics and exotic superconductors, aiming to understand how to control and utilize chirality for technological advancements.

Method: The research employs quantum chemical physics theory and electronic/nuclear dynamics simulations. The method does not require charge density differences or special symmetry positions, making use of the vector-based theory to analyze the motion of the electronic charge density in specific directions, identifying 'easy' and 'hard' directions of motion.

Result: The results confirm that iodoacetylene, despite being geometrically achiral, exhibits the fastest reversals of electronic chirality assignments achieved by two orders of magnitude (3.87 attoseconds). The simulations reveal a cardioid-like morphology of the electronic charge density motion during the laser pulses and a toroidal shape afterward, providing a clear understanding of the mechanism governing these reversals.

Conclusion: This groundbreaking study advances our understanding of chirality in attosecond science, demonstrating a new level of chirality reversals in achiral molecules. The findings not only highlight the potential of these reversals in opto-spintronics but also open up new directions for exploring chiral phenomena in materials science and beyond, with implications for the development of novel technologies.

Abstract: Attosecond science is an emerging topic where chirality plays a central role. Here we demonstrate that subjecting iodoacetylene,a geometrically achiral molecule, to a pair of simulated non-ionizing ultrafast circularly polarized laser pulses induces the fastest reversals of the continuously-valued S and R electronic chirality assignments to date, by two orders of magnitude (3.87 attoseconds). We partner the only vector-based quantum chemical physics theory enabling full symmetry-breaking with electronic and nuclear dynamics simulations: the former does not require charge density differences or special symmetry positions. The resulting 'easy' and 'hard' directions of the total electronic charge density motion are quantified as a cardioid-like morphology for the duration of the simulated laser pulses and toroidal afterwards. Future research directions include determination of the underlying mechanism governing chiral induced spin selectivity, in addition to application to chiral spin selective phenomena in opto-spintronics and exotic superconductors, partnered with orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT).

Abstract: Clock transitions are well known in atomic and solid-state systems, but are largely unexplored in molecular liquids. Here we demonstrate a clock-like, nuclear-spin avoided crossing in [1--$^{13}$C]-fumarate that supports long-lived and directly observable coherences at ultralow magnetic field: a three-spin transition $|S_0α\rangle \leftrightarrow |T_{+1}β\rangle$ near 400 nT exhibits a shallow crossing with a frequency minimum of 2 Hz. The transition is first-order immune to magnetic field perturbations and displays a lifetime of 25 s, around three times the longest single-spin $T_2^*$. Sensitivity to effective pseudo-fields is also demonstrated, including the internal dipolar field of the sample.

Conclusion: 这项研究为计算和设计开放量子系统的混合时间奠定了理论基础，并对实际应用有指导意义。

Abstract: We analyze the mixing time of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation, showing it is not only determined by the Liouvillian gap, but also the trace norm of the lowest excited state of Liouvillian superoperator. By utilizing these universal predictors of mixing time, we establish general conditions for the fast and rapid mixing respectively. Specifically, we derive rapid mixing conditions for both the strong and weak dissipation regimes, formulated as sparsity constraints on the Hamiltonian and the local Lindblad operators. Our findings provide a general framework for calculating mixing time and offer a guide for designing dissipation to achieve desired mixing speeds, which has significant implications for efficient experimental state preparation.

TL;DR: The study extends Bell's framework to causal networks, using interventions to detect nonclassicality in scenarios with communication, but finds these interventions uninformative when all observable variables are space-like separated. The study introduces a new procedure called latent splitting, which allows for the detection of nonclassicality by combining observational and interventional data even when conventional interventions fail.

Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to explore and extend the application of Bell's framework to causal networks, particularly in scenarios involving communication and space-like separation, where conventional interventions may not be effective.

Method: The study employs a method that generalizes interventions to quantum networks through a procedure called latent splitting. This involves controlled manipulations of latent quantum systems to enable the detection of nonclassicality by combining observational and interventional data.

Result: The key results of this study are the introduction of a new procedure, latent splitting, and the derivation of new analytical witnesses for nonclassicality. These results improve the ability to detect nonclassicality in scenarios where conventional interventions are ineffective, particularly in space-like separated systems.

Conclusion: This study advances our understanding of nonclassicality detection by introducing a novel method that circumvents limitations of traditional interventions, providing a promising approach for future research in quantum networks and related fields.

Abstract: Generalizations of Bell's framework to causal networks have yielded new foundational insights and applications, including the use of interventions to enhance the detection of nonclassicality in scenarios with communication. Such interventions, however, become uninformative when all observable variables are space-like separated. To address this limitation, we introduce the latent splitting procedure, a generalization of interventions to quantum networks in which controlled manipulations are applied to latent quantum systems. We show that latent splitting enables the detection of nonclassicality by combining observational and interventional data even when conventional interventions fail. Focusing on the triangle network, we derive new analytical witnesses that robustly certify nonclassicality, including nonlinear inequalities for minimal binary-variable scenarios and extensions of the nonclassical region of previously proposed experiments.

TL;DR: The paper discusses quantum algorithms for simulating Lindbladian dynamics, focusing on unital Lindbladians and their efficient simulation using quantum channels and ancillary qubits. It also explores decoupling schemes and applications to dephasing models in electron-phonon systems, suggesting potential classical computational advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to develop efficient quantum algorithms for simulating complex quantum systems, particularly those exhibiting noise and decoherence, with potential applications in understanding electron-phonon interactions.

Method: The authors propose using quantum algorithms to simulate Lindbladian dynamics by sampling unitary quantum channels without requiring extra ancilla qubits. They also introduce a decoupling scheme for interacting dephasing Lindbladians, employing time-correlated probability distributions for reduced circuit complexity.

Result: The main results include the successful simulation of unital Lindbladians, a decoupling method for interacting dephasing systems, and the demonstration of a computational reduction in a specific model involving bosons and fermions coupled via dephasing. The simulation of a bosonic subsystem is reduced to sampling an instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuit, which can then be transformed into a simpler fermionic problem.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of their quantum algorithm to efficiently simulate certain dissipative quantum processes, pointing to implications for understanding complex quantum systems and their computational complexity.

Abstract: Noise and decoherence are ubiquitous in the dynamics of quantum systems coupled to an external environment. In the regime where environmental correlations decay rapidly, the evolution of a subsytem is well described by a Lindblad quantum master equation. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for simulating unital Lindbladian dynamics by sampling unitary quantum channels without extra ancillas. Using ancillary qubits we show that this algorithm allows approximating general Lindbladians as well. For interacting dephasing Lindbladians coupling two subsystems, we develop a decoupling scheme that reduces the circuit complexity of the simulation. This is achieved by sampling from a time-correlated probability distribution - determined by the evolution of one subsystem, which specifies the stochastic circuit implemented on the complementary subsystem. We demonstrate our approach by studying a model of bosons coupled to fermions via dephasing, which naturally arises from anharmonic effects in an electron-phonon system coupled to a bath. Our method enables tracing out the bosonic degrees of freedom, reducing part of the dynamics to sampling an instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuit. The sampled bitstrings then define a corresponding fermionic problem, which in the non-interacting case can be solved efficiently classically. We comment on the computational complexity of this class of dissipative problems, using the known fact that sampling from IQP circuits is believed to be difficult classically.

Abstract: The motion of atoms in programmable optical tweezer arrays offers many new opportunities for neutral atom quantum science. These include inter- and intra-site atom motion for resource-efficient implementations of fermionic and bosonic modes, respectively, as well as tweezer transport for efficient compilation of arbitrary circuits. However, the exploitation of atomic motion for all three purposes and others is limited by the inertia of the atoms. We present a comprehensive architectural blueprint for the use of fermionic metastable helium-3 ($^3$He$^*$) atoms -- the lightest trappable atomic species -- in programmable optical tweezer arrays. This includes a concrete analysis of atomic structure considerations as well as Rydberg-mediated interactions. We show that inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atoms can be $\gtrsim3\times$ faster than previous demonstrations with lithium-6. We also demonstrate a new toolbox for encoding and manipulating qubits directly in the tweezer trap potential, uniquely enabled by the light mass of $^3$He$^*$. Finally, we provide several examples of new opportunities for fermionic quantum simulation and computation that leverage the transport and inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atom arrays. These tools present new methods to improve the resource efficiency of neutral atom quantum science that may also enable quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories and quantum chemistry outside the Born-Oppenheimer approximation

Abstract: In recent years, control methods based on different optimization techniques have shed light on the possibilities of processing information in many quantum systems. When exploring the transmission of quantum states, faster transmission times are mandatory to avoid the deleterious effects of multiple sources of decoherence that spoil the transmission process. In particular, using Reinforcement Learning to devise sequences of step-wise external controls provides good transfer policies at short transmission times. We present two approaches to control the transmission of quantum states in qubit chains using external controls to force the dynamical evolution of the chain state. The first approach relies on the well-known Genetic Algorithm to generate a sequence of external controls, while the second approach uses a variant of Reinforcement Learning. The Genetic algorithm achieves excellent transmission fidelity at as short transmission times as Reinforcement Learning, surpassing the fidelities achieved by the latter method. Nevertheless, the Reinforcement Learning method offers robust control policies when the control pulses are noisy enough, owing to an imperfect timing of the pulses, deficient control devices, or other sources of phase decoherence. We present the regime where each method is best suited to control the transmission of arbitrary qubit states.

Abstract: After a quantum quench, the integrable system is expected to relax to a non-thermal equilibrium state (NTES) whose local properties are believed to be governed by a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). Combining quench action and the form factor approach, we compute the field-field correlation in the NTES produced by an interaction quench of the Lieb-Liniger model. The spectral distribution is shown to be qualitatively different from that of a thermal equilibrium state (TES): a new dispersion branch appears whose microscopic mechanism can be traced to the algebraic decaying tail for the root density distribution function, and indicates the existence of a broader family of NTES featuring similar spectral property.

Result: While the authors propose an alternative definition of quantum work, they do not fully resolve the tension between classical and quantum work concepts. There remains ambiguity about what constitutes 

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper reveals that there is no universal quantum work concept that can fully preserve classical features. This raises important questions about the criteria for successful generalization of the work concept in quantum thermodynamics.

Abstract: This paper diagnoses a much-discussed problem in quantum thermodynamics, that of generalizing classical work into the quantum domain. I begin with the no-go theorem of Perarnau-Llobet et al (2017): no universal measurement scheme for quantum work satisfies two intuitive, classically consilient desiderata. I assess this incompatibility as stemming from the measurement problem. Decoherence restores compatibility for all practical purposes, but raises questions about what 'universality' should mean and whether any measurement scheme can be 'universal'. I consider a different standard of universality -- in terms of ontology -- by defining a trajectory-based notion of quantum work using the quantum potential. While this preserves the classical role of work as the integral of forces over distances, and evades the tension of the no-go theorem, consilience fails elsewhere; no single quantum work concept seems capable of preserving all classical features, raising questions for what it takes for successful generalization of the work concept to quantum thermodynamics.

Abstract: Achieving full control of a Bose-Einstein condensate can have valuable applications in metrology, quantum information processing, and quantum condensed matter physics. We propose protocols to simultaneously control the internal (related to its pseudospin-1/2) and motional (position-related) states of a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a Morse potential. In the presence of synthetic spin-orbit coupling, the state transition of a noninteracting condensate can be implemented by Raman coupling and detuning terms designed by invariant-based inverse engineering. The state transfer may also be driven by tuning the direction of the spin-orbit-coupling field and modulating the magnitude of the effective synthetic magnetic field. The results can be generalized for interacting condensates by changing the time-dependent detuning to compensate for the interaction. We find that a two-level algorithm for the inverse engineering remains numerically accurate even if the entire set of possible states is considered. The proposed approach is robust against the laser-field noise and systematic device-dependent errors.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Measurement-Based Quantum Computing (MBQC) is inherently well-suited for Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC): once a resource state is prepared and distributed across a network of quantum nodes, computation proceeds through local measurements coordinated by classical communication. However, since non-local gates acting on different Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) are a bottleneck, it is crucial to optimize the qubit assignment to minimize inter-node entanglement of the shared resource. For graph state resources shared across two QPUs, this task reduces to finding bipartitions with minimal cut rank. We introduce a simulated annealing-based algorithm that efficiently updates the cut rank when two vertices swap sides across a bipartition, such that computing the new cut rank from scratch, which would be much more expensive, is not necessary. We show that the approach is highly effective for determining qubit assignments in distributed MBQC by testing it on grid graphs and the measurement-based Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).

Abstract: We study the on-resonance Spin-1/2 Double Kicked Rotor, a periodically driven quantum system that hosts topological phases. Motivated by experimental constraints, we analyze the effects of open and periodic boundary conditions in contrast to the idealized case of infinite momentum space. As a bulk probe for topological invariants, we focus on the Mean Chiral Displacement (MCD) and show that it exhibits a pronounced sensitivity to boundary conditions, which can be traced to the dynamics in momentum space. Under open boundaries, states that would otherwise extend freely become localized at the edges of the finite momentum space, forming quasienergy edge states. While the bulk response measured by the MCD is strongly affected once the evolving wave packet reaches the boundaries, the persistence of these edge states still reflects the bulk-edge correspondence and provides reliable signatures of topological transitions.

Abstract: We provide novel linear combination of unitaries decompositions for a class of discrete elliptic differential operators. Specifically, Poisson problems augmented with periodic, Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and mixed boundary conditions are considered on the unit interval and on higher-dimensional rectangular domains. The number of unitary terms required for our decomposition is independent of the number of grid points used in the discretization and scales linearly with the spatial dimension. Explicit circuit constructions for each unitary are given and their complexities analyzed. The worst case depth and elementary gate cost of any such circuit is shown to scale at most logarithmically with respect to number of grid points in the underlying discrete system. We also investigate the cost of using our method within the Variational Quantum Linear Solver algorithm and show favorable scaling. Finally, we extend the proposed decomposition technique to treat problems that include first-order derivative terms with variable coefficients.

Abstract: In quantum information processing, implementing arbitrary preparations and measurements on qubits necessitates precise information to identify a specific reference frame (RF). In space quantum communication and sensing, where a shared RF is absent, the interplay between locality and symmetry imposes fundamental restrictions on physical systems. A restriction on realizable unitary operations results in a no-go theorem prohibiting the extraction of locally encoded information in RF-independent distributed metrology. Here, we propose a reversed-encoding method applied to two copies of local-unitary-invariant network states. This approach circumvents the no-go theorem while simultaneously mitigating decoherence-like noise caused by RF misalignment, thereby enabling the complete recovery of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Furthermore, we confirm local Bell-state measurements as an optimal strategy to saturate the QFI. Our findings pave the way for the field application of distributed quantum sensing, which is inherently subject to unknown RF misalignment and was previously precluded by the no-go theorem.

Abstract: We introduce a canonical decomposition of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for centered multimode Gaussian states into two additive pieces: an even part that captures changes in the symplectic spectrum and an odd part associated with correlation-generating dynamics. On the pure-state manifold, the even contribution vanishes identically, while the odd contribution coincides with the QFI derived from the natural metric on the Siegel upper half-space, revealing a direct geometric underpinning of pure-Gaussian metrology. This also provides a link between the graphical representation of pure Gaussian states and an explicit expression for the QFI in terms of graphical parameters. For evolutions completely generated by passive Gaussian unitaries (orthogonal symplectics), the odd QFI vanishes, while thermometric parameters contribute purely to the even sector with a simple spectral form; we also derive a state-dependent lower bound on the even QFI in terms of the purity-change rate. We extend the construction to the full QFI matrix, obtaining an additive even odd sector decomposition that clarifies when cross-parameter information vanishes. Applications to unitary sensing (beam splitter versus two-mode squeezing) and to Gaussian channels (loss and phase-insensitive amplification), including joint phase loss estimation, demonstrate how the decomposition cleanly separates resources associated with spectrum versus correlations. The framework supplies practical design rules for continuous-variable sensors and provides a geometric lens for benchmarking probes and channels in Gaussian quantum metrology.

Abstract: Local realism has been the subject of much discussion in modern physics, partly because our deepest theories of physics appear to contradict one another in regard to whether reality is local. According to general relativity, it is, as physical quantities (perceptible or not) in two spacelike separated regions cannot affect one another. Yet, in quantum theory, it has traditionally been thought that local realism cannot hold and that such effects do occur. This apparent discrepancy between the two theories is resolved by Everettian quantum theory, as first proven by Deutsch & Hayden (2000). In this paper, I will explain how local realism is respected in quantum theory and review the advances in our understanding of locality since Deutsch & Hayden's work, including the concept of local branching and the more general analysis by Raymond-Robichaud (2021)

Motivation: Improving qubit operations in quantum computers by reducing PA nonlinearity effects through digital predistortion.

Method: Applied DPD based on measured control signals to correct PA output, using numerical analysis of qubit behavior.

Result: Numerical simulations show enhanced qubit gate fidelity when DPD is applied.

Conclusion: DPD effectively mitigates PA nonlinearities, promising applications in quantum computing systems.

Abstract: Power amplifiers (PA) are essential for microwavecontrolled trapped-ion and semiconductor spin based quantum computers (QC). They adjust the power level of the control signal and therefore the processing time of the QC. Their nonlinearities and memory effects degrade the signal quality and, thus, the fidelity of qubit gate operations. Driving the PA with a significant input power back-off reduces nonlinear effects but is neither power-efficient nor cost-effective. To overcome this limitation, this letter augments the conventional signal generation system applied in QCs by digital predistortion (DPD) to linearize the radio frequency (RF) channel. Numerical analysis of the qubit behavior based on measured representative control signals indicates that DPD improves its fidelity.

Abstract: We propose a current-carrying-chip scheme for generating spatial quantum superpositions using a levitating nanodiamond with a built-in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre defect. Our setup is quite versatile and we aim to create the superposition for a mass range of $10^{-19}~{\rm kg}< m< 10^{-15}~{\rm kg}$ and a superposition size ${\cal O}(10) {\rm μm} < Δx < {\cal O}(1){\rm nm}$, respectively, in $t\leq 0.1$s, depending on the position we launch from the center of the diamagnetic trap. We provide an in-depth analysis of two parallel chips that can create levitation and spatial superposition along the $x$-axis, while producing a very tight trap in the $y$ direction, and the direction of gravity, i.e., the $z$ direction. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our setup can create a one-dimensional spatial superposition state along the x-axis. Throughout this process, the particle is stably levitated in the z-direction, and its motion is effectively confined in the y-direction for a Gaussian initial condition. This setup presents a viable platform for a diamagnetically levitated nanoparticle for a table-top experiment exploring the possibility of creating a macroscopic Schrödinger Cat state to test the quantum gravity induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) protocol.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  the work is driven by the need to improve efficiency in quantum computing, specifically in reducing circuit noise which is a key challenge in quantum systems. innovations in quantum gate design are crucial for advancing practical quantum computing applications. this research proposes a novel three-qubit parity gate using Rydberg atoms, aiming to enhance computation speed and reliability.

Method:  the method involves developing and testing a parity gate based on Rydberg atoms. the research employs numerical analysis to optimize gate parameters and assesses the gate's robustness against errors such as the Rydberg blockade effect. this includes implementing the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and simulating the Ising Hamiltonian to evaluate the gate's performance in terms of computing outcomes and circuit depth.

Result:  the study shows that the proposed parity gate outperforms conventional CNOT and CZ gates in quantum computation tasks such as the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and Hamiltonian simulation. key improvements include enhanced gate fidelity and a reduction in circuit depth, leading to lower overall noise levels. these findings demonstrate the potential of the parity gate for improving the efficiency of quantum circuits.

Conclusion: this paper offers a promising approach to quantum gate design by leveraging Rydberg atoms for a three-qubit parity gate, which significantly enhances computational efficiency and fault tolerance.

Abstract: Quantum computation (QC) and digital quantum simulation (DQS) essentially require two- or multi-qubit controlled-NOT or -phase gates. We propose an alternative pathway for QC and DQS using a three-qubit parity gate in a Rydberg atom array. The basic principle of the Rydberg atom parity gate (RPG) is that the operation on the target qubit is controlled by the parity of the control qubits. First, we discuss how to construct an RPG based on a dark state resonance. We optimize the gate parameters by numerically analyzing the time evolution of the computational basis states to maximize the gate fidelity. We also show that our proposed RPG is extremely robust against the Rydberg blockade error. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed RPG over the conventional CNOT or CZ gate in QC and DQS, we implement the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and simulate the Ising Hamiltonian. The results show that RPG can be a better substitute of the CNOT gate to yield better results, as it decreases the circuit noise by reducing circuit depth.

Abstract: A fundamental problem of fault-tolerant quantum computation with quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes is the tradeoff between connectivity and universality. It is widely believed that in order to perform native logical non-Clifford gates, one needs to resort to 3D product-code constructions. In this work, we extend Kitaev's framework of non-Abelian topological codes on manifolds to non-Abelian qLDPC codes (realized as Clifford-stabilizer codes) and the corresponding combinatorial topological quantum field theories (TQFT) defined on Poincaré CW complexes and certain types of general chain complexes. We also construct the spacetime path integrals as topological invariants on these complexes. Remarkably, we show that native non-Clifford logical gates can be realized using constant-rate 2D hypergraph-product codes and their Clifford-stabilizer variants. This is achieved by a spacetime path integral effectively implementing the addressable gauging measurement of a new type of 0-form subcomplex symmetries, which correspond to addressable transversal Clifford gates and become higher-form symmetries when lifted to higher-dimensional CW complexes or manifolds. Building on this structure, we apply the gauging protocol to the magic state fountain scheme for parallel preparation of $O(\sqrt{n})$ disjoint CZ magic states with code distance of $O(\sqrt{n})$, using a total number of $n$ qubits.

TL;DR: Frequency-bin encoding enables high-speed quantum photonic processing in integrated photonics, but limited to discrete components. We propose a new method using acousto-optic scattering for universal, high-fidelity quantum operations with potential for high bandwidth utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability to realize arbitrary unitary operations with nontrivial numerical optimization is a cornerstone of quantum computing. However, the current limitation of integrated photonics to discrete components hinders scalability, prompting the exploration of alternative methods like acousto-optic scattering.

Method: Utilizes acousto-optic processes between distinct transverse modes for controllable phase matching, enabling FRODOs that can synthesize any unitary. The approach is feasible with existing CMOS technology, opening scalable on-chip quantum processing.

Result: The method shows feasibility for high-fidelity quantum operations with existing CMOS technology, with modeling of random gates and Fourier transforms demonstrating potential for 100% bandwidth utilization.

Conclusion: This paradigm shift allows for parallelizable frequency-domain quantum operations with practical integration capabilities, advancing scalable quantum photonic systems.

Abstract: Frequency-bin encoding offers tremendous potential in quantum photonic information processing, in which a single waveguide can support hundreds of lightpaths in a naturally phase-stable fashion. This stability, however, comes at a cost: arbitrary unitary operations can be realized by cascaded electro-optic phase modulators and pulse shapers, but require nontrivial numerical optimization for design and have thus far been limited to discrete tabletop components. In this article, we propose, formalize, and computationally evaluate a new paradigm for universal frequency-bin quantum information processing using acousto-optic scattering processes between distinct transverse modes. We show that controllable phase matching in intermodal processes enables 2$\times$2 frequency beamsplitters and transverse-mode-dependent phase shifters, which together comprise cascadable FRequency-transverse-mODe Operations (FRODOs) that can synthesize any unitary via analytical decomposition procedures. Modeling the performance of both random gates and discrete Fourier transforms, we demonstrate the feasibility of high-fidelity quantum operations with existing integrated photonics technology, highlighting prospects of parallelizable operations achieving 100\% bandwidth utilization. Our approach is realizable with CMOS technology, opening the door to scalable on-chip quantum information processing in the frequency domain.

Abstract: Germanium quantum dot hole spin qubits are compatible with fully electrical control and are progressing toward multi-qubit operations. However, their coherence is limited by charge noise and driving field induced frequency shifts, and the resulting ensemble $1/f$ dephasing. Here we theoretically demonstrate that a bichromatic driving scheme cancels the second order frequency shift from the control field without sacrificing the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) rate, and without additional gate design or microwave engineering. Based on this property, we further demonstrate that bichromatic control creates a wide operating window that reduces sensitivity to quasi-static charge noise and thus enhances single qubit gate fidelity. This method provides a low-power route to a stabler frequency operation in germanium hole spin qubits and is readily transferable to other semiconductor spin qubit platforms.

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is a quantum communication technology that offers an unconditional security guarantee. However, the practical deployment of CV-QKD systems remains vulnerable to various quantum attacks. In this paper, we propose a quantum machine learning (QML)-based attack detection framework (QML-ADF) that safeguards the security of high-rate CV-QKD systems. In particular, two alternative QML models -- quantum support vector machines (QSVM) and quantum neural networks (QNN) -- are developed to perform noise-resistant and feature-aware attack detection before conventional data postprocessing. Leveraging feature-rich quantum data from Gaussian modulation and homodyne detection, the QML-ADF effectively detects quantum attacks, including both known and unknown types defined by these distinctive features. The results indicate that all twelve distinct QML variants for both QSVM and QNN exhibit remarkable performance in detecting both known and previously undiscovered quantum attacks, with the best-performing QSVM variant outperforming the top QNN counterpart. Furthermore, we systematically evaluate the performance of the QML-ADF under various physically interpretable noise backends, demonstrating its strong robustness and superior detection performance. We anticipate that the QML-ADF will not only enable robust detection of quantum attacks under realistic deployment conditions but also strengthen the practical security of quantum communication systems.

Abstract: Coherent one-way quantum key distribution (COW-QKD) has been widely investigated, and even been deployed in real-world quantum network. However, the proposal of the zero-error attack has critically undermined its security guarantees, and existing experimental implementations have not yet established security against coherent attacks. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an information-theoretically secure COW-QKD protocol that can resist source side-channel attacks, with secure transmission distances up to 100 km. Our system achieves a secure key rate on the order of kilobits per second over 50 km in the finite-size regime, sufficient for real-time secure voice communication across metropolitan networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the encrypted transmission of a logo with information-theoretic security over 100 km of optical fiber. These results confirm that COW-QKD can simultaneously provide simplicity and security, establishing it as a strong candidate for deployment in small-scale quantum networks.

Method: we investigate entanglement structure of bipartite two-qutrit pure states from both geometric and operational perspectives using mathematical analysis of eigenvalues of reduced density matrix and symmetric polynomials.

Result: we developed a framework for understanding two-qutrit entanglement by analyzing symmetric polynomials of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, identified a natural, rank-sensitive geometric invariant, and characterized the locus of separable and entangled states, and established an operational correspondence with three-path quantum interferometry which allows for testing and visualizing these quantum correlations in the lab.

Conclusion: our work provides a comprehensive understanding of the geometry of entanglement in two-qutrit systems and an operational approach to their characterization via interferometric techniques.

Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of bipartite two-qutrit pure states from both geometric and operational perspectives.Using the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, we analyze how symmetric polynomials characterize pairwise and genuinely three-level correlations. We show that the determinant of the coefficient matrix defines a natural, rank-sensitive geometric invariant that vanishes for all rank-2 states and is nonzero only for rank-3 entangled states. An explicit analytic constraint relating this determinant-based invariant to the I-concurrence is derived, thereby defining the physically accessible region of two-qutrit states in invariant space. Furthermore, we establish an operational correspondence with three-path optical interferometry and analyze conditional visibility and predictability in a qutrit quantum erasure protocol, including the effects of unequal path transmittances. Numerical demonstrations confirm the analytic results and the associated complementarity relations. These findings provide a unified geometric and operational framework for understanding two-qutrit entanglement.

Abstract: Conventional nuclear magnetic resonance searches for the galactic axion wind lose sensitivity at low frequencies due to the unfavourable scaling of inductive readout. Here, we propose a hybrid architecture where the hyperfine interaction transduces axion-driven nuclear precession into a high-bandwidth electron-spin readout channel. We demonstrate analytically that this dispersive upconversion preserves the specific sidereal and annual modulation signatures required to distinguish dark matter signals from instrumental backgrounds. When instantiated in a silicon ${ }^{209} \text{Bi}$ donor platform, the hybrid sensor is projected to outperform direct nuclear detection by more than an order of magnitude over the $10^{-16}-10^{-6} \text{eV}$ wide mass range. With collective enhancement, the design reaches a $5 σ$ sensitivity to DFSZ axion-nucleon couplings within one year, establishing hyperfine-mediated sensing as a competitive path for compact, solid-state dark matter searches.

Abstract: Noisy and Intermediate-Scale Quantum, or NISQ, processors are sensitive to noise, prone to quantum decoherence, and are not yet capable of continuous quantum error correction for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Hence, quantum algorithms designed in the pre-fault-tolerant era cannot neglect the noisy nature of the hardware, and investigating the relationship between quantum hardware performance and the output of quantum algorithms is essential. In this work, we experimentally study how hardware-aware variational quantum circuits on a superconducting quantum processing unit can model distributions relevant to specific use-case applications for Credit Risk Analysis, e.g., standard Gaussian distributions for latent factor loading in the Gaussian Conditional Independence model. We use a transpilation technique tailored to the specific quantum hardware topology, which minimizes gate depth and connectivity violations, and we calibrate the gate rotations of the circuit to achieve an optimized output from quantum algorithms. Our results demonstrate the viability of quantum adaptation on a small-scale, proof-of-concept model inspired by financial applications and offer a good starting point for understanding the practical use of NISQ devices.

Abstract: We consider a stationary quantum system consisting of two non-interacting yet entangled subsystems, $Ξ$ and $Γ$. We identify a quantum theory characterizing $Ξ$ such that, in the quantum-to-classical crossover of the composite system, $Γ$ behaves as a test particle within the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild Black Hole (SBH) near its event horizon. We then show that this same quantum theory naturally provides a representation of $Ξ$ in terms of bosonic modes, whose features match those of the Hawking radiation; this facilitates the establishment of precise relations between the phenomenological parameters of the SBH and the microscopic details of the quantum model for $Ξ$. Finally, we recognize that the conditions used to characterize $Γ$ and $Ξ$ coincide with those required by the Page and Wootters mechanism for identifying an evolving system and an associated clock. This leads us to discuss how the quantum model for $Ξ$ endows the SBH with all the characteristics of a "perfect" clock.

Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is the multipartite cryptographic primitive. Most of existing QSS protocols are limited by the linear rate-distance bound, and cannot realize the long-distance and high-capacity multipartite key distribution. This paper proposes a polarization (Pol) and phase (Ph) dual degrees of freedom (dual-DOF) QSS protocol based on the weak coherent pulse (WCP) sources. Our protocol combines the single-photon interference, two-photon interference and non-interference principles, and can resist the internal attack from the dishonest player. We develop simulation method to estimate its performance under the beam splitting attack. The simulation results show that our protocol can surpass the linear bound. Comparing with the differential-phase-shift twin-field QSS and WCP-Ph-QSS protocols, our protocol has stronger resistance against the beam splitting attack, and thus has longer maximal communication distance and higher key rate. By using the WCPs with high average photon number ($μ$ = 1.5), our protocol achieves a key rate about 5.4 times of that in WCP-Ph-QSS protocol. Its maximal communication distance (441.7 km) is about 7.9% longer than that of the WCP-Ph-QSS. Our protocol is highly feasible with current experimental technology and offers a promising approach for long-distance and high-capacity quantum networks.

Abstract: Accurately describing strongly correlated electronic systems remains a central challenge in quantum chemistry, as electron-electron interactions give rise to complex many-body wavefunctions that are difficult to capture with conventional approximations. Classical wavefunction-based approaches, such as the Semistochastic Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI) and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), currently define the state of the art, systematically converging toward the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit, but at a rapidly increasing computational cost. Quantum computing algorithms promise to alleviate this scaling bottleneck by leveraging entanglement and superposition to represent correlated states more compactly. We introduced the Handover-Iterative Variational Quantum Eigensolver (HI-VQE) as a practical quantum computing algorithm with an iterative "handover" mechanism that dynamically exchanges information between quantum and classical computers, even using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. In this work, we extend the HI-VQE to benchmark two prototypical strongly correlated systems, the nitrogen molecule $N_2$ and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster, which serve as stringent tests for both classical and quantum electronic-structure methods. By comparing HI-VQE results against Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (HCI) benchmarks, we assess its accuracy, scalability, and ability to capture multireference correlation effects. Achieving quantitative agreement on these canonical systems demonstrates a viable pathway toward quantum-enhanced simulations of complex bioinorganic molecules, catalytic mechanisms, and correlated materials.

Abstract: We formulate a quantum mechanical system consisting of a single discrete state coupled to an infinite ladder of equally-spaced states, the coupling between the two being given by a Lorentzian profile. Various limits of this system correspond to well-known models from quantum optics, namely, the narrow resonance limit gives the Rabi system, the wide resonance limit gives the Bixon-Jortner system, the wide resonance, true continuum limit gives the Wigner-Weisskopf system, and the fixed resonance, true continuum limit gives a system that is typically studied by methods developed by Fano. We give a semi-analytical solution of the eigenvalue problem by reducing it to a transcendental equation, and demonstrate the aforementioned limiting behaviors. We then study the dynamics of the initial discrete state numerically, and show that it gives a wide range of behaviors in various limiting cases as predicted by our asymptotic theory including exponential decay, revivals, Rabi oscillations, and damped oscillations. The ability of this system to interpolate between such a rich set of behaviors and existing model systems, and the accessibility of a semi-analytical solution, make it a useful model system in quantum optics and related fields.

Motivation: The paper aims to accelerate adiabatic processes in quantum systems, which have applications in quantum information processing.

Method: The authors propose using counter-diabatic driving with time-dependent electric fields, combined with a Hamiltonian transformation using Lie algebra.

Result: The method successfully reduces the operation time while maintaining high fidelity despite noise and systematic errors.

Conclusion: This approach provides an effective way to implement faster adiabatic operations in quantum systems, which is promising for quantum computing and information processing.

Abstract: The techniques of shortcuts to adiabaticity have been proposed to accelerate the "slow" adiabatic processes in various quantum systems with the applications in quantum information processing. In this paper, we study the counter-diabatic driving for fast adiabatic spin manipulation in a two-electron double quantum dot by designing time-dependent electric fields in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. To simplify implementation and find an alternative shortcut, we further transform the Hamiltonian in term of Lie algebra, which allows one to use a single Cartesian component of electric fields. In addition, the relation between energy and time is quantified to show the lower bound for the operation time when the maximum amplitude of electric fields is given. Finally, the fidelity is discussed with respect to noise and systematic errors, which demonstrates that the decoherence effect induced by stochastic environment can be avoided in speeded-up adiabatic control.

Conclusion: Graphene's unique optical features offer potential for advanced electro-optic devices.

Abstract: Graphene-assisted resonant transmission and enhanced Goos-Hänchen shift are investigated in a two-prism frustrated-total-internal-reflection configuration. Due to the excitation of surface plasmons induced by graphene in low terahertz frequency range, there exist the resonant transmission and anomalous Goos-Hänchen shifts in such optical tunneling configuration. As compared to the case of quantum well, graphene sheet with unique optical properties can enhance the resonant transmission with relatively low loss, and modulate the large negative and positive Goos-Hänchen shifts by adjusting chemical potential or electron relaxation time. These intriguing phenomena may lead to some potential applications in graphene-based electro-optic devices.

Abstract: Entropy production quantifies the amount of irreversibility of a physical process, leading to fundamental bounds for thermodynamic quantities. Particularly in the quantum realm, considerable research has been carried out in the last decades extending entropy production to nonequilibrium processes. We experimentally investigate the entropy production of forward-backward cycles containing different decorrelating processes realized to erase different types of correlations between two interacting systems, from obliterating solely quantum coherence to completely decorrelating local states. We apply these processes to the entanglement of a two-level atom, realized with a circular Rydberg atom, and a light field of a high-quality microwave cavity. The entropy production is computed from the full quantum-state tomography of the system performed at different stages of the interaction-decorrelation sequence. Due to the quantum nature of the atom-cavity system, we find that, although standard, the maximum likelihood estimation method for the density matrix leads to spurious divergences of the entropy production. We propose and implement an alternative estimator that remedies such divergences. Our work experimentally assesses irreversibility of non-thermal processes and addresses the care that must be taken in handling experimental data to estimate the entropy production.

Abstract: Estimating the ground-state energy of a quantum system is one of the most promising applications for quantum algorithms. Here we propose a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) \emph{Ansatz} for finding ground state configuration interaction (CI) wavefunctions. We map CI for fermions to a quantum circuit using a subspace superposition, then apply diagonal Walsh operators to encode the wavefunction. The algorithm can be used to solve both full CI and selected CI wavefunctions, resuling in exact and near-exact solutions for electronic ground states. Both the subspace selection and wavefunction \emph{Ansatz} can be applied to any Hamiltonian that can be written in a qubit basis. The algorithm bypasses costly classical matrix diagonalizations, which is advantageous for large-scale applications. We demonstrate results for several molecules using quantum simulators and hardware.

Abstract: Multielectron tunneling ionization creates ionic coherence crucial for lasing and driving electron motion in molecules. While tunneling is well understood as a single active electron process, less emphasis has been placed on theoretical descriptions of bound electrons during tunneling. This work systematically investigates multielectron tunneling ionization based on the strong field approximation, establishing a theoretical foundation and demonstrating the equivalence of wave function and density matrix approaches for subcycle ionic dynamics. An accurate subcycle nonadiabatic ionization rate is also derived and incorporated into the theory to improve its quantitative accuracy. Applying the theory to N$_{2}$ and CO$_{2}$, this work showcases how an intense laser field can induce ionic coherence in molecules as observed in previous experiments. These findings encourage future investigations into multielectron tunneling ionization and its applications in lasing and in controlling chemical reactions.

TL;DR: Presents a verifiable and scalable verification protocol for Clifford + Magic State Injection (MSI) circuits, addressing noise-resistance, composable security, and reducing quantum communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As quantum computing becomes more practical, ensuring the verification of delegated quantum computations with strong security guarantees is crucial. The need for scalable, modular, and robust verification methods in both measurement-based and circuit-based models is significant.

Method: Introduces *magic-blindness*, a refined notion of blindness that hides only injected magic states. This allows verification by randomly interleaving computation rounds with classically simulable test rounds, forming a trap-based framework for verification.

Result: The protocol achieves the same level of security and robustness as previous MBQC-based methods but with optimized quantum communication costs, as transmitted qubits are only required at injection locations.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap between MBQC and circuit-based models, offering a practical solution for near-term quantum devices to verify computations efficiently while achieving high security levels.

Abstract: As quantum computing machines move towards the utility regime, it is essential that users are able to verify their delegated quantum computations with security guarantees that are (i) robust to noise, (ii) composable with other secure protocols, and (iii) exponentially stronger as the number of resources dedicated to security increases. Previous works that achieve these guarantees and provide modularity necessary to optimization of protocols to real-world hardware are most often expressed in the Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) model. This leaves architectures based on the circuit model -- in particular those using the Magic State Injection (MSI) -- with fewer options to verify their computations or with the need to compile their circuits in MBQC leading to overheads.
  This paper introduces a family of noise robust, composable and efficient verification protocols for Clifford + MSI circuits that are secure against arbitrary malicious behavior. This family contains the verification protocol of Broadbent (ToC, 2018), extends its security guarantees while also bridging the modularity gap between MBQC and circuit-based protocols, and reducing quantum communication costs. As a result, it opens the prospect of rapid implementation for near-term quantum devices.
  Our technique is based on a refined notion of blindness, called magic-blindness, which hides only the injected magic states -- the sole source of non-Clifford computational power. This enables verification by randomly interleaving computation rounds with classically simulable, magic-free test rounds, leading to a trap-based framework for verification. As a result, circuit-based quantum verification attains the same level of security and robustness previously known only in MBQC. It also optimizes the quantum communication cost as transmitted qubits are required only at the locations of state injection.

Conclusion: 负态是相对论量子理论的基本属性，并在量子动力学和散射效应中起到关键的作用。我们发现，在Kapitza-Dirac 效应中，负态在两光子散射中主导振幅。我们的理论与数值和经典解一致，表明负态耦合在各种场幅值下都是主导的。这在单光子情况下与康普顿散射中的虚电子-正电子对相互作用相符。

Abstract: Negative states are an intrinsic property of relativistic quantum theory and related to anti-particles in the context of the Dirac sea concept. We show that negative states can dominantly contribute to the diffraction amplitude in the quantum dynamics of the two-photon Kapitza-Dirac effect. We draw our conclusion by investigating solutions from time-dependent perturbation theory, where the perturbative solutions are in match with numeric solutions of the relativistic quantum system and also with the numeric and analytic solutions from the relativistic equations of motion of a classical point-like electron in an external standing wave light field. While our numeric solutions assume a strong laser field, the analytic solutions indicate that negative state coupling remains dominant for arbitrary low field amplitudes, where in the single-photon case (Compton scattering) negative state coupling can be mathematically associated with the interaction of a virtual electron-positron pair in the context of a quantized theory in old-fashioned perturbation theory.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method for estimating temperature in nanoscale quantum systems under nonequilibrium conditions, which outperforms traditional methods by leveraging quantum coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temperature measurement in quantum systems is crucial for understanding quantum thermodynamics and nanotechnology, but most existing methods are limited to equilibrium conditions. This paper addresses the challenge of measuring temperature in nonequilibrium states, which are more representative of real-world applications.

Method: The paper introduces a 'corrected dynamical temperature' method. It uses the maximum entropy principle based on the thermometer's mean energy to define a 'reference temperature,' which is more accurate than previous 'effective temperature' methods. It also employs error functions based on quantum Fisher information to quantify the deviation from the true temperature.

Result: The proposed method is validated through a qubit-based thermometer. Simulations show that increasing quantum coherence enhances temperature estimation precision. Under nonequilibrium conditions, the corrected dynamical temperature provides a more accurate readout than previous methods.

Conclusion: This study advances quantum thermometry by enabling precise temperature measurement in nonequilibrium conditions, which is essential for advancing quantum technologies. The enhanced precision with increased quantum coherence opens new possibilities for practical applications in nanotechnology and quantum information processing.

Abstract: Quantum thermometry aims to measure temperature in nanoscale quantum systems, paralleling classical thermometry. However, temperature is not a quantum observable, and most theoretical studies have therefore concentrated on analyzing fundamental precision limits set by the quantum Fisher information through the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. In contrast, whether a direct temperature readout can be achieved in quantum thermometry remains largely unexplored, particularly under the nonequilibrium conditions prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we develop a direct temperature readout scheme based on a thermodynamic inference strategy. The scheme integrates two conceptual developments: (i) By applying the maximum entropy principle with the thermometer's mean energy as a constraint, we assign a reference temperature to the nonequilibrium thermometer. We demonstrate that this reference temperature outperforms a commonly used effective temperature defined through equilibrium analogy. (ii) We obtain positive semi-definite error functions that lower-bound the deviation of the reference temperature from the true temperature-in analogy to the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for the mean squared error-and vanish upon thermalization with the sample. Combining the reference temperature with these error functions, we introduce a notion of corrected dynamical temperature which furnishes a postprocessed temperature readout under nonequilibrium conditions. We validate the corrected dynamical temperature in a qubit-based thermometer under a range of nonequilibrium initial states, confirming its capability to estimate the true temperature. Importantly, we find that increasing quantum coherence can enhance the precision of this readout.

Abstract: Dictionary learning (DL) is a core tool in signal processing and machine learning for discovering sparse representations of data. In contrast with classical successes, there is currently no practical quantum dictionary learning algorithm. We argue that this absence stems from structural mismatches between classical DL formulations and the operational constraints of quantum computing. We identify the fundamental bottlenecks that prevent efficient quantum realization of classical DL and show how a structurally restricted model, doubly sparse dictionary learning (DSDL), naturally avoids these problems. We present a simple, hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on projection-based randomized Kaczmarz iterations with Qiskit-compatible quantum inner products. We outline practical considerations and share an open-source implementation at https://github.com/AngshulMajumdar/quantum-dsdl-kaczmarz.

Abstract: At the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, quantum machine learning (QML) is poised to revolutionize artificial intelligence. However, the vulnerability of the current generation of quantum computers to noise and computational error poses a significant barrier to this vision. Whilst quantum error correction (QEC) offers a promising solution for almost any type of hardware noise, its application requires millions of qubits to encode even a simple logical algorithm, rendering it impractical in the near term. In this chapter, we examine strategies for integrating QEC and quantum error detection (QED) into QML under realistic resource constraints. We first quantify the resource demands of fully error-corrected QML and propose a partial QEC approach that reduces overhead while enabling error correction. We then demonstrate the application of a simple QED method, evaluating its impact on QML performance and highlighting challenges we have yet to overcome before we achieve fully fault-tolerant QML.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses generalized squeezing in quantum optics, challenging claims about photon number monotonicity and operator physicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is concerned with the physical interpretation and mathematical rigor of generalized squeezing operators in quantum systems.

Method: Numerical simulations and theoretical analysis of squeezing operators in different quantum states.

Result: The simulation results demonstrate oscillatory dynamics in higher-order squeezing which do not follow a simple photon number increase with squeezing parameter r. The paper provides a detailed analysis, concluding that while generalized squeezing can exhibit complex behaviors, the physical validity depends on additional factors like system information or Hamiltonian modifications.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that generalized squeezing operators are not well-defined without additional context, but modifications can restore physical validity. The simulation results about photon number monotonicity are disproven by mathematical results shown in Ref. [4].

Abstract: In our paper [1], our numerical simulations showed that, unlike displacement and conventional squeezing, higher-order squeezing exhibits oscillatory dynamics. Subsequently, Gordillo and Puebla pointed out that simulation results depend on whether the state space in the simulations is even or odd [2]. Using additional derivations, they argued that the oscillatory dynamics is unphysical and that the photon number must increase monotonically as a function of the squeezing parameter $r$. We agree with the observation of an even-odd parity dependence in the simulations. We independently noticed the same feature in our simulations after the publication of Ref. [1]. This observation led us to perform a more detailed investigation of the numerical simulation and mathematical aspects of the generalized squeezing problem. Our new findings were reported in Ref. [3]. Further analysis was reported in Ref. [4]. Our conclusion is that the generalized squeezing operator is physically not well defined but can be made well defined when combined with additional information about the physical system under study. We demonstrated this point in the case where we include an additional nonlinear interaction term in the Hamiltonian. We disagree with the claim that the photon number must be a monotonically increasing function of $r$. This claim contradicts the mathematically rigorous results of Ref. [4]. Furthermore, we show that the oscillatory behaviour persists in two closely related, well-behaved models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fault-tolerant modular quantum computing requires stabilizer measurements across the modules in a quantum network. For this, entangled states of high quality and rate must be distributed. Currently, two main types of entanglement distribution protocols exist, namely emission-based and scattering-based, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. On the one hand, scattering-based protocols with cavities or waveguides are fast but demand stringent hardware such as high-efficiency integrated circulators or strong waveguide coupling. On the other hand, emission-based platforms are experimentally feasible but so far rely on Bell-pair fusion with extensive use of slow two-qubit memory gates, limiting thresholds to $\approx 0.16\%$. Here, we consider a fully distributed surface code using emission-based entanglement schemes that generate GHZ states in a single shot, i.e., without the need for Bell-pair fusions. We show that our optical setup produces Bell pairs, W states, and GHZ states, enabling both memory-based and optical protocols for distilling high-fidelity GHZ states with significantly improved success rates. Furthermore, we introduce protocols that completely eliminate the need for memory-based two-qubit gates, achieving thresholds of $\approx 0.19\%$ with modest hardware enhancements, increasing to above $\approx 0.24\%$ with photon-number-resolving detectors. These results show the feasibility of emission-based architectures for scalable fault-tolerant operation.

Method: SSWs are introduced as a family of witnesses for detecting GME. The method involves establishing a theoretical connection between SSWs and graph theory, providing analytical detection criteria. Numerically, optimal detection is formulated as a linear program, which is more efficient than traditional semidefinite programs.

Result: The proposed SSWs offer a scalable and practical solution for GME certification. Their experimental evaluation can be performed with local measurements, making them resource-efficient regardless of the local dimension or overall network size.

Conclusion: The development of SSWs represents a significant advancement in quantum network analysis, providing a robust framework for ensuring reliable quantum information processing across large-scale systems.

Abstract: Quantum networks form the backbone of long-distance quantum information processing. Genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) serves as a key indicator of network performance and overall state quality. However, the widely used methods for certifying GME suffer from a major drawback that they either detect only a limited range of states or are applicable only to systems with a small number of parties. To overcome these limitations, we propose a family of sub-symmetric witnesses (SSWs), which are tractable both theoretically and experimentally. Analytically, we establish a connection between SSWs and the cut space of graph theory, enabling several powerful detection criteria tailored to practical quantum networks. Numerically, we show that the optimal detection can be formulated as a linear program, offering a significant efficiency advantage over the semidefinite programs commonly employed in quantum certification. Experimentally, SSWs can be evaluated via local measurements, with resource requirements independent of the local dimension in general, and even independent of the overall network size in many practical networks.

Conclusion: 作者的观点是，量子力学的解释需要更深入的理论，而波姆力学虽然有所改进，但并未触及核心问题，未来需要其他理论来补充和解决更深层次的问题。

Abstract: Tim Maudlin has argued that the standard formulation of quantum mechanics fails to provide a clear ontology and dynamics and that the de Broglie--Bohm pilot-wave theory offers a better completion of the formalism, more in line with Einstein's concerns. I suggest that while Bohmian mechanics improves on textbook quantum theory, it does not go far enough. In particular, it relies on the ``quantum equilibrium hypothesis'' and accepts explicit nonlocality as fundamental. A deeper completion is available in stochastic mechanics, where the wavefunction and the Born rule emerge from an underlying diffusion process, and in a contextual, category-theoretic semantics in which measurement and EPR--Bell correlations are reinterpreted as features of contextual truth rather than of mysterious dynamics. In this framework, the measurement problem and ``spooky action-at-a-distance'' are dissolved rather than solved. Finally, a dynamics based on Rosen's ``classical Schrödinger equation'' provides a continuous passage between quantum and classical regimes, eliminating any sharp Heisenberg cut.

<details>

Motivation: Understanding the relationship between quantum computing and thermodynamics is crucial for optimizing quantum technologies and reducing energy waste.

Method: A framework reusing failure branches by coupling to an athermal bath is proposed, leveraging reset states in quantum algorithms.

Result: The method achieves thermodynamic tasks with heat below the Landauer limit, demonstrating potential for efficient quantum computing.

Conclusion: Quantum computing and thermodynamics are deeply interconnected, suggesting pathways to enhance future quantum systems' efficiency.

Abstract: Branch selection, including postselection, is a standard method for implementing nonunitary transformations in quantum algorithms. Conventionally, states associated with unsuccessful branches are discarded and treated as useless. Here we propose a generic framework that reuses these failure branches as thermodynamic resources. The central element is an athermal bath that is naturally generated during the reset of a failure branch. By coupling this bath to a target system prior to relaxation, useful thermodynamic tasks can be performed, enabling performance beyond conventional thermodynamic limits. As an application, we analyze information erasure and derive the resulting gain analytically. We further demonstrate the framework by implementing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm on IBM's superconducting quantum processor. Despite substantial noise and errors in current hardware, our method achieves erasure with heat dissipation below the Landauer limit. These results establish a practical connection between quantum computing and quantum thermodynamics and suggest a route toward reducing thermodynamic costs in future large-scale quantum computers.

Conclusion: 这一研究为理解和优化马尔可夫链提供了一种高效的量子工具，可能对实际应用中的加速采样等有重要应用价值。

Abstract: This paper proposes a quantum algorithm for Markov chain spectral gap estimation that is quasi-optimal (i.e., optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor) in the number of vertices for all parameters, and additionally quasi-optimal in the reciprocal of the spectral gap itself, if the permitted relative error is above some critical value. In particular, these results constitute an almost quadratic advantage over the best-possible classical algorithm. Our algorithm also improves on the quantum state of the art, and we contend that this is not just theoretically interesting but also potentially practically impactful in real-world applications: knowing a Markov chain's spectral gap can speed-up sampling in Markov chain Monte Carlo.
  Our approach uses the quantum singular value transformation, and as a result we also develop some theory around block-encoding Markov chain transition matrices, which is potentially of independent interest. In particular, we introduce explicit block-encoding methods for the transition matrices of two algebraically-defined classes of Markov chains.

Method: 通过文献分析和理论计算，结合Levin-Rytov方法和Van Kampen方法，计算各种结构的色散压力密度。

Result: 计算结果表明，当间距较小时，压力密度与距离的四次方成反比，且在小于1纳米的距离时，压力密度基本与距离无关；对于薄片结构，压力密度与厚度的平方成正比，但随厚度增加压力密度趋于饱和，厚度约10纳米时压力密度几乎与厚度无关。

Conclusion: Lifshitz公式在不同结构中的应用，尤其是Van Kampen方法，在研究界面效应和色散力方面具有重要优势，能够有效计算不同结构的色散压力密度。

Abstract: The Lifshitz formula and methods of its preparation in the literature are considered. It is shown that in Lifshitz's work itself, this formula is given without a consistent conclusion. Moreover, the approach to the conclusion proposed in this work does not allow us to obtain it. The most general conclusion of this formula can be the method proposed by Levin and Rytov, the variation method of Schwinger and the method proposed by Van Kampen and co-authors. The Levin and Rytov approach is applicable in principle to bodies of arbitrary shape if the diffraction loss fields for electric and magnetic dipoles are determined, while the Van Kampen approach is applicable to any plane-layered structure and is quite simple. It is enough to write down the dispersion equations of the plasmon-polaritone structure. The specific dispersion force for a number of structures is calculated based on the Van Kampen method. It is shown that at small gaps, the force (pressure) density changes the inverse fourth-degree dependence on the distance and practically ceases to depend on it at distances less than 1 nm. For thin identical plates, this density is proportional to the square of their thickness at such distances, but the dependence quickly becomes saturated and already at thicknesses of the order of 10 nm practically ceases to depend on it.

Result: Achieved higher key rates with increased dimensionality, demonstrating the potential of high-dimensional entanglement in QKD.

Conclusion: High-dimensional QKD offers significant advantages in practical applications with loss and noise.

Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement is considered to hold great potential for quantum key distribution (QKD) in high-loss and -noise scenarios. To harness its robustness, we construct a source for high-dimensional time-bin entangled photons optimized for high brightness, low complexity, and long-term stability. We certify the generated high-dimensional entanglement with a new witness employing nested Franson interferometry. Finally, we obtain key rates using a novel, noise-resilient QKD protocol. Our flexible evaluation method, centered around discretizations of the time stream, enables the same dataset to be processed while varying parameters such as state dimensionality and time bin length, allowing optimization of performance under given environmental conditions. Our results indicate regions within the accessible parameter space where high key rates per time are achievable for dimensionalities larger than two.

Representative results are given for three one-electron atomic ions in tabular and graphical format. Changes in these measures with respect to parity and Dunkl parameter have been given in detail. Most of these results are offered here for the first time.

Abstract: Although the original EPR paradox was formulated in terms of position and momentum, most studies of these phenomena have focused on measurement scenarios with only a discrete number of possible measurement outcomes. Here, we present a framework for studying non-locality that is agnostic to the dimension of the physical systems involved, allowing us to probe purely continuous-variable, discrete-variable, or hybrid non-locality. Our approach allows us to find the optimal Bell inequality for any given measurement scenario and quantifies the amount of non-locality that is present in measurement statistics. This formalism unifies the existing literature on continuous-variable non-locality and allows us to identify new states in which Bell non-locality can be probed through homodyne detection. Notably, we find the first example of continuous-variable non-locality that cannot be mapped to a CHSH Bell inequality. Moreover, we provide several examples of simple hybrid DV-CV entangled states that could lead to near-term violation of Bell inequalities.

### [136] [Non Markovian Corrections to Tegmark's Decoherence Bound in Biological Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07689)
*Ramandeep Dewan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: In this paper, the authors examine Tegmark's bound on decoherence times in biological systems under a delta-correlated environment. They find that any finite environmental memory leads to quadratic short-time decoherence, which validates the exponential decay law at early times. For an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) environment, they derive a closed non-Markovian expression for coherence dynamics and determine the de-coherence time scaling as the square root of the bath correlation time. In the singular limit of vanishing bath memory, their result aligns exactly with Tegmark's bound. Numerical simulations based on an exact pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding decoherence mechanisms in biological systems is crucial for comprehending the role of quantum effects at the mesoscale. Tegmark's work provides a foundational bound under specific assumptions, but this paper explores the validity and limitations of such assumptions in more realistic scenarios with finite environmental memory.

Method: The authors analyze the decoherence dynamics under both delta-correlated and finite memory OU environments. They derive closed-form expressions for coherence dynamics and perform numerical simulations using an exact pseudomode mapping to validate their theoretical findings.

Result: The key results are: 1) finite environmental memory induces quadratic short-time decoherence, supporting the exponential decay law early on; 2) for an OU environment, the de-coherence time scales as the square root of the bath correlation time; 3) in the Markovian limit, the result reduces exactly to Tegmark's bound.

Conclusion: Tegmark's result applies only in the Markovian limit, and mesoscopic quantum coherence in structured biological media is not ruled out.

Abstract: Tegmark's widely cited bound on decoherence times in biological systems is derived under the assumption of a delta correlated, memoryless environment. In this work we show that any finite environmental memory universally induces quadratic short time decoherence, in validating the exponential decay law at early times. For an Ornstein Uhlenbeck environment we derive a closed non markovian expression for the coherence dynamics and obtain a de-coherence time that scales as the square root of the bath correlation time. In the singular limit of vanishing bath memory our result reduces exactly to Tegmark's bound. Numerical simulations based on an exact pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling. These findings demonstrate that Tegmark's result applies only in the Markovian limit and does not rule out mesoscopic quantum coherence in structured biological media.

Result: 算法复杂度为O(√N log N)，并成功应用于LHCb实验模拟，展示了在NISQ时代的潜在应用。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来高能物理实验中的量子计算方法提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The transition to the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) presents a computational challenge where particle reconstruction complexity may outpace classical computing resources. While quantum computing offers potential speedups, standard algorithms like Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) require prohibitive circuit depths for near-term hardware. Here, we introduce the 1-Bit Quantum Filter, a domain-specific adaptation of HHL that reformulates tracking from matrix inversion to binary ground-state filtering. By replacing high-precision phase estimation with a single-ancilla spectral threshold and exploiting the Hamiltonian's sparsity, we achieve an asymptotic gate complexity of $O(\sqrt{N} \log N)$, given Hamiltonian dimension $N$. We validate this approach by simulating LHCb Vertex Locator events with a toy model, and benchmark performance using the noise models of Quantinuum H2 trapped-ion and IBM Heron superconducting processors. This work establishes a resource-efficient track reconstruction method capable of solving realistic event topologies on noise-free simulators and smaller tracking scenarios within the current constraints of the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.

Conclusion: 长程跳跃增强了电流随无序的增强趋势，扩展了该效应在不同跳跃衰减指数范围内的适用性。

Abstract: We analyze the interplay of disorder and long-range hopping in a paradigmatic one dimensional model of quantum transport. While typically the current is expected to decrease as the disorder strength increases due to localization effects, in systems with infinite range hopping it was shown in Chavez et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 153201 (2021), that the current can increase with disorder in the Disorder-Enhanced-Transport (DET) regime. Here, by analyzing models with variable hopping range decaying as $1/r^α$ with the distance $r$ among the sites, we show that the DET regime is a general feature of long-range hopping systems and it occurs, not only in the strong long-range limit $α<1$ but even for weak long-range $1 \le α\le 3$. Specifically, we show that, after an initial decrease, the current grows with the disorder strength until it reaches a local maximum. Both disorder thresholds at which the DET regime starts and ends are determined. Our results open the path to understand the effect of disorder on transport in many realistic systems where long range hopping is present.

Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' quantifies how far a quantum state departs from the stabilizer set. It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of many-body quantum states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods reduce the runtime to $O(N d^{2N})$, an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, while exposing substantial parallelism and enabling GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG.jl, which provides a high-performance, GPU-enabled toolbox for computing SRE and mana. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems.

Here, we demonstrate an architecture for mechanical resonator-based quantum computing, in which a superconducting qubit is used to perform quantum gates on a collection of mechanical modes. We show the implementation of a universal gate set, composed of single-qubit gates and controlled arbitrary-phase gates, and showcase their use in the quantum Fourier transform and quantum period finding algorithms.

### [143] [Scattering at Interluminal Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06073)
*Zhiyu Li,Klaas De Kinder,Xikui Ma,Christophe Caloz*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: A comprehensive study of scattering at interluminal modulation interfaces is presented, establishing a complete and general solution to this decades-old problem. The interluminal regime, characterized by a moving interface between two media with differing wave velocities, leads to unique scattering dynamics. Unlike the Cherenkov regime, which involves a single particle, this regime involves two media and a moving interface, resulting in multiple scattered waves. The study introduces a symmetric decomposition approach based on subluminal and superluminal limit interfaces, along with a space-time impulse response, to bridge the gap between subluminal and superluminal scattering regimes and provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms behind interluminal scattering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper addresses a fundamental problem in wave scattering theory, which has significant implications for various fields including optics, acoustics, and electromagnetism.

Method: The authors employ a symmetric decomposition approach, decomposing the interface into subluminal and superluminal limit interfaces, and use a space-time impulse response to analyze the scattering dynamics.

Result: The paper successfully derives a general solution for scattering in the interluminal regime, revealing the unique scattering features and mechanisms that arise due to the interaction of waves with two media and a moving interface.

Conclusion: This study paves the way for further research in interluminal scattering and opens new possibilities for applications in areas such as wave manipulation and control.

Abstract: Scattering at interluminal modulation interfaces, where a sharp space-time perturbation moves at a velocity lying between the wave velocities of the two surrounding media, has remained an open problem for decades. This regime is somewhat reminiscent of the Cherenkov regime, in which the velocity of a charged particle exceeds the phase velocity of light in a medium. However, because it involves two media and a moving interface, it gives rise to richer and more complex scattering dynamics, with a single scattered wave when the incident wave propagates in the same direction as the interface and three scattered waves when they propagate in opposite directions. Existing studies address only limited non-magnetic configurations, and a general formulation has yet to be established. In this paper, we present a complete and general solution to scattering in the interluminal regime using a symmetric decomposition approach based on subluminal and superluminal limit interfaces, together with a space-time impulse response. This approach provides clear physical insight into the scattering features of the interluminal regime. Our results bridge the long-standing gap between the subluminal and superluminal regimes and elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying interluminal scattering.

### [144] [Energetic vs Inference-Based Invisibility: Fisher-Information Analysis of Two-Layer Acoustic Near-Cloaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06091)
*J. Sumaya-Martinez,J. Mulia-Rodriguez*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for creating near-cloaks using passive coatings, focusing on the suppression of scattered-field energy while mitigating the impact of measurement noise on parameter inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to develop a robust framework for coated acoustic cylinders to enhance invisibility by reducing scattering effects, particularly in noisy environments.

Method: The researchers developed a 2D theoretical framework using Helmholtz equation solutions and modal scattering coefficients to design coatings that cancel specific low-order multipoles. They employed the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) to assess the detectability of parameters from noisy measurements.

Result: The coating achieved a 25 dB reduction in total scattering width at the target frequency, yet the Fisher information (tr(FIM)) decreased only slightly, indicating that energy suppression and parameter estimation are distinct objectives.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that while passive coatings can suppress scattering, they do not necessarily degrade the ability to infer object parameters, highlighting the importance of balancing energy reduction with maintainable parameter detection.

Abstract: Near-cloaks based on passive coatings can strongly suppress scattered-field energy in a narrow frequency band, yet an observer's ability to infer object parameters from noisy measurements need not decrease proportionally. We develop a fully theoretical two-dimensional (2D) framework for a coated acoustic cylinder in an air background. Using an exact cylindrical-harmonic solution of the Helmholtz equation, we compute the modal scattering coefficients a_m(omega) for a core of radius a surrounded by two concentric effective-fluid layers, and we design the coating to cancel the dominant low-order multipoles (monopole m=0 and dipole m=+/-1) at a target frequency, yielding a narrowband near-cloak. Beyond the conventional energetic metric (total scattering width), we quantify information-based detectability through the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the associated Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for joint estimation of the size-material parameter vector x=[a, rho1, c1]^T from noisy far-field data. A representative air-background study exhibits an approximately 25 dB reduction in total scattering width near the design frequency, while tr(FIM) decreases by only a few dB, demonstrating that energy-based and inference-based notions of invisibility are distinct objectives. We further provide a low-order analytic argument clarifying the mechanism behind this energetic-informational decoupling and report design-space and local-robustness diagnostics that highlight persistent trade-offs between scattering suppression and parameter identifiability.

Abstract: We derive a framework for classifying topological bands in three-dimensional photonic band structures, where the zero frequency polarization singularity implied by Maxwell's equations complicates the direct application of existing symmetry-based approaches. Building on recent advances in the regularization of photonic bands, we use the recently introduced concept of stable real-space invariants (SRSIs) to show how photonic band structures can be unambiguously characterized in terms of equivalence classes of band representations. We classify topologically trivial photonic bands using SRSIs, treating them as the fundamental building blocks of 3D photonic band structures. This means that if certain bands cannot be constructed from these building blocks, they are necessarily topological. Furthermore, we distinguish between photonic and electronic band structures by analyzing which SRSI values are allowed in systems with and without polarization singularity. We also explore the impact of the polarization singularity on the behavior of Wilson loops, providing new insights into the topological classification of 3D photonic systems.

Abstract: Ultrathin multimode fibers (MMFs) promise endoscopes with hair-scale diameters for accessing sub-millimeter anatomy, but in MMF far-field imaging the required small collection aperture drives speckle-dominated measurements that rapidly degrade image fidelity. Here we present Speckle Clean Network (SCNet), a physics-guided foundation model for universal speckle removal that makes photon-limited, single-fiber collection compatible with high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse scattering conditions without target-specific retraining. SCNet combines a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with material-aware routing, wavelet-based frequency decomposition to separate structure from speckle across sub-bands, and a curriculum-style optimization that progressively enforces spectral consistency before spatial fidelity. Using an ultrathin dual-fiber holographic probe, we deliver wavefront-shaped illumination through one s and collect backscattered photons through a parallel MMF. We validate SCNet on 3D plastic objects over varying working distances, resolve 5.66 lp/mm on a paper USAF target, and restore fine structures on leaves and metal surfaces. On rabbit heart and kidney tissues, SCNet improves recovery of low-contrast anatomical texture under the same ultrathin collection constraint. We further compress SCNet through multi-teacher distillation to reduce computation while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling inference at 60 FPS. This work effectively decouples image quality from probe size, establishing a speckle-free ultrathin endoscopy for stand-off imaging in confined spaces.

Abstract: Rendering reflections in curved mirrors is crucial for enhancing the realism in computer-generated hologram (CGH), yet it poses a fundamental challenge due to the unique computational principles of CGH. Conventional methods using Bézier clipping are computationally prohibitive, and a previously proposed mirror surface subdivision method suffered from the computation time increasing with mirror curvature. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel calculation method based on Fermat's principle that directly and efficiently determines the reflection point by minimizing the optical path length from a point light source to a hologram pixel via the mirror surface, using Newton's method for optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly reduces computation time compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, it enables the rendering of multiple reflections from several mirrors, a capability that was challenging for conventional techniques.

Conclusion: 一维光子准晶体的光谱性质由无理数比β的大小决定，这一发现为光子学设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we construct a one-dimensional photonic quasicrystal by combining two incommensurate spatial harmonics, where the ratio of their periods is the irrational number β. We evaluate the photonic quasicrystal accurately by a generalized spectral method that embeds the quasiperiodic structure into a higher-dimensional periodic system. We study the spectral distribution of one-dimensional photonic quasicrystals and find some interesting phenomena. As the computational resolution N increases, there are more eigenvalues within finite frequency bandwidths, and the maximum localization always occurs at spectral gap edges for states near index N + 1. By varying βwithin the range of (0,1), we present a butterfly-shaped spectral structure with abundant band gaps. We find that the spectral structure factor Q (defined as I_{mg}/N, where I_{mg} is the maximum gap index) exhibits different linear patterns as βchanges: Q = 1 - βwhen β< βc, while Q = βwhen β> βc, where βc \approx 0.424 is the transition point. This linear relationship holds robustly in the strong quasiperiodic regime (βaway from 0 or 1) and is independent of the specific type of irrational number used. The relationship disappears (weak quasiperiodic regime) near β= 0 or β= 1. It demonstrates that the intrinsic spectral properties of one-dimensional photonic quasicrystals are fundamentally governed by the magnitude of the irrational parameter β.

Abstract: Integrated optical transceivers, utilizing wavelength-division-multiplexing, offer a path forward for implementation of compact, high-bandwidth and energy-efficient interconnects for future data centers. Here we report the demonstration of a monolithically integrated optical receiver in 45nm CMOS, where efficient multi-layer optical demultiplexing with capacitive tuning, energy efficient electronics and wideband inverse designed grating couplers enable implementation of a 32-channel receiver chip based on wavelength-division multiplexing. The chip operates at an aggregate data-rate of 1.024 Tb/s with all channels operating simultaneously at a data-rate of 32 Gb/s/channel achieving a record energy efficiency of 71 fJ/b, including the power consumption of both the electronic circuitry and the tuning and control of photonic devices, and a record bandwidth density of 4 Tb/s/mm2. The receiver achieves a bit-error-rate below 1E-12 without requiring equalization, error correction or digital processing. Inverse-designed broadband grating couplers provide efficient, low-loss optical coupling into the chip. An on-chip demultiplexer, composed of Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) and ring resonators, offers a large channel-to-channel isolation sufficient for error-free operation. Capacitive phase shifters embedded within the ring resonators of the demultiplexer are used for wavelength alignment at a zero static power consumption. MZIs and ring-resonators are periodically selected and autonomously locked to the wavelength of the corresponding optical carrier. The implemented monolithic receiver offers a scalable, energy-efficient and reliable solution for the beyond Tb/s optical interconnects.

Abstract: We report a comprehensive experimental study of spontaneous Brillouin scattering in a few-mode optical fiber, resolving both forward and backward scattering processes for intra- and inter-modal interactions. Using heterodyne detection, Stokes and anti-Stokes components without external acoustic excitation are observed and quantitatively extracted Brillouin shifts, linewidths, and gain coefficients. Forward scattering is mediated by guided torsional-radial acoustic modes with frequencies ranging from MHz to GHz, while backward scattering involves longitudinal core-guided modes at frequencies of tens of GHz. These results provide calibrated benchmarks for Brillouin interactions in few-mode fibers, offering insights relevant to phonon-based quantum applications and mode-selective optomechanics.

Abstract: Analog coprocessors are intensively developing nowadays with the aim to optimize energy computations of neural networks. In this work we focus on the possibility of using detection of collective oscillations in optical systems for computational purposes. We show that in a system of coupled resonators, collective oscillations can be used to implement matrix-vector multiplication. The matrix is formed by the coupling constants between the resonators, and the input vector is formed by the initial occupancies of the involved modes. The frequency of the collective oscillations is growing with the number of the involved modes, similarly to Rabi oscillations. The time needed for their detection, i.e., averaging, decreases with an increase in the input vector dimension. We discuss the limitations imposed on parallel computation in the system by restriction of the allowed optical frequency band.

Abstract: Programmable photonic integrated circuits (PPICs) offer a versatile platform for implementing diverse optical functions on a generic hardware mesh. However, the scalability of PPICs faces critical power consumption barriers. Therefore, we propose a novel non-volatile PPIC architecture utilizing MEMS with mechanical latching, enabling stable passive operation without any power connection once configured. To ensure practical applicability, we present a system-level solution including both this hardware innovation and an accompanying automatic error-resilient configuration algorithm. The algorithm compensates for the lack of continuous tunability inherent in the non-volatile hardware design, thereby enabling such new operational paradigm without compromising performance, and also ensuring robustness against fabrication errors. Functional simulations were performed to validate the proposed scheme by configuring five distinct functionalities of varying complexity, including a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), a MZI lattice filter, a ring resonator (ORR), a double ORR ring-loaded MZI, and a triple ORR coupled resonator waveguide filter. The results demonstrate that our non-volatile scheme achieves performance equivalent to conventional PPICs. Robustness analysis was also conducted, and the results demonstrated that our scheme exhibits strong robustness against various fabrication errors. Furthermore, we explored the trade-off between the hardware design complexity of such non-volatile scheme and its performance. This study establishes a viable pathway to a new generation of power-connection-free PPICs, providing a practical and scalable solution for future photonic systems.

Abstract: Vortex light, a unique optical field that carries orbital angular momentum (OAM), has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this paper, we present a detailed theoretical analysis of OAM transfer from the input field to the generated signal field in a four-level double-Lambda system via the four-wave mixing (FWM) process, showing that their OAMs follow a specific algebraic relationship. We identify the optimal conditions for efficient vortex light transmission, analyze the influence of detuning on transmission efficiency and phase distortion, and specifically examine the scenario where the control field carries OAM the latter being essential for a complete characterization of OAM conservation in the FWM process, while all three aspects have been largely overlooked in the existing literature. Furthermore, we investigated the tunability of the group velocity between the probe and signal fields by modulating the Rabi frequencies of the two control fields and the relative phase between the probe and signal fields during the FWM process. We demonstrate that the conversion between matched vortex slow and fast light can be realized an effect that has not been widely explored in dual-Lambda-type systems. These results may hold promise for applications in quantum information storage and processing, quantum computing, and ultrasensitive detection.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing using light is commonly constrained by serial voxel-by-voxel or layer-by-layer processing, which fundamentally limits fabrication speed and scalability. Here, we introduce a single-exposure holographic three-dimensional (3D) printing approach that synthesizes an entire volumetric dose distribution optically in one step. The method combines inverse-designed microstructured phase masks with photopolymer resins engineered for controlled optical absorption. By precisely tailoring the phase-mask topography, we generate arbitrary 3D light-intensity distributions within the resin, including intentionally encoded dark regions that define hollow internal features. Simultaneously, the resin formulation is designed to balance optical penetration with sufficient local energy deposition to achieve high-fidelity polymerization throughout the volume. Using this approach, millimeter-scale architectures comprising more than $10^{6}$ addressable voxels are fabricated in a single 7.5~s exposure, corresponding to a volumetric throughput of $\sim$1~mm$^{3}$/s ($>10^{5}$~voxels/s). The demonstrated performance is presently limited by resin kinetics and illumination geometry rather than by the phase-mask framework itself. Because the volumetric information capacity scales with the space--bandwidth product of the phase mask, this approach provides a clear pathway toward substantially higher throughput, enabling scalable fabrication of micro-optical components, biomedical scaffolds, and other precision-engineered mesoscale systems.

Abstract: Skyrmions, topologically stable field configurations, have recently emerged in classical optics as structured light for high-density data applications. Achieving controllable on-chip generation of single-photon skyrmions, while being highly desirable for quantum information technologies, remains challenging due to the nanoscale confinement of quantum emitters (QEs). Here we demonstrate a metasurface-integrated quantum emitter (metaQE) platform enabling room-temperature on-chip generation of single-photon skyrmions. Near-field coupling between QEs and propitiously designed surface arrays of meta-atoms mediates spin-orbit interaction, transforming nanoscale-localized dipole emission into free-propagating topologically structured photonic modes. By exploiting this approach for structuring quantum emission from different color centers in nanodiamonds, we realize diverse skyrmionic states, including high-order anti-skyrmions and skyrmionium, and thereby demonstrate its universality across QEs. Our work establishes a unified framework for on-chip structured quantum light sources, offering versatile control of high-dimensional topological states, such as skyrmions, and advancing scalable quantum photonic technologies.

Abstract: We investigate a non-Hermitian Aubry-André-Harper lattice exhibiting quasiperiodicity, featuring an imaginary gauge field that varies spatially but averages to zero. In the presence of open boundary conditions, this system is precisely mapped, through a nonunitary gauge transformation, to the Hermitian AAH model with balanced hopping terms. The mapping leaves the spectrum unchanged but reshapes each eigenfunction by a realization-dependent random-walk envelope. In a parameter regime where the Hermitian counterpart hosts spectrally isolated in-gap boundary modes, we identify two such modes with sharply different responses to the envelope: one stays anchored at the boundary, while the other is controllable via the gauge, allowing its peak intensity to be relocated solely by altering the gauge setup without modifying the associated eigenenergy. Additionally, we demonstrate that this steerable mode can be preferentially enhanced and generated from an initial bulk wavefunction by introducing mild site-specific amplification at a location determined exclusively from the Hermitian model using the biorthogonal function. These findings offer pathways for both static and dynamic manipulation of spatially adjustable in-gap states in quasiperiodic non-Hermitian lattices.

*Shah Fahad,Gao Xianlong*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: We propose a theoretical scheme for controlling the Goos-Hänchen shift in a polariton optomechanical system by exploiting the effective exciton-vibration coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling the Goos-Hänchen shift is important for designing optical devices that exploit beam-displacement phenomena.

Method: We consider a system comprising an optical mode, a molecular vibrational mode, and N excitonic modes, where excitons couple to molecular vibrations via conditional displacement interactions and to photons through electric dipole interactions. The effective exciton-vibration coupling is shown to provide a powerful mechanism for coherent GHS control; in its absence, the system exhibits a pronounced GHS at resonance, while activating it strongly suppresses the shift. The effective cavity detuning and the cavity length serve as additional tunable parameters for GHS manipulation. Furthermore, increasing the collective exciton-optical coupling enhances the GHS.

Result: We establish a framework for probing the Goos-Hänchen shift in polariton optomechanical systems and offer new avenues for designing optical devices that exploit beam-displacement phenomena.

Conclusion: This work provides aakis approach for controlling the Goos-Hänchen shift in polariton optomechanical systems.)

Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme for controlling the Goos-Hänchen shift (GHS) of a reflected probe field in a polariton optomechanical system. The system comprises an optical mode, a molecular vibrational mode, and $N$ excitonic modes, where excitons couple to molecular vibrations via conditional displacement interactions and to photons through electric dipole interactions. We show that the effective exciton-vibration coupling provides a powerful mechanism for coherent GHS control: in its absence, the system exhibits a pronounced GHS at resonance, while activating it strongly suppresses the shift. The effective cavity detuning and the cavity length serve as additional tunable parameters for GHS manipulation. Furthermore, increasing the collective exciton-optical coupling enhances the GHS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying Bound states in the continuum (BICs) and their applications in manipulating light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.

Method: The research is based on general principles of photonic crystals and Bloch wave theory, solved using perturbation methods and linear algebra for stability analysis.

Result: The photonic crystal slabs support h-BICs stabilized by $C_{4v}$ symmetry, exhibit annihilation and topological dynamics through parameter variation, and achieve precise control of light emission in diffraction channels.

Conclusion: Discovery of BICs at Γ-point in photonic crystal slabs as versatile platforms for designing novel photonic nanodevices.

Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have greatly impacted our ability to manipulate light-matter interaction at the nanoscale. However, in periodic structures, BICs are typically realized below the diffraction limit, thus leaving a broad spectral domains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce a new type of at-$Γ$ BICs of photonic crystal (PhC) slabs supporting higher diffraction orders, which we call hybrid BICs (h-BICs), whereby symmetry protection and parameter tuning are utilized to suppress light emission in the zeroth- and higher-diffraction orders, respectively. By tuning certain structural parameters of the PhC slab, we fully characterize the dynamics of the topological structure of these h-BICs, including the generation, merging, splitting, and annihilation of circularly polarized states. We further show that the relative amount of light radiated in the first-order diffraction channels can be effectively controlled by simply breaking the $C_{4v}$ symmetry of the PhC slab. Our findings reveal a versatile approach to realize new types of BICs above the diffraction limit, and could potentially inspire new efforts towards development of novel photonic nanodevices, such as multi vortex-beam generators, frequency converters, and lasers.

Abstract: Information metasurfaces have emerged as pivotal components in next-generation electronic systems, with significant progress in their applications to communication, radar, and sensing. However, the current researches are mainly focused on their physical structures and system functions, while radio-frequency (RF) signal processing and calculation remain constrained to digital-domain operations. This reliance on digital conversion inherently increases hardware complexity and power consumption. To address this challenge, we propose a programmable RF calculation system based on a space-time-coding metasurface (STCM), which can control the wave-matter interactions through space-time-coding (STC) strategies and achieve direct RF calculations in the electromagnetic (EM) space in a reprogrammable way. Particularly, the fundamental signal operations - Fourier transform and convolution - are implemented in the EM-wave domain successfully. We validate the RF calculation capabilities in radar scenarios, facilitating the accurate detection of target velocity and range. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experimental results collectively demonstrate that the STCM-based RF calculation system exhibits superior precision, enhanced operational efficiency, and notable cost-effectiveness, highlighting its significant potentials for the next-generation electronic system deployments.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new paradigm for solving ill-posed inverse problems in physical sciences using simulation as a third pillar of discovery, with broad applications in understanding structure-function relationships and multi-physics processes.

Abstract: The fusion of rigorous physical laws with flexible data-driven learning represents a new frontier in scientific simulation, yet bridging the gap between physical interpretability and computational efficiency remains a grand challenge. In electron microscopy, this divide limits the ability to quantify three-dimensional topography from two-dimensional projections, fundamentally constraining our understanding of nanoscale structure-function relationships. Here, we present a physics-embedded neural computational microscopy framework that achieves metrological three-dimensional reconstruction by deeply coupling a differentiable electron-optical forward model with deep learning. By introducing a Vision Field Transformer as a high-speed, differentiable surrogate for physical process analysis simulations, we establish an end-to-end, self-supervised optimization loop that enforces strict physical consistency with hardware geometry. This synergy enables single-shot, quantitative three-dimensional nanometrology with precision comparable to atomic force microscopy but at orders of magnitude higher throughput. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability for four-dimensional (3D real space plus time) in situ characterization by tracking the dynamic evolution of surface nanostructure during copper redox, revealing hidden crystallographic kinetics invisible to conventional imaging. Our work not only redefines the limits of scanning electron microscopy but also establishes a generalizable archetype for solving ill-posed inverse problems across physical sciences, unlocking the full potential of simulation as a third pillar of discovery.

TL;DR: A compact, cost-effective microwave oscillator combining high-Q cavities with optical co-SIL locking achieves record-low phase noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating ultra-pure microwaves is essential for next-gen communications, radar, and metrology. Current methods face challenges like large footprint or noise suppression.

Method: Utilizes ultrahigh-Q Fabry-Perot cavity with optical co-SIL locking, complemented by an integrated soliton microcomb.

Result: Phase noise of -147 dBc/Hz at 4 kHz offset (10 GHz scaled), surpassing electronic stabilized systems.

Conclusion: This system offers a simpler, more accessible, compact solution for precise microwave generation.

Abstract: Optical frequency division (OFD) provides the purest microwaves by down-converting the stability of optical cavity references. State-of-the-art references typically rely on electronic co-Pound-Drever-Hall locking to ultrahigh-Q microresonators-a complex approach that introduces servo bumps and increases footprint. Alternatively, optical co-self-injection-locking (co-SIL) offers inherent simplicity but is limited by the large thermo-refractive noise and confined mode volumes of integrated cavities. Here, we demonstrate a two-point OFD-based microwave oscillator that combines an ultrahigh-Q miniature Fabry-Perot cavity with optical co-SIL. Leveraging its low relative phase noise optical reference and combing with an integrated soliton microcomb, the system generates a microwave with phase noise of -147 dBc/Hz at 4 kHz offset (scaled to 10 GHz)-performance rivalling most electronically stabilized systems. This work marries the superior noise floor of ultrahigh-Q cavities with the simplicity of optical locking, providing a compact, cost-effective, and field-deployable path to pure microwaves for next-generation communications, radar and metrology.

Abstract: For more than 20 years, optical microresonators have served as the backbone of integrated nonlinear photonics, exploiting Kerr nonlinearity to generate octave-spanning frequency combs, enable quantum effects, and drive optical parametric oscillators. Since the inception of microresonator-based nonlinear optics, related studies have focused primarily on regimes in which photons with distinct resonant modes can interact. Although multiple comb lines can occupy a single resonance during the Kerr comb formation process, their mutual interactions have remained largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate a Kerr comb formation that is confined to a single resonance of a microresonator via dual-pumping. MHz-scale comb-line spacing reveals previously unobserved Kerr-comb dynamics, featuring parametrically driven phase multistability that can be observed directly in the temporal domain. Two laser pumps serve as phase-coupled references for heterodyne read-out, simplifying the measurements.

Abstract: Programmable integrated photonics aims to replicate the versatility of field-programmable gate arrays in the optical domain. However, scaling these systems has been prevented by the high power consumption and thermal crosstalk of conventional volatile phase shifters. Here, we demonstrate the first non-volatile field-programmable photonic gate array, implemented on a hybrid silicon-barium titanate platform. Unlike traditional thermo-optic devices that require constant power to maintain a state, our device utilizes ferroelectric domain switching to provide non-volatile memory, allowing optical circuits to be programmed and retained without any holding power or electrical bias. The hexagonal waveguide mesh integrates 58 programmable unit cells and 116 actuators, achieving nanosecond-scale switching speeds of 80 nanoseconds while reducing static power consumption to negligible levels (560 nanowatts per π phase shift). To validate this platform, we configured the mesh to perform diverse signal processing functions, including tunable filtering, 4x4 linear unitary transformations, and optical routing. This work establishes non-volatile ferroelectric silicon photonics as a scalable, heat-free platform essential for the next generation of energy-efficient photonic computing.

Abstract: Coherence transfer is a multi-disciplinary topic of interest, including chemistry, biology and physics. In quantum technologies, achieving non-local coherent coupling between solid-state qubits is of the utmost importance. Here, we demonstrate that excitons - i.e. electron-hole pairs bound by the Coulomb force within a quantum well - can act as a medium for mesoscopic optical coherence transfer in semiconductors. To this end, we use a femtosecond laser pulse to resonantly generate excitons within the light cone. These excitons can then either recombine radiatively or scatter out of the light cone, gaining an in-plane momentum in the process. In samples without disorder, such as the CdTe quantum wells used here, the resulting fast excitons can diffuse over mesoscopic distances before recombining radiatively. Using coherent nonlinear micro-spectroscopy, we carry out exciton time-of-flight measurements. Specifically, we monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of launched exciton wave packets, selectively observing their coherence or density on a scale of up to 10$\,μ$m. Our proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates that free excitons inherit a phase modulation from the optical pulsed excitation and can generate coherent links within excitonic circuits, offerring a higher level of miniaturisation and compactness than photonic or polaritonic architectures.

Abstract: Optical computing offers ultrafast, energy-efficient alternatives to conventional digital processors, yet most implementations remain confined to single-channel processing, severely underutilizing light's information capacity. Here we demonstrate a self-optimizing multichannel optical computing architecture based on multi-plane light conversion that natively processes RGB images and structured numerical data throughout the optical domain. We introduce two complementary optimization strategies that enable autonomous performance adaptation without differentiable forward models. First, Bayesian optimization tunes channel mixing coefficients to minimize crosstalk and enhance feature separability at the input level. Second, a hardware-in-the-loop protocol based on self-organized criticality leverages avalanche dynamics to autonomously navigate the high-dimensional phase landscape, enabling the system to self-optimize through stochastic multi-scale perturbations. Across medical imaging, natural image classification, and regression tasks, multichannel processing with random phase masks improves accuracy by 26--58 percentage points over raw pixel baselines, with RGB systematically outperforming grayscale by 5--6 percentage points. Self-optimization strategies provide additional gains of 6--7 percentage points through autonomous adaptation at complementary system levels. Our work establishes self-optimizing multichannel optical computing as a practical platform for real-world machine learning applications.

Abstract: We propose a topology-optimization framework for optimizing finite structures of arbitrary shape by combining density-based methods with level-set approaches. We first optimize regular polygonal structures to suppress the photonic density of states and find that the best performing polygon is consistent with a tiling of space with hexagonal unit cells. We next show that introducing cavities into hexagonal structures further suppresses the photonic density of states, particularly when the cavity is also hexagonal. Such a result would find application in the design of fiber-optic cables. We then describe an approach for optimizing arbitrary x-simple or y-simple designs that can recover finite supercells of a hexagonal unit cell. Our approach can therefore discover the symmetry of photonic-crystal primitive unit cells that significantly suppress the photonic density of states for a given set of material parameters within a single optimization.

*Alexandre Yoshitaka Charau,Jérôme Laurent,Tony Valier-Brasier*

Main category: physics.class-ph

TL;DR: Evanescence modes mediate energy transfer in elastic waveguides, enabling tunneling and localization. They play a key role in thickness resonances and energy transfer across barriers. We observed Lamb mode tunneling near turning points, showing how evanescent barriers can be crossed. In waveguides with varying thickness, the $S_2$ mode becomes evanescent in a narrow frequency range, allowing energy transfer. The barrier's behavior is influenced by material properties, specifically Poisson's ratio. Numerical results match predictions from the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. This research offers a deeper understanding of energy transfer in structured elastic waveguides by studying evanescent mode tunneling, especially relevant for controlling and manipulating waves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding evanescent modes and their role in energy transfer is crucial for developing wave control strategies. This has implications in non-destructive testing, imaging, and material characterization. The study of these mechanisms enhances our ability to manipulate waves, such as in imaging applications or vibration control.

Method: We conducted experiments to observe evanescent mode tunneling in elastic waveguides with varying thickness. Using a combination of experimental setups and theoretical modeling, we analyzed wave propagation in materials with Poisson's ratio dependence. Our approach included numerical simulations to validate theoretical predictions.

Result: Our findings demonstrate that evanescent modes enable energy transfer across barriers that are classically impenetrable to propagating waves. We observed that Poisson's ratio governs the behavior of evanescent barriers, supporting our hypothesis that materials with specific properties allow for such energy transfer. Our experimental results align with theoretical predictions, confirming the mechanism of evanescent mode tunneling.

Conclusion: Evanescence modes mediate energy transfer in elastic waveguides, enabling tunneling across barriers. The study reveals the mechanisms governing energy transfer, localization, and mode conversion in structured waveguides. Evolutionary techniques improved energy transfer.

Abstract: Understanding how evanescent modes mediate energy transfer in tapered elastic waveguides is of paramount interest, as it unlocks new strategies for wave control and manipulation. Evanescent modes play a crucial role in energy localization and in the emergence of thickness resonances. We report the first unambiguous experimental evidence of Lamb mode tunneling near turning points, revealing how energy can traverse an evanescent barrier and recover its propagative nature after a finite transit time. Focusing on waveguides with linearly varying thickness, we show that the $S_2$ mode becomes evanescent over a narrow frequency band, enabling a tunnelinglike phenomenon. Our study demonstrates that the barrier width is governed by the elastic properties of the material, particularly the Poisson's ratio, within a confined range bordering the Dirac cone. Numerical results exhibit excellent agreement with predictions from the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. These findings provide compelling evidence that, for a specific barrier width, evanescent modes mediate energy transfer across regions classically forbidden to propagating waves, revealing the mechanisms governing transmission, localization, and mode conversion in structured or corrugated elastic waveguides.

### [170] [Self-oscillations induced by self-induced torque in magnetic double tunnel junction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07300)
*R. Arun,R. Gopal,V. K. Chandrasekar,M. Lakshmanan*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The research investigates the magnetization oscillations in a magnetic double tunnel junction, influenced by self-induced torque (SIT) and field-like torque (FLT). The numerical analysis shows that SIT is crucial for generating GHz-scale oscillations, whereas without it, the system reaches a steady state after switching. The oscillator frequency and power of oscillations vary with FLT parameters. Specifically, when FLT's strength is negative, these properties enhance with increasing current, offering tunability and a broader frequency range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The understanding of magnetization dynamics in magnetic tunnel junctions is vital for developing high-speed spintronic devices, such as oscillators and memory circuits. This research provides insights into how different torque mechanisms can be utilized to control spin wave oscillations, which is critical for advancing nanoscale electronic and memory technologies.

Method: The research employs numerical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation to analyze the dynamics of the magnetization under the influence of SIT and FLT. The LLGS equation is fundamental in micromagnetics, describing the precessional motion of magnetization in response to external fields and torque mechanisms. By solving this equation numerically, the researchers can accurately predict the behavior of the system under various parameter settings.

Result: The results reveal that SIT is essential for generating magnetization oscillations at GHz frequencies. These oscillations are damped and decay after several oscillation periods in the absence of SIT. The power of oscillations increases while the oscillator frequency decreases with rising current when only SIT is active. Incorporated with a negative FLT, the power spectral density shows that the oscillator's frequency, power, and quality factor (Q-factor) increase with higher current, suggesting an enhanced tunability range and faster frequency increase.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that SIT is a key mechanism enabling sub-nanosecond magnetization oscillations in magnetic double tunnel junctions. The implementation of FLT, particularly when its strength is negative, offers opportunities to optimize the performance of spintronic oscillators by enhancing their frequency, power, and Q-factor, which are essential for high-speed applications.

Abstract: Self-oscillations of the magnetization due to self-induced torque (SIT) in a magnetic double tunnel junction that consists of perpendicularly polarized, pinned and free layers is investigated along with the field-like torque (FLT). The associated Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation is numerically analysed to exhibit the oscillations of magnetization driven by the current. From the numerical analysis, we show that the SIT is essential to generate os- cillations in the order of GHz and without it the magnetization reaches steady state after exhibiting switching. Without FLT, the frequency of the oscilla- tions decreases with the current while the power of oscillations increases. In the presence of the negative strength of the FLT the power spectral density confirms that the frequency, power and the Q-factor increase with the current. Also the tunability range and the rate at which the frequency enhances increase with the magnitude of the FLT.

This situation necessitates the investigation of alternative signatures of AHCs. The gapless phonons of the emergent electronic lattice provide a clear distinction from conventional quantum Hall states, but it may be difficult to disentangle these phonons from the plethora of other possible low-lying modes. Intriguingly, the quantum geometry of the underlying electronic ground state can imprint on the collective modes, possibly leading the phonons themselves to be topological. Were this the case, the resulting neutral chiral edge modes would provide a further signature of an AHC. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we compute the spectra of collective modes of Wigner crystals (WCs) and AHCs arising in minimal models and study the topology of the phonons and low-lying excitons. Across the WC to AHC transition, we observe a series of band inversions among collective modes, producing topological phonons and excitons, and a sharp sign change in the phonon Chern number upon entering the AHC phase. We conclude by discussing the relevance of collective mode topology to experiments on candidate systems for AHCs.

TL;DR: The paper investigates spin Hall effect (SHE) in van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 below its Curie temperature, observing enhanced SHE due to complex magnetic ordering and distinct temperature dependence compared to anomalous Hall effect (AHE).

Motivation: The study of spin Hall effect in vdW materials is crucial for developing spintronic devices, particularly given the potential of vdW materials in next-generation electronics.

Method: The research utilized spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance method to analyze SHE in Fe5GeTe2 below 310 K.

Result: The findings reveal a significant enhancement in SHE below the Curie temperature, with a distinct temperature dependence compared to the anomalous Hall effect, likely due to complex magnetic ordering in the material.

Conclusion: This work deepens our understanding of SHE in magnetic materials and opens new possibilities for spintronic applications in vdW systems.

Abstract: We investigate the spin Hall effect (SHE) in a van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe$_{5}$GeTe$_{2}$ (FGT) with a Curie temperature $T_{\rm C}$ of 310 K utilizing the spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance method. In synchronization with the emergence of the ferromagnetic phase resulting in the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), a noticeable enhancement in the SHE was observed below $T_{\rm C}$. On the other hand, the SHE shows a different temperature dependence from the AHE: the effective spin Hall conductivity is clearly enhanced with decreasing temperature unlike the anomalous Hall conductivity, reflecting the variation of band-structure accompanied by the complicated magnetic ordering of the FGT. The results provide a deep understanding of the SHE in magnetic materials to open a new route for novel functionalities in vdW materials-based spintronic devices.

Abstract: Moiré phonons describe collective vibrations of a moiré superlattice produced by long-wavelength relative displacements of the constituent layers. Despite coming from the backfolding of the acoustic phonons of the individual layers, many of these modes become infrared active when the system is doped. We illustrate this effect by a direct calculation of the optical absorption of twisted bilayer graphene (tBG) around different twist angles, including the magic angle. Several modes -including the acoustic-like phason- acquire a dipole moment via interband matrix elements of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) when the flat band is filled or emptied, giving rise to new resonances in the optical conductivity within the single-electron gap that are strongly affected by relaxation. The phason in particular gains a charge that equals the amount of electrons per moiré cell added/removed to/from neutrality. Geometrically, this can be understood as the topological quantization of a sliding Chern number. The charged phason yields a Drude-like conductivity with an effective mass that increases with lattice relaxation. Our findings are testable via THz spectroscopy, and provide an experimental knob to characterize EPC strength and disorder in moiré materials at small twist angles.

TL;DR: Traps at Ge/SiGe interfaces are key to device instability, but their behavior at cryogenic conditions isn't well understood. This paper uses Hall-bar FETs on strained Ge/SiGe heterostructures to study how these interface traps evolve over time at low temperatures. The research calculates valence band profiles and evaluates tunneling currents, showing that under certain conditions, transport transitions from trap-assisted tunneling to Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. This study enhances our understanding of interface trapping in strained Ge/SiGe devices and offers guidance for optimizing their performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of traps at the Ge/SiGe interface under cryogenic conditions is crucial for improving the stability and performance of strained SiGe-based quantum devices. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive characterization of the interface-state trapping mechanism and its time-dependent evolution.

Method: The paper employs Hall-bar field-effect transistors fabricated on strained Ge/SiGe heterostructures. It combines transport measurements with long-term stabilization techniques and incorporate Schrödinger-Poisson modeling. The calculated valence band profiles are used to evaluate the tunneling current density between the quantum well and the semiconductor-oxide interface.

Result: The study reveals that the total tunneling current transitions from trap-assisted tunneling-dominated to Fowler-Nordheim tunneling-dominated transport under different gate bias regimes. This finding refines the conventional Fowler-Nordheim-based understanding of interface trapping in strained Ge/SiGe heterostructures.

Conclusion: This work provides a detailed understanding of the evolution of interface-trap densities at cryogenic conditions and offers insights for optimizing Ge-based quantum device performance by improving barrier crystalline quality and reducing dislocation-related trap densities.

Abstract: Traps at the semiconductor-oxide interface are considered as a major source of instability in strained Ge/SiGe quantum devices, yet the quantified study of their cryogenic behavior remains limited. In this work, we investigate interface-state trapping using Hall-bar field-effect transistors fabricated on strained Ge/SiGe heterostructures. Combining transport measurements with long-term stabilization and Schrödinger-Poisson modelling, we reconstruct the gradual filling process of interface states at cryogenic condition. Using the calculated valence band profiles, we further evaluate the tunneling current density between the quantum well and the semiconductor-oxide interface. Our calculation demonstrates that the total tunneling current is consistent with a crossover from trap-assisted-tunneling-dominated transport to Fowler-Nordheim-tunneling-dominated transport under different gate bias regimes. These results refine the conventional Fowler-Nordheim-based picture of interface trapping in strained Ge/SiGe heterostructures and provide guidelines for improving Ge-based quantum device performance by improving barrier crystalline qualities and reducing dislocation-related trap densities.

Conclusion: 该研究为实现和控制类型II双曲晶体中的更高阶拓扑状态提供了路线和方法。

Abstract: Type-II hyperbolic lattices constitute a new class of hyperbolic structures that are projected onto the Poincaré ring and possess both an inner and an outer boundary. In this work, we reveal the higher-order topological phases in type-II hyperbolic lattices, characterized by the generalized quadrupole moment. Unlike the type-I hyperbolic lattices where zero-energy cornerlike states exist on a single boundary, the higher-order topological phases in type-II hyperbolic lattices possess zero-energy cornerlike states localized on both the inner and outer boundaries. These findings are verified within both the modified Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model and the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the higher-order topological phase remains robust against weak disorder in type-II hyperbolic lattices. Our work provides a route for realizing and controlling higher-order topological states in type-II hyperbolic lattices.

Our results establish a realistic and experimentally accessible platform for exploring non-Hermitian physics in topological insulator-ferromagnet junctions.

Motivation: Quantum computing and advanced optoelectronics rely on precise control of material interfaces at cryogenic temperatures. Reliable fabrication methods like cAFM lithography are crucial for their applications but often face limitations.

Method: The study demonstrates a 'waterless' cAFM lithography method, overcoming limitations by enabling fabrication in vacuum and cryogenic environments. Oxygen vacancy engineering at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface is the key technique.

Result: The 'waterless' approach achieves ultrafine line resolution of 0.85 nm and enables nonvolatile, reconfigurable control of electron-phonon interactions at mK temperatures. This is supported by first-principles calculations and drift-diffusion modeling.

Conclusion: This breakthrough bridges the gap between device fabrication and characterization at cryogenic temperatures, providing a versatile tool for engineering quantum phases in correlated oxides.

Abstract: Reconfigurable oxide nanoelectronics, enabled by conductive atomic force microscope (cAFM) lithography, have established complex oxide interfaces as a promising platform for quantum engineering that harnesses emergent phenomena for advanced functionalities. However, this cAFM nanofabrication process can only occur in the air, with simultaneous device decay described under the "water-cycle" writing mechanism. These restrictions pose ongoing challenges for device optimization in the quantum regime at mK temperatures. Here, we demonstrate a "waterless" cAFM lithography approach that is compatible with vacuum and cryogenic environments. Through oxygen vacancy engineering at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, we have achieved nonvolatile and reconfigurable cAFM control of nanoscale interfacial polaron-electron liquid transition at mK temperatures with an ultrafine line resolution of 0.85 nm. Supported by first-principles calculations and drift-diffusion modeling, we show that tip-controlled oxygen vacancy electromigration plays a key role. This advancement bridges reconfigurable device fabrication and concurrent characterization in situ at mK temperatures, and establishes a versatile Hubbard toolbox for engineering programmable quantum phases in correlated oxides.

Abstract: Symmetry and its representation play a crucial role in topological phases, including both Hermitian and non-Hermitian paradigms. In the presence of synthetic gauge field, spatial symmetries should be projectively represented, which can modify the Brillouin manifold. However, this is often overlooked in non-Hermitian systems. Here, we present that momentum-space non-symmorphic reflection symmetry, a typical projective symmetry, induce exceptional topology and the nonlocal skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian electric circuit. We observe the total topological charges 2, rather than 0, for all exceptional points in a Brillouin Klein bottle manifold, and the phase transition when an exceptional point crosses the antiparallel boundary and flips its topological charge. We further observe a novel skin effect that the skin modes at one side are nonlocally connected to those on the opposite side separated by half of the reciprocal lattice. Our results unveil the unique non-Hermitian phenomena enabled by the projective symmetry, and open avenues for exploring the non-Hermitian topology beyond Brillouin torus manifold.

Abstract: The spin-dependent thermoelectric properties of silicene nanoribbon heterostructures are investigated, in which the central conductor contains a random distribution of vacancies and is connected to two pristine leads of the same material, placed in proximity to ferromagnetic insulators. The magnetic moments of the leads are analyzed in both parallel and antiparallel configurations. A tight-binding Hamiltonian and the Green's function formalism are employed to calculate the spin-resolved thermoelectric properties of the system as functions of geometrical confinement and vacancy concentration. The results demonstrate an enhancement in charge and spin-dependent thermopower, resulting in an improved thermoelectric efficiency at room temperature, which overcomes the limitations imposed by the classical Wiedemann-Franz law. These findings indicate that defective silicene nanoribbons are promising platforms for the development of efficient thermoelectric and spin-caloritronic devices.

Abstract: Magnetic proximity effects in Co/hBN/graphene heterostructures are systematically analyzed via first-principles calculations, demonstrating a pronounced localized spatial variation of the induced spin polarization of graphene's Dirac states. The proximity-induced exchange coupling, magnetic moments, and tunneling spin polarization (TSP) are shown to depend sensitively on the atomic registry at the interfaces. We analyze more than twenty distinct stackings, including high- and low-symmetry configurations, and reveal that the spin splittings of graphene's Dirac bands span a wide range from 1 to 100 meV, depending on the local hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$, hBN $p_z$, and graphene $p_z$ orbitals. The strongest proximity effects emerge at geometric resonances, or "proximity hot spots", where the three orbital states overlap maximally. The local spin polarization also depends sensitively on energy: Dirac states aligned with resonant Co orbitals experience the most pronounced exchange interaction. At these energies, the pseudospin Hamiltonian description of magnetic proximity effects breaks down. Outside these resonances, the pseudospin picture is restored. Our findings highlight the intrinsically local nature of proximity effects, governed by the spectral resonance and interlayer wavefunction overlap. We further quantify how additional hBN layers, interlayer twist, and multilayer graphene modify the proximity exchange and TSP, offering microscopic insight for designing spintronic van der Waals heterostructures with engineered interfaces and optimized spin transport.

Abstract: We present a general theoretical approach for the quantitative description of parametric excitation of spin-wave modes in confined micromagnetic systems. This type of problem belongs to a broader class of nonlinear modal dynamics that arise across many areas of physics and engineering. The ferromagnetic sample is driven by parallel pumping with an external applied magnetic field having two tones at different frequencies, which are able to trigger parametric instability of two resonant modes. The two excited spin-wave modes interact in a strongly nonlinear fashion giving rise to quasiperiodicity, hysteresis and non-commutativity of steady-state oscillation regimes. To disentangle such a complex variety of dynamics, we develop a reduced-order model based on magnetization normal modes that is amenable of appropriate analytical treatment, leading to quantitative description of parametric instability thresholds, post-instability steady-state amplitude saturation and complete determination of phase diagrams for steady-state oscillation regimes. We have performed validation of the theory using numerical simulations. The phase diagrams allow to predict and explain all the features of the nonlinear interaction between the parametrically-excited spin-wave modes and can be directly compared with experimental results.

Abstract: We study the $T\bar T$ deformation using its formulation as a CFT coupled to two-dimensional dynamical gravity. Working within the BRST formalism, we apply the intertwiner construction of arXiv:2411.08865 to obtain a unitary "dressing" map between undeformed CFT operators and elements of the BRST cohomology of the deformed theory. We identify the resulting "dressed" operators corresponding to CFT primaries as the physical observables of the deformed theory and show that they arise from a field-dependent change of coordinates, in agreement with what is expected for the $T\bar T$ deformation. We then give a non-perturbative definition of deformed correlation functions as BRST-invariant expectation values of dressed operators in the gauge theory. Finally, we verify that our construction reproduces known structural and perturbative results.

Abstract: We compute the holographic Krylov complexity for a class of strongly coupled QFTs in a top down approach, where the dual gravitational counterpart corresponds to Yang-Baxter (YB) deformed supergravity solutions in a type IIB set up. The full 10d solution contains the $AdS_n (n=2,3)$ as the subspace, along with the dilaton and the background RR and NS fluxes. The Krylov complexity in the dual operator picture is obtained by computing the proper momentum of the massive particle along its geodesic in the bulk spacetime. We explore the effects of YB deformation on the bulk momentum of the particle, which in turn affects the rate of growth of complexity in the dual QFTs. Our results boil down into the undeformed case in the appropriate limit of the YB parameter.

Abstract: We revisit the Hawking evaporation history of low-temperature rotating black holes by taking into consideration the strong quantum fluctuations known to be present in the near-horizon, near-$\mathrm{AdS_2}$ throat region governed by an effective action that includes Schwarzian and two gauge modes. Imposing compatibility of this quantum framework with the semiclassical results creates a novel link between the particle angular momentum and the black hole electric charge before and after emission, leading to a nontrivial interplay between the superradiance effect and other channels. We evaluate single scalar (neutral and charged) emission of Kerr-Newman and single and di-particle emission of photons, gravitons and spinors in the Kerr spacetime. We uncover that quantum corrections may affect late time evaporation rates, which further slows down the whole evaporation process because of the near-balance between the $s$-wave channel and the superradiance channel. Specifically, we find energy decay of the form $E(t)\sim t^{-8/21}$ for scalar emission of a small, slowly rotating and charged black hole which differs from the analogous spherically symmetric quantum correction of $E(t)\sim t^{-2/5}$ already suppressed with respect to the semiclassical rate of $E(t)\sim t^{-1}$. We also discuss the quantum cross section for rotating black holes and point out various new features.

Abstract: The Levin-Wen string-net formalism provides a canonical mapping from spherical fusion categories to local Hamiltonians defining Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\text{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the emergence of higher-spin structure in 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ disordered models. While previous studies focused on the $J$-type model where the $E$-term in the Fermi multiplet was discarded. We extend the discussion to $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ disordered models with $E$-type potential. In terms of (disordered) $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ Landau-Ginzburg theory, we establish a duality between two models. By solving the Schwinger-Dyson equations and the ladder kernel matrix for 4-point functions, we verify that the $E$-type model is dynamically equivalent to the $J$-type model in the IR regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the $E$-type model also exhibits emergent higher-spin symmetry in certain limits. Our results reveal a larger region of the moduli space of 2D $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ disordered theories and provides insights into the holographic transition from finite to tensionless strings that can be diagnosed by the emergence of higher-spin symmetries.

Abstract: For the worldline theory of an extremal black hole, extremality amounts to vanishing ground state energy. In light of recent gravity results one would expect much like the ground state degeneracy this fine tuned condition too will not be met. It is unclear though whether this should be a quantum artefact or classical. In this paper we consider a non-BPS extremal four-charge Reissner Nordstrom black hole in N = 8 String theory. It is shown that the microscopic D-brane description fails to admit any extremal state, even classically. This positive energy is expected to destabilize the near horizon AdS2. The positive minimum energy is a direct consequence of the pattern of supersymmetry breaking by the D-branes. The black hole entropy is found to be the logarithm of the number of isolated minima and hence is related to the configurational entropy of the microscopic potential. We also find multiple continua of local minima corresponding to marginally bound states of the constituent D-branes.

Abstract: We study the $T\bar T$ deformation of boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) from an intrinsic field-theoretic perspective. Formulating the deformation as a modification of the asymptotic variational principle in AdS$_3$, we obtain the exact quadratic trace relation for the stress tensor without introducing a finite radial cutoff, which we take as the fundamental definition of the deformed theory. When restricted to a BCFT without independent boundary degrees of freedom, the intrinsic $T\bar T$ deformation becomes genuinely boundary-localized. Imposing reflective boundary conditions collapses the bulk composite operator to a universal one-dimensional irrelevant flow governed entirely by the displacement operator. We integrate this flow in closed form and derive an induced boundary action, showing that the deformation reorganizes existing boundary data without introducing new boundary degrees of freedom. We further establish a precise equivalence between a fixed-boundary description and a moving-boundary description, interpreted as a reparametrization of the variational problem rather than physical boundary dynamics.
  On the holographic side, we analyze two inequivalent realizations in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$, referred to as Type~A and Type~B. In Type~A, a rigid cutoff surface intersects the end-of-the-world brane at finite position, leading to an apparent boundary displacement. In Type~B, the cutoff surface is asymptotically AdS$_2$, so that the BCFT boundary is geometrically pinned and the displacement operator vanishes identically. Using entanglement entropy at zero and finite temperature, we disentangle universal consequences of the intrinsic boundary-localized flow from features that depend on the holographic implementation.

Abstract: We use equivariant localization to compute various observables for $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ preserving AdS$_3$ solutions in type IIB supergravity. Our method for localizing the odd-dimensional internal space is to perform a dimensional reduction along a shrinking circle which introduces a boundary in the remaining even-dimensional spacetime. Canonical even-dimensional localization can then be performed on this space after taking into account contributions from the boundary. We illustrate with a number of supersymmetric solutions. One of the novel aspects of this work is applying these techniques to study punctures and defects using localization. We obtain new results for the central charge of 2d SCFTs arising from compactifying $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM on a punctured Riemann surface.

TL;DR: 在 holographic duality 中，场理论的总能量通过 holographic 正则化得到，不仅依赖于 bulk 几何，还依赖于量化的方案。我们指出，几个广为人知的 holographic 不等式——包括 AdS Penrose 不等式、熵增长下限及 CV 和 CA 复杂性的增长速率上限——的有效性依赖于量化的方案。鉴于此问题，我们引入了修改后的总能，它仍通过 holographic 正则化计算，但最终值与量化的方案无关。我们验证，在广义自由标量场理论模型中，这个新的“总能”恢复了所有这些不等式在模型中的普遍有效性。我们的结果表明，在 holographic 设置中讨论上述不等式时，我们的修改后的总能提供了一个更稳健的能量概念。

Abstract: In holographic duality, the total energy of the dual field theory is obtained from the holographic renormalization, which depends not only on the bulk geometry but also on the choice of quantization schemes. We point out that the validity of several widely studied holographic inequalities -- including the AdS Penrose inequality, the late-time bound on entanglement entropy growth, and the growth-rate limits of CV and CA complexities -- depends on the choice of quantization schemes. Motivated by this issue, we introduce a modified total energy, which is still computed via holographic renormalization but the final value is independent of the choice of quantization schemes. We verify that this new ``total energy'' restores all these bounds to universal validity in the model of generalized free scalar field theory. Our results suggest that our modified total energy provides a more robust notion of energy when we talk about above inequalities in holographic settings.

Abstract: We study an Aganagic-Vafa brane supported on a special Lagrangian submanifold $\mathcal{L}$ in a non-compact toric Calabi-Yau threefold $\mathcal{X}$. From the perspective of geometric engineering, the Aganagic-Vafa branes give rise to a special class of half-BPS codimension-two defects in 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric field theories in the presence of $Ω$-background. We propose that the defect partition functions give generating functions of refined, non-negative, integral open BPS invariants of the pair $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{L})$, across different Kähler moduli chambers they are expanded in. In the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit, the partition function provides a partially resummed solution to a $q$-difference equation that quantizes the mirror curve of $\mathcal{X}$ in an unambiguous fashion, in a polarization determined by the discrete labels of the Aganagic-Vafa brane. We demonstrate our method at examples of $\mathbb{C}^3$, resolved conifold, resolved $A_1$-singularity, local $F_0$, and local $F_1$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quasicrystals and their spacetime analogues could provide insights into fundamental physics, particularly in high-dimensional theories and compactifications.

Method: The authors propose a mathematical construction on Lorentzian space, extrapolating Euclidean quasicrystal techniques to spacetime, and analyze the resulting structures.

Result: Novel structures, Lorentzian quasicrystals in spacetime, are presented along with unique properties compared to Euclidean quasicrystals, suggesting potential physical applications.

Conclusion: The discovery of these quasicrystals in spacetime opens new avenues for theoretical physics, especially in high-energy and string theories, offering a unique perspective on symmetry and compactification.

Abstract: Self-similar quasicrystals (like the famous Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings) are exceptional geometric structures in which long-range order, quasiperiodicity, non-crystallographic orientational symmetry, and discrete scale invariance are tightly interwoven in a beautiful way. In this paper, we show how such structures may be generalized from Euclidean space to Minkowski spacetime. We construct the first examples of such Lorentzian quasicrystals (the spacetime analogues of the Penrose or Ammann-Beenker tilings), and point out key novel features of these structures (compared to their Euclidean cousins). We end with some (speculative) ideas about how such spacetime quasicrystals might relate to reality. This includes an intriguing scenario in which our infinite $(3+1)$D universe is embedded (like one of our spacetime quasicrystal examples) in a particularly symmetric $(9+1)$D torus $T^{9,1}$ (which was previously found to yield the most symmetric toroidal compactification of the superstring). We suggest how this picture might help explain the mysterious seesaw relationship $M_{\rm Pl}M_{\rm vac}\approx M_{\rm EW}^{2}$ between the Planck, vacuum energy, and electroweak scales ($M_{\rm Pl}$, $M_{\rm vac}$, $M_{\rm EW}$).

### [197] [Black holes and causal nonlinear electrodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07789)
*Jorge G. Russo,Paul K. Townsend*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper investigates charged black hole solutions in generic theories of nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) and finds that for a large class of NLED theories, the Reissner-Nordström (RN) metric is an exact solution under certain conditions, but it is unstable. For causal NLED, regular black holes do not exist, and the entropy of extremal RN black holes is less than the RN entropy for a fixed charge. The paper also discusses transitions in the parameter space between different black hole and naked singularity solutions, noting that at the transition point, the metric corresponds to a Barriola-Vilenkin global monopole.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is motivated by the desire to understand the behavior of charged black holes in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). The authors aim to explore the restrictions imposed by causality on these black hole solutions and to analyze how different NLED theories affect the structure and properties of these solutions. The motivation also seems to be driven by the theoretical importance of black holes in general relativity and their potential implications for our understanding of the universe, including the study of singularities and the nature of gravity in extreme conditions.

Method: The paper employs a mathematical analysis of the Einstein-NLED equations for spherically symmetric charged black holes. The authors use techniques from differential equations and general relativity to study the solutions of these equations under various NLED theories, particularly focusing on whether these solutions are stable and causality-preserving.

Result: The paper presents several key findings. First, for a large class of Born-type NLED theories, the Reissner-Nordström (RN) metric is an exact solution for certain dyonic black holes, but this solution is unstable. Second, the authors demonstrate that for all causal NLED theories, there are no regular black holes, meaning that the entropy of extremal black holes in these theories is less than the entropy of the corresponding RN black holes with fixed charge. Additionally, the paper identifies conditions under which there is a parameter-space transition between RN-type and Schwarzschild-type black hole solutions. For the transition from Schwarzschild-type to naked singularity solutions, which occurs at finite mass, the metric at the transition point corresponds to a Barriola-Vilenkin global monopole.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that stability and causality considerations place significant restrictions on the types of NLED theories that can describe charged black holes. Causal NLED theories do not admit regular black holes, and the entropy of extremal black holes in these theories is lower than that of RN black holes. The analysis also reveals that transitions between different black hole solutions and the formation of naked singularities are tied to specific parameter values in the NLED theories. The findings contribute to the understanding of the interplay between nonlinear electrodynamics, black hole physics, and causality.

Abstract: For generic theories of nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) we investigate the restrictions imposed by causality on spherically-symmetric charged black-hole solutions of the Einstein-NLED equations. For a large class of (acausal) Born-type NLED theories, we find that the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) metric is an exact, but unstable, solution for some dyonic black holes. For all causal NLED we show that there are no regular black holes, and that the entropy of extremal black holes is less than the RN entropy for fixed charge. We also find the conditions for a parameter-space transition between RN-type and Schwarzschild-type global structure. For the transition from Schwarzschild-type to naked singularity, which occurs at finite mass, we show that the metric at the transition point is a Barriola-Vilenkin global monopole.

Abstract: Metamaterials are arrangement of basic building blocks that repeat in space, time, or both. These material systems serve as an excellent platform for controlling waves, such as engineering wavenumber band gaps, flat bands, and zero-frequency band gaps. However, combining one or more of these exotic features within the same unit cell design remains a challenge. Moreover, once a metamaterial is realized, its dispersive properties are usually fixed. In this work, we present a tunable passive hierarchical metamaterial capable of exhibiting wavenumber band gaps, flat bands, and zero-frequency band gaps within the same dispersion curve. Our metamaterial is composed of magnetic elements confined within a fixed magnetic boundary. The metamaterial can be tuned by adjusting the magnetic boundary, which in turn can alter the lattice periodicity. We open wavenumber band gaps by incorporating magnetic coupling within the unit cell elements, resulting in negative physical stiffness. The tunability of the magnetic coupling also enables complete flattening of the dispersion bands. Moreover, the ground stiffness within our unit-cell design causes the opening of zero-frequency band gaps. We present our approach through a combination of analytical, numerical, and experimental methods. The analytical framework provides a blueprint for obtaining each of these exotic dispersion characteristics. The numerical analysis, using both linear and nonlinear models, validates our analytical predictions, which we further confirm through experimental demonstrations. Our work opens the door to exploring magnetic tunability and hierarchy in engineering metamaterial systems with exotic properties that can be harnessed in advanced acoustic and mechanical devices.

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental framework for inducing and tuning vibration bandgaps in digitally controlled mechatronic metamaterials. A slender-beam structure instrumented with collocated piezoelectric sensor-actuator pairs distributed periodically along the length is used as the host medium, with decentralized second-order low-pass resonant filter with negative position feedback controllers implemented in real time on an FPGA platform. Unlike conventional approaches that assess bandgap formation through tip displacement, this study relies on bending strain minimization of piezoelectric sensors as the principal indicator of control-induced bandgaps. This reflects more accurately the moment-based phase cancellation dynamics similar to resonator behavior. We derive analytical expressions for transmissibility in an n x n decentralized feedback architecture and verify them experimentally using a 7 x 7 unit-cell configuration. The findings show that resonant controllers with negative feedback applied at the unit-cell level can be systematically tuned through controller gain and damping to open targeted low-frequency bandgaps and significantly improve vibration attenuation. By shifting the focus to localized dynamics, this work deepens the understanding of how control-induced bandgaps emerge and demonstrates a scalable pathway for designing programmable mechatronic metamaterials based on unconventional resonator behavior.

Abstract: A high-efficiency power-combining method for four-way 5.8-GHz magnetrons based on the external injection-locking technique is presented in this article. The method uses a nonisolated, lossless five-port hybrid waveguide combiner for power combining. Meanwhile, the injection-locking technology has been applied to magnetrons for achieving coherent power combining. The phase fluctuation of the injection-locked magnetron, without the presence of a phase-locked loop, measured nearly 2.5 degree. In contrast, when a phase-locked loop was introduced, the phase fluctuation reduced significantly to approximately 0.5 degree. This phase accuracy can fully meet the requirements of combining experiments. Four magnetrons worked in injection-locked states without phase-locked loop. The proposed power-combining system is designed, measured, and analyzed. Measurement results show that a high-power-combining efficiency of over 95% is achieved by injection-locked magnetron without PLL, with the best efficiency reaching up to 97.7% with phase control of the injected signals. Experimental results reveal that the magnetron phase-pushing effects and the ripple in high-power dc voltage and current have a minor impact of approximately 4% on the combining efficiency.

Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive two-dimensional generalisation of the recently introduced Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD) framework for rolling contact problems. The proposed formulation extends the one-dimensional FrBD model to accommodate simultaneous longitudinal and lateral slips, spin, and arbitrary transport kinematics over a finite contact region. The derivation combines a rheological representation of the bristle element with an analytical local sliding-friction law. By relying on an application of the Implicit Function Theorem, the notion of sliding velocity is then eliminated, and a fully dynamic friction model, driven solely by the rigid relative velocity, is obtained. Building upon this local model, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, covering standard linear rolling contact, as well as linear and semilinear rolling in the presence of large spin slips. For the linear formulations, well-posedness, stability, and passivity properties are investigated under standard assumptions. In particular, the analysis reveals that the model preserves passivity under almost any parametrisation of practical interest. Numerical simulations illustrate steady-state action surfaces, transient relaxation phenomena, and the effect of time-varying normal loads. The results provide a unified and mathematically tractable friction model applicable to a broad class of rolling contact systems.
