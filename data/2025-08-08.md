*Gurupada Ghorai,Kalyan Ghosh,Pratap K. Sahoo*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effects of Au ion implantation on 2D materials, showing how it can modify their magnetic properties, including increasing the Curie temperature.Implantation leads to changes in exchange energy gaps and magnetic moments, suggesting potential applications in spintronic devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drop-in synthesis methods and exfoliation of 2D materials have made them popular in spintronics. Exploring their modification under low-energy ion implantation is important for tuning their properties for device applications.

Method: The study uses the Scotch tape method to exfoliate Cr2Ge2Te6 flakes and studies their morphological, structural, vibrational, and magnetic properties using Au ion implantation at 30 KeV doses.

Result: The Au ion implantation increases the Curie temperature and leads to transitions in magnetic interactions, indicating enhanced magnetic properties through intercalation.

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential of ion implantation on 2D materials to tune their magnetic properties, paving the way for advanced spintronic applications combining electronics and magnetism.

Abstract: Advancements in 2D magnetic materials highlight their potential in
semiconductors, magnetism, and spintronics, particularly in tuning magnetic
properties for spintronic applications. This study investigates the impact of
low-energy (30 KeV) Au ion implantation on 2D layered exfoliated $Cr_2Ge_2Te_6$
flakes prepared on Si/SiO$_2$ substrates using the Scotch tape method. Five
different ion doses (5$\times10^{13}$, 1$\times10^{14}$, 5$\times10^{14}$,
1$\times10^{15}$, and 2.5$\times10^{15}$ ions/cm$^2$) were used to modify the
morphology, composition, structural, and vibrational properties of the samples.
The implantation introduces significant changes in morphology and magnetic
behavior, leading to an increase in Curie temperature and an attribution from
superexchange to double exchange interactions. The reduced exchange energy gaps
and modified magnetic moments attribute to Au ions intercalation in
$Cr_2Ge_2Te_6$ underscore the potential of ions implantation to tune the
magnetic properties of 2D materials for advanced spintronic applications.

Abstract: We investigate, as part of a Lawrence-Livermore-National-Laboratory (LLNL)
sponsored-research work initiated in February of 2021, the parametric
performance analysis of ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) Fe-doped Ga2O3
photoconductive semiconductor switch (FG-PCSS) with embedded electrode. The
detailed SILVACO based simulation of the FG-PCSS uses experimentally obtained
lifetime, absorption coefficient, and mobility data. The key analysis results,
demonstrated first to the sponsor LLNL in 2022, focus on the performance of the
FG-PCSS under relatively high electric field and optical-excitation energy with
specific regard to current gain, quantum efficiency, on-state resistance, and
impact of beam position. The parametric analysis indicates that a high-gain
operation yielding a low-cost laser beam for the FG-PCSS is possible.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 摘要主要介绍了一种基于负折射率的 metamaterial 用于水波控制，提出了可以同时调节水深和重力的结构，展示了其在水波隔离、折射、成像等方面的应用，实验结果与理论预测一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水波对开发和防灾具有重要意义，寻找有效的控制方法是关键。

Method: 使用了Veselago-Pendry双负折射率 metamaterial，通过受损 gears 和 split tubes 构建均匀排列的结构，利用 CPA 预测了负有效水深和重力，并通过模拟和实验验证了效果。

Result: 结构设计合理，参数预测准确，模拟和实验结果一致。

Conclusion: 该 metamaterial 为水波调控提供了新的工具，应用前景良好。

Abstract: Water waves present both opportunities and hazards, which demand precise
control to effectively exploit their energy and mitigate their destructive
effects. Leveraging the unique propagation characteristic of negative
refraction enables versatile strategies for achieving such control. Here, we
propose a Veselago-Pendry double negative metamaterial (DNM) for water waves
constructed by nested gears and split tubes. This uniform array structure
realizes effective negative water depth and gravity distributions, enabling
tunable negative refraction that resolves the unclear structure-propagation
relationships and stringent layout requirements of prior negative refraction
structures. By employing coherent potential approximation (CPA), negative
effective water depth ue and gravity ge are predicted. The predicted DNM
parameters align well with band structures, and are validated by simulations of
isolation, wave bending and all-angle imaging with surface waves excitation. A
simplified experiment demonstrating water wave bending was successfully
performed, matching the analytical predictions and simulation results well.
Through quantitative mapping between structural parameters and propagation
properties that enables tunable bandgaps and controllable negative refraction,
DNMs furnish a transformative toolkit for coastal engineering, and are able to
calm harbors, boost wave-energy harvesters, and steer river-bend currents to
curb erosion.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper discusses various thin-film PV technologies and their progress, aiming to understand their current status and future potential.

Result: CdTe and CIGS lead in efficiency, perovskites are showing rapid progress, but stability, toxicity, and material issues hinder adoption.

Conclusion: Advancements in tandem architectures, encapsulation, and sustainable materials are needed for future success.

Abstract: Thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technologies address crucial challenges in solar
energy applications, including scalability, cost-effectiveness, and
environmental sustainability. This paper reviews critically, thin-film
technologies such as amorphous silicon (a-Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe), and
copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). It also discusses emerging technologies,
including perovskites, copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS), quantum dots (QDs),
organic photovoltaics (OPV), and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Among
these, CdTe and CIGS currently dominate commercial viability, achieving
laboratory-scale efficiencies of 23.1% and 23.6%, respectively. Perovskites
have notably advanced, reaching a laboratory efficiency of 26.7%. Thin-film PV
technologies significantly reduce material use and manufacturing costs,
offering distinct advantages such as flexibility and lightweight structures,
thereby enabling diverse applications from building-integrated systems to
portable electronic devices. Despite these benefits, broader adoption remains
limited by challenges including long-term stability, toxicity concerns, and
material scarcity. Addressing these challenges through advancements in tandem

sourcing is essential for thin-film PV technologies to substantially contribute
to the global renewable energy transition.

*Yu Wang,Shubin Liu,Zhihang Yao,Yulin Liu,Zhiyong Zhang,Zhengyang He,Ziwen Pan,Changqing Feng*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: This paper presents a high-resolution muography hodoscope using Micromegas detectors, achieving excellent spatial resolution both in the lab and outdoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon radiography is useful for inspecting hidden structures but faces challenges with accurate flux measurement. This paper aims to solve those issues.

Method: The team built a detector using four Micromegas layers, multiplexing circuits, and a versatile readout system. They tested it in a subway tunnel and outdoors.

Result: They achieved 190 µm resolution and demonstrated robust performance.

Conclusion: Opens new possibilities for non-destructive testing and geophysical exploration.

Abstract: Muon radiography is an imaging technique based on muon absorption in matter
that allows measurement of internal details in hidden objects or structures.
This technique relies on measuring cosmic-ray muons tracks accurately, which
reflects the incoming muon flux from both the target object and the open sky.
In this paper, we report on the construction of a high spatial resolution
muography hodoscope based on Micromegas detectors. Using four layers of 40cm
{\times} 40 cm Micromegas detectors, channel multiplexing circuits, and the
versatile readout system, a moveable muography hodoscope named {\mu}STC-R400
was designed and constructed. Results show that the channel multiplexing
circuits can resolve hit positions correctly, and the spatial resolution of the
detector is approximately 190 {\mu}m. Experiments were conducted at an
under-construction subway tunnel and outdoors near a mountain, demonstrating
the {\mu}STC-R400's ability to maintain high spatial resolution outside the
laboratory and its robustness in harsh environments.

### [7] [The seed-carrying stalk of the linden diaspore ensures autorotating flight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05106)
*Annette Cazaubiel,Andreas Carlson*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: 研究发现， Linden 植物的_diaspore_飞行依赖于其stalk_长度与wing span的比例，该比例决定了稳定自旋飞行的能力，从而延长飞行时间。生物和合成材料的实验支持了这一发现，流动的气流数据进一步确认了这一特性可能是进化选择的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究种子传播机制是理解植物入侵生态系统的关键，特别是风传播的机制。

Method: 实验包括制作生物和合成diaspores进行飞行实验，测量飞行时间和参数，然后用流动分析和计算流体力学研究飞行机制。

Result: 发现stalk_长度与wing span的比例是稳定飞行的关键参数，且存在进化选择的特征。

Conclusion: 这个发现有助于理解植物如何有效传播种子，可能解释了不同物种差异飞行能力的进化原因。外延应用可能包括改进风传播模型或设计更有效的人工种子传播装置。

Abstract: The dispersal of seeds by wind is one of the most evolved mechanisms plants
use to invade new territories. Linden trees grow diaspores with a curved bract
acting as a wing, where the seed pods are connected underneath by a stalk.
Besides the seed-carrying capacity, the other functions of the stalk remain
unknown. We demonstrate that the stalk of linden (genus Tilia L.) diaspores
plays an essential role in their flight. The stalk length to wing span ratio is
found to be the key parameter for facilitating steady autorotating flight in
Tilia x europaea diaspores, effectively doubling their flight time compared to
an unsteady tumbling motion. Flight experiments with biological and synthetic
diaspores reveal a critical stalk length needed to induce autorotation, which
correlates with analysis of collected biological samples and points to a
possible evolutionarily selected trait. Flow measurements show that the
vortical structures around the curved wing cause the elevated lift force during
the autorotating flight.

Result: 在孤立情况下，系统趋向于各个热力学相的混合物。但在引入外部激发物后，可以选择特定相平衡。使用 bootstrapping 方法得到了严格的定理来支持不动点的存在性和唯一性，并通过数值计算展示了相变行为。

Conclusion: 这种方法为理解大N量子引力的热力学提供了一种模拟方法。通过研究这些伪热力学系统，可以更深入地探索量子力学系统的孤立与孤立相变现象，从而更有效地理解量子引力的热力学行为。

Abstract: It is believed that the theory of quantum gravity describing our universe is
unitary. Nonetheless, if we only have access to a subsystem, its dynamics is
described by nonequilibrium physics. Motivated by this, we investigate the
planar limit of large $N$ one-matrix quantum mechanics obeying the Lindblad
master equation with dissipative jump terms, focusing on the existence,
uniqueness, and properties of steady states. After showing that Lindblad
dissipation is absent in the gauged model at large $N$, we study nonequilibrium
phase transitions in planar ungauged matrix quantum mechanics. In the first
class of examples, where potentials are unbounded from below, we study
nonequilibrium critical points above which strong dissipation allows for the
existence of normalizable steady states that would otherwise not exist. In the
second class of examples, termed matrix quantum optics, we find evidence of
nonequilibrium phase transitions analogous to those recently reported in the
quantum optics literature for driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. Preliminary
results on two-matrix quantum mechanics are also presented. We implement
bootstrap methods to obtain concrete and rigorous results for the
nonequilibrium steady states of matrix quantum mechanics in the planar limit.

Conclusion: 非阿贝尔引力 cosmic string 背景下，标量和旋量场的散射行为与阿贝尔模型具有显著差异，支持需要进一步研究引力在高能物理中的潜在影响。

Abstract: We study the scattering behavior of scalar and spinor fields in the
background of a gravitating cosmic string spacetime. The model explored here
for the background vortex is non-abelian, becoming abelian in an appropriate
limiting case. We adopted the formalism we developed in
\cite{silva2021scattering}, modifying the standard partial wave approach. We
apply the method for a scalar and also a fermion field interacting with the
background spacetime with a nontrivial asymptotic structure. The spacetime
metric, obtained numerically in \cite{de2015gravitating}, forms the basis of
our state-of-the-art numerical study. We make an exhaustive analysis and
compare all the results in the non-abelian model with the corresponding abelian
one for both massless and massive fields. We analyze the field configuration's
total cross-section and angular profile at small and large distances from the
core. We show that the total cross-section oscillates with the incident
momentum of the wave, as anticipated in \cite{silva2021scattering}, and also,
the angular profile can be explained reasonably well with a Fraunhofer
diffraction pattern, especially for the scalar field scattering.

### [10] [On invariants of two-dimensional minimally supersymmetric field theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04916)
*Yuji Tachikawa,Kazuya Yonekura*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new invariant for 2D N=(0,1) supersymmetric quantum field theories, building on insights from heterotic string theory. It also defines a spectral invariant and pairing method. The findings could potentially be extended to higher dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of invariants in quantum field theories is crucial for understanding their properties and connections across different dimensions. The introduction of a new invariant alongside an established method for their analysis could provide deeper insights into the structure of these theories and their dualities.

Method: The authors construct the new invariant by leveraging known properties of SQFTs inspired by heterotic string theory. They also introduce a spectral invariant by integrating the supercharge and use a spectral pairing to detect existing and new invariants.

Result:  successful construction of a new invariant, along with a related spectral invariant and pairing, that allows for the systematic identification and analysis of both existing and new invariants within the theory framework.

Conclusion: By utilizing heterotic string theory motivations and spectral methods, this work opens new avenues for studying and classifying two-dimensional N=(0,1) SQFTs, potentially leading to connections with other areas of theoretical physics.

Abstract: We construct a new invariant of two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}{=}(0,1)$
supersymmetric quantum field theories (SQFTs), under a couple of assumptions on
the general properties of such SQFTs motivated by considerations in heterotic
string theory. This new invariant is in addition to the known 'primary'
invariants, i.e. the ordinary elliptic genus and the mod-2 elliptic genus, and
the known 'secondary' invariant, which can be considered as an SQFT analog of
the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer $\eta$-invariant when its continuous variation
vanishes.
  We also define a spectral invariant of supercharge more generally by the
integration of the expectation value of the supercharge over the fundamental
region of $\mathrm{ SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. With this spectral invariant, we
construct a spectral pairing which can be used to systematically detect all the
known invariants, including the new one we introduce in the first half of this
paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究处理的是SL(2,ℂ) Open Spin Chain，特别是涉及B算子和边界相互作用的问题。这种问题在量子场论和统计力学中非常重要，尤其是在计算和理解多体量子系统的性质时。

Method: 研究者使用Λ算子和Q算子来构建本征函数，并且通过寻找一个与B算子 commuting 的Q算子来实现这一点。他们还通过引入K和R算子来帮助解决特征值问题，这可能是关键步骤之一。

Result: 研究者找到了具有明确对称性的本征函数，这些函数涵盖了所有情况，并展示了它们的正交性和完整性。通过计算的手段，尤其是在 Mellin-Barnes 积分中，结果具有明确性和一致性。

Conclusion: 该研究为非紧开放SL(2,ℂ)自旋链的B算子特征问题提供了完整的解，这可能为更广泛量子系统的研究提供了一个转折点。

Abstract: We diagonalize the $B$-element of monodromy matrix for noncompact open
$SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ spin chain with boundary interaction. The monodromy matrix
is defined in terms of $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ $L$-operator and boundary $K$-matrix.
The eigenfunctions of $B$-operator are constructed iteratively using raising
$\Lambda$-operators. The key role in the calculations plays the Baxter
$Q$-operator commuting with the $B$-operator. The main building blocks for
$\Lambda$- and $Q$-operators are $\mathcal{K}$-operator -- the general solution
of reflection equation and $\mathcal{R}$-operator -- the reduction of the
general solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. Two types of the symmetry of
eigenfunctions are established. The first kind is the invariance under
permutations and reflections of spectral variables, or in other words, under
the action of Weyl group of B and C root systems. The second kind is the
symmetry with respect to transformation $(s,g) \to (1-s,1-g)$, where $s$ is the
spin variable and $g$ is the parameter of $K$-matrix. We prove that obtained
system of eigenfunctions is orthogonal and complete. The calculation of the
scalar product of eigenfunction is given in initial coordinate representation.
We derive the Mellin-Barnes integral representation for eigenfunctions and use
it to prove the comleteness.

### [12] [Generalization of anomaly formula for time reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04990)
*Ippo Orii*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究(2+1)维阿贝尔 bosonic拓扑相的时反转对称性，Z₂×Z₂分类了这种系统的时反转异常。可以通过在如RP^4和CP^2等流形上的分割函数来诊断(3+1)维的对称保护拓扑(SPT)相。这些分割函数之间的关系由一个异常公式Z(RP^4)*Z(CP^2)=θ_M给出，其中θ_M是与跨心态相关的德恩扭曲相位。另一方面，存在有界gap边界受到称为更高中心电荷ξₙ的约束，这些ξₙ是可计算不变量，记录障碍数据。由于已知Z(CP^2)=ξ₁，我们推广了异常公式，引入了新的时反转不变量ηₙ以及一个特殊子集Mⁿ。导出了关系式ηₙ*ξₙ=（Σθ(a)ⁿ over a in Mⁿ）除以绝对值。这个关系将已知的异常公式进行了推广。分析了子集Mⁿ的代数结构，导出了它必须满足的一致性关系，并明确了它与原异常公式之间的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究时反转对称性在(2+1)维阿贝尔玻色onic拓扑相中的作用，尝试推广已知的异常公式，并通过引入新的不变量来描述系统的特性。 this paper aims to explore time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic topological phases and proposes an extended anomaly formula using new invariants and a special subset of anyons.

Method: The paper uses abstract algebra and topological field theory. They analyze the partition functions on specific manifolds, derive relationships between higher central charges and anomalies, and establish connections between the introduced subsets and existing anomalies. the authors also derive consistency relations for the special subset Mⁿ. 

Result: The paper successfully proposes an extended anomaly formula involving higher central charges ξₙ and a new time-reversal invariant ηₙ. This provides a more comprehensive description of the anomalies in these systems. The special subset Mⁿ and their associated relations are identified and analyzed, which may open new avenues for studying SPT phases and their boundaries.

Conclusion: 通过在RP^4和CP^2等流形上的分割函数分析，该论文推广了已知的异常公式，引入了新的时反转不变量ηₙ和特殊子集Mⁿ，提升了对(2+1)维阿贝尔玻色onic拓扑相时反转对称性的理解。未来研究可能进一步探索这些不变量对系统边界和相变的影响。

Abstract: We study time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)-dimensional abelian bosonic
topological phases. Z_2 x Z_2 classifies the time-reversal anomalies in such
systems symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in (3+1) dimensions and can
be diagnosed via partition functions on manifolds such as RP^4 and CP^2. These
partition functions are related by an anomaly formula of the form Z(RP^4) *
Z(CP^2) = theta_M, where theta_M is the Dehn twist phase associated with the
crosscap state.
  Meanwhile, the existence of gapped boundaries is constrained by so-called
higher central charges, denoted xi_n, which serve as computable invariants
encoding obstruction data. Motivated by the known relation Z(CP^2) = xi_1, we
propose a generalization of the anomaly formula involving both the higher
central charges xi_n and a new time-reversal invariant eta_n. By introducing a
distinguished subset M^n of the set A of anyons, we establish the relation
  eta_n * xi_n = (sum of theta(a)^n over a in M^n) divided by its absolute
value.
  This generalizes the known anomaly formula. We analyze the algebraic
structure of the subset M^n, derive consistency relations it satisfies, and
clarify its connection to the original anomaly formula.

### [13] [Crossing symmetry including non planar diagrams in perturbative QFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05044)
*Ritabrata Bhattacharya*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: We provide a proof of crossing symmetry for non-planar diagrams in perturbative QFT. Following existing planar proof, non-planar diagrams are divided into 'trivial' and 'non-trivial' cases. Trivial cases extend straightforwardly, while non-trivial cases require addressing Landau singularities. An explicit 3-loop example is given, and a conjecture is made for higher loops based on the nature of these singularities. The key takeaway is that while a general proof for non-trivial cases at higher loops is challenging, the proof holds due to the type of singularity involved, not just loop complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the extension of proving crossing symmetry beyond planar diagrams, which has significant implications for understanding on-shell amplitudes in QFT. Crossing symmetry is fundamental and its proof enhances theoretical underpinnings.

Method: The authors categorize non-planar diagrams into two types. The trivial case proof follows the planar method, while the non-trivial case requires careful examination of Landau singularities. An explicit 3-loop example is used to highlight the challenges in the general proof.

Result: 	The paper successfully demonstrates the proof for the trivial non-planar cases and provides evidence suggesting the possibility of a similar proof for non-trivial cases through the lens of Landau singularities, even though a general proof isn't presented here.

Conclusion: 	By distinguishing non-planar diagrams into manageable categories and focusing on their singularity structures, the authors advance the understanding of crossing symmetry in perturbative QFT, particularly for complex, non-trivial cases at higher loop orders. This work opens avenues for extending such proofs to more challenging scenarios, enhancing theoretical predictions in high-energy physics.

Abstract: We venture a proof of crossing symmetry for non-planar diagrams in
perturbative QFT. For the planar diagrams a proof of crossing is available in
the literature and our method closely follows the one depicted in that case. We
classify the non-planar diagrams broadly into two types. For one of these types
the proof is pretty straightforward and hence the result extends to all point
all loop on-shell amplitudes. These are called the "trivial" cases while for
the other type we find certain cases called the "non trivial" cases for which
the proof is much more subtle. We present an explicit example of such a "non
trivial" case at 3-loop order and argue how the proof of crossing symmetry
holds true when all subtleties are taken into consideration. Although a general
proof for these "nontrivial cases" at higher loop is beyond the scope of this
paper, we do conjecture that the proof of crossing shall hold in a similar
fashion, for higher loops as well since the subtlety of the resolution in
3-loop case lies with the type of Landau singularity we need to consider and
not the number of internal propagators or loop momenta.

Abstract: We consider conformal Killing-Yano forms corresponding to the antisymmetric
generalizations of conformal Killing vectors to higher degree forms in the
presence of skew-symmetric torsion. Integrability conditions for torsionful
conformal Killing-Yano forms are found and a graded Lie bracket for conformal
Killing-Yano forms to constitute a graded Lie algebra structure is proposed. It
is found that a graded Lie algebra structure for a special subset of torsionful
conformal Killing-Yano forms can be constructed for a closed and parallel
skew-symmetric torsion on constant curvature and Einstein manifolds. Similar
structure for generalized hidden symmetries defined from generalized connection
in generalized geometry is also constructed.

*Leron Borsten,Simon Jonsson,Dimitri Kanakaris,Hyungrok Kim*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified algebraic framework combining twisted and classical background fields in supersymmetric quantum field theory, utilizing homotopy-algebraic structures and the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the connection between twisting and introducing classical backgrounds in quantum field theory, aiming for a unified framework that includes topological twists, spontaneous symmetry breaking, anomalies, and localisation.

Method: The authors use homotopy algebraic techniques, focusing on $L_superalgebra$-algebras and the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism to formalize the connection between twisting and classical backgrounds.

Result: They establish that both twisting and classical backgrounds are instances of homotopy algebraic twisting, providing a unified framework that encompasses various phenomena in supersymmetric QFT.

Conclusion: This work offers a comprehensive methodological advancement in understanding and computing phenomena in supersymmetric quantum field theories.

Abstract: Twisting and classical background fields are two foundational techniques in
supersymmetric quantum field theory, central to developments ranging from the
Higgs mechanism to topological twisting and supersymmetric localisation. While
traditionally treated as distinct procedures, they appear on an equal footing
in the homotopy-algebraic approach to quantum field theory. In this work, we
formalise this connection by interpreting both twisting and the introduction of
classical backgrounds as instances of twisting curved quantum
$L_\infty$-superalgebras. Using the language of homotopy algebras and the
Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, we provide a unified algebraic framework that
encompasses topological/holomorphic twists, spontaneous symmetry breaking,
computation of anomalies, and supersymmetric localisation \`a la
Festuccia--Seiberg. As a byproduct, we introduce a notion of twisting for
quantum $L_\infty$-algebras and a homotopy-algebraic reformulation of the
one-particle-irreducible effective action.

### [16] [Entanglement measures for causally connected subregions and holography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05158)
*XiangKun Gong,Wu-zhong Guo,Jin Xu*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper investigates the concept of entanglement entropy for causally connected spacetime regions, particularly focusing on timelike entanglement. Using advanced formalisms like the Schwinger-Keldysh and real-time replica method, the authors define a transition operator and compute related measures. They propose a holographic dual by analytic continuation and check consistency with analytic results and numerical simulations. The study also extends other entanglement measures to timelike regions and addresses theoretical challenges related to non-Hermitian operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entanglement entropy is a fundamental concept in quantum field theory, and extending its study to timelike separated regions is crucial for understanding causality and the structure of spacetime. This paper pushes boundaries by providing new computational methods and proposing holographic interpretations for these entanglement measures.

Method: The authors employ the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and real-time replica method to construct the transition operator in causal diamonds. They compute entanglement entropy and extend their methods to propose a holographic dual by analytic continuation. They also validate their findings with analytic and numerical examples for systems like AdS_3/CFT_2.

Result: The paper demonstrates that timelike entanglement entropy is positive and provides a holographic dual via analytic continuation. They compute logarithmic negativity for timelike intervals and confirm that reflected entropy aligns with the timelike entanglement wedge cross section in leading order. These results suggest a consistent framework for understanding entanglement in causally connected regions.

Conclusion: The study successfully extends the understanding of entanglement entropy to timelike separated regions, offering new insights into quantum field theory and holography. The proposed methods and holographic duals provide a solid foundation for further exploration of causally connected entanglement in spacetime.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate entanglement for causally connected subregions
$A$ and $B$ in quantum field theory and holography. Recent developments have
established that a transition operator $T_{AB}$ can be well-defined for such
subregions, which is generally non-Hermitian. By employing the
Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and the real-time replica method, we show how to
construct $T_{AB}$ and compute associated entanglement measures. In certain
configurations, this leads to a notion of timelike entanglement entropy, for
which we provide explicit quantum field theory computations and propose a
holographic dual via analytic continuation from the Euclidean setup. Both
analytical and numerical results are compared and found consistent.
  If entanglement between causally connected subregions is to be meaningful, it
should also be able to define other entanglement measures. Motivated by the
spacelike case, we propose a timelike extension of the entanglement wedge cross
section, though we do not expect it to carry the same physical interpretation.
In AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we compute explicit examples and find that the timelike
entanglement wedge cross section is generally positive. Furthermore, we show
that the reflected entropy for timelike intervals -- obtained via analytic
continuation of twist correlators -- coincides with twice the timelike
entanglement wedge cross section at leading order in $G$, supporting a
holographic duality in the timelike case. We also discuss the extension of
other entanglement measures, such as logarithmic negativity, to timelike
separated regions using replica methods. We highlight conceptual challenges in
defining reflected entropy via canonical purification for non-Hermitian
operators.

*Dmitry Galakhov,Elena Lanina,Alexei Morozov*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel differential operator approach for computing KR cohomologies using insights from TQFT and BRST operators, addressing previous limitations and trailing physical interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to describe homologies with a functional integration approach, overcoming the complexity by utilizing BRST operators' zero modes, particularly for KR cohomologies in 3d Chern-Simons theory.

Method: Develops an even-odd differential operator for link diagrams, including tangles, with nilpotency based on diagram topology. Factorization formalism handles open tangles while preserving invariance.

Result: A physical, alternative approach to KR cohomologies using odd operators, with applications beyond Chern-Simons theory and potential for computerization.

Conclusion: This method offers a practical solution and advances physical understanding, with broad applications in knot theory and quantum topology.

Abstract: Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) is a powerful tool to describe
homologies, which normally involve complexes and a variety of maps/morphisms,
what makes a functional integration approach with a sum over a single kind of
maps seemingly problematic. In TQFT this problem is overcame by exploiting the
rich set of zero modes of BRST operators, which appear sufficient to describe
complexes. We explain what this approach looks like for the important class of
Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) cohomologies, which categorify the observables (Wilson
lines or knot polynomials) in 3d Chern-Simons theory. We develop a construction
of odd differential operators, associated with all link diagrams, including
tangles with open ends. These operators become nilpotent only for diagram with
no external legs, but even for open tangles one can develop a factorization
formalism, which preserve Reidemeister/topological invariance -- the symmetry
of the problem. This technique seems much more ``physical'' than conventional
language of homological algebra and should have many applications to various
problems beyond Chern-Simons theory. We also hope that this language will
provide efficient algorithms, and finally allow to computerize the calculation
of KR cohomologies -- for closed diagrams and for open tangles.

Abstract: We comprehensively discuss various microscopic approaches to the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for rotating, electrically charged, asymptotically
AdS$_4$ non-extremal black holes in gauged supergravity. We apply the covariant
phase space formalism to the near-horizon region to obtain a
Cardy-formula-based microscopic explanation for the entropy, consistent with
the Kerr/CFT correspondence. From the dual boundary CFT point of view, we
estimate the free partition function in the matrix model approximation in the
high-temperature regime and find qualitative agreement with the supergravity
answer. All these different approaches match in the appropriate limits and
support the universality of AdS black hole entropy even at high temperatures,
far away from extremality. Prompted by the consistency of the results of
statistical explanations for the AdS$_4$ black hole entropy, we discuss aspects
of the rate of Hawking radiation at high temperatures from the CFT$_2$
perspective and found it to be universally proportional to the horizon area.

### [19] [Symmetry Packaging I: Irreducible Representation Blocks, Superselection, and Packaged Entanglement in Quantum Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05356)
*Rongchao Ma*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new concept called 'symmetry packaging' in quantum field theory, proposing that internal quantum numbers (IQNs) for local creation operators must remain intact in all physical processes. This leads to a symmetry packaging principle, which maintains these IQNs throughout various stages of quantum excitation, including particle creation, hybridization, isotypic decomposition, packaged superposition/entanglement, and local gauge invariance. The result is that this packaging leads to a gauge-invariant physical Hilbert space, new classes of entangled states, and noise-protected logical qudits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses fundamental aspects of quantum field theory, particularly focusing on the role of internal quantum numbers and symmetry in the structure of quantum excitations. By introducing symmetry packaging, it seeks to unify principles like superselection rules, entanglement, and gauge invariance under a single theoretical framework.

Method: The authors analyze a quantum-field excitation through six distinct stages, examining the impact of symmetry packaging on each process. They also establish a three-layer packaging hierarchy and derive conditions for the proposed states.

Result: The key results include the establishment of symmetry packaging principles, the derivation of conditions for packaged superpositions and entangled states, and the demonstration that these states form noise-protected logical qudits. Additionally, the framework is shown to unify various quantum concepts under a mathematical roof.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a novel framework based on symmetry packaging that provides a unified mathematical approach to understanding superselection rules, entanglement, and gauge invariance, with potential applications in constructing and manipulating quantum states in gauge theories.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of symmetry packaging for quantum field excitations:
in a quantum field theory with a gauge group $G$, every local creation operator
carries its full set of internal quantum numbers (IQNs) as a single irreducible
$G$-block and forbids any partial factorization. We elevate this observation to
a symmetry packaging principle, which asserts that packets of IQNs remain
intact throughout all physical processes. We analyze a quantum-field excitation
in six successive stages: (1) particle creation/annihilation, (2) hybridization
with gauge-blind external degrees of freedom (DOFs), (3) tensor-product
assembly, (4) isotypic decomposition, (5) packaged superposition/entanglement,
and (6) local Gauge-Invariance constraint. We show that packaging survives
every stage and culminates in a gauge-invariant physical Hilbert space. These
stages unfold within a three packaging layer hierarchy (raw-Fock $\to$ isotypic
$\to$ physical) with distinct packaging characters. Packaging alone reproduces
familiar charge-superselection rules and, within any fixed-charge sector,
admits a new class of packaged entangled states where internal and external
DOFs are inseparably locked. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for
such superpositions and show that packaged irreps behave as noise-protected
logical qudits. This framework unifies representation theory, superselection,
and entanglement under a single mathematical roof and provides a roadmap for
constructing and manipulating packaged states in any gauge theory.

### [20] [Violating Weak Cosmic Censorship in AdS$_3$ via Gedanken Experiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05384)
*Masaya Amo*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Potential counterexample to the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (wCCC) in a rotating AdS3 spacetime. Extending qBTZ black hole parameter range and studying infalling test particles with large angular momentum. Findings suggest that under certain conditions (like neglecting self-force), the event horizon can be destroyed, violating wCCC. Need to either exclude this solution or consider self-force effects for further analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The question arises whether the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, a fundamental principle in general relativity, can be violated in specific spacetime configurations. This paper explores this possibility in a AdS3 rotating spacetime, which is a model of interest in theoretical physics. The motivation is to test the limits of the conjecture and understand if such violations are possible, which could have implications for our understanding of black holes and spacetime structure.

Method: The method used in the paper involves quantum corrections to the BTZ black hole, extending its parameter range, studying the behavior of test particles with angular momentum, and analyzing the conditions under which the event horizon can be destroyed. Computational tools like numerical simulations or analytical methods are likely employed to model these scenarios.

Result: The key results show that the weak cosmic censorship conjecture might not hold under certain conditions, specifically when the self-force effects are neglected. This leads to a scenario where the event horizon is destroyed, suggesting a potential violation of the conjecture, which could imply that the original formulation of the conjecture needs to be revisited or that additional constraints are necessary to ensure the validity of the wCCC.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the weak cosmic censorship conjecture in a rotating AdS3 spacetime might not be as robust as previously thought. The paper suggests that either the solution studied in the paper should be excluded from the applicability of the conjecture or further analysis is needed that incorporates self-force effects to accurately determine the conditions under which the event horizon is destroyed.

Abstract: The weak cosmic censorship conjecture (wCCC) might not be as robust as one
would expect. We present a potential counterexample to the wCCC in a rotating
three-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS$_3$) spacetime. We extend the parameter
range of the quantum corrected BTZ (qBTZ) black hole. We examine the infall of
test particles with large orbital angular momentum into an extremal black hole.
Our findings indicate that, under certain conditions -- such as neglecting the
self-force effects -- the event horizon can be destroyed, leading to a
violation of the wCCC. The results suggest that this solution should either be
excluded from the applicability of the wCCC or should be examined with
self-force effects incorporated.

Conclusion: 论文填补了AdS3/CFT2中理解这种特殊超对称解结构的重要空白，为研究重幺正态态提供了新的视角，对超引力、多重理论和量子场论都具有重要意义。

Abstract: Supergravity solutions describing supersymmetric rotating bound states of NS
fivebranes, fundamental strings and momentum can sometimes have an ergoregion
but no horizon. In such supersymmetric ergoregions, there is an unusual feature
that there exist BPS "excitations" that cost negative (or zero) energy as
measured from asymptotic infinity. We study the spectrum of supergravity and
string excitations of these backgrounds using their worldsheet description as
gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models, and construct their holographic map to
transitions in the dual spacetime CFT. The backgrounds generically contain
orbifold singularities, and we exhibit vertex operators corresponding to
twisted sector ground states localized at the orbifold fixed points. The gauged
WZW model thus provides a valuable tool to explore the stringy structure of
such heavy BPS states in $AdS_3/CFT_2$.

TL;DR: The paper computes four-dimensional thermal n-point conformal blocks using specific geometric spaces and group representations, finding results consistent with known low-temperature limits and expressing them through different mathematical functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of conformal blocks in thermal and higher-dimensional settings is important for understanding quantum field theories, especially in contexts like thermal physics or black hole thermodynamics.

Method: The authors use oscillator representations on S^1 × S^3 and evaluate integrals over the homogeneous space D4 of the conformal group. They focus on scalar operators and consider both the projection and comb channel cases.

Result: They derive expressions for the blocks that can be written as hypergeometric functions or SU(2) spin networks, providing a deeper understanding of the structure and potentially facilitating further calculations or applications in physics.

Conclusion: The results extend our knowledge of conformal blocks into higher dimensions and thermal settings, offering new mathematical tools for studying quantum field theories under these conditions.

Abstract: We define and compute the four-dimensional thermal $n$-point conformal block
in the projection channel using oscillator representations on
$\mathbb{S}^1_\beta \times \mathbb{S}^3$. This is done by evaluating a class of
integrals over the homogeneous space $\mathbb{D}_4$ of the four-dimensional
conformal group. We restrict ourselves to scalar external operators and scalar
exchange. In the low-temperature limit, our result reduces correctly to the
vacuum $(n+2)$-point block in the comb channel. The corresponding expressions
can be written as a series of terminating hypergeometric functions or
equivalently, a series of weighted SU(2) spin-networks. Alternatively,
functions adapted to the SU(2,2) representation are introduced and some
properties are discussed.

Abstract: We investigate how the positive geometry framework for loop integrands in
$\mathcal{N}{=}4$ super Yang-Mills theory constrains the structure of the
integrated answers. This is done in the context of a geometric expansion of
Wilson loops with a Lagrangian insertion, called negative geometries, extending
ideas previously used for scattering amplitudes related to the Amplituhedron.
The procedure we adopt combines the knowledge of all maximal codimension
boundaries of the geometry, which characterize all possible leading
singularities of the integral, with a geometrically informed Landau analysis.
The interplay between geometry and Landau analysis arises from associating
Landau diagrams to geometric boundaries. The boundary structure of the geometry
then determines which solutions to the Landau equations are spurious and which
ones are physical, that is, which singularities are actually present in the
integral. This method allows us to efficiently determine the symbol alphabet of
the associated integral, and serves as a starting point for the symbol
bootstrap. We successfully implement this procedure and compute the six-point
two-loop and five-point three-loop ladder negative geometries at the symbol
level. We also present the conjectural alphabet for ladder negative geometries
at two loops for all multiplicities. These are finite integrals that serve as
building blocks for the Wilson loop with Lagrangian insertion, and therefore
provide insights into the function space of the latter.

*Saskia Demulder,Maria Knysh,Andrew Rolph*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores the connection between Krylov complexity and quantum chaos in effective field theories, using maximal chaos as a framework. It finds that while maximal Lyapunov exponents are achieved, the relationship between Lyapunov and Krylov exponents is still complex, suggesting further investigation is needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the intricate connections between different measures of quantum chaos is crucial for advancing our knowledge of complex quantum systems. This paper aims to shed light on this relationship within effective field theory frameworks, potentially offering new insights into the behavior of chaotic systems.

Method: The authors employ effective field theory (EFT) alongside Krylov complexity and the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis to analyze maximal chaos. They derive the impact of shift symmetry on two-point autocorrelators, compute Lanczos coefficients, and compare Lyapunov and Krylov exponents across various examples.

Result: The study reveals that the shift symmetry enforces maximal Lyapunov exponents but does not necessarily ensure maximal Krylov exponents, showing that λ_K can be either double or half of λ_L. This suggests potential tensions with conjectured bounds, prompting further exploration into the interplay between these concepts.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to the understanding of quantum chaos by highlighting the nuanced relationship between Krylov complexity and Lyapunov exponents in EFTs, underlining the need for additional studies to comprehend the dynamics of chaotic quantum systems fully.

Abstract: We examine the effective field theory (EFT) of maximal chaos through the lens
of Krylov complexity and the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. We test the
relationship between two measures of quantum chaos: out-of-time-ordered
correlators (OTOCs) and Krylov complexity. In the EFT, a shift symmetry of the
hydrodynamic modes enforces the maximal Lyapunov exponent in OTOCs, $\lambda_L
= 2\pi T$, while simultaneously constraining thermal two-point autocorrelators.
We solve these constraints on the autocorrelator, and calculate the Lanczos
coefficients and Krylov exponents for several examples, finding both $\lambda_K
= \lambda_L$ and $\lambda_K = \lambda_L/2$. This demonstrates that, within the
EFT, the shift symmetry alone is insufficient to enforce maximal Krylov
exponents even when the Lyapunov exponent is maximal. In particular, this
result suggests a tension with the conjectured bound $\lambda_L \leq \lambda_K
\leq 2\pi T$. Finally, we identify autocorrelator solutions whose power spectra
closely resemble the so-called thermal product formula seen in holographic
systems.

Result: 论文展示了一种新的方法来计算带有自旋的胶状粒子的振幅，可能在树级近似下完成，获得的振幅为纯自旋一粒子的顶点操作。通过这种方式，提取了非交换相互作用顶点操作器，并通过BRST不变性确保振幅的一致性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的超弦粒子法，计算了带有自旋的胶状粒子的振幅，并展示了如何通过这种方式将顶点操作器纳入量子力学的框架中。这为双复制计划提供了新的数学视角。该方法在构建更复杂相互作用时也有潜在的重要性。

Abstract: We compute tree-level gluon amplitudes as worldline correlators of vertex
operators in a bosonic spinning particle model. In this framework, the
particle's position degrees of freedom are extended by complex bosonic
variables that encode its spin. In the free theory, the model exhibits a
first-class constraint algebra whose gauging ensures the unitarity of the
quantum theory. This algebra is a contraction of the $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$
algebra, which is by itself a subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra. In string
theory, gauging the Virasoro algebra plays a similar role. Our model admits a
consistent truncation to describe a pure spin-1 particle. Non-abelian
interactions are introduced by using BRST techniques, which allow us to extract
the vertex operators of the theory as suitable deformations of the BRST charge.
BRST invariance is central to ensuring the consistency of the tree-level
amplitudes analyzed in this work. We discuss connections with similar worldline
constructions and comment on the potential relevance of this framework for
uncovering the structures underlying the double-copy program in gauge and
gravitational theories.

particles. Technical aspects about the formulation of massive helicity spinors
are presented in detail to analyze the projective-geometry kinematics of
helicity spinors as well as the diagrammatical and analytical structure of
their interactions. Two new methods for calculating massive cross sections are
derived and tested on Bhabha and Compton processes: a quasi-high-energy limit
and an assembly of partial cross sections. The acquisition of mass, where
ultrarelativistic amplitudes coalesce at low energy, is given a physical
interpretation as the localization of particle worldlines in twistor theory. By
subsuming the spinor helicity formalism in this way, both spacetime and
particle content can emerge from null, lightlike, and timelike twistors.

### [27] [On a 5D UV completion of Argyres-Douglas theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05610)
*Giulio Bonelli,Pavlo Gavrylenko,Ideal Majtara,Alessandro Tanzini*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper discusses a novel UV completion of Argyres-Douglas theories by embedding them into the renormalization group flow of 5D N=1 SCFTs on a circle. They use (q)-Painlevé/gauge theory correspondence to compute partition functions and BPS states, grounding their analysis in a 5D lift of operator/state correspondence on a blown-up geometry. They detail the phase diagram of 4D limits, identifying special AD loci, and compute these for the E1 tildes and its limit to the H0 (A1,A2) AD theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is likely to explore the connections between gauge theories and integrable systems, such as the correspondence between supersymmetric gauge theories and Painlevé equations. Understanding this could provide new insights into the structure of SCFTs and their RG flows, offering a UV completion mechanism for certain strongly coupled theories.

Method: They use the (q)-Painlevé/gauge theory correspondence, compute partition functions as Wilson loop vev expansions with q-polynomial coefficients by lifting gauge theories to 5D on a blown-up geometry, and utilize operator/state correspondence for analysis.

Result: They successfully compute the partition functions and BPS states, establishing a concrete framework for understanding the RG flows and AD loci. The specific computations for E1 tildes and their AD limits demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.

Conclusion: The paper provides a detailed and rigorous analysis of UV completion of AD theories, establishing a robust method using gauge theory and integrable systems, contributing to a deeper understanding of 4D and 5D SCFTs and their RG flows.

Abstract: We discuss a novel UV completion of a class of Argyres-Douglas (AD) theories
by its embedding into the renormalisation group flow from five dimensional
$\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories (SCFT) on $S^1$. This is obtained
via analysing these theories in the light of ($q$-)Painlev\'e/gauge theory
correspondence, which allows to compute the five dimensional BPS partition
functions as an expansion in the Wilson loop vev with integer $q$-polynomials
coefficients. These are derived formulating the gauge theory on a blown-up
geometry and using a five-dimensional lift of (topological) operator/state
correspondence. We discuss in detail the phase diagram of the four dimensional
limits, pinpointing the special AD loci. Explicit computations are reported for
$\tilde E_1$ SCFT and its limit to H$_0=(A_1,A_2)$ AD theory.

### [28] [Five points for the Polyakov Bootstrap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05623)
*António Antunes,Sebastian Harris,Apratim Kaviraj*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Paper introduces new tools to extract data from multi-point crossing equations using a generalization of Polyakov blocks for 5-point functions in 1D CFTs, leading to two classes of functionals that improve upon standard derivative-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses extracting information from conformal field theory correlators, which is essential for understanding the structure of CFTs. The use of crossing equations and the generalization of existing methods (Polyakov bootstrap) to higher-point functions is a novel approach.

Method: The authors generalized the Polyakov blocks to handle 5-point functions in 1D CFTs. They constructed crossing-symmetric blocks, derived sum-rules by ensuring consistency with the OPE, and developed sum-rule-based functionals controlling OPE coefficients for double- and triple-twist operators. Validation was done through extensive checks, and they applied these functionals to a truncated 5-point bootstrap, showing advantages over derivative-based methods.

Result: The method provides a systematic and efficient way to extract operator product expansion coefficients from multi-point crossing symmetry equations, improving upon standard methods and demonstrating particular effectiveness when applied to truncated bootstrap analyses.

Conclusion: The new functionals represent a significant advancement in analyzing higher-point correlators in 1D CFTs. The approach has the potential to enhance both theoretical understanding and practical applications in conformal bootstrap studies by leveraging higher-order correlators effectively.

Abstract: Higher-point correlation functions encode the data of infinitely many 4-point
correlators in conformal field theory (CFT). In this paper, we develop new
tools to efficiently extract this data from multi-point crossing equations.
Concretely, we generalize the functionals constituting the so-called Polyakov
bootstrap of 4-point correlators to the case of 5-point functions in
one-dimensional CFTs. We first construct the crossing symmetric Polyakov
blocks, and then derive sum-rules by requiring consistency with the operator
product expansion (OPE). This procedure leads to two classes of functionals
controlling OPE coefficients of double- and triple-twist families. After
extensively checking the validity of the associated sum-rules, we apply our
functionals to the truncated 5-point bootstrap where we find several advantages
with respect to more standard derivative functionals.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is likely motivated by the need for advanced free-electron lasers for scientific research, particularly in the water window which offers advantages in application areas like medical imaging or environmental monitoring.

Method: The paper employs computational simulations and tolerance analyses to assess the system's performance under acceleration and beam integrity issues.

Result: The analysis highlights that plasma wakefield acceleration enhances the laser's performance, achieving higher efficiency and reduced beam distortions compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed AQUA beamline design is validated as a robust solution for water-window laser applications, showing promise for scientific and industrial innovations through its improved yield and stability.

Abstract: The AQUA beamline of the EuPRAXIA@SPARC_LAB facility is a SASE free-electron
laser designed to operate in the water window, in the 3-4 nm wavelength range.
The electron beam driving this source is accelerated up to about 1-1.2 GeV by
an X-band normal conducting linear accelerator, followed by a plasma wakefield
acceleration stage. The main radiator consists of an array of ten APPLE-X
permanent magnet undulator modules, each 2 m long and with a period length of

misalignments at undulator entrance are performed, and the related effects on
the laser yield performance are evaluated and discussed.

### [30] [Causal Interventions Beyond Time: A CP-do(C)-Calculus for Indefinite Quantum Order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04737)
*Jordi Vallverdu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper reformulates Pearl's do-calculus for quantum systems using CP maps, showing Rule 2 fails in systems with indefinite causal order, contributing to a better understanding of quantum causality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding causality in quantum systems is crucial, especially with the emergence of quantum computing and information theory, which challenge classical notions of causation due to phenomena like entanglement and quantum superposition.

Method: The authors used a mathematical approach by reformulating Pearl's three rules in the language of completely positive (CP) trace-preserving maps, which are fundamental in describing quantum operations. They analyzed whether Rule 2 holds in scenarios where causal order is indefinite, possibly through models like quantum switches.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the traditional second rule of do-calculus fails in quantum systems with indefinite causal order, requiring a more general framework for causal reasoning in quantum contexts.

Conclusion: The study suggests that classical causal concepts must be redefined in quantum regimes, and the CP-do calculus provides a unified framework applicable across classical, definite-order quantum, and indefinite-order quantum systems, aiding in the development of quantum information science and computation.

Abstract: We reformulate Pearl's three rules of do-calculus in the language of
completely positive (CP) trace-preserving maps, thereby extending them to
quantum systems with entanglement. We prove that Rule~2 fails whenever the
underlying process admits indefinite causal order, and we demonstrate this
failure in a three-qubit ``quantum switch'' circuit. Our analysis clarifies why
the classical notions of surgical intervention, faithfulness, and
counterfactual dependence must be revised in quantum information science. The
CP-do($C$)-calculus introduced here provides a common syntax for causal
modelling across classical, definite-order quantum, and indefinite-order
quantum regimes.

Motivation: 论文旨在解决多尺度系统的量子编码难题，特别关注于能量和结构的有效编码。

Method: 提出了三阶段超球面编码方法，利用Hopf纤维化将量子可观测量映射到漩涡结构，减少所需量子位数。

Result: 通过27个量子位生成Reynolds数为13900的湍流场，准确捕捉到能量谱、漩涡结构和间歇性。

Conclusion: 该方法在指数意义上优于经典方法，为大规模量子模拟提供了基础。

Abstract: The chaotic structure of multiscale systems presents a formidable challenge
to their quantum encoding. We propose a three-stage hyperspherical encoding
method for turbulent fields. This method comprises a symmetry-preserving
perturbation of the ground state, a measurement-specific convolution, and a
final deconvolution of observables. The latter two stages employ the Hopf
fibration to map quantum observables onto vortex tubes, the building blocks of
fluid turbulence. Using 27 qubits, we generate an instantaneous turbulent field
at a Reynolds number of $\mathit{Re} = 13900$ that reproduces the energy
spectrum with Kolmogorov's five-thirds scaling, tangled vortex structures, and
strong intermittency. The method only requires $\mathcal{O}(\log_2\mathit{Re})$
qubits, which is asymptotically optimal for turbulent-field encoding. This
yields an exponential memory reduction over classical methods, and enables
state preparation for large-scale quantum simulation of multiscale systems.

Conclusion: QCopilot为大规模量子传感器应用提供了技术支持，方法适用于其他量子信息系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) exhibit broad utility but face limitations in
quantum sensor development, stemming from interdisciplinary knowledge barriers
and involving complex optimization processes. Here we present QCopilot, an
LLM-based multi-agent framework integrating external knowledge access, active
learning, and uncertainty quantification for quantum sensor design and
diagnosis. Comprising commercial LLMs with few-shot prompt engineering and
vector knowledge base, QCopilot employs specialized agents to adaptively select
optimization methods, automate modeling analysis, and independently perform
problem diagnosis. Applying QCopilot to atom cooling experiments, we generated
10${}^{\rm{8}}$ sub-$\rm{\mu}$K atoms without any human intervention within a
few hours, representing $\sim$100$\times$ speedup over manual experimentation.
Notably, by continuously accumulating prior knowledge and enabling dynamic
modeling, QCopilot can autonomously identify anomalous parameters in
multi-parameter experimental settings. Our work reduces barriers to large-scale
quantum sensor deployment and readily extends to other quantum information
systems.

*Aurélien Drezet,Dustin Lazarovici,Bernard Michael Nabet*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The authors argue that their experiment challenges Bohmian mechanics, but in reality, their findings align with it by explaining the differences in speed definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper in question presents conflicting claims regarding quantum particle behavior under Bohmian mechanics, prompting a need for a detailed analysis to establish validity.

Method: The analysis relies solely on the standard Bohmian guidance equation for single particles, which is a key component of Bohmian mechanics.

Result: The experiment's findings are shown to be consistent with Bohmian mechanics once the nuances in the definitions of velocities are addressed.

Conclusion: Bohmian particle dynamics remain valid, and the original findings, once properly understood, do not contradict the theory.

Abstract: In their recent paper [Nature 643, 67 (2025)], Sharaglazova et al. report an
optical microcavity experiment yielding an "energy-speed relationship" for
quantum particles in evanescent states, which they infer from the observed
population transfer between two coupled waveguides. The authors argue that
their findings challenge the validity of Bohmian particle dynamics because,
according to the Bohmian guiding equation, the velocities in the classically
forbidden region would be zero. In this note, we explain why this claim is
false and the experimental findings are in perfect agreement with Bohmian
mechanics. We also clarify why the operationally defined speeds reported in the
paper are unrelated to particle velocities in the sense described by Bohmian
mechanics. In contrast to other recent replies, our analysis relies solely on
the standard Bohmian guidance equation for single particles.

Conclusion: 线性规划解码结合有序统计解码是解决量子纠错码解码问题的一种有效方法，尤其适合中小规模量子LDPC码的应用。

Abstract: Decoding quantum error-correcting codes is a key challenge in enabling
fault-tolerant quantum computation. In the classical setting, linear
programming (LP) decoders offer provable performance guarantees and can
leverage fast practical optimization algorithms. Although LP decoders have been
proposed for quantum codes, their performance and limitations remain relatively
underexplored. In this work, we uncover a key limitation of LP decoding for
quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes: certain constant-weight error
patterns lead to ambiguous fractional solutions that cannot be resolved through
independent rounding. To address this issue, we incorporate a post-processing
technique known as ordered statistics decoding (OSD), which significantly
enhances LP decoding performance in practice. Our results show that LP
decoding, when augmented with OSD, can outperform belief propagation with the
same post-processing for intermediate code sizes of up to hundreds of qubits.
These findings suggest that LP-based decoders, equipped with effective
post-processing, offer a promising approach for decoding near-term quantum LDPC
codes.

Conclusion: 建议在量子热力学应用中采用高频控制策略以提高能效传输。

Abstract: We examine the transport of useful energy, i.e. extractable work as
quantified by the ergotropy, along a spin chain with tuneable exchange
couplings between the sites. We focus on, and interpolate between, the two
physically relevant limits of uniform interaction strengths and engineered
couplings which achieve perfect state transfer (PST). By modelling the
individual constituents as quantum batteries, we consider how the manner in
which the extractable work appears in the initial state of the first site
impacts the chain's ability to transport ergotropy to the final site. For
non-PST couplings, we establish that there is a clear quantum advantage when
the ergotropy is initially endowed in quantum coherences and demonstrate that
this ergotropy is more efficiently transferred. For extractable work encoded in
a population inverted state, we show that this considerably limits the length
of chain over which any ergotropy can be faithfully transported. For PST
couplings, we consider the robustness to disorder and again demonstrate a
quantum advantage for coherently endowed ergotropy. Finally, we examine the
work probability distribution associated with quenching on the interactions
which provides insight into the work cost in switching on the couplings. We
show that PST couplings lead to smaller fluctuations in this work cost,
indicating that they are more stable.

Abstract: The classification of quantum phases of matter remains a fundamental
challenge in condensed matter physics. We present a novel framework that
combines shadow tomography with modern time-series machine learning models to
enable efficient and practical quantum phase classification. Our approach
leverages the definition of quantum phases based on connectivity through
finite-depth local unitary circuits, generating abundant training data by
applying Haar random evolution to representative quantum states for a given
phase. In this way, the training data can be efficiently obtained from a
quantum simulator. Additionally, we demonstrate that advanced time-series
models can be used to process the training data and achieve universal quantum
phase classification that does not rely on local order parameters. To validate
the universality and versatility of our method, we test the model against
one-dimensional quantum spin chains such as the Ising model and the axial
next-nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model, showing excellent agreement with
known phase boundaries.

Result: The paper provides new methods for generating AME states, including orthogonal frequency squares and understanding their entanglement properties. It also updates classification of states under local unitary transformations.

Conclusion: AME states are crucial for quantum applications; new methods enhance their study and practical use in quantum processing tasks.

Abstract: Absolutely maximally entangled (AME) pure states of a system composed of $N$
parties are distinguished by the property that for any splitting at least one
partial trace is maximally mixed. Due to maximal possible correlations between
any two selected subsystems these states have numerous applications in various
fields of quantum information processing including multi-user teleportation,
quantum error correction and secret sharing. We present an updated survey of
various techniques to generate such strongly entangled states, including those
going beyond the standard construction of graph and stabilizer states. Our
contribution includes, in particular, analysis of the degree of entanglement of
reduced states obtained by partial trace of AME projectors, states obtained by
a symmetric superposition of GHZ states, an orthogonal frequency square
representation of the "golden" AME state and an updated summary of the number
of local unitary equivalence classes.

TL;DR: The study presents a fault-tolerant error correction mechanism using the minimally invasive alterations (MIA) scheme in solid-state qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of large-scale quantum processors with defective components, requiring robust error correction.

Method: Evaluates the MIA scheme and automated detector construction for dead-component correction in both measurement-based and CNOT-based circuits.

Result: The MIA scheme shows superior fault-tolerance compared to conventional methods, with state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The MIA method and automated detector system are effective solutions for handling defective components in quantum computers.

Abstract: The physical implementation of a large-scale error-corrected quantum
processor will necessarily need to mitigate the presence of defective (thereby
"dead") physical components in its operation, for example, identified during
bring-up of the device or detected in the middle of a computation. In the
context of solid-state qubits, the quantum error correcting protocol operating
in the presence of dead components should ideally (i) use the same native
operation set as that without dead components, (ii) maximize salvaging of
functional components, and (iii) use a consistent global operating schedule
which optimizes logical qubit performance and is compatible with the control
requirements of the system. The scheme proposed by Grans-Samuelsson et al.
[Quantum 8, 1429 (2024)] satisfies all three of these criteria: it effectively
excises (cuts out) dead components from the surface code using minimally
invasive alterations (MIA). We conduct extensive numerical simulations of this
proposal for the pairwise-measurement-based surface code protocol in the
presence of dead components under circuit-level noise. To that end, we also
describe techniques to automatically construct performant check (detector)
bases directly from circuits without manual circuit annotation, which may be of
independent interest. Both the MIA scheme and this automated check basis
computation can be readily used with measurement-based as well as CNOT-based
circuits, and the results presented here demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance.

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了量子码设计的范围，为量子计算的纠错提供了新思路。

Abstract: The homological product is a general-purpose recipe that forges new quantum
codes from arbitrary classical or quantum input codes, often providing enhanced
error-correcting properties. When the input codes are classical linear codes,
it is also known as the hypergraph product. We investigate structured
homological product codes that admit logical operations arising from
permutation symmetries in their input codes. We present a broad theoretical
framework that characterizes the logical operations resulting from these
underlying automorphisms. In general, these logical operations can be performed
by a combination of physical qubit permutations and a subsystem circuit. In
special cases related to symmetries of the input Tanner graphs, logical
operations can be performed solely through qubit permutations. We further
demonstrate that these "automorphism gadgets" can possess inherent
fault-tolerant properties such as effective distance preservation, assuming
physical permutations are free. Finally, we survey the literature of classical
linear codes with rich automorphism structures and show how various classical
code families fit into our framework. Complementary to other fault-tolerant
gadgets for homological product codes, our results further advance the search
for practical fault tolerance beyond topological codes in platforms capable of
long-range connectivity.

dissipation can partially tame the instability of the inverted potential,
leading to novel steady-state phases. We also identify regimes with multiple
competing saddle points and discuss potential implications for the landscape of
metastable states.

Abstract: We outline a theoretical framework for quantum metrology in non-Hermitian
systems, demonstrating both significant failure and exceptional regimes in
PT-symmetric Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer chains. Through biorthogonal quantum
Fisher information analysis, we identify two distinct regimes: exponential
sensitivity suppression in the non-Hermitian skin effect phase ($F_Q \propto
N^3 e^{-2\kappa N}$) where eigenstates localize exponentially, and quadratic
enhancement near PT-breaking exceptional points [1-4] ($F_Q \propto
N^2/\delta$) achieving Heisenberg scaling. Our multiparameter analysis
establishes optimal simultaneous estimation of chemical potential, Peierls
phase, and gain/loss strength with quantum Fisher information matrix scaling as
$N^2$, surpassing the standard quantum limit by factors exceeding $10^2$. For
realistic parameters ($t/2\pi=10$ MHz, $\Delta/2\pi=1$ MHz, $N=50$), we predict
enhancement factors $\eta_\mu \approx 20\sqrt{N}=141$ for chemical potential
estimation and $\eta_\phi \approx t^2 \sqrt{3N/2}=100\sqrt{N}$ over classical

provide concrete protocols for superconducting circuit implementations.We
reveal a core dichotomy in non-Hermitian quantum metrology: NHSE suppresses
sensitivity exponentially, while $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry enables
Heisenberg-limited enhancement -- each arising from distinct spectral and

*Sayan Chakraborty,Victor V. Albert*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper generalizes quantum lattice codes to hybrid systems with discrete and continuous variables, introduces new stabilizer codes, and provides methods for error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for quantum computing and communication technologies necessitates robust error correction methods, especially for hybrid systems that combine discrete and continuous variables.

Method: The authors developed a framework that maps qudit phase spaces into continuous variable systems, constructed hybrid stabilizer states and codes, and utilized Morita equivalence for logical operator construction.

Result: The proposed codes offer advantages over traditional systems by enabling error correction beyond Gaussian operations and efficiently handling larger displacement ranges.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational approach for error correction in hybrid quantum systems, paves the way for scalable and practical quantum technologies.

Abstract: We construct stabilizer states and error-correcting codes on combinations of
discrete- and continuous-variable systems, generalizing the
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) quantum lattice formalism. Our framework
absorbs the discrete phase space of a qudit into a hybrid phase space
parameterizable entirely by the continuous variables of a harmonic oscillator.
The unit cell of a hybrid quantum lattice grows with the qudit dimension,
yielding a way to simultaneously measure an arbitrarily large range of
non-commuting position and momentum displacements. Simple hybrid states can be
obtained by applying a conditional displacement to a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill
(GKP) state and a Pauli eigenstate, or by encoding some of the physical qudits
of a stabilizer state into a GKP code. The states' oscillator-qudit
entanglement cannot be generated using symplectic (i.e., Gaussian-Clifford)
operations, distinguishing them as a resource from tensor products of
oscillator and qudit stabilizer states. We construct general hybrid
error-correcting codes by relating stabilizer codes to non-commutative tori and
obtaining logical operators via Morita equivalence. We provide examples using
commutation matrices, integer symplectic matrices, and binary codes.

*Siddharth Dangwal,Tina Oberoi,Ajay Sailopal,Dhirpal Shah,Frederic T. Chong*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a simulator called TUSQ for noisy quantum hardware that achieves significant speedups over existing simulators by reducing overhead through error characterization and tree-based execution with rollback-recovery techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating quantum circuits on real hardware is computationally expensive and resource-intensive, especially with noisy gates. This paper aims to address this challenge by introducing an efficient simulation method that reduces unnecessary computations and leverages error correction techniques.

Method: The paper proposes TUSQ, which consists of two modules: ECM for error characterization and temporal optimization, and TEM for tree-based execution with rollback-recovery. ECM reduces the number of redundant circuit executions by tracking unique execution paths, while TEM reuses computations across these paths using a tree structure. Rollback-recovery is employed to further optimize the simulation process.

Result: TUSQ achieved an average speedup of 52.5x over Qiskit and 12.53x over CUDA-Q, with higher speedups for larger benchmarks (over 15 qubits) compared to 55.42x and 23.03x respectively. For benchmark sizes beyond 15 qubits, TUSQ outperformed both simulation tools effectively.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel approach for simulating quantum circuits on noisy quantum hardware, significantly improving upon existing methods by implementing error characterization, tree-based execution, and advanced rollback-recovery techniques. This advancement paves the way for more efficient use of quantum computational resources and brings us closer to practical quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Quantum computers have grown in size and qubit quality in recent years,
enabling the execution of complex quantum circuits. However, for most
researchers, access to compute time on quantum hardware is limited. This
necessitates the need to build simulators that mimic the execution of quantum
circuits on noisy quantum hardware accurately and scalably.
  In this work, we propose TUSQ - Tracking, Uncomputation, and Sampling for
Noisy Quantum Simulation. To represent the stochastic noisy channels
accurately, we average the output of multiple quantum circuits with fixed noisy
gates sampled from the channels. However, this leads to a substantial increase
in circuit overhead, which slows down the simulation. To eliminate this
overhead, TUSQ uses two modules: the Error Characterization Module (ECM), and
the Tree-based Execution Module (TEM).
  The ECM tracks the number of unique circuit executions needed to accurately
represent the noise. That is, if initially we needed $n_{1}$ circuit
executions, ECM reduces that number to $n_{2}$ by eliminating redundancies so
that $n_{2} < n_{1}$. This is followed by the TEM, which reuses computation
across these $n_{2}$ circuits. This computational reuse is facilitated by
representing all $n_{2}$ circuits as a tree. We sample the significant leaf
nodes of this tree and prune the remaining ones. We traverse this tree using
depth-first search. We use uncomputation to perform rollback-recovery at
several stages which reduces simulation time. We evaluate TUSQ for a total of
186 benchmarks and report an average speedup of $52.5\times$ and $12.53\times$
over Qiskit and CUDA-Q, which goes up to $7878.03\times$ and $439.38\times$
respectively. For larger benchmarks (more than than 15 qubits), the average
speedup is $55.42\times$ and $23.03\times$ over Qiskit and CUDA-Q respectively

Abstract: We propose a universal gate set for quantum computing that operates in the
presence of decoherence without requiring the overhead of quantum error
correction. Inspired by recent advances in noise manipulation technologies, we
demonstrate that a broad class of anisotropic qubit-bath couplings can be
decoupled via a dressing transformation, which generates a system-bath
entangled resource basis. When initialized in this basis, the computation
evolves as if decoherence is absent. Our proposal offers a flexible alternative
to systems requiring quantum error correction by utilizing partially tunable
system-bath couplings.

### [48] [Taming coherent noise with teleportation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04947)
*Kathleen Chang,Qile Su,Shruti Puri*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper addresses coherent quantum errors, which are more complex than Pauli errors, by analyzing their impact on quantum error correction and computing. The authors show that teleportation can convert coherent errors into Pauli-like errors, enabling threshold computation and efficient simulation. This suggests teleportation-based schemes might not need random compiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's main concern is advancing quantum error correction techniques, especially in handling more realistic and complex noise models such as coherent errors. The motivation comes from the need to improve the reliability and fault-tolerance of quantum computing systems which are threatened by various sources of noise, including coherent errors.

Method: The authors use a combination of theoretical analysis and simulation to model and compare the effects of coherent and Pauli errors. They specifically use teleportation as a method to transform coherent errors into more manageable forms, allowing for easier analysis and simulation. The paper also develops a pure Z-coherent error model for CSS codes.

Result: The key results include demonstrating that coherent errors can be converted into Pauli-like errors through teleportation, leading to manageable thresholds and classical simulatability. The work establishes a clear pathway for understanding and handling coherent noise, hinting at potential simplifications in quantum compiling.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that teleportation-based error correction can effectively mitigate coherent errors, making threshold computation and classical simulation feasible. This paves the way for optimizing quantum computing schemes by leveraging the inherent noise-tuning properties of teleportation, potentially reducing the need for randomized compiling methods. The findings are significant for advancing fault-tolerant quantum computing by addressing a critical yet underexplored challenge of coherent noise.

Abstract: Compared to the more widely studied Pauli errors, coherent errors present
several new challenges in quantum computing and quantum error correction (QEC).
For example, coherent errors may interfere constructively over a long circuit
and significantly increase the overall failure rate compared to Pauli noise.
Additionally, there is so far no analytical proof for a topological code
threshold under coherent errors. Moreover, it is hard to even numerically
estimate the performance of QEC under coherent errors as their effect in a
Clifford circuit cannot be efficiently classically simulated. In this work, we
demonstrate that teleportation effectively tailors coherent errors into Pauli
errors, for which analytical and numerical results are abundant. We first show
that repeated teleportation of a single qubit decoheres errors, and the average
infidelity grows at worst linearly with the number of teleportations, similar
to Pauli errors. We then analyze a physically motivated pure $Z$-coherent error
model for teleported CSS codes in which over-rotation errors accompany every
gate, and find that such an error model is equivalent to a Pauli error model.
Our result implies that the performance of a CSS code implemented via
teleportation-based error correction or measurement-based error correction with
such coherent noise can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer and
has an analytically provable threshold. The intrinsic noise-tailoring property
of teleportation may ultimately remove the need for randomized compiling in
teleportation-based quantum computing schemes.

Conclusion: The integrated methodology using design tools and materials simulations provides a viable pathway for advancing practical quantum computing capabilities, supporting continued research in superconducting qubit development.

Abstract: One of the most crucial steps in creating practical quantum computers is
designing scalable and efficient superconducting qubits. Coherence times,
connections between individual qubits, and reduction of environmental noise are
critical factors in the success of these qubits. Because they can be
lithographically fabricated and are less sensitive to charge noise,
superconducting qubits, especially those based on the Transmon architecture,
have emerged as top contenders for scalable platforms. In this work, we use a
combination of design iteration, material analysis, and simulation to tackle
the superconducting qubit optimization challenge. We created transmon-based
layouts for 4 qubits and 8 qubits using Qiskit Metal and conducted an
individual analysis for each qubit. We investigated anharmonicity and extracted
eigenfrequencies, computing participation ratios across several design passes,
and identifying the top five energy eigenstates using Ansys HFSS. We then
created a 2D cross section of a single qubit design in COMSOL Multiphysics to
evaluate how different materials affect performance. This enables us to assign
various superconducting materials and substrates and investigate their effects
on energy loss and electromagnetic properties. Qubit coherence and overall
device quality are significantly influenced by the materials chosen. This
integrated framework of material based simulation and circuit design offers a
workable way to create reliable superconducting qubit systems and supports
continued attempts to create scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing.

generated entangled states and the request completion time. Furthermore, we
investigated additional decisions that the central controller can make beyond
path selection, such as the choice of cutoff time and the allocation of network
resources to requests.

Motivation: 研究量子计算和信息处理中的量子状态生成质量至关重要，高质量的量子状态对于量子通信、量子传感器和量子计算尤为重要。然而，由于多种误差源混杂在密度矩阵中，难以单独识别每个误差源。因此，提出了一种自动量化误差源的方法，利用实验密度矩阵和模拟结果的距离优化模型参数，从而减少误差并提高状态质量。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模块化的设计，可以推广到其他量子平台，如超导量子比特、原子和固态自旋量子比特，为量子计算和通信提供了有力的技术支持。

Abstract: High-quality quantum state generation is essential for advanced quantum
information processing, including quantum communication, quantum sensing, and
quantum computing. In practice, various error sources degrade the quality of
quantum states, and quantum state tomography (QST) is a standard diagnostic
tool. However, in QST, multiple error sources gather in a single density
matrix, making it difficult to identify individual error sources. To address
this problem, we propose an automated method for quantifying error sources by
combining simulation and parameter optimization to reproduce the experimental
density matrix. We focus on the experimental generation of time-bin entangled
photon pairs, for which we model the relevant error sources and simulate the
density matrix with adjustable model parameters, thereby optimizing the
parameters and minimizing the trace distance to the experimental data.
Optimization of the parameters reduced the trace distance from 0.177 to 0.024,
indicating that our modeled error sources explain 86% of the errors. Reducing
the predicted error sources improves the state quality, consistent with our
predictions and thus validating the proposed method. In addition, the modular
structure of this framework makes it applicable to other quantum platforms,
such as superconducting qubits, atoms, and solid-state spins.

TL;DR: Preview this paper: Introduces a new quantum error correction decoding framework, HyperBlossom, that combines various decoding methods, achieves significant performance improvements, and demonstrates efficient runtime scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of implementing efficient and accurate quantum error correction decoding for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computations.

Method: The authors propose HyperBlossom as a unified framework that reformulates the MLE decoding problem into a Minimum-Weight Parity Factor (MWPF) problem, generalizing the blossom algorithm to hypergraphs.

Result: The proposed Hyperion software achieves improved logical error rates and demonstrates nearly-linear scaling in average runtime for various quantum codes under different noise models.

Conclusion: HyperBlossom provides a scalable, efficient, and versatile framework that unifies existing decoding methods while enhancing their performance under practical noise conditions.

Abstract: Fast and accurate quantum error correction (QEC) decoding is crucial for
scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation. Most-Likely-Error (MLE) decoding,
while being near-optimal, is intractable on general quantum Low-Density
Parity-Check (qLDPC) codes and typically relies on approximation and
heuristics. We propose HyperBlossom, a unified framework that formulates MLE
decoding as a Minimum-Weight Parity Factor (MWPF) problem and generalizes the
blossom algorithm to hypergraphs via a similar primal-dual linear programming
model with certifiable proximity bounds. HyperBlossom unifies all the existing
graph-based decoders like (Hypergraph) Union-Find decoders and Minimum-Weight
Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder, thus bridging the gap between heuristic and
certifying decoders.
  We implement HyperBlossom in software, namely Hyperion. Hyperion achieves a
4.8x lower logical error rate compared to the MWPM decoder on the distance-11
surface code and 1.6x lower logical error rate compared to a fine-tuned BPOSD
decoder on the $[[90, 8, 10]]$ bivariate bicycle code under code-capacity
noise. It also achieves an almost-linear average runtime scaling on both the
surface code and the color code, with numerical results up to sufficiently
large code distances of 99 and 31 for code-capacity noise and circuit-level
noise, respectively.

Abstract: Quantum cloud computing enables remote access to quantum processors, yet the
heterogeneity and noise of available quantum hardware create significant
challenges for efficient resource orchestration. These issues complicate the
optimization of quantum task allocation and scheduling, as existing heuristic
methods fall short in adapting to dynamic conditions or effectively balancing
execution fidelity and time. Here, we propose QFOR, a Quantum Fidelity-aware
Orchestration of tasks across heterogeneous quantum nodes in cloud-based
environments using Deep Reinforcement learning. We model the quantum task
orchestration as a Markov Decision Process and employ the Proximal Policy
Optimization algorithm to learn adaptive scheduling policies, using IBM quantum
processor calibration data for noise-aware performance estimation. Our
configurable framework balances overall quantum task execution fidelity and
time, enabling adaptation to different operational priorities. Extensive
evaluation demonstrates that QFOR is adaptive and achieves significant
performance with 29.5-84% improvements in relative fidelity performance over
heuristic baselines. Furthermore, it maintains comparable quantum execution
times, contributing to cost-efficient use of quantum computation resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper investigates how boundary conditions affect entanglement measures in a harmonic oscillator setup, which is relevant for quantum information theory and condensed matter physics.

Method: The research uses a two-dimensional lattice of harmonic oscillators under periodic and fixed boundary conditions, computing logarithmic negativities, mutual informations, and Renyi entropies to analyze corner and edge functions.

Result: Results indicate variation in corner function values under different boundary conditions, with mutual information showing discrepancies compared to logarithmic negativity.

Conclusion: The study highlights the influence of boundary conditions on entanglement measures in quantum harmonic systems, suggesting implications for modeling and simulation of quantum systems.

Abstract: We study the entanglement indices such as logarithmic negativities (LNs) and
mutual informations (MIs) between two adjacent subsets in a isolated universal
set $U$ of harmonic oscillators arranged on a two dimensional lattice within a
sufficiently large square. First, we verify the values of the corner functions
of angle $\pi/2, \pi/4, 3\pi/4$ presented in the previous study which adopts
periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) for the $U$. The values of each corner
function obtained from LNs are nearly equal to those in the previous ones,
while those of $3\pi/4$ from MIs are not sufficiently consistent with those
computed from LNs. Next, for the case where the universal system $U$ satisfies
the fixed end boundary conditions(FBCs), we calculate LNs, MIs at several
locations in $U$, compare them, especially corner functions with the values
obtained in the PBCs case, and examine the effect of the fixed ends. In
addition, we examine Renyi entropies for sets of three dimensional lattice
sites, the corner functions and the edge terms with solid angles and dihedral
angles $\pi/2,\pi/4$, respectively.

*Chi-Sheng Chen,Samuel Yen-Chi Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for differentially private time series forecasting. It combines variational quantum circuits with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection to achieve (∊, δ)-differential privacy. Experiments on the ETT dataset show that Q-DPTS performs better than classical and quantum baselines, indicating a favorable privacy-utility trade-off. The work is among the first to explore quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of time series forecasting under differential privacy, a crucial problem in domains like finance and energy where data sensitivity is high. The integration of differential privacy mechanisms often leads to performance degradation due to added noise, so the motivation is to find a way to enhance privacy without significantly compromising model performance. Using quantum computing as a novel approach seems promising, as quantum models may offer robustness against the utility loss from differential privacy measures.

Method: The method proposed, Q-DPTS, integrates quantum variational circuits with classical techniques like gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection. This hybrid approach is designed to maintain differential privacy while leveraging quantum models' expressiveness to improve robustness against utility loss.

Result: The experiments on the ETT dataset, which is a standard benchmark, show that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower prediction errors compared to classical and quantum baselines while maintaining the same privacy budget. This indicates that the proposed method successfully balances privacy and utility.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Q-DPTS represents a promising direction for secure and accurate time series forecasting in scenarios where data privacy is a concern. It highlights the potential of quantum computing to aid in differentially private forecasting, suggesting that future research should explore further the integration of quantum models with differential privacy mechanisms for enhanced performance.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is
paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP)
provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its
integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to
injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical
framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS
combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping
and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables
improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We
evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a
standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is
compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA,
QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower

Motivation: 近年来，量子计算和量子信息科学领域对量子态纯化问题的关注度日益增加，如何高效地从噪声量子态中提取纯量子态成为一个重要课题。该论文提出了一种简单的基于随机swap测试的协议，展示了其在实现最优纯化效果方面的作用，为量子态处理任务提供了新的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究在量子纯化协议的优化方面取得重要进展，提出了一种高效的基于随机swap测试的协议，具有广泛的应用场景。文章论证严谨，方法创新，对于量子计算和量子信息科学的发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: The goal of qubit purification is to combine multiple noisy copies of an
unknown pure quantum state to obtain one or more copies that are closer to the
pure state. We show that a simple protocol based solely on random SWAP tests
achieves the same fidelity as the Schur transform, which is optimal. This
protocol relies only on elementary two-qubit SWAP tests, which project a pair
of qubits onto the singlet or triplet subspaces, to identify and isolate
singlet pairs, and then proceeds with the remaining qubits. For a system of $n$
qubits, we show that after approximately $T \approx n \ln n$ random SWAP tests,
a sharp transition occurs: the probability of detecting any new singlet
decreases exponentially with $T$. Similarly, the fidelity of each remaining
qubit approaches the optimal value given by the Schur transform, up to an error
that is exponentially small in $T$. More broadly, this protocol achieves what
is known as weak Schur sampling and unitary Schur sampling with error
$\epsilon$, after only $2n \ln(n \epsilon^{-1})$ SWAP tests. That is, it
provides a lossless method for extracting any information invariant under
permutations of qubits, making it a powerful subroutine for tasks such as
quantum state tomography and metrology.

Abstract: We consider multi-party quantum sequence discrimination under local
operations and classical communication(LOCC), and provide conditions under
which the optimal LOCC discrimination of a multi-party quantum sequence
ensemble can be factorized into that of each individual ensemble. In other
words, the optimal LOCC discrimination of a multi-party quantum sequence
ensemble can be achieved just by performing optimal LOCC discrimination
independently at each step of the quantum sequence. We also illustrate through
examples of multi-party quantum states that such factorizability of optimal
LOCC discrimination is possible. We further establish a necessary and
sufficient condition under which the optimal LOCC discrimination of a
multi-party quantum state ensemble can be realized just by guessing the state
with the largest probability. Our results can provide a useful application to
investigate the fundamental limits of quantum data hiding.

associated quantum signature kernel through a quantum circuit construction. In
the case of the Gaussian matrix model, we study a random ensemble of Pauli

Motivation: Accurate AC/DC current measurements are vital for power metrology, and current comparators face challenges due to technological limitations. Bridging these gaps is crucial for unified current standards essential in modern power systems and quantum electrical standards.

Method: The device uses a diamond-based magnetometer with nitrogen-vacancy centers, enabling both AC and DC measurements with high accuracy (1e-8) and a bandwidth up to 300 Hz without cryogenics, outperforming traditional comparators.

Result: The comparator achieves 1e-8 accuracy for both AC and DC, operates up to 300 Hz, is ten times more accurate for AC, and matches DC comparators, expanding applicability to DC resistance bridges.

Conclusion: This solution unifies AC and DC current measurements, enhances precision without cryogenics, and broadens applications for quantum standards, addressing a fragmented metrology system.

Abstract: Accurate measurements of alternating current (AC) and direct current(DC)
ratios are fundamental to electric power metrology. However, conventional
current comparators for AC and DC typically rely on distinct
technologies-electromagnetic induction for AC and superconducting quantum
interference devices for DC. This technological divide leads to a fragmented

unified current standards that meet the demands of emerging power technologies.
In this work, we present a compact, room-temperature AC/DC current comparator
that integrates a diamond-based magnetometer using nitrogen-vacancy centers.
The device achieves an accuracy of 10-8 for both AC and DC signals and supports
a system bandwidth up to 300 Hz, without the need for cryogenics. It surpasses
the performance of typical AC comparators, offering ten-fold higher accuracy,
and matches that of state-of-the-art DC comparators. This unified,
cryogenics-free solution not only enhances precision and versatility but also
expands the applicability of the system to DC resistance bridges in quantum
electrical standards.

Abstract: We investigate the application of hybrid quantum tensor networks to

By combining tensor networks with variational quantum circuits, we demonstrate
the potential of QML to tackle complex time series classification and
regression tasks. Our results showcase the ability of hybrid quantum tensor
networks to achieve high accuracy in binary classification. Furthermore, we
observe promising performance in regressing discrete variables. While
hyperparameter selection remains a challenge, requiring careful optimisation to
unlock the full potential of these models, this work contributes significantly
to the development of QML for solving intricate problems in aeroelasticity. We
present an end-to-end trainable hybrid algorithm. We first encode time series
into tensor networks to then utilise trainable tensor networks for
dimensionality reduction, and convert the resulting tensor to a quantum circuit
in the encoding step. Then, a tensor network inspired trainable variational
quantum circuit is applied to solve either a classification or a multivariate
or univariate regression task in the aeroelasticity domain.

Result: Simulation results quantify achievable link budgets and secure key rates over varying distances, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed framework in optimizing Free Space Optical Quantum Key Distribution link performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the capability of the developed simulation framework to evaluate and optimize Free Space Optical Quantum Key Distribution links with atmospheric turbulence, concluding that such links are feasible with enhanced protocols and components.

Abstract: Satellite Quantum Key Distribution creates a pathway for secure global
communication with a level of security that is peerless. However,
ground-to-satellite Quantum Key Distribution links are degraded due to the
atmospheric turbulence. This paper gives a numerical framework using angular
spectrum propagation, Hufnagel-Valley model of turbulence and Von Karman phase
screens and takes into account the static losses introduced due to the
absorption of the beam by the different elements and compounds in the
atmosphere like O2, CO2 and H2O. This simulation propagates a Gaussian beam
step by step through the atmosphere, where we incorporate the phase distortions
using phase screens based on standard Cn2 profiles which take into account
losses such as scintillation and beam wander. We simulate the BB84 protocol
with decoy states for added security. The results of the simulation quantify
the expected link budget and Secure key rates over a range of distances to
measure the viability of Free Space Optical Quantum Key Distribution links at

Abstract: Quantum networks will rely on photons entangled to robust, local quantum
registers for computation and error correction. We demonstrate control of and
entanglement in a fully connected three-qubit $^{13}\mathrm{C}$ nuclear spin
register in diamond. The register is coupled to a quasi-free electron spin-1/2
of a silicon-vacancy center (SiV). High strain decouples the SiVs electron spin
from spin-orbit interaction reducing the susceptibility to phonons at liquid
helium temperature. As a result, the electron spin lifetime of hundreds of
milli seconds enables sensing of nuclear-nuclear couplings down to few hertz.
To detect and control the register we leverage continuous decoupling using
shaped, low-power microwave and direct radio frequency driving. Furthermore, we
implement a nuclear spin conditional phase-gate on the electron spin to mediate
bipartite entanglement. This approach presents an alternative to dynamically
decoupled nuclear spin entanglement, not limited by the electron spin's 1/2
nature, opening up new avenues to an optically-accessible, solid-state quantum

Abstract: The development of practical sensors for optical coherence tomography (OCT)
with undetected photons requires miniaturization via integration. To be
practical, these sensors must exhibit a large spectral bandwidth and a high
brightness, which are linked to a high axial resolution and a sufficient signal
to noise ratio, respectively. Here, we combine these requirements in a scheme
for OCT-measurements with undetected photons based on nonlinear Ti:LiNbO$_3$
waveguides. We investigate the performance benchmarks of the commonly used
SU(1,1) scheme in comparison to an induced coherence scheme and find that the
latter is actually better suited when implementing measurements with undetected
photons in integrated systems. In both schemes, we perform pump gain
optimization and OCT measurements with undetected photons with an axial

Abstract: Preparing a quantum circuit that implements a given sparse state is an
important building block that is necessary for many different quantum
algorithms. In the context of fault-tolerant quantum computing, the so-called
non-Clifford gates are much more expensive to perform than the Clifford ones.
We hence provide an algorithm for synthesizing sparse quantum states with a
special care for quantum resources. The circuit depth, ancilla count, and
crucially non-Clifford count of the circuit produced by the algorithm are all
linear in the sparsity. We conjecture that the non-Clifford count complexity is
tight, and show a weakened version of this claim. The first key component of
the algorithm is the synthesis of a generalized W-state. We provide a
tree-based circuit construction approach, and the relationship between the
tree's structure and the circuit's complexity. The second key component is a
classical reversible circuit implementing a permutation that maps the basis
states of the W-state to those of the sparse quantum state. We reduce this
problem to the diagonalization of a binary matrix, using a specific set of
elementary matrix operations corresponding to the classical reversible gates.
We then solve this problem using a new version of Gauss-Jordan elimination,
that minimizes the circuit complexities including circuit depth using parallel
elimination steps.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents two methods for quantum circuit preparation in quantum chemistry, comparing external-controlled Givens rotations and a sparse technique. The sparse method outperforms the others in several applications, leading to more efficient circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of efficient quantum algorithms for chemistry is a significant area of research, particularly in quantum circuit design. This paper addresses the challenge of preparing multiconfigurational states, which are crucial for accurately modeling quantum chemical systems with strong correlations.

Method: The authors compare two methods for preparing multiconfigurational states using quantum circuits. The first method uses externally controlled Givens rotations, while the second leverages the sparsity of chemical state vectors. Both methods aim to automate the process, with the second method shown to be more efficient in several applications.

Result: The result shows that the sparse technique can produce more efficient quantum circuits compared to the external-controlled Givens method, particularly useful for applications involving strong correlations and excited states.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that exploiting the sparsity of chemical state vectors can lead to more efficient quantum circuits for multiconfigurational state preparation, advancing the field of quantum chemistry on quantum computers.

Abstract: The ability to prepare states for quantum chemistry is a promising feature of
quantum computers, and efficient techniques for chemical state preparation is
an active area of research. In this paper, we implement and investigate two
methods of quantum circuit preparation for multiconfigurational states for
quantum chemical applications. It has previously been shown that controlled
Givens rotations are universal for quantum chemistry. To prepare a selected
linear combination of Slater determinants (represented as occupation number
configurations) using Givens rotations, the gates that rotate between the
reference and excited determinants need to be controlled on qubits outside the
excitation (external controls), in general. We implement a method to
automatically find the external controls required for utilizing Givens
rotations to prepare multiconfigurational states on a quantum circuit. We
compare this approach to an alternative technique that exploits the sparsity of
the chemical state vector and find that the latter can outperform the method of
externally controlled Givens rotations; highly reduced circuits can be obtained
by taking advantage of the sparse nature (where the number of basis states is
significantly less than 2$^{n_q}$ for $n_q$ qubits) of chemical wavefunctions.
We demonstrate the benefits of these techniques in a range of applications,
including the ground states of a strongly correlated molecule, matrix elements
of the Q-SCEOM algorithm for excited states, as well as correlated initial
states for a quantum subspace method based on quantum computed moments and
quantum phase estimation.

TL;DR: 研究展示了通过测量不满 Recently，我需要分析这篇论文的摘要，作为对我来说，这是一个新的研究领域，我对量子网络和纠缠态的理解还不深入。首先，摘要提到在量子网络中，消除节点之间的连接有助于减轻去相干性的影响，通常通过测量静默的节点或容易受噪声影响的节点来实现。这让我想到纠缠态在量子信息处理中的重要性，尤其是在量子网络的稳定性和安全性方面。接下来，论文引入了“区域局部纠缠”这个概念，定义为多态系统中两态区域内的平均纠缠。这让我思考，如何量化和描述复杂的量子系统中的纠缠分布，尤其是在大规模量子网络中，这可能是一个挑战。然后，论文通过考虑所有共享一个共同态的两态区域，称为“枢纽”，来计算总区域局部纠缠。我需要理解枢纽的作用和其在纠缠态分解中的重要性。例如，如果一个枢纽与其他多个节点相连，它的丢失如何影响整体系统的纠缠结构。此外，论文还比较了不同量子状态，如置换对称态和特定磁化子空间中的态，得出它们的总区域局部纠缠有不同的上界和下限。这让我联想到量子相变和不同的量子态之间的差异，可能存在某种不变量或特征能够区分这些状态。另外，数值模拟部分提到，即使在haar均匀的随机态和各态之间的传递经历局部相位干扰时，这些界限仍然有效。这让我想到冗余和稳健性在量子通信中的重要性，特别是在存在噪声和干扰的情况下，如何确保纠缠资源的稳定性和可靠性。最后，与置换对称态不同，特定磁化子空间中的态有不同的纠缠界限，这表明它们的纠缠结构是独特的。这可能对量子编码和纠错码的设计产生影响，或者在量子材料的结构分析中找到对应的现象。总的来说，这篇论文通过引入新的纠缠度量和理论分析，提供了量子网络中纠缠态分布的新视角，这对于我们理解如何有效管理和利用纠缠资源具有重要意义。然而，我还不太确定具体的数学推导细节，以及这些界限是如何得到的，可能需要查阅相关的数学方法或文献来更深入理解。”onacci-like sequences and graph theory concepts to determine the bounds and how they relate to the specific quantum states considered.

Motivation: The paper's focus on understanding how to measure and control entanglement distribution in large-scale quantum networks is crucial for the development of robust quantum communication and computing systems. By introducing the 

Method: The method involves defining a new measure of entanglement, 'regionally localized entanglement', and applying it to various quantum states to establish upper and lower bounds. The study uses a    framework based on numerical simulations and analytical proofs, specifically examining permutation-symmetric states and magnetization sector states.

Result: The study finds that permutation-symmetric pure states have consistent bounds even in large system sizes, while magnetization sector states exhibit different bounds. Additionally, the local phase-flip channels affect these bounds differently depending on the system size.

Conclusion: The research provides a novel way to quantify and analyze entanglement distribution in quantum networks, offering insights into the behavior of different quantum states under various noise conditions and suggesting potential applications in quantum error correction and communication protocols.

Abstract: In quantum networks, eliminating connections between nodes is crucial to
mitigate the effects of decoherence, often achieved by performing measurements
on nodes that are idle, or vulnerable to noise. To characterize the
entanglement content of the resulting smaller network, we introduce the notion
of ``regionally localized entanglement", defined as the average entanglement
concentrated over a two-qubit region in a multi-qubit system. Hence, the total
regionally localized entanglement can be obtained by considering all two-qubit
regions sharing a common qubit, referred to as the ``hub". We prove that the
total regionally localized entanglement corresponding to a specific hub is
bounded above and below via the localizable block entanglement shared between
the hub and the rest of the multi-qubit system for a number of paradigmatic
pure quantum states, including permutation-symmetric states and arbitrary
superposition of states from a specific magnetization sector. Numerical
simulations confirm that the bounds for permutation-symmetric pure states
remain valid even for Haar-uniformly generated pure states, and when each of
the qubits is sent through local phase-flip channels of Markovian and
non-Markovian types, except when the system-size is small. On the other hand,
arbitrary states from a particular magnetization sector yield bounds on total
regionally localized entanglement that are distinct from the
permutation-symmetric states, highlighting the structurally unique entanglement
properties of the former.

Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement (HDE) is a valuable resource in quantum
information processing, and efficient certification of HDE is crucial to many
applications. In this work, we propose a simple and general framework for
certifying HDE in general bipartite pure states under restricted operations,
such as local operations and classical communication (LOCC). On this basis we
show that HDE in general bipartite pure states can be certified efficiently.
Moreover, the sample cost for certifying a given degree of HDE even decreases
monotonically with the local dimensions. In addition, for a general two-qubit
pure state, we construct an optimal entanglement certification strategy based
on separable operations, which can be realized by LOCC when the target state
has sufficiently high entanglement. The core concept of our framework is
versatile and can be extended to certify a wide range of critical resources
under restricted operations.

*Mustapha Anis Younes,Sofia Zebboudj,Abdelhakim Gharbi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a new mediated multiparty semi-quantum secret sharing protocol enabling a classical user to share a secret with multiple classical users with fewer quantum operations and resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of traditional multiparty semi-quantum secret sharing protocols by offering a more efficient and practical approach.

Method: The protocol uses a single qubit as the quantum resource, reduces classical user operations to two (measurements in Z basis and qubit reordering), and relies on an untrusted third party for mediation.

Result: The new protocol achieves higher qubit efficiency and is secure against various attacks, making it more practical for real-world applications.

Conclusion: This protocol enhances the practicality of semi-quantum secret sharing by optimizing quantum operations and simplifying classical tasks.

Abstract: Typical multiparty semi-quantum secret sharing (MSQSS) protocols require the
dealer to possess full quantum capabilities, while the classical users usually
need to perform three operations. To address this practical limitation, this
paper introduces a new mediated MSQSS protocol that enables Alice, a classical
user, to share a secret with $M$ classical Bobs, with the assistance of an
untrusted third party (TP) who may attempt any possible attack to steal Alice's
secret. Furthermore, the classical participants require only two capabilities
instead of three, namely: (a) performing measurements in the $Z$ basis; and (b)
reordering qubits. The proposed scheme offers significant advantages over
existing mediated QSS protocols: (1) it is the first mediated SQSS protocol to
adopt single qubits, instead of entangled states, as the quantum resource,
which makes it more practical and easier to implement; (2) It achieves higher
qubit efficiency. Security analysis also demonstrates that the protocol is
secure against well-known attacks.

### [73] [$Λ$-Type Giant Atom Mediated Controllable Single-Photon Transport in a One-Dimensional Chiral Waveguide](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05510)
*Yimei Wang,Jing Li,Jing Lu,Lan Zhou*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Abstract discusses a driven Λ-type giant atom system coupled to a 1D waveguide. By using a real-space scattering approach, analytical solutions for scattering amplitudes are found in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The study reveals a splitting of dip transmission into double dips as driving field strength increases. Chiral coupling allows controlled switching between full transmission and perfect reflection. In Markovian limit, perfect transmission is predicted at specific phases. In non-Markovian regime, giant atom size affects oscillatory behavior and decoupling/reflectivity points. Outcome is a method to control photon transmission and reflection through system parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract discusses a quantum optics setup aiming to control photon transport, likely using unconventional coupling methods. The goal is probably to demonstrate novel ways to manipulate light transmission and reflection in quantum systems, which could have applications in quantum information processing or photonic devices.

Method: Real-space scattering approach is employed to derive analytical solutions. The system under study is a driven Λ-type giant atom coupled to a 1D waveguide, considering both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Solutions involve scattering amplitudes, and system parameters such as field strength and giant atom size are varied to observe transmission properties.

Result: The main findings include splitting of transmission dip into double dips with increased driving field strength, controlled switching via chiral coupling between full transmission and reflection, and controlling the number of decoupling and reflection points by adjusting giant atom size. Additionally, in the Markovian limit, perfect transmission is achieved at specific phases regardless of driving parameters.

Conclusion: The research presents a controllable system for single-photon transport using giant atoms and waveguide coupling, offering a new avenue to design devices for quantum optics applications. The analytical approach and findings could guide future experimental implementations and theoretical studies in this complex quantum system.

Abstract: We investigate the single-photon scattering spectrum of a driven
$\Lambda$-type giant atom system chirally coupled to a one-dimensional (1D)
waveguide. By employing a real-space scattering approach, we obtain analytical
solutions for the scattering amplitudes that remain valid in both Markovian and
non-Markovian regimes. We observe that an external driving field induces a
splitting of the transmission spectrum's dip into double dips, with the
distance between the two dips increasing as the strength of the driving field
increases. The chiral nature of the coupling allows for controlled switching
between complete transmission and perfect reflection of incident photons. In
the Markovian limit, we predict robust perfect transmission at specific phase
values, independent of the driving field parameters.Moreover, in the
non-Markovian regime, as the size of the giant atom increases, the oscillatory
behavior of the scattering spectrum becomes more pronounced. Adjusting the
giant atom size enables control over the number of decoupling points as well as
the number of complete reflection points.

This method is robust against general noise models and helps determine the crossover point where quantum advantage becomes possible. It also extends existing techniques like entropy benchmarking. The framework includes a novel randomised compiling scheme to mitigate noise and resolves an open problem regarding non-transversal gate twirling. The approach provides a tool for assessing computation quality on quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the scaling of quantum computers, traditional certification methods become impractical, creating a need for scalable and device-independent solutions. This paper addresses this need by introducing logical accreditation as an efficient method to certify quantum computations, considering various noise models and extending existing techniques. This is significant as it helps determine the practicality of quantum advantage experiments and the efficiency of error mitigation strategies.

It includes methods for twirling non-transversal gates beyond the standard T-gate, providing a resolution to an open problem. The framework also extends techniques like entropy benchmarking and provides criteria for evaluating computation quality.

Result: Numerical simulations demonstrate the scalability of logical accreditation in certifying quantum advantage experiments and identifying the crossover point where logical computations surpass physical ones. The method shows applicability in evaluating logical circuit error rates and extending error mitigation strategies. It provides a way to upper-bound logical state infidelity and assesses the quality of computations on quantum hardware.

Conclusion: Logical accreditation offers a practical tool for evaluating the scalability and reliability of quantum computations using encoded qubits. It addresses critical challenges in certification, supports quantum advantage assessments, and enhances error mitigation strategies, providing a scalable solution to a major challenge in quantum computing. By incorporating randomised compiling and solving the non-transversal gate twirling problem, it offers a robust framework that bridges computation and certification, enabling practical evaluation of quantum hardware performance.

Abstract: As fault-tolerant quantum computers scale, certifying the accuracy of
computations performed with encoded logical qubits will soon become classically
intractable. This creates a critical need for scalable, device-independent
certification methods. In this work, we introduce logical accreditation, a
framework for efficiently certifying quantum computations performed on logical
qubits. Our protocol is robust against general noise models, far beyond those
typically considered in performance analyses of quantum error-correcting codes.
Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that logical accreditation can
scalably certify quantum advantage experiments and indicate the crossover point
where encoded computations begin to outperform physical computations. Logical
accreditation can also find application in evaluating whether logical circuit
error rates are sufficiently low that error mitigation can be efficiently
performed, extending the entropy benchmarking method to the regime of
fault-tolerant computation, and upper-bounding the infidelity of the logical
output state. Underpinning the framework is a novel randomised compiling scheme
that converts arbitrary logical circuit noise into stochastic Pauli noise. This
scheme includes a method for twirling non-transversal logical gates beyond the
standard T-gate, resolving an open problem posed by Piveteau et al. [Piveteau
et al. PRL 127, 200505 (2001)]. By bridging fault-tolerant computation and
computational certification, logical accreditation offers a practical tool to
assess the quality of computations performed on quantum hardware using encoded
logical qubits.

Abstract: Accurate quantum channel parameter estimation is essential for effective
information reconciliation in continuous-variable quantum key distribution
(CV-QKD). However, conventional maximum likelihood (ML) estimators rely on a
large amount of discarded data (or pilot symbols), leading to a significant
loss in symbol efficiency. Moreover, the separation between the estimation and
reconciliation phases can introduce error propagation. In this paper, we
propose a novel joint message-passing scheme that unifies channel parameter
estimation and information reconciliation within a Bayesian framework. By
leveraging the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, the proposed method
simultaneously estimates unknown parameters during decoding, eliminating the
need for separate ML estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid
multidimensional rotation scheme that removes the requirement for norm
feedback, significantly reducing classical channel overhead. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to unify multidimensional reconciliation and
channel parameter estimation in CV-QKD, providing a practical solution for
high-efficiency reconciliation with minimal pilots.

Abstract: Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a novel paradigm in
quantum artificial intelligence due to its exceptional hardware efficiency. For
practical applications, pulse-based models must be both expressive and
trainable. Previous studies suggest that pulse-based models under dynamic
symmetry can be effectively trained, thanks to a favorable loss landscape that
has no barren plateaus. However, the resulting uncontrollability may compromise
expressivity when the model is inadequately designed. This paper investigates
the requirements for pulse-based QML models to be expressive while preserving
trainability. We present a necessary condition pertaining to the system's
initial state, the measurement observable, and the underlying dynamical
symmetry Lie algebra, supported by numerical simulations. Our findings
establish a framework for designing practical pulse-based QML models that
balance expressivity and trainability.

Abstract: We consider the effect of projective measurements on the quench dynamics of
the bipartite entanglement entropy in one dimensional free fermionic systems.
In our protocol, we consider projective measurements of a $U(1)$ conserved
charge, the particle number, on some large subsystem, and study the
entanglement entropies between the same subsystem and its complement. We
compare the dynamics emanating from two classes of initial states, one which is
an eigenstate of the charge and another which is not. Moreover, we consider the
effects of a single measurement as well as multiple which are periodically
performed. Using the quasiparticle picture, we obtain analytic expressions for
the behaviour of the entanglement which admit a transparent physical
interpretation. In general, we find that measurements introduce two distinct
types of corrections to the entanglement, which can be interpreted separately
as classical and quantum contributions. The classical contribution is
independent of the measurement outcome and scales logarithmically with variance
of the charge distribution. In contrast, the quantum contribution depends on
the specific measurement outcome and can be significant for individual
realizations; however, it becomes negligible when averaged over all possible
outcomes. Our expressions reduce to previously known results for symmetry
resolved entanglement and full counting statistics in some relevant limits, and
are confirmed by an exact calculation performed on the N\'eel initial state.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is an emerging cryptographic method designed
for secure key sharing. Its security is theoretically guaranteed by fundamental
principles of quantum mechanics, making it a leading candidate for future

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method called Partial Projected Ensembles (PPE) to study thermalization and information scrambling in quantum systems. They show that this method captures the spreading of information and how quantum correlations decay when parts of the system are discarded. They test this method on different models and find that PPE dynamics reflect the different scrambling behaviors of these models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of thermalization and scrambling in quantum systems is important for understanding the dynamics of many-body systems and their approach to equilibrium. This paper aims to provide a new framework to probe these processes, which could have implications for various fields including quantum computing and condensed matter physics.

Method: The authors introduce the concept of Partial Projected Ensembles, which involves measuring subsystems, conditioning the ensembles on these measurements, and tracing out the complementary regions. They use this method on the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, a many-body localized system, and the $	extit{	extell}$-bit model to compute statistical fluctuations and probabilities of bit strings to observe scrambling dynamics.

Result: The results show that PPE fluctuations and probabilities exhibit dynamics sensitive to the size of discarded regions, revealing how scrambling is encoded. They observe linear and logarithmic dependency of the lightcones in different regimes, confirming the accuracy of PPE as a tool for studying scrambling and thermalization.

Conclusion: PPE provides a powerful tool for analyzing thermalization and information scrambling, capturing the causal structure of information spreading and the decay of quantum correlations when parts of the system are discarded. This method can be experimentally implemented, providing a way to probe complex many-body dynamics in various systems.

Abstract: Thermalisation and information scrambling in out-of-equilibrium quantum
many-body systems are deeply intertwined: local subsystems dynamically approach
thermal density matrices while their entropies track information spreading.
Projected ensembles--ensembles of pure states conditioned on measurement
outcomes of complementary subsystems--provide higher-order probes of
thermalisation, converging at late times to universal maximum-entropy
ensembles. In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a
framework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted
on projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced
on a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement,
tracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded
outcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the
PPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing
how scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we
demonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs)
associated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an
experimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs
display exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting
exponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate
these findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics
in the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our
analysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic
results for the $\ell$-bit model. The linear and logarithmic lightcones
characteristic of ergodic and MBL regimes emerge naturally from PPE dynamics,
establishing it as a powerful tool for probing scrambling and deep
thermalisation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces best practices for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations, covering fundamentals, methods, steps, and practical guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics is growing rapidly, but understanding its complex steps and choosing the right methods remains a challenge for users. This paper aims to provide a user-friendly guide to help researchers navigate this field.

Method: The paper follows a structured approach by discussing fundamentals, introducing necessary electronic structure methods, detailing simulation steps, providing practical examples, and including a checklist and FAQs.

Result: Readers are equipped with comprehensive guidance on performing NAMD simulations, integrating different electronic structure methods, and calculating observables effectively.

Conclusion: This Best Practices paper serves as an essential resource for users entering the field of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, making it easier to conduct successful simulations.

Abstract: Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations aim to describe the coupled
electron-nuclear dynamics of molecules in excited electronic states. These
simulations have been applied to understand a plethora of photochemical and
photophysical processes, and, as a result, the number of nonadiabatic dynamics
simulations has been growing significantly over the past decade. Yet, the field
remains in its infancy, and a potential user may find it difficult to approach
this type of simulation, given their complexity and the number of elements that
should be considered for a (hopefully) successful nonadiabatic dynamics
simulation. Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics relies on several key steps:
finding a level of electronic-structure theory to describe the molecule in its
Franck-Condon region and beyond, describing the photoexcitation process,
selecting a method to perform the nonadiabatic dynamics, and analyzing the
final results before calculating observables for a more direct comparison with
experiment. This Best Practices aims to provide a general guide for the user of
nonadiabatic molecular dynamics by (i) discussing the fundamentals of
nonadiabatic molecular dynamics and the various trajectory-based methods
developed for molecular systems, (ii) introducing the different
electronic-structure methods and concepts - adiabatic/diabatic representation,

### [82] [The Anisotropic Interface Continuum Solvation Model and the Finite-Element Anisotropic Poisson Solver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05577)
*Ziwei Chai,Sandra Luber*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: paper proposes an anisotropic solvation model for simulating dielectric constants near solid surfaces, validates the model with analytical and numerical methods, and demonstrates significant electrostatic effects under anisotropic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of accurately modeling dielectric behavior in the vicinity of solid surfaces, which is crucial for understanding surface interactions and properties.

Method: The authors developed an anisotropic interfacial continuum solvation model, derived analytical electrostatic contributions, implemented it in CP2K, and created FEAPS for solving Poisson equations. They validated analytical forces and benchmarked potentials against standard methods.

Result: The model shows pronounced work function shifts and spatially varying potentials under anisotropic conditions, with optimized adsorption geometries differing from isotropic cases.

Conclusion: This model enhances accuracy in simulating surface interactions by accounting for anisotropic dielectric effects.

Abstract: We propose an anisotropic interfacial continuum solvation (AICS) model to
simulate the distinct in-plane and out-of-plane dielectric constants of liquids
near solid-liquid interfaces and their spatial variations along the surface
normal direction. In low-electron-density regions, each dielectric function in
the diagonal components of a dielectric tensor varies monotonically with
distance from the solid surface along the surface normal; in
high-electron-density regions near the surface, each dielectric function adopts
the electron-density-based formulation proposed by Andreussi et al. (J. Chem.
Phys. 136, 064102 (2012)) The resulting dielectric tensor is continuously
differentiable with respect to both electron density and spatial coordinates.
We derived analytical expressions for electrostatic contributions to the KS
potential and forces, and implemented AICS, including these analytical
derivatives, into CP2K. To solve the anisotropic Poisson equations, we
developed a parallel finite-element anisotropic Poisson solver (FEAPS) based on
the FEniCSx platform and its interface with CP2K. Analytical forces were
validated against finite-difference calculations, while electrostatic
potentials computed under vacuum and isotropic solvent conditions using AICS
and FEAPS were benchmarked against standard vacuum DFT and SCCS results,
respectively. In the anisotropic solvent environment characterized by the
enhanced in-plane and reduced out-of-plane dielectric functions near the
Ag(111) surface, we calculated the resulting work functions and electrostatic
potentials, and optimized the adsorption geometry for OH. Compared to the
isotropic case, we observed more pronounced work function shifts and spatially
modulated electrostatic profiles across different charge states. Our results
also showed that OH tilted more towards the plane parallel to the surface under
the anisotropic dielectric conditions.

Abstract: The "Mpemba effect" is the name given to the assertion that hot water freezes
quicker than cold water1 or, in a modern and more general form, that the system
that is initially more distant from its equilibrium state comes to this state
earlier2. This counterintuitive statement seems to breach fundamental
thermodynamic and kinetic laws; however, numerous experiments3-10 with
classical and quantum systems demonstrate this paradoxical Mpemba effect,
leading to extensive discssions in prominent scientific jornals2,5,9,12-14.
However, the fundamental physical mechanisms behind this effect have remained
elusive14. Here we performed the water freezing experiments under carefully
controlled conditions, and found that the Mpemba effect only occurred when the
freezer temperature was very close to the temperature of ice nucleation. In
this case, the range of freezing times for both hot and cold water was so great
that it exceeded the delayed cooling of the initially hotter liquid, and
therefore sometimes the hot water froze before the cold water. Our theoretical
analysis of this fact shows that the Mpemba paradox associated with water
freezing is rooted in the stochastic nature of ice nucleation, typical of
first-order phase transitions. We anticipate our assay to be a starting point
for reconsidering the famous Mpemba paradox in water and other systems
undergoing similar phase transitions.

Abstract: The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons
passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at
ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its
theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist
regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general
chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across
solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules.
Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine
if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models
are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a
workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical
fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems,
magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized
electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and
enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and
potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum
information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory,
experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for
quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS,
clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the
`spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model
realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum
sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular
exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer
a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum
technologies.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper presents a time-domain implementation of the Method of Auxiliary
Sources (MAS) combined with the Standard Impedance Boundary Condition (SIBC)
for electromagnetic scattering problems involving cylindrical scatterers with
finite but moderate conductivity. The proposed approach focuses on solving the
two-dimensional problem using a first-order SIBC, which is valid when the
conductivity is sufficiently higher than the maximum spectral frequency times
the dielectric permittivity of the scatterer. This regime includes moderately
conductive materials--such as carbon-based composites, conductive polymers, and
doped dielectrics--that are increasingly used in real-world radio-frequency
applications, including wearable electronics, electromagnetic interference
shielding, and biomedical sensors. Under the above validity conditions, the
interaction between the incident wave and the scatterer is dominated by surface
effects, allowing for an efficient and accurate modeling strategy without the
need to compute internal fields. The theoretical formulation of the time-domain
MAS-SIBC method is developed, followed by extensive numerical testing on
various geometries whose cross section is a closed curve. Such geometries
include circular, elliptical, super-circular, rounded-triangular, and
inverted-elliptical scatterers. A planar geometry is also tested. All results
are validated against analytical solutions and commercial frequency-domain
solvers, demonstrating the accuracy and practical potential of the proposed
method. The findings suggest that time-domain MAS-SIBC offers a promising and
computationally efficient approach for modeling scattering from materials even
with moderate conductivity.

### [86] [Unstable periodic orbits galore and quantum hyperscarring in highly frustrated magnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04763)
*Andrea Pizzi,Claudio Castelnovo,Johannes Knolle*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper explores a new high-energy dynamical regime in frustrated magnets where a large manifold of classical configurations leads to many-body quantum chaos, with quantum states scarring on periodic orbits. The product states have unusual amplitude distributions, suggesting new mechanisms for quantum scarring without symmetry or integrability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is dealing with frustrated magnets and quantum chaos, aiming to find new mechanisms for quantum scarring, which is a significant topic in condensed matter physics, particularly at high energies where conventional symmetries and integrability are absent.

Method: The authors identify an extensive manifold of classical configurations, leading to dynamically suppressed interactions and unstable periodic orbits. They connect this to quantum effects, specifically hyperscarring and non-Porter-Thomas amplitude distributions.

Result: The study shows that the proliferation of classical periodic orbits corresponds to hyperscarring in quantum systems, resulting in power-law amplitude distributions at mid-spectrum thermal states, establishing a new mechanism for quantum scarring without protecting symmetries.

Conclusion: This work opens a new perspective on quantum chaos without conventional protecting symmetries, offering intriguing possibilities for scars in 2D or 3D frustrated magnets and spin liquids, which are also relevant to quantum gravity.

Abstract: Highly frustrated magnets, with their macroscopically-degenerate classical
ground states and massively-entangled quantum spin liquid phases, have been
pivotal to the development of modern condensed matter concepts such as emergent
symmetries, topological order, and fractionalisation. The effects of
frustration and massive degeneracies at high energy, where the many-body
dynamics becomes chaotic, have hitherto been far less explored. Here, we
identify a high-energy dynamical analog of highly-frustrated magnetism, in the
form of an extensive manifold of classical ''interaction-suppressing''
configurations giving rise to unstable periodic orbits. These are in general
neither protected by symmetry nor integrability, and emerge from a set of
dynamical local constraints that effectively nullify the interactions while
allowing extensively many local degrees of freedom. The proliferation of
unstable periodic orbits corresponds in the quantum case to ''hyperscarring'',
that is, quantum scarring on exponentially many unstable periodic orbits. On
the product states associated to the latter, the amplitudes of the mid-spectrum
thermal eigenstates exhibit a power-law distribution, in stark contrast to the
expected exponential Porter-Thomas distribution that holds for generic product
states. Our results reveal a new constrained dynamical regime where many-body
quantum chaos coexists with structured manifolds of coherent dynamics, and
establishes a mechanism for hitherto elusive extensive scarring.

Abstract: We investigate quasiparticle interference on an altermagnetic Lieb-like
lattice and show how a non-spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy
measurement can yield effectively spin-resolved information. Within a four-site
tight-binding model, which can be tuned between an antiferromagnetic and a
Lieb-type altermagnetic state, we introduce on-site impurities at distinct
sublattice sites and compute the real space local density of states (LDOS) via
a Green's function approach. A Fourier transformation of the impurity-induced
LDOS yields the characteristic $d$-wave spin-split Fermi surface contours of
the altermagnetic phase. Notably, by choosing which sublattice the impurity is
placed upon, we show that the scattering amplitudes effectively encode
spin-dependent contrasts: Impurities on one of the magnetic sublattices
highlights predominantly spin-up contributions along one crystallographic
direction, while impurities on the other one favor the complementary spin-down
channel and orientation.

Abstract: Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we study the dimerized spin-1/2
Heisenberg model on a square lattice, focusing on the paramagnetic dimer phase
and its edge states, and associated surface criticality behavior. The model can
also be viewed as two-dimensional antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled usual
ladders with AF rungs. We demonstrate that the dimer phase of the model,
previously considered topologically trivial, is actually a
quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) Haldane phase belonging to a symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) state. This is established by measuring generalized strange
correlators introduced in this work and further confirmed by showing that the
nontrivial edge state on a zigzag cut in the dimer phase is ferromagnetically
ordered, resulting from effective ferromagnetic interactions between degenerate
spinons generated on each side of the zigzag cut. Furthermore, we show that the
ordered edge state gives rise to an extraordinary surface critical behavior at
the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) bulk critical points of the model, which contradicts
theoretical predictions based on classical-quantum mapping.

Abstract: We investigate the ground state phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the star lattice using infinite projected
entangled pair states (iPEPS) and high-order series expansions. The model
includes two distinct couplings: $J_d$ on the dimer bonds and $J_t$ on the
trimer bonds. While it is established that the system hosts a valence bond
solid (VBS) phase for $J_d \ge J_t$, the ground state phase diagram for $J_d <
J_t$ has remained unsettled. Our iPEPS simulations uncover a first-order phase
transition at $J_d/J_t \approx 0.18$, significantly lower than previously
reported estimates. Beyond this transition, we identify a close competition
between two valence bond crystal (VBC) states: a columnar VBC and a $\sqrt{3}
\times \sqrt{3}$ VBC, with the latter consistently exhibiting lower energy
across all finite bond dimensions. The high-order series expansion supports
this by finding that the $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ VBC state indeed becomes
energetically favorable, but only at sixth order in perturbation theory,
revealing the subtle nature of the competition between candidate states.

Motivation: The study of magnetic properties in materials is crucial for understanding their potential applications in technology and for advancing fundamental physics, especially in the context of x-ray diffraction which is a key analytical tool.

Method: The approach involves symmetry analysis of the material, considering magnetic order below 14.5 K in a specific space group (P21/c) and utilizing neutron diffraction patterns to derive conclusions about the magnetic moments and Bragg amplitudes.

Result: The analysis highlights the role of Dirac and polar nickel multipoles in contributing to the x-ray Bragg amplitudes and suggests that this material may exhibit unique magnetic properties compared to Cr2O3.

Conclusion: The findings could pave the way for new applications in magnetic materials research, particularly in the development of advanced magnetic sensors and devices by optimizing magnetic ordering and multipole contributions.

Abstract: Magnetic axial and polar (Dirac) nickel multipoles contribute to resonant
x-ray Bragg amplitudes in a symmetry informed analysis of monoclinic
Li2Ni3P4O14 presented for future diffraction experiments. Magnetic long-range
order below a temperature 14.5 K can be viewed as a two-dimensional trimerized
antiferromagnet with Ni ions in two Wyckoff positions in the centrosymmetric

the primary x-ray beam, unlike the corresponding diffraction by an
antiferromagnet characterized by anti-inversion and a linear magnetoelectric
effect, e.g., historically significant chromium sesquioxide (Cr2O3) and
Cu2(MoO4)(SeO3) (Lovesey & van der Laan, 2024). The space group is inferred

Abstract: Higher-spin quantum magnets with competing interactions offer a rich platform
for exploring quantum phases that transcend the paradigms of spin-1/2 systems,
owing to their enlarged local Hilbert spaces and the emergence of multipolar
correlations. We investigate a one-dimensional spin-1 chain where quadrupolar
order is promoted by two distinct mechanisms: conventional bilinear-biquadratic
exchange and bond-directional antiferromagnetic Kitaev frustration. Using
density matrix renormalization group calculations, we determine the complete
ground-state phase diagram and uncover two emergent phases induced by the
Kitaev interaction: a Kitaev nematic phase and a Kitaev-dimer phase. The Kitaev
nematic phase emerges from a fragile biquadratic dimer state via a continuous
quantum phase transition in the Ising universality class. The Kitaev dimer
phase spontaneously breaks a screw symmetry to favor either $x$- or $y$-spin
bonding, forming a gapped state that coexists with a crystalline order of
alternating $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes.

Abstract: Kramers-Wannier duality, a hallmark of the Ising model, has recently gained
renewed interest through its reinterpretation as a non-invertible symmetry with
a state-level action. Using sequential quantum circuits (SQC), we argue that
this duality governs the stability of quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states in a
nonintegrable model, depending on whether the dual preserves the embedding
conditions for scarring. This is supported by striking agreement between
first-order perturbation theory and numerics, which capture scar dynamics
despite chaotic spectra. Our results suggest that non-invertible dualities
provide both a generative mechanism for new QMBS and a diagnostic for their
stability.

TL;DR: The paper presents a study on symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy in the Moore-Read quantum Hall state using matrix product states, revealing an approximate equipartition of entanglement among symmetry sectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy in non-Abelian quantum states is crucial for unraveling their entanglement structure and has implications for topological quantum computing.

Method: Matrix product state techniques are employed for precise evaluation of symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies and full counting statistics for the Moore-Read state.

Result: Symmetry-resolved entanglement exhibits approximate equipartition among sectors, matching theoretical expectations and revealing the onset of finite-size corrections. The study validates the Li-Haldane conjecture with high precision by matching their predictions with the calculated entanglement spectrum.

Conclusion: This work deepens our understanding of symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy and its applicability in analyzing non-Abelian quantum states, providing insights into the entanglement structure and the validity of theoretical models in describing finite-size effects.

Abstract: Symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy provides a powerful framework for
probing the internal structure of quantum many-body states by decomposing
entanglement into contributions from distinct symmetry sectors. In this work,
we apply matrix product state techniques to study the bosonic, non-Abelian
Moore-Read quantum Hall state, enabling precise numerical evaluation of both
the full counting statistics and symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our
results reveal an approximate equipartition of entanglement among symmetry
sectors, consistent with theoretical expectations and subject to finite-size
corrections. The results also show that these expectations for
symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy remain valid in the case of a
non-Abelian state where the topological sectors cannot be distinguished by the
Abelian $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry alone, and where neutral and charged modes
possess distinct velocities. We additionally perform a detailed comparison of
the entanglement spectrum with predictions from the Li-Haldane conjecture,
finding remarkable agreement, and enabling a more precise understanding of the
effects of the distinct neutral and charged velocities. This not only provides
a stringent test of the conjecture but also highlights its explanatory power in
understanding the origin and structure of finite-size effects across different
symmetry sectors.

Abstract: Cold atom systems in optical lattices have long been recognized as an ideal
platform for bridging condense matter physics and quantum optics. Here, we
investigate the 1D fermionic superradiance in an optical lattice, and observe
novel tricritical phenomena and multistability in finite-temperature cases. As
a starting point, which can be analytically calculated, we compare the 1D and
2D Fermi gases in zero-temperature limit. It turns out that the tricritical
point originates from the higher-order Fermi surface nesting (FSN), and the
infrared divergence in 1D systems is absent in 2D cases. When extending to
finite-temperature cases, our numerical results reveal that both quantum- and
classical-type trcritical phenomena can be observed simultaneously. Moreover,
there exists an optimal temperature for observing superradiance. This work
provides a new approach to understanding the relation between quantum and
classical phase transitions.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates quantum relaxometry using diamond's NV centers to probe anisotropic spin dynamics in altermagnetic insulators, enabling directional sensing that distinguishes altermagnets from conventional antiferromagnets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about developing advanced quantum sensing methods using individual defects in diamond, specifically focusing on altermagnetic materials, which have unique spin dynamics that can now be probed with high sensitivity.

Method: The method involves using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to measure the spin relaxation rates of quantum impurities, analyzing how these rates vary with distance and orientation to infer spin diffusion and anisotropy in the material.

Result: The study reveals the ability to detect directional spin dynamics and momentum space anisotropy in altermagnetic insulators, which was previously unrecognized, providing a new tool for quantum materials research.

Conclusion: This breakthrough in quantum sensing offers new possibilities for studying spin transport and symmetry breaking in altermagnets, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of these materials and their potential applications in spintronics and quantum technologies.

Abstract: Quantum sensing with individual spin defects has emerged as a versatile
platform to probe microscopic properties of condensed matter systems. Here we
demonstrate that quantum relaxometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in
diamond can reveal the anisotropic spin dynamics of altermagnetic insulators
together with their characteristic spin polarised bands. We show that the
distance and orientation dependent relaxation rate of a nearby quantum impurity
encodes signatures of momentum space anisotropy in the spin diffusion response,
a hallmark of altermagnetic order. This directional sensitivity is
unprecedented in the landscape of quantum materials sensing, and it enables the
distinction of altermagnets from conventional antiferromagnets via local,
noninvasive measurements. Our results could spark new NV-sensing experiments on
spin transport and symmetry breaking in altermagnets, and highlight the role of
NV orientation to probe anisotropic phenomena in condensed matter systems.

Abstract: Microcavity exciton-polariton condensates under additional transverse
confinement constitute a flexible optical platform to study the coupling
mechanism between confined nonequilibrium and nonlinear states of matter.
Driven far from equilibrium, polariton condensates can display spontaneous
synchronization and instabilities depending on excitation and material
parameters, showcasing emergent and intricate interference patterns based on
mode competition over mutual gain landscapes. Here, we explore this coupling
mechanism between polariton condensates populating the first excited ${\it
p}$-state manifold of coupled optically trapped condensates and show a rich
structure of patterns based on excitation parameters. The optical
reconfigurability of the laser excitation patterns enables the creation of an
annular-shaped beam to confine polaritons in a tailored trapping potential,
whilst the dissipative nature of the optical traps enables effective
interaction with neighboring condensates. Our results underpin the potential
role of polariton condensates in exploring and simulating $\sigma$ and $\pi$
molecular bonding mechanisms between artificial two-dimensional diatomic
orbitals and beyond.

Abstract: The tenfold classification provides a powerful framework for organizing
topological phases of matter based on symmetry and spatial dimension. However,
it does not offer a systematic method for transitioning between classes or
engineering materials to realize desired topological properties. In this work,
we introduce a general method for designing topological materials by embedding
defects or spatial textures, which alter symmetry or dimension. This enables
controlled navigation across the tenfold table, allowing one to induce
topological phase transitions on demand. We illustrate this approach through
several nontrivial examples, demonstrating how local defects can generate
phases with different symmetries and topological invariants.

Abstract: Expanding the moir\'e material library continues to unlock novel quantum
phases and emergent electronic behaviors. In this work, we introduce PbI2 into
the moir\'e family and investigate the magnetotransport properties of moir\'e
superlattice in a hexagonal boron nitride/graphene/PbI2 heterostructures. In
high-field quantum Hall regime, we observe a robust dissipationless transport
at charge neutrality point, indicative of incompressible states stabilized at
the filling factor vh = 0. Additionally, a fractional conductance plateau at
2/3 e2/h emerges, which we attribute to a Chern junction between domains with
distinct Chern numbers originating from moir\'e-modulated and conventional
integer quantum Hall states. The moir\'e Hofstadter spectrum displays an
unconventional flavor sequence, likely influenced by proximity-induced
spin-orbit coupling from the PbI2 layer. We also see coherent electronic
interference along lines with Chern number vm = -2. These findings position
PbI2-based heterostructures as a versatile platform for realizing
spin-orbit-enhanced moir\'e phenomena and engineering coherent edge transport
in two-dimensional quantum materials.

Abstract: We investigate the transport of spin angular momentum and linear momentum
carried by magnons in electrically insulating collinear antiferromagnets (AFs).
Focusing on both transverse and longitudinal geometries, we model magnons as a
viscous fluid and explore the hydrodynamic transport regime that emerges when
the magnon-magnon scattering length is shorter than the momentum-relaxation
length, such that momentum-conserving processes dominate over momentum-relaxing
ones. We develop a theoretical framework to investigate viscous effects in the
magnon hydrodynamic regime, which give rise to measurable transport signatures
such as nonlocal resistance and spin and thermal conductance. Accounting for
both momentum and spin relaxations, we derive hydrodynamic equations governing
magnon momentum and spin transport. Notably, interspecies scattering between
antiferromagnetic magnons with opposite spin angular momentum induces drag-like
effects that strongly modify spin current propagation. We derive expressions
for magnon conductivity and introduce an accessibility parameter quantifying
intra-band momentum transfer. Our results establish antiferromagnetic
insulators as a promising platform for observing magnon-fluid dynamics and
exploring collective spin transport phenomena.

Abstract: It has been demonstrated that topological quantum spin Hall (QSH) state exist
in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. However, a
comprehensive theoretical characterization of the topological edge states
remains a topic of interest and an unresolved issue. Here, the topological
transport properties of the twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers are investigated. Beyond
the conventional single QSH, we identify emergent double and quartuple quantum
spin Hall states, hosting two and four pairs of counter-propagating helical
edge channels respectively. Furthermore, the charge carriers in these edge
states are not localized at edge but rather the high potential point of the
moire superlattice boundary, undergoing interlayer transitions and propagating
forward continuously. We term these edge states as moire edge states. These
edge states can survive in non-magnetic disorder, with the robustness of double
QSH states surpassing that of single QSH states. At a twisting angle of
2.45$^\circ$, the transition between the single and double QSH states can be
achieved by adjusting the gate on the surface. Based on this, we propose a
five-terminal device to as a topological current devider. Our findings provide
support for the development of dissipationless spintronics.

Abstract: Multiexcitons (MXs) in quantum dots (QDs) manifest many body interactions
under quantum confinement. Beyond this fundamental interest, MXs are of
importance in numerous optoelectronic applications including QD lasing, light
emitting diodes and photocatalysis. Yet, the strong interactions between MXs
leading to rapid non-radiative decay introduce challenges for their
characterization. While so far, the measurement techniques rely either on
indirect methods or on single particle studies, herein we introduce a new
method to study MXs in QD ensembles utilizing spectrally resolved time-gated
heralded spectroscopy. With this approach we extract the biexciton binding
energies in a series of CdSe/CdS QD ensembles of several core/shell sizes,
manifesting a transition between attractive and repulsive exciton-exciton
interactions. Additionally, for triexcitons, which involve occupation of two
excitons in the 1s energy levels, as well as one exciton in the 1p energy
levels, we address the open issues of isolating the spectra of the two
triexciton pathways from one another and from high-order MXs, and extract the
MX lifetimes. The measurements on ensembles provide high photon counts and low
noise levels, and alongside the time-gated heralded approach thus enable the
observation of MX characteristics that are difficult to resolve in single
particle studies. The approach can be further implemented in the
characterization of the energies and lifetimes of MXs in other QD systems to
enable rapid characterization and understanding of the MX properties. Such
insight bears relevance to optoelectronic applications ranging from lasing to
electroluminescent devices to quantum light sources.

TL;DR: Stacking two monolayer type-I QSHI results in a trivial insulator, but stacking two type-II QSHIs does not; instead, it forms a quantum spin Hall insulator with high spin Chern number. Similar properties can be extended to multilayer stacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about quantum spin Hall effects, exploring how different quantum spin Hall insulators behave upon stacking, which could have implications for future electronic applications and material design.

Method: Lattice model calculations and first-principles electronic structure calculations

Result: Stacking two type-II QSHIs results in a spin Hall insulator with high Chern number. Bilayer Nb2SeTeO is proposed as a type-II QSHI. Multilayer stacks enhance spin Hall conductance.

Conclusion: Stacking type-II QSHIs behaves differently from type-I and offers a pathway for high spin Hall conductance applications.

Abstract: Generally, stacking two monolayer type-I quantum spin Hall insulators gives
rise to a trivial insulator. However, whether or not stacking two type-II
quantum spin Hall insulators results in a trivial insulator has not yet been
explored. In this letter, based on the calculations of lattice model, we
demonstrate that stacking two type-II quantum spin Hall insulators does not
yield a trivial insulator, but instead forms a quantum spin Hall insulator with
high spin Chern number. In this phase, there are two pairs of topological edge
states with opposite chirality and polarization coexisting in the boundary. Our
calculations further reveal that the quantized spin Hall conductance of the
bilayer is twice that of the monolayer. When U(1) symmetry is present, the high
spin Chern number phase remains stable; when U(1) symmetry is broken, it
persists over a broad parameter range. Furthermore, based on the
first-principles electronic structure calculations, we propose that bilayer
Nb$_2$SeTeO is a type-II quantum spin Hall insulator with high spin Chern
number. Finally, extending this strategy to multilayer stacks naturally leads
to quantum spin Hall insulator with larger spin Chern number. Our work not only
deepens the distinction between type-I and type-II quantum spin Hall
insulators, but also offers a route toward realizing highly quantized spin Hall
conductance.

Abstract: We develop a unified theory of weakly probed differential observables for

this theory to various quantum dot systems, including multichannel Kondo,
quantum Hall and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev quantum dots, and demonstrate that each of
the microscopic theories is characterized by a set of universal relations
connecting conductance and thermoelectrics with noise. Violations of these

Abstract: We report the creation and characterization of a molecular-scale negative
differential conductance (NDC) device by assembling a triangular trimer of
4,5,9,10-tetrabromo-1,3,6,8-tetraazapyrene (TBTAP) molecules on a
superconducting Pb(111) substrate. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling
spectroscopy, we observe robust NDC behavior manifesting as a decrease in
current with increasing voltage between 0.7-0.9 V arising from the interplay of
Coulomb blockade and strong inter-molecular capacitive coupling within the
molecular cluster. Gate-controlled charging and discharging processes are
directly visualized via two-dimensional differential conductance mapping, which
reveals the emergence of Coulomb rings and spatial regions of NDC. Theoretical
modeling using a three-impurity Anderson model and master equation approach
quantitatively reproduces the experimental observations and demonstrates that
the NDC emerges purely from electron correlations, independent of the
underlying superconductivity. By tuning the geometry to a hexamer structure, we
further show that cluster topology provides versatile control over electronic
properties at the molecular scale. These results establish a functional
platform for implementing multifunctional molecular devices and highlight a
strategy toward programmable and scalable nanoelectronics.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for inertial spin-wave dynamics in
three-dimensional twisted soft-magnetic nanostrips, where curvature and torsion
couple with magnetic inertia to generate terahertz (THz) magnetic oscillations.
The resulting spin-wave spectra exhibit pronounced nonreciprocity due to
effective symmetry breaking arising from geometric chirality and inertial
effects. We show that this behavior is governed by a curvature-induced
geometric (Berry) phase, which we analytically capture through compact
expressions for dispersion relations and spectral linewidths in both nutational
(THz) and precessional (GHz) regimes. Topological variations, including
M\"obius and helical geometries, impose distinct wavenumber quantization rules,
elucidating the role of topology in spin-wave transport. These results position
twisted magnetic strips as a viable platform for curvilinear THz magnonics and
nonreciprocal spintronic applications.

Motivation: The paper tackles the issue of phase noise significantly affecting OFDM-based THz systems, especially with higher-order QAM like 64-QAM, which has high data rates and low spectrum usage. It's important for practical communication systems to manage phase noise effectively to avoid ICI and maintain orthogonality.

Method: The researchers analyzed a 64-QAM, 2048-subcarrier OFDM system with phase noise. They introduced 3σ-error estimation to quantify phase noise tolerance and used pilot-assisted techniques. They also benchmarked various oscillators and found that MRRs are effective in reducing phase noise impacts with minimal pilot overhead.

Result: The 3σ-error estimate indicated that phase noise tolerance was about 5%, which is a crucial figure for ensuring system performance. Additionally, MRRs were shown to be effective in enabling THz links with beyond 64-QAM, offering a good balance between phase noise and pilot overhead.

Conclusion: The study provides essential insights for optimizing THz wireless communication systems by managing phase noise through 3σ-error estimation and leveraging MRRs to reduce pilot overhead, thus enabling higher-order modulations and efficient spectral usage.

Abstract: THz wireless communications have garnered significant attention due to their
unprecedented data rates enabled by the abundant untapped spectrum. However,
advanced modulation formats beyond 64-QAM remain largely unexplored, as phase
errors introduced during up/down-conversion severely limit system performance.
Particularly, OFDM transmission is highly susceptible to aggravated ICI induced
by phase noise, undermining the orthogonality of subcarriers. While PLLs and
pilot-assisted compensation can mitigate phase errors, excessive pilot overhead
compromises spectral efficiency and energy consumption, and white phase noise
remains unrecoverable. Therefore, quantifying phase noise tolerance is
essential for practical physical layer protocols. Here, we reveal the impact of
phase noise in a 64-QAM, 2048-subcarrier OFDM THz transmission system.
3{\sigma}-error estimation is proposed to quantify phase noise tolerance,
indicating an intuitive EVM threshold of approximately 5%. This threshold
further delineates the trade-offs among phase noise levels, SNR requirements,
and pilot overhead. Moreover, by benchmarking representative oscillators with
distinct phase noise spectra, microring resonators (MRRs) are identified as
indispensable enablers for low-pilot-overhead OFDM THz links operating beyond
64-QAM.

TL;DR: This paper discussesnovel metamaterials for relativistic space propulsion, demonstrating a 5x reduction in mass and achieving 50% reflectivity. Results suggest potential for faster-than-light travel using conventional physics and advanced manufacturing. However, challenges such as integrating AI into the framework remain unresolved.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation appears to be exploring the feasibility of relativistic interstellar propulsion without requiring exotic physics. The authors aim to build upon existing research in sail designs, suggesting that this approach complements the use of AI in theoretical frameworks for space exploration.

Method: The paper uses a combination of experimental nanolaminate sail design, Kurtz-Mura etalon-based filter analysis, spectroscopy, and thermodynamics to measure reflectivity and other parameters of the sail films. They present a fabrication process based on semiconductor techniques.

Result: The results include ultra-low areal density, high reflectivity, and controlled absorptivity. The novel sail design shows promise for relativistic propulsion, but only within current physical constraints, without addressing potential AI or structural integration issues.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that relativistic interstellar travel using sail-based propulsion is feasible with their metalfilms, though challenges regarding AI, safety, and integration with theoretical frameworks remain. Future work will expand the analysis to include AI and assess practical mass and structural limitations.

Abstract: Achieving laser-driven, reflective, relativistic light sails would represent
a tremendous breakthrough for humankind, allowing us to advance our
understanding of the solar system and deep space far beyond what we know from
space probes, telescopes, and objects passing near Earth. Numerous sail film
designs have been proposed, but none have been demonstrated that satisfy all of
the stringent optical, mechanical, and mass budget constraints. Here we
overcome this challenge by experimentally demonstrating a novel class of
optically-optimized nanolaminate sails with strong and flexible
hexagonally-corrugated microstructures. Our prototypes, fabricated from alumina
and molybdenum disulfide using scalable semiconductor processing techniques,
feature ultra-low areal densities of <1 g/m^2 and achieve
experimentally-measured reflectivities of >50% and absorptivities of <4% within
the Doppler-shifted laser wavelength range corresponding to accelerating to a
fifth the speed of light. Moreover, we analyze reflectivity, strength, and mass
constraints to show that our sails have the potential to achieve greater
maximum velocities than other sail designs in the literature. Broadly, our
films mark a significant leap forward toward plausible relativistic
interstellar propulsion for intragalactic exploration

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Terahertz nonreciprocal devices rely on magnetic materials but have limitations. A new method uses temporal dissipative barriers and photoexcited carriers to achieve nonreciprocity without magnets. Experiments show isolation exceeding 20 dB on a 0.4 THz bandwidth.

Motivation: The paper addresses the need for improved THz devices without reliance on costly and limiting magnetic materials, aiming to advance technology for applications like communications and imaging.

Method: The method involves using temporal dissipative barriers, transient loss variation from photoexcited carriers, and distinct coupling behavior with the barrier to create nonreciprocity. It also introduces a dark mode to enhance isolation efficiency. The approach uses a metasurface platform.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant isolation efficiency, with experimental results showing over 20 dB and theoretical predictions exceeding 60 dB.&Motivation:The paper aims to overcome the limitations of current THz nonreciprocal devices by eliminating reliance on magnetic materials, a major issue in miniaturization and functionality.

Conclusion: This study opens new possibilities for the development of compact, integrated, and magnetic-free THz nonreciprocal devices, significantly advancing applications in science, communications, imaging, and sensing. The theoretical and experimental success paves the way for scalable and efficient devices in the future.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) nonreciprocal devices are essential for advancing future
fundamental science, wireless communications, imaging, and sensing. Current THz
nonreciprocal devices mostly rely on magnetic materials, which, however, suffer
from large volume, operation under an external magnetic field, and
low-temperature environment, rendering them poorly compatible with miniaturized
developments. Here,we propose an unconventional method for achieving THz
nonreciprocity free from magnetic materials. The scheme relies on a temporal
dissipative barrier, a transient loss variation generated by photoexcited
carriers, and the nonreciprocity arises from the distinct coupling behavior for
different polarizations with the barrier. The isolation efficiency correlates
with the temporal barrier width, resonant mode detuning, and the working
frequency, and has been significantly enhanced by introducing a dark mode. We
experimentally confirm our method in a THz optically active metasurface with
wave-flow isolation exceeding 20 dB across a bandwidth greater than 0.4 THz.
Theoretical predictions indicate peak isolation surpassing 60 dB, with
experimental results achieving over 30 dB at 0.7 THz. Our approach unlocks the
potential of miniaturized, integrated, magnetic-free THz nonreciprocal devices
for various applications.

Conclusion: 该框架为超薄光栅设计提供了一种新的解决方案，具有 broad applications potential。

Abstract: Metasurfaces are ultrathin, engineered materials composed of nanostructures
that manipulate light in ways unattainable by natural materials. Recent
advances have leveraged computational optimization, machine learning, and deep
learning to automate their design. However, existing approaches exhibit two
fundamental limitations: (1) they often restrict the model to generating only a
subset of design parameters, and (2) they rely on heavily downsampled spectral
targets, which compromises both the novelty and accuracy of the resulting
structures. The core challenge lies in developing a generative model capable of
exploring a large, unconstrained design space while precisely capturing the
intricate physical relationships between material parameters and their
high-resolution spectral responses. In this paper, we introduce MetaDiT, a
novel framework for high-fidelity metasurface design that addresses these
limitations. Our approach leverages a robust spectrum encoder pretrained with
contrastive learning, providing strong conditional guidance to a Diffusion
Transformer-based backbone. Experiments demonstrate that MetaDiT outperforms
existing baselines in spectral accuracy, we further validate our method through
extensive ablation studies. Our code and model weights will be open-sourced to
facilitate future research.

*Fahmy Yousry,Panu Hildén,Radoslaw Kolkowski,Andriy Shevchenko*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of higher-order modes in photonic integrated circuits to reduce crosstalk and improve chip dimensions in telecommunications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing importance of photonic devices in telecommunications and information processing but their limited widespread adoption due to physical size issues.

Method: Analyzes fundamental and higher-order modes in closely spaced straight and bent waveguides, proposes on-chip components for selective mode excitation, and designs directional couplers, splitters, and interferometers; also explores applications like optical interconnects, switches, transceivers, and phased arrays for LiDAR.

Result: Reduces crosstalk using higher-order modes, which effectively lowers chip dimensions.

Conclusion: Using higher-order modes can lead to more compact photonic chips with reduced crosstalk and enables various advanced components and systems.

Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits are gaining traction in the field of
telecommunications and information processing for their low-loss and
high-throughput data transmission in comparison to electronic integrated
circuits. However, they are still not used as widely as their electronic
counterparts due to a relatively large footprint of photonic chips. One
limiting factor to their size is the need to separate optical components by
distances on the order of the working wavelength or larger to minimize optical
crosstalk between them. In this work, we consider the fundamental and
higher-order modes in closely spaced straight and bent waveguides with
relatively small cross sections and find that higher-order modes allow one to
substantially reduce the crosstalk in both cases. This can be used to
considerably reduce the dimensions of photonic chips. We also propose on-chip
components that allow selective excitation of higher-order modes. In addition,
we design a directional coupler, a 3-dB splitter, and a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer capable of operating on higher-order modes. Other ultracompact
photonic-chip components, such as optical interconnects, switches,
transceivers, and phased waveguide arrays for on-chip LiDAR scanners, can be
designed as well based on similar principles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of EUV coherent sources is crucial for advanced nanoscale lithography and spectroscopy, offering potential in quantum materials research.

Method: The proposed RAPP strategy involves embedding a random phase grating into the crystal to compensate phase mismatches, achieving high efficiency in converting fundamental waves to third-harmonic waves.

Result: The RAPP method successfully demonstrated an 118nm EUV laser with over 90uW output power, marking the shortest wavelength achieved in solid-state lasers.

Conclusion: This breakthrough paves the way for next-generation EUV light sources, significantly advancing nonlinear optical materials and enabling new applications in quantum technology.

Abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) coherent sources below 120nm are of paramount
significance for promoting next-generation nano-scale lithography,precision
spectroscopy, and exploring the emerging physical phenomena in quantum
materials. Nonlinear optical conversion serves as the only feasible approach to
obtain solid state EUV lasers, yet the intrinsic strong absorption at EUV and
giant phase mismatch among light waves have hindered the realization of
highly-efficient EUV light sources. Herein, we propose a random additional
periodic phase (RAPP) strategy in third-order nonlinear crystals to overcome
these problems, that an artificially designed random phase grating at
micrometer-scales is embedded in the homogeneous bulk crystal, thus adaptively
compensating the phase mismatch between fundamental-wave and third-harmonic
waves. For the first time, the EUV laser at 118nm is demonstrated in the RAPP
lithium fluoride (LiF) crystals with wide period distributions, where the
highest output power is over 90uW. To the best our knowledge, this is the
shortest wavelength among all solid-state laser systems, which represents a
significant advance in nonlinear optical materials and opens new roadmap toward
high-brightness EUV sources.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for label-free sensing and hierarchical chirality applications in various fields.

Abstract: We introduce meta-diastereomers, hybrid systems where molecular chirality
($\leq 10$\,nm) and nanoscale chirality ($>100$\,nm) combine to create a new
hierarchical chiral state with emergent optical properties. By coupling chiral
biomolecules electrostatically with enantiomeric silicon nanostructures, we
demonstrate how distinct chiral systems can interact to produce optical
responses -- linear and circular dichroism -- that reflect the combined
chirality of both components. This unique interplay of chirality across scales
represents a conceptual advance in chiral nanophotonics. Importantly, we
leverage the meta-diastereomers to probe a model antibody-antigen interaction,
analogous to how molecular diastereomers are used in chemistry to investigate
chiral structures. This work establishes a platform for label-free, highly
specific detection of biomolecular interactions and opens new avenues for
exploring hierarchical chirality in optics, biosensing, and quantum
technologies.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach for designing and fabricating plasmonic nanocircuits using DNA origami. The modified structure achieves an unprecedented Q-factor and allows for precise control over molecular cargo, enhancing optical sensing applications significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper introduces an innovative method combining optical nanocircuit design with DNA origami for precise nanomanipulation and applications in molecular sensing and quantum optics.

Method: The authors developed a DNA origami platform for 3D plasmonic nanocircuits, integrating Au NPs and dye-coded circuit components. The approach combines theoretical modeling with practical experiments to assemble large nanocircuits with controlled symmetry and nanogaps.

Result: The nanocircuit achieves a Q-factor of ~19.2, which is the highest reported, and enables 100x stronger PRET signals compared to single nanoparticles.

Conclusion: This method provides enhanced precision and control for optical nanocircuit design, openingnew possibilities in nanophotonics research without relying on computationally intensive simulations.

Abstract: The optical nanocircuit concept provides a predictive framework analogous to
an electric RLC circuit, where induced dipoles in plasmonic nanoparticle (NPs),
ohmic losses in NPs, and dielectric gaps serve as inductors (L), capacitors
(C), and resistors (R), respectively. This modular theory allows unprecedented
design flexibility, expanding the range of achievable optical resonances in
plasmonic clusters. However, existing experimental approaches, such as atomic
force microscope tip-enabled nanomanipulation and electron-beam lithography,
lack the critical accuracy in nanogap tuning and molecular loading required for
applications like PRET. Here, we introduce a molecularly addressable optical
nanocircuit enabled by DNA origami. First, we theoretically and experimentally
confirmed that gold (Au) NPs and dye-loaded DNA origami can function as
different circuit elements: R- and C-coupled L and R-coupled C, respectively.
To assemble large Au NPs into designer optical nanocircuits, we utilized a
mechanically robust 3D DNA origami design rather than conventionally used 2D
origami sheet. This platform provided high reproducibility and accuracy in
assembling a range of structures-from dimers to tetramers-with controlled
symmetry, heterogeneity, and nanogap tunability. Together with ultrasmoothness
and uniformity of Au NPs, we achieved the highest Q-factor for magnetic
resonance of a nanoparticle-based optical nanocircuit (~19.2). Also, selective
molecular cargo loading onto designated 3D DNA origami sites within plasmonic
clusters enabled deterministic, predictive light-molecule coupling in optical
nanocircuits. This resulted in 100-fold stronger PRET signal in dimeric
clusters compared to monomeric NPs. Our approach opens promising directions in
designing custom optical resonances for use in molecular sensing, nonlinear
optics, and quantum photonics.

Result: Numerical optimization reveals a high-Q resonance, which significantly enhances the electric field, increasing modal gain and achieving a high-Purcell enhancement.

Conclusion: The study shows promising results for designing efficient nanolaser devices using TMDC materials and optimized nanobeam resonators with strong Purcell enhancement.

Abstract: We propose a nanobeam resonator incorporating an optically active monolayer,
designed to achieve a high Purcell enhancement. The resonator is fully composed
of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials and intended to operate as

the Purcell enhancement associated with the emission from atomically thin
layers is developed. This framework is based on a resonance expansion, enabling
spectral resolution of physical quantities governed by high-Q resonances. The
numerical optimization of the resonator leads to the presence of a high-Q

maximize the modal gain.

Motivation: The development of efficient terahertz absorbers is crucial for advancing communication systems, imaging technologies, and photonic devices. This paper addresses this need by presenting a VO2-based absorber optimized for ultra-broadband and polarization-insensitive performance, filling a gap in the field by offering a solution with both high efficiency and flexibility.

Method: The paper describes the absorber structure, which consists of a VO2 metasurface, a low-loss MF2 dielectric spacer, and a gold ground plane. They exploit the phase transition of VO2 for dynamic electromagnetic absorption. Full-wave simulations were used to validate the absorber's performance across the desired frequency range, polarization angles, and incidence conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed VO2-based design outperforms existing THz absorber designs in terms of bandwidth, efficiency, and simplicity, making it ideal for applications in THz sensing, imaging, communication, and adaptive photonic systems, positioning it as a promising platform for tunable and reconfigurable THz modules.

Abstract: This paper presents a VO2-based metamaterial absorber optimized for

3.35THz. The absorber maintains stable performance for varying polarization
angles and both TE and TM modes under oblique incidence. Impedance analysis
confirms strong matching to free space, reducing reflection and eliminating

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is achieving reliable and tunable white laser emission, particularly matching D65 standards, which is important for applications like Li-Fi and displays.

Method: Hierarchical design with spatially distributed dye layers in electrospun fiber mats, utilizing random lasing properties to enable multicolor and white laser outputs with controlled energy transfer.

Result: High spectral tunability, low deviation from D65, surpassing previous systems, and applicability in next-gen technologies.

Conclusion: This solution offers a promising approach for tunable lasers, enhancing various optical technologies.

Abstract: Random Lasing has become highly advantageous for achieving white laser
emission. Utilizing multiple light scattering in disordered media allows for
cost-effective and flexible designs, as well as the seamless integration of
multiple multicolor gain materials. However, generating light that closely
meets the D65 illumination standard remains challenging due to energy transfer
between chromophores. To address this issue, effective spatial separation of
gain media is required. Here, we present a solution to the problem using
hierarchically designed polymer fiber mats with spatially distributed red,
green, and blue (RGB) laser dyes to achieve controlled and tunable multicolor
and white lasing. While electrospun fibers are well-studied, their use for
multicolor random lasing is demonstrated here for the first time. Our results
demonstrate outstanding spectral tunability, aligning well with industrial
color standards such as sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3. The white lasing closely
matches D-series white illuminants, including D65, D55, and D75 standards, with
coordinate deviations as low as approximately 0.2 to 3%, surpassing previously
reported values for organic, hybrid, and inorganic systems. By limiting energy
transfer, our approach enables precise lasing control, demonstrating that fiber
mats are versatile for next-generation random lasing applications. These
findings advance technologies in Li-Fi, laser displays, optical sensors,
switches, and modulators, bringing tunable lasers closer to commercialization.

Abstract: We explore the late time cosmological dynamics of the Universe within the
framework of $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity by considering the specific form
$f(Q, \mathcal{L}_m)=-Q+2\mathcal{L}_m+\gamma$. To describe the cosmic pressure
evolution, a redshift dependent parametrization of $p(z)=\alpha+\frac{\beta
z}{1+z}$ is introduced. MCMC analysis is performed using a combined datasets
from Hubble ($46$ points), BAO ($15$ points including DESI DR2) and Pantheon$+$
($1701$ SNe Ia), the model parameters are constrained as
$H_{0}=67.9476^{+0.7534}_{-0.7523}$ (km/s/Mpc),
$\alpha=-0.0002^{+0.0211}_{-0.0208}$, $\beta=-0.0001^{+0.0410}_{-0.0404}$ and
$\gamma=0.0002^{+0.0599}_{-0.0602}$. The model predicts a transition from
deceleration to acceleration at $z_{tr} \approx 0.493$ with present values
$q_{0}=-0.255$ and $\omega_{0}=-0.9001$. The evolution of energy density and
pressure aligns with observational expectations. An analysis of energy
conditions shows that NEC and DEC are satisfied, while SEC is violated,
consistent with late time acceleration. Moreover, the slow roll parameters
$\epsilon_{1}$ and $\epsilon_{2}$ confirm a smooth inflationary regime. These
results demonstrate the capability of the model to unify early Universe
inflation with the current phase of cosmic acceleration.

Motivation: 研究中子星结构和演化，探索新物理对引力 waves和多镜天文学的影响

Method: 使用了动态的共形标量场模型，并求解了修正的TOV方程，分析了压力异向性和其他物理量的变化

Result: 中子星的最大质最为1.75±0.280 M_sun，半径约为11.35±1.11 km，标量场对变形率有显著影响，但不超出观测限制

Conclusion: 共形标量场能在不违反观测约束的情况下动态影响中子星结构，为未来引力波和多镜观测提供研究目标

Abstract: We investigate a chameleon scalar field dynamically interacting with a
Kiselev-type metric, where the static anisotropic fluid part of the metric is
replaced by a density-dependent scalar field non-minimally coupled to
curvature. This construction enables a transition from screened behavior in
high-density regions-where the scalar acquires an effective mass
m_\phi\propto\rho^1/2-to unscreened quintessence dynamics at large scales,
characterized by a critical screening radius r_\rm crit\propto m_\phi^-1. By
solving the modified TOV equations under spherical symmetry, we show that
radial scalar gradients \partial_r\phi induce pressure anisotropies \Delta
p\propto r^-1 in neutron star envelopes, while deviations from general
relativity are suppressed deep in the core r<r_\rm crit\sim 0.03\,\mathrm{km}
without destabilizing it. We further demonstrate that increasing the scalar
coupling \beta enhances scalar energy density, which counteracts anisotropic
pressure support and slightly reduces the maximum mass. The resulting (stable)
configurations yield maximum mass M_max\approx 1.75\pm0.280\,M_\odot and radii
R\approx11.35\pm1.11\,\mathrm{km}, consistent with conservative upper and lower
bounds from multimessenger observations. Scalar contributions induce a modest
suppression in the dimensionless tidal deformability \Lambda_\rm ST\Lambda_\rm
GR\sim0.137 at 1.4\,M_\odot i.e, 86% suppression compared to typical GR star,
falling well within the LIGO/Virgo range 70\lesssim\Lambda_1.4\lesssim 580.
These results demonstrate that environmentally screened scalar fields can
dynamically generate anisotropies and modify neutron star structure without
violating current astrophysical bounds. In particular, percent-level deviations
in compactness and tidal response provide falsifiable signatures of short-range
scalar forces, offering a novel target for next-generation GW and
multimessenger surveys.

### [124] [Four-scalar model and spherically symmetric solution in $f({\cal T})$ theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04758)
*G. G. L. Nashed,A. Eid*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Summary: The paper addresses the construction of spherically symmetric solutions in modified teleparallel gravity. It highlights limitations of existing mimetic gravity models and introduces a new four-scalar field approach that allows for arbitrary spherically symmetric spacetimes. The model successfully avoids ghost degrees of freedom and reconstructs physically viable solutions. Conclusion: This work advances our ability to construct consistent spacetime models in modified gravity theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper deals with challenges in constructing spherically symmetric solutions in modified gravity theories, which is of interest in theoretical physics and cosmology. The proposed approach contributes to overcoming limitations of existing models by introducing a more flexible framework with scalar fields.

Method: The researchers propose a four-scalar field model in $f({	cal T})$ gravity. They demonstrate that this model allows for arbitrary spherically symmetric spacetimes and avoids ghost degrees of freedom using Lagrange multipliers. Physical viability is shown through specific solutions with quadratic extensions.

Result: Construction of spherically symmetric spacetimes with four scalar fields enables ghost-free solutions and avoids the limitation of requiring linear gravity or constant torsion. The method successfully reconstructs viable solutions with quadratic actions.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for constructing consistent spacetime solutions in modified gravity, expanding beyond limitations of previous models.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the construction of spherically symmetric
solutions within the framework of modified teleparallel gravity, focusing in
particular on $f({\cal T})$ theory, where ${\cal T}$ represents the torsion
scalar. Conventional mimetic gravity and its extension with two scalar fields
are unable to reproduce general spherically symmetric geometries in $f({\cal
T})$ gravity, since consistency requires either a constant torsion scalar or a
linear form of $f({\cal T})$, which corresponds to the teleparallel equivalent
of General Relativity (TEGR). To overcome this restriction, we introduce a
four-scalar field formulation that generalizes the two-scalar model and enables
the realization of arbitrary spherically symmetric spacetimes. We further
demonstrate that the model avoids ghost degrees of freedom by imposing
appropriate constraints through Lagrange multipliers. As an application of the
formalism, we examine a specific spherically symmetric metric and determine the
corresponding four scalar fields, analyzing their properties. In the presence
of a quadratic extension of the action, ${\cal T} + \tfrac{\alpha}{2}{\cal
T}^2$, our approach successfully reconstructs physically viable solutions free
from ghost instabilities. These findings highlight the potential of
scalar-field-based constructions for generating consistent spacetime geometries
in modified gravity theories, thereby extending beyond the standard
formulations.

Conclusion: 旋转Kerr黑洞对气体吸积率和流体形态有轻微但非零的影响，尤其在自旋低阶近似下较好描述。

Abstract: We investigate the accretion of a collisionless, relativistic kinetic gas by
a rotating Kerr black hole, assuming that at infinity the state of the gas is
described by a distribution function depending only on the energy of the
particles. Neglecting the self-gravity of the gas, we show that relevant
physical observables, including the particle current density and the accretion
rates associated with the mass, the energy, and the angular momentum, can be
expressed in the form of closed integrals that can be evaluated numerically or
approximated analytically in the slow-rotation limit. The accretion rates are
computed in this manner for both monoenergetic particles and the
Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution and compared with the corresponding results in
the non-rotating case. Whereas it is shown that the angular momentum accretion
rate vanishes exactly, it is found that the rotation of the black hole has a
small but non-vanishing effect on the mass and the energy accretion rates,
which is remarkably well described by an analytic calculation in the
slow-rotation approximation to quadratic order in the rotation parameter. The
effects of rotation on the morphology of the accretion flow are also analyzed.

Result: 发现了新的提供更多自由度的新势，在太阳系测试中不受约束。

Conclusion: 标度依赖性引力为解决某些引力问题提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Scale-dependent gravity is an extension of general relativity in which the
Newton and cosmological constants may vary slightly with the energy scale due
to remnant low-energy quantum effects. A fundamental feature of this approach
is the scale-setting procedure. In a previous work by one of the authors, a
covariant expression for the scale, consistent with conservation laws, was
established. Here, we apply the full Will-Nordtvedt version of the
parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism to this framework, assuming that
the constants can be expressed as a power series in the scale. We find that a
new potential arises at the first post-Newtonian order, which is absent from
the standard PPN formalism. This potential modifies the definitions of pressure
and internal energy but does not affect center-of-mass orbits and is,
therefore, not constrained by Solar System tests.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work, we develop a generalization of Kaluza-Klein theory by
considering a purely affine framework, without assuming a prior metric
structure. We formulate the dimensional reduction using the geometry of
principal fiber bundles and the Ehresmann connection, introducing adapted bases
that allow an explicit decomposition of tensors, vectors, and connections. This
formalism provides a natural geometric definition of the electromagnetic field
as the difference between the horizontal space and the space generated by the
observer's frame. We demonstrate that the presence of a nontrivial
electromagnetic field requires the non-integrability of the horizontal
distribution, and we derive a complete ansatz for decomposing the affine
connection into fields defined on the reduced space. Under assumptions such as
vanishing torsion, autoparallel fibers, and suitable normalization conditions,
we show that the reduced theory corresponds to the Einstein-Maxwell system for
purely radiative electromagnetic fields. Furthermore, we propose an
interpretation where the metric emerges dynamically from the affine structure
through the dynamics of the electromagnetic field.

### [128] [A new class of rotating charged black holes with non-aligned electromagnetic field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04850)
*Hryhorii Ovcharenko,Jiří Podolský*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new family of charged, accelerating black hole solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations. These solutions involve twisting and expanding spacetimes with non-aligned principal null directions, described in Boyer-Lindquist-type coordinates with several free parameters. The solutions can reduce to known black holes under specific limits and include new types like Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson. The metric is well-parameterized, and the physical interpretations are outlined.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of black hole solutions in general relativity, particularly those with electromagnetic fields and various symmetries, is fundamental for understanding spacetime and gravitational physics. This paper extends the known solutions by introducing new parameters and considering non-aligned electromagnetic fields, potentially offering new insights into black hole dynamics and spacetime structures.

Method: The authors likely used a generalization and analysis of the Einstein-Maxwell field equations, assuming algebraic type D spacetimes with specific conditions on the principal null directions, methodically deriving the new solution class and its parameters.

Result: The discovery of a new class of charged, accelerating black holes with electromagnetic fields not aligned with the spacetime's principal null directions. The solutions are found in Boyer-Lindquist-type coordinates and encompass both standard and novel subclasses under varying parameter limits.

Conclusion: This research advances the theoretical framework of charged black holes by expanding the solution set to include twisting, expanding, and charged spacetimes with electromagnetic fields' principal null directions not aligned with those of the Weyl tensor. The multi-parameter solution provides a comprehensive model for various gravitational and electromagnetic field configurations.

Abstract: We present a large family of twisting and expanding solutions to the
Einstein-Maxwell equations of algebraic type D, for which the two double
principal null directions (PNDs) of the Weyl tensor are not aligned with the
null eigendirections of the Faraday tensor. In addition to systematically
deriving this new class, we present its various metric forms and convenient
parameterizations. We show that in Boyer-Lindquist-type coordinates these
solutions depend on 7 parameters, namely the Kerr and NUT
(Newman-Unti-Tamburino) twist parameters $a$ and $l$, mass parameter $m$,
acceleration $\alpha$, strength of the Maxwell field $|c|$, and angular
parameters $\beta, \gamma$ that represent two duality rotations of the Faraday
tensor, which include the rotation between the electric and magnetic charges
generating the aligned part of the Maxwell field. This coordinate
parameterization, analogous to the Griffiths-Podolsk\'y form of the
Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solutions, allows us to perform various limits,
explicitly identify the subcases, and determine the physical interpretation of
the new class. Interestingly, by considering the limit with no acceleration
($\alpha\to 0$), one obtains either the famous Kerr-Newman-NUT black holes (if
the parameter $|c|$ remains constant) or the novel Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black
holes, announced recently in our work arXiv:2507.05199 (if $|c|\rightarrow
\infty$ while $\alpha |c|=\mathrm{const.}$). We may thus conclude that this new
class of spacetimes represents twisting charged accelerating black holes,
immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field. In the non-twisting
subcase, we obtain the previously known solutions of Alexeev-Garcia and Van den
Bergh-Carminati.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As gravitational wave astronomy has entered an era of routine detections, it
becomes increasingly important to precisely measure the physical parameters of
individual events and infer population properties. Eccentricity is a key
observable, suggesting that binaries form in a dense stellar environment
through dynamical encounters. This work performs the first matched-filtering
search for gravitational waves from eccentric binary black holes (BBHs)
covering the mass range $[5, 200]~M_\odot$ and eccentricity at 20 Hz up to 0.5
with a newly developed effective-one-body waveform model. Throughout the third
observation run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, we identify 28 BBH events with a
false alarm rate below once per 100 yr; all of which were previously reported
in the GWTC-3 and 4-OGC catalogs. Additional candidates with false alarm rates
between once per 1 and 100 yr are also reported. We perform an injection
campaign to characterize the sensitive volume time of our search pipeline.
Assuming that none of the eccentric BBH events were missed by previous
searches, our results provide constraints on the event rate of eccentric BBHs
in the mass range [5, 30] $M_\odot$. For a 30-30 $M_\odot$ BBH with
eccentricity 0.5, the event rate is limited to less than 0.06 Gpc$^{-3}$
yr$^{-1}$; this marks an order of magnitude improvement for sensitive volume
compared with the previous search with a minimally modeled algorithm without
using templates.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates periodic orbits around a magnetically charged black hole using nonlinear electrodynamics. The NED charge parameter significantly affects orbital dynamics, reducing both marginally bound and innermost stable orbits. Gravitational waveforms from extreme mass ratio inspirals are shown to be influenced by this charge parameter, suggesting future observations could constrain MCBH properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation is in understanding how the charge parameter from NED influences orbital dynamics around MCBHs, which has implications for gravitational wave observations.

Method: The study uses general relativity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics and periodic orbit analysis, examining the effects of the NED charge parameter on particle orbits and resulting waveforms.

Result: The NED charge parameter reduces the radii of MBOs and ISCOs, leading to altered zoom-whirl behavior and significant changes in gravitational waveforms from EMRIs.

Conclusion: This research contributes to gravitational wave astronomy by indicating how nonlinear electrodynamics may modify observed signals from MCBHs, offering a new perspective on testing astrophysical theories with GW data.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate periodic orbits exhibiting zoom-whirl behavior
around a magnetically charged black hole (MCBH) within the framework of
nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). We examine how the NED charge parameter
influences orbital dynamics by modifying the background spacetime geometry,
thereby affecting the energy and angular momentum of particles. In particular,
we calculate the radii of the marginally bound orbits (MBOs) and innermost
stable circular orbits (ISCOs), demonstrating that the NED charge parameter
reduces both radii. This provides valuable insight into the role of the charge
parameter in shaping orbital behavior and altering spacetime geometry. We model
the complex motion of a stellar-mass object, as a timelike particle,
inspiraling into a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the MCBH background, with
its trajectory described using periodic geodesic orbits. Based on this analysis
of such periodic orbits, we further analyze the gravitational waveforms
generated by extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which the SMBH's
spacetime dominates the dynamics of the stellar-mass object. By combining
particle trajectory analysis with waveform modeling in a semi-analytical, we
show that the charge parameter arising from NED significantly alters the
zoom-whirl orbital dynamics and induces notable changes in the waveform
structure. These results illustrate that future gravitational wave (GW)
observations may constrain the properties of MCBHs, thereby deepening our
understanding of the gravitational imprint of nonlinear electrodynamics.

*Yong Xiao,Qiang Wang,Aonan Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper establishes a universal equality governing Euclidean integrals of gravitational actions in higher-derivative theories and applies it to black holes in various spacetimes and matter-gravity systems, finding violations under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring gravitational theories and their implications for thermodynamics and spacetime behavior is a fundamental area in theoretical physics. Understanding the applicability and limitations of such theories helps in identifying physical constraints and potential issues in cosmological and astrophysical contexts.

Method: The paper uses Euclidean path integral techniques combined with asymptotic analysis, regularization methods, and perturbative expansions to derive the universal equality and test its validity in different scenarios.

Result: The study shows that the universal equality holds for asymptotically flat and AdS black holes but fails in matter-gravity coupled systems when matter exhibits divergent behavior at the horizon or non-decaying profiles at infinity.

Conclusion: The findings impose significant constraints on gravitational thermodynamics and provide tools to detect problematic matter configurations in gravitational theories, enhancing our understanding of black hole physics and the validity of higher-derivative gravity models.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a universal equality governing Euclidean
integrals of gravitational actions in higher-derivative theories. This relation
is shown to hold universally for asymptotically flat black holes in pure
gravity, and is generalized to asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes
through appropriate regularization. We further examine its validity in systems
with matter-gravity coupling, identifying that violations occur only when
matter fields exhibit pathological behaviors: divergence at the horizon or
non-decaying profiles at infinity. These findings reveal fundamental
constraints on gravitational thermodynamics and provide diagnostic tools for
identifying ill-behaved matter configurations.

Motivation: 探讨恒星、星系和宇宙的结构是否可能以某种规范的方式来重新定义，特别是在Cosmology和 wormholes领域。或许，这方面的探索有助于我们对时空机制有更好的理解。

Result: 通过标量场和调整动能项、势来构造时空模型，发现这些时空中的标量场作为'幽灵'存在，但通过引入细小的调整或约束，可以消除这种'幽灵'的影响。特别在f(R)重力下，可以构造不含幽灵标量场的正则时空。

Conclusion: 基于Simpson-Visser方法，研究了正则时空模型，分析了标量场作为幽灵存在的现象，并探索了在修正引力下的应用，展示了如何在不同框架下构建没有奇点或其他问题的正则时空中。

Abstract: Some novel regular spacetimes are considered that show a non-stationary
wormhole structure. A Simpson-Visser-like procedure is applied to reconstruct
these regular spacetimes, free of time-like and space-like singularities. Such
a procedure is also applied to describe a regular cosmological expansion, where
the universe reaches a minimum scale and then rebounds. This type of regular
spacetime is achieved by considering some scalar fields as sources, with the
appropriate kinetic term and scalar potential. We show that all these sources
turn out to be ghosts due to the wrong sign of the kinetic term. These ghosts
can, however, be eliminated by constraints. Nevertheless, the same procedure is
also explored in the framework of modified gravities, particularly within the
so-called f(R) gravity, where a new wormhole spacetime is also obtained that
does not require a ghost scalar field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation explores the impact of charge on particle phase and interference patterns in gravitational lensing, assuming this could offer new insights into determining masses independently.

Method: The methodology involves deriving the phase for neutral particles in the Reissner-Nordstrom metric, analyzing interference for particles on different trajectories, and plotting the resulting patterns.

Result: The phase and interference patterns are found to be influenced by charge, introducing significant oscillation shifts that allow independent mass determination.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that charge effects are measurable and could aid in determining particle masses independently of each other.

Abstract: We derive the phase acquired by a neutral scalar particle propagating along
Reissner-Nordstrom geodesics. Considering two flavours propagating on different
trajectories which intersect, we plot the interference pattern induced by
gravitational lensing from the charged compact object. Although the effect of
the charge is subdominant in the metric, it proves to be significant in the
phase, and shifts the interference pattern, compared to the Schwarzschild case.
This pattern is characterised by two oscillation lengths which, if known, would
allow the determination of both eigen masses independently.

TL;DR: The paper discusses improving the efficiency of quantum-state detection for ionized molecules, specifically ^{232}ThF+ ions.

Motivation: The researchers aim to enhance their ability to detect quantum states of ions for precision experiments, such as studying the electron's electric dipole moment. This is important for fundamental physics research.

Method: Spectroscopy is employed to identify excited states. They optimized for the most favorable transition, achieving 57% dissociation efficiency with detectable selectivity. Additionally, they propose state detection protocols to monitor multiple states simultaneously.

Result: 57% dissociation efficiency and quantum state selectivity is achieved. Future work aims to further improve efficiency and enable simultaneous detection of all relevant states for better statistical results.

Conclusion: Improved methods for quantum-state detection are presented, utilizing spectroscopy and optimized excited states. These advancements will enhance precision in experiments targeting fundamental particles like the electron's electric dipole moment.

Abstract: Efficient quantum-state detection is crucial for many precision control
experiments, such as the ongoing effort to probe the electron's electric dipole
moment using trapped molecular $^{232}\mathrm{ThF}^+$ ions at JILA. While
quantum state detection through state-selective photodissociation has been
successfully implemented on this molecule, progress has been hindered by low
dissociation efficiency. In this work, we perform spectroscopy on the molecule
to identify excited states that facilitate more efficient photodissociation.
For the most favorable transition, we achieve a dissociation efficiency of
57(14)% with quantum state selectivity. Additionally, we discuss several state
detection protocols that leverage favorable excited states that will facilitate
simultaneous readout of all EDM relevant states, allowing further improvement
of overall statistics.
