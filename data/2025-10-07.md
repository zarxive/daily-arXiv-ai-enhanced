Abstract: Mode-locked lasers (MLLs) are essential for a wide range of photonic
applications, such as frequency metrology, biological imaging, and
high-bandwidth coherent communications. The growing demand for compact and
scalable photonic systems is driving the development of MLLs on various
integrated photonics material platforms. Along these lines, developing MLLs on
the emerging thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform holds the promise to
greatly broaden the application space of MLLs by harnessing TFLN 's unique
electro-optic (E-O) response and quadratic optical nonlinearity. Here, we
demonstrate the first electrically pumped, self-starting passive MLL in lithium
niobate integrated photonics based on its hybrid integration with a GaAs
quantum-well gain medium and saturable absorber. Our demonstrated MLL generates
4.3-ps optical pulses centered around 1060 nm with on-chip peak power exceeding
44 mW. The pulse duration can be further compressed to 1.75 ps via linear
dispersion compensation. Remarkably, passive mode-locking occurs exclusively at
the second harmonic of the cavity free spectral range, exhibiting a high pulse
repetition rate $\sim$20 GHz. We elucidate the temporal dynamics underlying
this self-starting passive harmonic mode-locking behavior using a
traveling-wave model. Our work offers new insights into the realization of
compact, high-repetition-rate MLLs in the TFLN platform, with promising
applications for monolithic ultrafast microwave waveform sampling and
analog-to-digital conversion.

Conclusion: Pre-fabricated diamond resonators can effectively create defects without degrading their optical properties.

Abstract: A key challenge for quantum photonic technologies based on spin qubits is the
creation of optically active defects in photonic resonators. Several of the
most promising defects for quantum applications are hosted in diamond, and are
commonly created through ion implantation and annealing at high temperatures
and high vacuum. However, the impact of annealing on photonic resonator quality
factor, a critical parameter governing their coupling to defects, has not been
reported. In this work, we characterize the effect of annealing at temperatures
>1200{\deg}C in high vacuum on the quality factors of diamond microdisk
resonators. We investigate the optical losses associated with a non-diamond
layer formed during annealing, and use Raman spectroscopy to analyze the
resonator surface morphology and demonstrate that tri-acid cleaning can restore
their optical quality factors. These results show the viability of creating
defects in pre-fabricated diamond resonators without degrading their optical
properties.

Abstract: This work seeks to present an investigation about the trajectories followed
by rays of light passing through refractive index gradients that was entirely
carried by high school students. Such trajectories are curved, therefore
contradicting the common sense that light should always travel along straight
lines. This fact causes the formation of distorted and striated images,
similarly to a type of mirage known as Fata Morgana. Using a rectangular
aquarium containing solutions with different gradients of sugar or water with a
temperature gradient, we analyzed the conditions for image inversion to occur.
Also, we were able to reconstruct a distorted image through our theoretical
predictions.

Abstract: Image projection systems must be efficient in data storage, computation and
transmission while maintaining a large space-bandwidth-product (SBP) at their
output. Here, we introduce a hybrid image projection system that achieves
extended depth-of-field (DOF) with improved resolution, combining a
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based digital encoder with an all-optical
diffractive decoder. A CNN-based encoder compresses input images into compact
phase representations, which are subsequently displayed by a low-resolution
(LR) projector and processed by an analog diffractive decoder for all-optical
image reconstruction. This optical decoder is completely passive, designed to
synthesize pixel super-resolved image projections that feature an extended DOF
while eliminating the need for additional power consumption for super-resolved
image reconstruction. Our pixel super-resolution (PSR) image projection system
demonstrates high-fidelity image synthesis over an extended DOF of ~267xW,
where W is the illumination wavelength, concurrently offering up to ~16-fold
SBP improvement at each lateral plane. The proof of concept of this approach is
validated through an experiment conducted in the THz spectrum, and the system
is scalable across different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This image
projection architecture can reduce data storage and transmission requirements
for display systems without imposing additional power constraints on the
optical decoder. Beyond extended DOF PSR image projection, the underlying
principles of this approach can be extended to various applications, including
optical metrology and microscopy.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Equilateral triangular waveguides are one of the very few special kind of
waveguides, whose field solutions can be constructed without necessarily
solving the Maxwell's equations. Solutions can be obtained simply by
superposing some plane wave solutions and requiring the solutions to obey the
necessary boundary conditions for each modes, as would be expected of any
Maxwell equation's solution or that of any Helmholtz equation resulting from
the problem of Heat flow, membrane vibrations, etc. In fact, this was how one
of the earlier solutions or eigen functions found by Gabriel Lam\'e, were
obtained. Julian Schwinger, performed the same analysis, but used the
superposition of complex exponential functions, in order to obtain the eigen
functions of an equilateral triangular waveguide. The solutions exhibit other
special symmetric properties that leave their solutions invariant and these
special symmetries and applications, are what we investigate in this work,
particularly as it relates to their attenuation characteristics and quality
factors. Finally, by employing the number theory of Eisenstein integers or
primes we have obtained a well ordered and more rigorous eigenvalues of the
equilateral triangular waveguides, which is definitely something missing in the
literature.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Electronic correlations occur on attosecond timescales, dictating how
chemical bonds form, energy flows, and materials respond to light. Capturing
such many-body processes requires light pulses of similar duration. The soft
X-ray water window is vital because it encompasses the principle absorption
edges of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen that underpin chemistry, biology, and
materials science. However, generating and characterising isolated attosecond
pulses that reach into the soft X-ray water window has remained a challenge. We
addressed this need and report an isolated attosecond soft X-ray pulse with a
duration of 19.2 attoseconds. This pulse reaches into the water window and is
shorter than the atomic unit of time (24.2 as). The pulse is supported by a
spectrum centred at 243 eV, extending up to 390 eV, and crossing the carbon
K-edge with record photon flux: 4.8x10$^10$ photons per second overall and
4.1x10$^9$ photons per second in a 10% bandwidth at the carbon K-shell edge
(284 eV). Such an extremely short soft X-ray pulse combines extreme temporal
resolution with a coherent ultrabroadband soft X-ray spectrum, opening new
opportunities to study electron dynamics in atoms, molecules, and solids,
disentangle many-body interactions in correlated systems, and follow
non-adiabatic energy flow in molecular complexes. Our results establish a new
benchmark for table-top attosecond technology and lay the foundation for its
widespread application in science and technology.

Motivation: Understanding the properties of ZnSe:Fe²⁺ and its Mg-substituted variants could lead to advancements in laser technology.

Method: Binary ZnSe:Fe²⁺ crystals and Mg-substituted Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}Se:Fe²⁺ crystals were grown using the vertical Bridgman method in graphite crucibles under high argon pressure. Structural, energetic, and optical properties were characterized and compared.

Result: With increasing Mg concentration, a red-shift in the absorption and emission spectra was observed. Theoretical models explain this red-shift in terms of electronic structure changes due to increased solubility of Mg²⁺ in ZnSe.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of Fe²⁺ luminescence in ZnSe-based systems, which is relevant for the development of new laser materials with tailored optical properties.

Abstract: In this study, binary $ZnSe:Fe^{2+}$ crystals and ternary
$Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}Se:Fe^{2+}$ crystals $(0 < x < 0.6)$ were grown by the vertical
Bridgman method in graphite crucibles under high argon pressure. A comparative
characterization of the structural, energetic, and optical parameters of the
obtained crystals was performed. Theoretical explanations of the observed
experimental characteristics, including the specific red-shift of the
absorption and emission spectra with increasing solid-solution concentration,
are provided. These results could be useful for the development of new laser
media based on simple and complex AIIBVI crystals and for targeted engineering

*Keren Wang,Kaili Sun,Jing Du,Peijuan Dai,Hao Zhou,Lujun Huang,Zhanghua Han,Wei Wang*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Nonlocal metasurfaces are optimized for generating momentum-space optical vortices, but high-quality factor resonances inherently limit their performance, resulting in narrowband and inefficient operation. This paper proposes a novel reflection-type nonlocal metasurface that hybrid-couples a bound state in the continuum (BIC) with two degeneracy points (DPs), enabling on-demand control of dispersion, radiative Q-factors, and polarization states of guided resonances. This design achieves quasi-flat dispersion and enhanced scattering strength, with full-wave simulations predicting near-unity on-resonance conversion and efficiencies above 90%. Experimental results confirm a bandwidth expansion from 1480 to 1600 nm, achieving peak efficiency approaching 80% and OAM purity up to 91.7%. The concept is demonstrated for direct conversion of zero-order Bessel beams into OAM Bessel beams, highlighting its potential in high-dimensional optical communications, advanced imaging, and quantum photonics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to address the challenge of achieving high-efficiency and broadband operation in optical vortex generation, which is crucial for advancing fields such as high-dimensional optical communications, advanced imaging, and quantum photonics.

Method: The researchers developed a reflection-type nonlocal metasurface by hybrid-coupling a bound state in the continuum (BIC) with two degeneracy points (DPs). Full-wave simulations and experiments were conducted to validate the design's performance.

Result: The results demonstrate significant improvements over conventional designs, including a three- to fourfold efficiency improvement, more than fifteenfold bandwidth expansion, and successful conversion of zero-order Bessel beams into OAM Bessel beams under various illumination conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed reflection-type nonlocal metasurface represents a promising advancement in the field of optical vortex generation, offering high efficiency, scalable bandwidth, and versatility across diverse applications.

Abstract: Nonlocal metasurfaces provide a compact route to generating momentum-space
optical vortices but are limited by steep dispersion typically associated with
high-quality (Q) factor resonances, resulting in narrowband and inefficient
operation. Here, we introduce a reflection-type nonlocal metasurface that
hybrid-couples a bound state in the continuum (BIC) with two degeneracy points
(DPs). This engineered interaction enables on-demand control of dispersion,
radiative Q-factors, and polarization states of guided resonances, yielding
quasi-flat dispersion and enhanced scattering strength. Full-wave simulations
predict near-unity on-resonance conversion and overall efficiencies above 90%,
representing a three- to fourfold efficiency improvement and more than
fifteenfold bandwidth expansion over conventional designs. Experiments confirm
broadband operation from 1480 to 1600 nm, achieving peak efficiency approaching
80% and orbital angular momentum (OAM) purity up to 91.7% under flat-top
illumination, while suppressing edge effects and mitigating positional
sensitivity and numerical-aperture (NA) dependence. As a proof of concept, we
demonstrate direct conversion of zero-order Bessel beams into OAM Bessel
(perfect vortex) beams with enhanced wavelength tunability, underscoring the
versatility of this approach over diverse illumination conditions. This
record-high performance establishes a practical and scalable pathway toward
broadband, high-efficiency vortex generation, opening new opportunities across
high-dimensional optical communications, advanced imaging, and quantum
photonics.

*Mohammad Tahsin Alam,Zafrin Jahan Nikita,Ying Yin Tsui,Md. Zahurul Islam*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper presents a cost-effective and efficient method for designing ultrasubwavelength plasmonic nanolasers with tunable emission in the NIR region by incorporating surface plasmon modes and distributed Bragg reflectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plasmonic nanolasers with tunable emission are crucial for next-generation integrated photonic and quantum devices. Current limitations include high-order diffraction and multiple far-field modes, which hinder lasing efficiency.

Method: The approach involves using Tamm surface plasmon modes at a metal-distributed Bragg reflector interface to enhance lasing efficiency. A pump pulse excites these modes through a metallic nanohole array, and two distributed Bragg reflectors are used to suppress backward emission and enhance forward lasing. The combination of Tamm plasmon excitation and dual-DBR feedback improves cavity response and lasing efficiency.

Result: The proposed nanolasers achieve lasing in the NIR region with wide tunability and enhanced efficiency, offering potential for applications in on-chip photonic and quantum technologies.

Conclusion: This method provides a scalable and versatile solution for overcoming challenges in plasmonic nanolasers, paving the way for their use in advanced integrated optical systems.

Abstract: Plasmonic resonances attract significant interest due to their ability to
tightly confine electromagnetic fields. Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and
localized surface plasmons (LSPs) are widely used in plasmonic nanolasers, but
performance is often affected by coupling into reflective and transmissive
directions and multiple far-field modes, mainly due to higher-order diffraction
from the plasmonic crystal. Here, we utilize the Tamm plasmon mode at the
interface between a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) and a metal layer to
achieve lasing in the NIR region with wide tunability. Optical Tamm states are
excited at the metal-DBR interface by a pump pulse, and emission is enhanced
via extraordinary optical transmission through a metallic nanohole array, which
suppresses higher-order diffraction and ensures a directional far-field
pattern. A second DBR beneath the pump side further suppresses backward
emission and enhances forward lasing intensity. The combination of Tamm plasmon
excitation and dual-DBR feedback improves cavity response and overall lasing
efficiency. This approach provides a cost-effective and versatile route to
plasmonic nanolasers with enhanced efficiency, tunability, and integration
potential for next-generation on-chip photonic and quantum technologies.

Abstract: Metasurfaces provide a compact, flexible, and reliable solution for
controlling the wavefront of light. In imaging systems, micro-lens arrays are
integrated with pixel matrices to reduce optical crosstalk, enhance photon

the increasing impact of diffraction at small pixel sizes. Despite their design
versatility, our findings reveal the necessity of accounting for fundamental
diffraction properties to optimize the performance of miniature optical

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Localized quantum emitters in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have
recently emerged as solid-state candidates for on-demand sources of single
photons. Due to the role of strain in the site-selective creation of TMD
emitters, their hybrid integration into photonic structures such as cavities
and waveguides is possible using pick-and-place methods. Here we investigate
quantum emission from a hybrid structure consisting of a monolayer of WSe2
interfaced with horizontally aligned InP nanowires (NWs). Our experiments
reveal multiple narrow and bright emission peaks in the 715-785 nm spectral
range and g(2)(0) as low as 0.049, indicating strong antibunching and good
single photon purity. The faceted nature of III-V NWs provides unique
opportunities for strain engineering, including the potential for placement of
emitters on the top surface for optimal coupling. Our findings pave the way for
realizing hybrid quantum light sources for integrated quantum photonics that
could combine III-V quantum dots with TMD emitters into a single platform.

beam, to steer micro-objects effectively. By establishing a one-to-one
correspondence between control beam parameters (e.g., phase/polarization of a
plane wave) and particle trapping positions, our method enables real-time and
versatile control of particles. A wide range of two- and three-dimensional
trajectories -- including circles, squares, tree-like paths, and
epicycle-deferent curves -- can be achieved solely by modulating the phase of
the control beam. This design strategy for the structured-light environments
offers a dynamically reconfigurable, all-optical, and contact-free platform for
advanced optical manipulation in free space, with promising applications in
nanorobotics, biological probing, and beyond.

*Robert Klas,Martin Gebhardt,Jan Rothhardt,Jens Limpert*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified framework connecting microscopic and macroscopic dynamics in high harmonic generation to optimize XUV and soft X-ray sources with tunable lasers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advances in lasers enable tuning wavelength, power, and pulse duration, offering opportunities to enhance HHG-based sources for both fundamental and applied sciences.

Method: The study introduces a scaling law for the single-atom dipole moment under phase-matching conditions, correlated with macroscopic performance metrics. It evaluates the impact of pulse duration on efficiency and identifies key limitations such as carrier-envelope-phase walk-off.

Result: A 1/t dependence of the single-atom dipole moment at 515 nm is established. This scaling law is used to predict macroscopic conversion efficiency, with experiments confirming the predictions and highlighting scenarios where short pulses are advantageous.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical guidelines for designing HHG sources capable of achieving Watt-level average power and extended spectral reach, significantly advancing XUV and soft X-ray technologies.

Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) is a crucial technology for compact,
high-brightness extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and soft X-ray sources, which are key
to advancing both fundamental and applied sciences. The availability of
advanced driving lasers, with tunable wavelength, power, and pulse duration,
opens new opportunities for optimizing HHG-based sources. While scaling laws
for wavelength are well understood, this work focuses on how pulse duration
impacts HHG efficiency and introduces a unified framework that links
microscopic dynamics to macroscopic performance. We establish a practical
scaling law for the single-atom dipole moment under phase-matching conditions,
demonstrating a 1/t dependence at 515 nm wavelength. By connecting this
microscopic scaling to macroscopic conversion efficiency, we provide clear
guidelines for optimizing HHG output across different gases and driving
wavelengths. Furthermore, we identify fundamental constraints, including the
carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) walk-off, which limits efficiency at longer driver
wavelengths and becomes especially significant for very short pulses. All
predictions are based on simple, accessible formulas, eliminating the need for
complex numerical simulations. Experiments confirm these predictions and
highlight when short pulses are advantageous, particularly in scenarios where
CEP walk-off and absorption effects are minimized. These findings offer
practical principles for designing next-generation HHG sources, capable of
Watt-level average power and extended spectral reach, enabling more versatile
and powerful HHG-based XUV and soft X-ray sources.

Conclusion:  Free-space optical computing offers a promising alternative for AI by utilizing spectral advantages to process information efficiently and achieve robust classification with enhanced accuracy.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved into a critical technology;
however, electrical hardware struggles to keep pace with the exponential growth
of AI models. Free space optical hardware provides alternative approaches for
large-scale optical processing, and in-memory computing, with applications
across diverse machine learning tasks. Here, we explore the use of broadband
light scattering in free-space optical components, specifically complex media,
which generate uncorrelated optical features at each wavelength. By treating
individual wavelengths as independent predictors, we demonstrate improved
classification accuracy through in-silico majority voting, along with the
ability to estimate uncertainty without requiring access to the model's
probability outputs. We further demonstrate that linearly combining
multiwavelength features, akin to spectral shaping, enables us to tune output
features with improved performance on classification tasks, potentially
eliminating the need for multiple digital post-processing steps. These findings
illustrate the spectral multiplexing or broadband advantage for free-space

predict the number of self-images visible from different observation points and
classify space into regions by image count. We then test these predictions with
an inexpensive stainless-steel concave cylindrical mirror commonly found in

Abstract: Photonic platforms have emerged as versatile and powerful classical

of extended structured (i.e., crystalline) electronic systems. While most
realizations to date have used only the fundamental mode in each site, recent
advances in structured light - particularly the use of higher-order spatial

dynamics and new functionalities. These additional degrees of freedom
facilitate the emulation of phenomena ranging from topological band structures
and synthetic gauge fields to orbitronics. In this perspective, we discuss how
exploiting the internal structure of higher-order modes is reshaping the scope
and capabilities of photonic platforms for simulating quantum phenomena.

Motivation: The motivation is to advance the understanding of polaritons by studying novel cavity designs that leverage higher Q-factors and improved robustness, potentially enabling better optical confinement and robust fabrication.

Method: The study employs theoretical analysis with mathematical modeling of spherical Mie cavities, deriving approximate expressions for Q-factors and exploring the conditions for weak and strong coupling.

Result: Analytical results are derived, showing Q-factor enhancements and spatial field localizations due to polaritonic effects in Mie void cavities loaded with resonant media.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to the design of new polaritonic systems by elucidating factors influencing cavity performance and light-matter interactions.

Abstract: The progress in understanding the optical and microscopic properties of
polaritons relies on various optical cavities to confine electromagnetic
radiation, which causes a demand for new platforms with higher $Q$-factors and
better fabrication robustness. In this context, so called Mie voids --
spherical cavities inside a dielectric medium, where the light confinement
occurs due to refractive index contrast at the air-dielectric interface --
present a substantial interest. Here, we theoretically study the resonant
characteristics and polaritonic spectra of spherical Mie cavities loaded with
resonant media, as well as address the inverted problem, where a Mie void is
formed inside a resonant dispersive medium. We establish approximate analytical
expressions for the $Q$-factors of Mie void cavities, find the parameter ranges
of spherical voids leading to the regimes of weak and strong light-matter
coupling and analyze the concomitant effects, such as $Q$-factor enhancement
and spatial field localization, from the polaritonic perspective. Our result
could be valuable for the design of new polaritonic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: THz-TDS is a promising non-invasive technique for material analysis, but existing simulations are computationally expensive. This paper aims to improve simulation efficiency.

Method: The authors developed FD-PINNs by integrating physics-informed neural networks with frequency-domain techniques, reducing data dependence.

Result: Comparisons with FDTD, TD-PINNs, and experimental results show that FD-PINNs achieve accurate reconstructions with lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed FD-PINNs framework effectively addresses computational and modeling challenges in THz-TDS simulations, opening new possibilities for real-time and large-scale applications.

Abstract: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) provides a non-invasive and
label-free method for probing the internal structure and electromagnetic
response of materials. Numerical simulation of THz-TDS can help understanding
wave-matter interactions, guiding experimental design, and interpreting complex
measurement data. However, existing simulation techniques face challenges in
accurately modeling THz wave propagation with low computational cost.
Additionally, conventional simulation solvers often require dense
spatial-temporal discretization, which limits their applicability to
large-scale and real-time scenarios. Simplified analytical models may neglect
dispersion, multiple scattering, and boundary effects. To address these
limitations, we establish a novel computational framework that integrates
frequency-domain physics-informed neural networks (FD-PINNs) with less
data-driven. To validate our proposed FD-PINNs, simulation results from
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and time-domain (TD)-PINNs were used to
compare with FD-PINNs. Finally, experimental results from THz-TDS systems were
employed to further exhibit accurate reconstruction ability of FD-PINNs.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，等离子体诱导的束流发散现象在低 municipality和高电流的 collider 中较为常见，且难以完全消除。通过深入分析束流与等离子体的相互作用机制，有望开发出更有效的 Mitigation 策略，以提高 collider 的性能和效率。

Abstract: In recent electron-positron colliders designed and operated with very low
emittance and high current, the energy density of the beam has increased
significantly compared to earlier designs. Under these conditions, interactions
between the beam and residual materials within the beam pipe exert considerable
mutual influence. The residual materials are heated by the beam, leading to
evaporation, charging, and possible fission, eventually resulting in a plasma
state. Conversely, the beam undergoes emittance growth due to electromagnetic
interactions with the resulting plasma. We investigate the effects of such
dust-induced plasma on the beam through numerical simulations of these
processes.

Motivation: The authors aim to develop robust frequency standards for optical clocks to enhance precision by eliminating common sources of error.

Method: They externally drive the D1 line, measure the frequency shift caused by magnetic fields using Zeeman splitting, and analyze the sensitivity to these fluctuations.

Result: The crossover resonance shows greater stability under magnetic field variations compared to the zero detuning resonance.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant advancement in creating more reliable optical clocks that are less susceptible to environmental disruptions, positioning it as a promising development in metrology and quantum sensing.

Abstract: We report the observation and characterization of a high-contrast
dual-frequency Doppler-free ground-state crossover resonance in the D1 line of
87Rb.The crossover appears at a two-photon detuning exceeding the natural
linewidth of the excited state and is formed by the optical pumping effect.
Unlike the previously proposed resonance at zero two-photon detuning, which we
show becomes sensitive to magnetic-field fluctuations due to residual
ellipticity of the optical fields-resulting in frequency shifts and profile
asymmetry-the crossover resonance is largely immune to this effect. Our
theoretical analysis attributes the observed sensitivity to the dispersive
contribution of ground-state coherences to absorption. Stability measurements
under magnetic-field fluctuations demonstrate that using the crossover
resonance provides more than an order-of-magnitude improvement, making it a
promising reference for frequency stabilization in compact, field-deployable
optical standards.

advances in laser technology and the growing relevance of cadmium in quantum
gas research, precision metrology, and atom trapping. General analytic
expressions are derived for transition matrix elements of all multipolar
orders, formulated to be applicable for experimental use. Using configuration
interaction combined with many-body perturbation theory, we calculate not only
the previously reported contributions from electric dipole (E1) transitions,
but also the electric quadrupole (E2), electric octupole (E3), magnetic dipole
(M1), and magnetic quadrupole transitions (M2) that have not yet been
investigated for cadmium. These matrix elements are then employed to determine
the lifetimes of key excited states, particularly those pertinent to laser
cooling and optical frequency standards, and to evaluate the long-range
dispersion coefficient C6. The linewidths of the strongest transitions, along
with the atomic energy levels, are compared with available experimental data to
validate the accuracy of the simulations. Overall, the results are in good
agreement, with the calculated energy levels exhibiting an average relative
deviation of 0.3% from experiments. These values serve as benchmarks for both
bosonic and fermionic isotopes, providing a foundation for future experimental

Abstract: Precise measurement of radiation has long played a vital role in a wide range
of research and industrial fields, from fundamental physics beyond the Standard
Model to medical imaging such as time-of-flight positron emission tomography.
Developing radiation detectors that achieve high timing precision-on the order
of a few tens of picoseconds-and energy measurement capabilities remains
indispensable yet challenging. In this study, we developed two types of
scintillator-integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (SCI-IMPs),
one incorporating barium fluoride, and the other bismuth germanate, to enable
simultaneous high-precision timing and energy measurements. To evaluate their
performance over a wide energy range from keV- to GeV-scale, electron-positron
annihilation gamma rays and cosmic ray muons were used. For energy
measurements, both detectors achieved an energy resolution of approximately 35%
at 511 keV. For timing measurements using 511 keV, coincidence time resolutions
(CTRs) of approximately 50 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) were obtained
for both detectors. In contrast, for cosmic ray muon experiments where cosmic
ray muon energy is typically on the order of GeV, CTRs were measured to be 25.1
and 16.8 ps FWHM for barium fluoride- and bismuth germanate-based detectors,
respectively. The versatile scintillator-integration technique established in
this study can broaden the applicability of the newly developed SCI-IMPs. In
particular, these results demonstrate that the developed detectors push the
boundaries of timing performance while retaining energy measurement and hold
promise for future applications in fundamental physics experiments and medical
imaging.

Abstract: Rasnik is a three-point optical displacement sensor originally developed for

purely optical measurement principles, working distances from 50 mm to 15 m,
and multi-degree-of-freedom sensitivity perpendicular to the optical axis.
RasCal, a comprehensive control and analysis software, is presented in this
paper and its real-time image processing shows 5 pm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ spatial
resolution. With GPU acceleration, 274.5 Hz is achieved during live camera
acquisition and 109 Hz on CPU. In maximum-throughput configurations, the
processing rates exceed 300 Hz on simple consumer hardware. System performance
is demonstrated across diverse applications: 5 pm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$
displacement sensitivity is achieved in the VATIGrav setup, dynamic behavior is
characterized with a Watt's linkage. In addition, the lack of cumulative drift
due to absolute coding with minimal thermal sensitivity under controlled
conditions is used for vibration and thermal characterization of photodiode
mounts for the LISA space mission. Millisecond-level command latency and
thread-safe multi-camera support are provided by the RasCal software,

TL;DR: The BeEST experiment focuses on superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors to search for BSM physics using $^7$Be electron capture ($EC$) decay.

The improved STJ arrays maintain high energy resolution while eliminating calibration discrepancies. This work is—to investigate the source of discrepancies in STJ calibration and develop a solution for better precision.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BSM physics, such as new particles and interactions, can be probed through rare decay processes like $^7$Be EC. STJ sensors have shown promise in achieving sufficient precision for these studies, making this research both theoretically and experimentally relevant.

Method: Phase-III utilized the BeEST system with STJs calibrated using UV lasers. Artifacts were identified as resistive crosstalk and laser fluctuations, which were mitigated in Phase-IV by modifying the STJ array and switching to a more stable laser source.

Result: Calibration issues were successfully resolved, maintaining the high energy resolution of ~1–2 eV in the 100 eV range. The improved STJ arrays demonstrate consistent performance without residual artifacts.

Conclusion: This paper presents a comprehensive solution for STJ calibration discrepancies in the BeEST experiment, ensuring the continued effectiveness of STJ-based measurements in exploring beyond the Standard Model physics.

Abstract: The Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions (BeEST)
experiment uses superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors to search for
physics beyond the standard model (BSM) with recoil spectroscopy of the
$\mathbf{^7}$Be EC decay into $\mathbf{^7}$Li. A pulsed UV laser is used to
calibrate the STJs throughout the experiment with $\sim$20 meV precision.
Phase-III of the BeEST experiment revealed a systematic calibration discrepancy
between STJs. We found these artifacts to be caused by resistive crosstalk and
by intensity variations of the calibration laser. For phase-IV of the BeEST
experiment, we have removed the crosstalk by designing the STJ array so that
each pixel has its own ground wire. We now also use a more stable UV laser for
calibration. The new STJ arrays were fabricated at STAR Cryoelectronics and
tested at LLNL and FRIB. They have the same high energy resolution of
$\sim$1\textendash2~eV in the energy range of interest below 100~eV as before,
and they no longer exhibit the earlier calibration artifacts. We discuss the
design changes and the STJ array performance for the next phase of the BeEST
experiment.

Abstract: We developed a compact and rugged muon detector designed for deployment in
boreholes. The detector uses a SiPM-on-tile approach in which silicon
photomultipliers are directly coupled to scintillator tiles, thereby
eliminating the need for wavelength-shifting fibers and long scintillator bars.
The modular design is based on a 64-channel unit, 140~cm in length and 80~mm in
diameter, composed of $5 \times 5$~cm$^{2}$ scintillator tiles coupled to
SiPMs, powered and read out using off-the-shelf electronics. The detector has
an average muon detection efficiency above 95\% and acceptance over
5$^\circ$--60$^\circ$ in zenith and 0$^\circ$--360$^\circ$ in azimuth.
Simulations indicate that reconstruction combining hit positions and energy
deposits achieves a zenith resolution of 1.5--4.0$^\circ$ across most of the
zenith range. This work demonstrates a compact, rugged, and cost-effective
borehole muon detector based on the SiPM-on-tile approach, offering a new

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Kibble balance realizes the kilogram by linking mechanical and electrical
quantities via a magnet system. In an improved BIPM-type magnet design by
Tsinghua University, an open/close surface was incorporated, facilitating
operation. However, an unavoidable mechanical air gap at the splitting plane
introduces asymmetry in the magnetic flux density profile, degrading field
uniformity. This study proposes a two-step yoke compensation method to restore
symmetry by adjusting the upper outer yoke's inner radius and the splitting gap
height. Finite element simulations show linear relationships between asymmetry
and these parameters, enabling predictive compensation. Experimental results
confirm that sequential tuning successfully eliminates asymmetry and recovers
the designed uniform field range. The method provides an effective solution for
enhancing magnetic field quality in openable Kibble balance magnets.

Motivation: Study of black holes in expanding universes for theoretical physics.

Method: Derived metric tensors with spherical symmetry satisfying Einstein-Maxwell equations in FLRW backgrounds.

Result: Black holes with charge dependent on cubic root of a time-dependent mass function.

Conclusion:  novel approach to black hole dynamics in FLRW models with possible relevance for cosmology and quantum gravity.

Abstract: New time-dependent metric tensors with spherical symmetry satisfying the
Einstein-Maxwell equations in space-times with FLRW asymptotic behaviour are
derived here for the first time. These geometries describe dynamical charged
non-rotating black holes hosted by the perfect fluid of the asymptotic FLRW
space-times. Their gravitational sources are the stress-energy tensors formed
by a contribution of the perfect fluid and an electromagnetic one due to the
Coulomb field produced by the time-dependent black-hole charge in the
asymptotic FLRW background. The dynamics of these models is determined by the
dynamical mass, which may be an arbitrary function of time, and two arbitrary
real-valued parameters. The first one simulates the effect of a cosmological
constant as in our $\kappa$-models we proposed recently [I. I. Cotaescu, Eur.
Phys. J. C (2024) 84:819]. The second parameter relates surprisingly the
dynamical black hole charge to the cubic root of the mass function. The role of
these parameters is investigated analyzing simple examples of dynamical charged
black holes in the matter-dominated universe.

Abstract: For twisted particles in arbitrary gravitational fields, the problems of the
rotation of intrinsic orbital angular momentum and the orbital Hall effect are
solved in the general case. We need not use the Maxwell equations in curved

rigorously defining the OAM dynamics in any Riemannian spacetimes is derived.
The general description of different manifestations of the orbital Hall effect
for any twisted particles is also presented. Our short analysis shows that the

Abstract: We model the motion of a small compact object on a nearly circular orbit
around a spinning supermassive black hole, which is also interacting with a
thin equatorial accretion-disk surrounding the latter, through tools from
self-force and Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We provide an analytical and
relativistically-accurate formalism to calculate the rate of energy and angular
momentum exchanged at Lindblad resonances. We show that strong relativistic
effects can potentially cause a reversal in the direction of the torque on the
small compact object if the surface density gradient is not too large. We
analytically explore the dependence of the torque reversal location on the spin
of the supermassive black hole and demonstrate that the ratio of the reversal
location to the innermost stable circular orbit is approximately insensitive to
the spin of the supermassive black hole. Our results show that relativistic
torques can be 1--2 order of magnitude larger than the Newtonian torque
routinely used in the literature to model disk/small-compact-object
interactions close to the supermassive black hole. Our results highlight the
importance of including relativistic effects when modeling environmental
effects in extreme mass-ratio inspirals.

Abstract: This work tries to establish the theoretical framework for
gravitomagnetic-hydrodynamics (GMHD), revealing a fundamental correspondence
between geometrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamic phenomena in general
relativity. By introducing the gravitoelectromagnetic formalism to relativistic
fluids, a set of leading-order GMHD equations is derived that govern the
co-evolution of spacetime geometry and matter dynamics in the early Universe.
This analysis reveals that, under high-temperature and high-density conditions
such as those during the electroweak phase transition, the gravitomagnetic
Reynolds number becomes large, leading to a strongly coupled fluid-spacetime
system. This coupling supports the emergence of gravitational Alfven waves and
a turbulent energy cascade. Our findings suggest that GMHD turbulence may leave
imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background, offering a new window
into the nonlinear dynamics of the primordial Universe.

Conclusion: 提供了解决大爆炸奇点和剪切问题的新方案。

Abstract: In bouncing cosmological models, either classical or quantum, the big bang
singularity is replaced by a regular bounce. A challenging question in such
models is how to keep the shear under control in the contracting phase, as it
is well-known that the shear grows as fast as $1/a^{6}$ toward the bounce,
where $a$ is the expansion factor of the universe. A common approach is to
introduce a scalar field with an ekpyrotic-like potential which becomes
negative near the bounce, so the effective equation of state of the scalar
field will be greater than one, whereby it dominates the shear and other matter
fields in the bounce region. As a result, a homogeneous and isotropic universe
can be produced. In this paper, we study how the ekpyrotic mechanism affects
the inflationary phase in both loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and a modified loop
quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I), because in these frameworks the inflation
is generic without such a mechanism. After numerically studying various cases
in which the potential of the inflaton consists of two parts, an inflationary
potential and an ekpyrotic-like one, we find that, despite the fact that the
influence is significant, by properly choosing the free parameters involved in
the models, the ekpyrotic-like potential dominates in the bounce region, during
which the effective equation of state is larger than one, so the shear problem
is resolved. As the time continuously increases after the bounce, the
inflationary potential grows and ultimately becomes dominant, resulting in an
inflationary phase. This phase can last long enough to solve the cosmological
problems existing in the big bang model.

Abstract: Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime
geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and
quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study aims to
investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information
extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and
entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum
vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat,
also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's
position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the
extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction,
with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific
image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of
the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that
the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work
highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like
wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential
relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of
quantum mechanics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Many quantum gravitational frameworks, such as DBI inflation, k-essence, and
effective field theories obtained by integrating out heavy modes, can lead to a
non-trivial sound speed. Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open
system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum
systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity
throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated,
and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open
two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To
numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the
evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open
two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity
exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with
non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also
investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov
entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial
sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos
coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a
maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the
Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge
expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for
exploring the early universe through the quantum information.

### [48] [Do Black Holes Exist?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04165)
*Leonardo Modesto,Edoardo Rattu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The McVittie solution of Einstein's gravity is thoroughly analyzed, revealing its singularity at $2M$ and the implications for black hole existence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the validity of black holes in the context of McVittie solution is crucial.

Method: Mathematical analysis of the McVittie metric, evaluation of energy conditions, and construction of a toy model.

Result: The McVittie solution contains a curvature singularity at $2M$, energy conditions are violated near the singularity, and black hole existence may need reevaluation.

Conclusion: The McVittie solution challenges our conventional understanding of black holes, suggesting spacetime anomalies at the singularity which may influence gravitational collapse models.

Abstract: We carefully investigate, extend, and shed new light on the McVittie exact
solution of Einstein's gravity (EG) with the focus on the implications in the
Universe we live in. It turns out that the only known exact solution of EG,
which interpolates between an asymptotic homogeneous and isotropic Universe and
a Schwarzschild black hole, is actually singular in 2M, namely, the curvature
invariants diverge and the spacetime is geodetically incomplete in 2M. Very
important: all energy conditions are satisfied except the dominant one (DEC),
which is violated inside the radius 8M/3. Notice that 2M is not the event
horizon, but a curvature singularity covered by an apparent horizon that, at
the actual stage of the Universe, nearly coincides with 2M. Moreover, the
curvature singularity is not analytic with respect to the dynamics of the
Universe encoded in the Hubble function $H(t)$: for arbitrarily small but not
zero $H^\prime(t)$, the curvature invariants are singular, while for
$H^\prime(t)$ identically zero, they are regular. Therefore, we can not
analytically decouple the black hole from the entire Cosmos, namely, we can not
assume the Schwarzschild solution locally and the FRW metric at large scale
without violating the analyticity of the metric. Since the spacetime does not
exist for $r \leqslant$2M, and since the DEC is violated for r<8M/3, we are
allowed to doubt the existence of black holes in our Universe as understood up
to now. In particular, the violation of DEC seems catastrophic for the
spacetime stability below 8M/3. We build and study a toy model for the
gravitational collapse, generalizing the Vaidya to the McVittie-Vaidya metric.
Although dynamical, the singularities remain in the same locations. Finally, in
order to achieve the curvature smoothness and geodesic completion, we propose
two solutions: one in Einstein's conformal gravity, and the other replacing M
with M(r).

Abstract: We explore the modified thermodynamics of a Hayward-Anti de Sitter (H-AdS)
black hole in atypical conditions, incorporating a string fluid, Hayward
regularisation, and quantum entropy corrections. Our analysis reveals a
first-order phase transition between small and large black hole phases,
characterised by a swallowtail behaviour in the Gibbs free energy profiles. It
is found that the key parameters - string fluid strength, Hayward
regularisation scale, and quantum correction coefficients significantly
influence the critical temperature and phase stability of the H-AdS system. It
is further noticed that a large black hole phase is stabilised by these
modifications, with quantum corrections smoothing the transition. This model
offers a valuable framework to study quantum gravity effects on black hole
thermodynamics with potential implications in analysing black hole evolution
and astrophysical observations.

Conclusion: 通过数值与解析的结合分析，确定了d维带电黑洞周围测试天体轨道周期的上下限，并为其在高维时空中的引力理论研究提供了界定。

Abstract: This paper investigates the bounds on the minimum orbital period for test
objects around d-dimensional charged black holes in asymptotically flat
spacetimes. We find numerically that the minimum orbital period decreases as
the charge of the black hole increases. Thus, the upper limit is reached for an
uncharged black hole, while the lower limit is attained for a maximally charged
one. We then analytically derive the upper and lower bounds for the minimum
orbital period. These results improve our understanding of dynamics around
d-dimensional black holes and impose constraints on candidate gravity theories.

### [51] [$I-$Love$-$Curvature: Exploring compact stars' quasi-universal relation with curvature scalars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04260)
*M. D. Danarianto,A. Sulaksono*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper establishes links between neutron star properties (tidal deformability Λ and normalized moment of inertia ī) and curvature scalars (Ricci, Ricci tensor, Weyl, and Kretschmann) in GR. Strong correlations were found between these curvature measures and Λ, ī, both locally and globally. A key equation-of-state-independent relation involving the Ricci scalar suggests a trace anomaly connection, offering new universal links between observables, geometry, and microphysics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay between neutron star structure, their gravitational wave signals (from events like GW170817), and their internal physics (equation of state) is crucial for constraining compact star models. The paper contributes to this by linking observable properties with spacetime geometry via curvature scalars.

Method: The study uses a combination of theoretical modeling (piecewise polytropic and color-flavor-locked EOS) and data constraints from gravitational wave observations (GW170817) and X-ray binaries. Systematic analysis of curvature scalar correlations with neutron star observables is employed.

Result: Significant correlations between curvature measures and Λ, ī were identified, with especially strong links between surface and volume-averaged curvatures. A universal relation involving the Ricci scalar was highlighted, suggesting a potential connection to the trace anomaly. The findings are consistent with existing Bayesian inference estimates on EOS.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a robust framework linking neutron star observables to spacetime geometry through curvature scalars, offering new insights into EOS and microphysics. These results enhance our ability to predict neutron star properties and validate GR in extreme conditions.

Abstract: We investigate quasi-universal relations in neutron stars linking standard
observables, such as tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) and normalized moment of
inertia ($\bar{I}$), with normalized curvature scalars in general relativity.
These curvature scalars include the Ricci scalar ($\mathcal{R}$), the Ricci
tensor contraction ($\mathcal{J}$), the Weyl scalar ($\mathcal{W}$), and the
Kretschmann scalar ($\mathcal{K}$). We systematically examine both piecewise
polytropic and color-flavor-locked equations of state, finding: (1) significant
correlations between both local (central and surface) and global
(volume-averaged) curvature scalars with $\bar{I}$ and $\Lambda$; (2)
especially strong correlations between surface and volume-averaged curvature
scalars and both $\bar{I}$ and $\Lambda$; (3) a near
equation-of-state-independent maximum for the normalized Ricci scalar,
suggesting a link to the trace anomaly; and (4) new universal relations
involving normalized central and volume-averaged pressure and energy density,
which also correlate strongly with $\bar{I}$ and $\Lambda$. Using constraints
from GW170817 and low-mass X-ray binaries, we demonstrate that $\Lambda$
measurements directly constrain both scalar curvature quantities and the
interior properties of canonical-mass neutron stars. These findings agree with
the literature on equation-of-state-dependent Bayesian inference estimates. Our
identified relations thus provide an equation-of-state-insensitive connection
between stellar observables, spacetime geometry, and the microphysics of
compact stars.

Conclusion: 通过研究特定传播子和哈密顿流，论文提供了分析Klein-Gordon场在复杂时空的新方法，相关结果可能有助于解决在这些时空中的具体波动问题。

Abstract: On a large class of asymptotically flat spacetimes which includes radiative
perturbations of Minkowski space, we define a distinguished global Feynman
propagator for massive Klein-Gordon fields by means of the microlocal approach
to non-elliptic Fredholm theory, working in the de,sc-pseudodifferential
algebra due to Sussman. We extend the limiting absorption principle (the
"$i\varepsilon$ prescription" for the Feynman propagator) to this setting.
Motivated by the complicated Hamilton flow structure arising in this problem,
we also prove a new localized radial point estimate in the spirit of Haber-Vasy
which, under appropriate nondegeneracy assumptions, allows one to propagate
microlocal regularity into a single radial point belonging to a larger radial
set which can be a source, sink, or saddle for the Hamilton flow.

Conclusion: 椭圆轨道和自旋预cessing显著影响参数估计，正确模型至关重要。

Abstract: While the majority of gravitational wave (GW) events observed by the LIGO and
Virgo detectors are consistent with mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) on
quasi-circular orbits, some events are also consistent with non-zero orbital
eccentricity, indicating that the binaries could have formed via dynamical
interactions. Moreover, there may be GW events which show support for
spin-precession, eccentricity, or both. In this work, we study the interplay of
spins and eccentricity on the parameter estimation of GW signals from BBH
mergers. We inject eccentric signals with no spins, aligned spins, and
precessing spins using hybrids, TEOBResumS-DALI, and new Numerical Relativity
(NR) simulations, respectively, and study the biases in the posteriors of
source parameters when these signals are recovered with a quasi-circular
precessing-spin waveform model, as opposed to an aligned-spin eccentric
waveform model. We find significant biases in the source parameters, such as
chirp mass and spin-precession ($\chi_p$), when signals from highly-eccentric
BBHs are recovered with a quasi-circular waveform model. Moreover, we find that
for signals with both eccentricity and spin-precession effects, Bayes factor
calculations confirm that an eccentric, aligned-spin model is preferred over a
quasi-circular precessing-spin model. Our study highlights the complex nature
of GW signals from eccentric, precessing-spin binaries and the need for readily
usable inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric, spin-precessing waveform models for
unbiased parameter estimation.

Abstract: Einstein-bumblebee gravity is one of the simplest vector-tensor theories that

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines cosmological scenarios in scalar-tensor gravity with non-minimal couplings and a monomial scalar potential. The analysis focuses on critical points, stability, and asymptotic behaviors using dynamical systems methods. The model exhibits various inflationary and late-time behaviors, including quasi-de Sitter, phantom, power-law, and exponential expansion. Phase portraits are used to illustrate the dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of non-minimal couplings in scalar-tensor gravity is crucial for exploring alternative theories of gravity and their implications for early and late universe cosmology, such as inflation and dark energy.

Method: The authors employed dynamical systems theory to analyze the critical points and stability of the scalar-tensor model with non-minimal kinetic and scalar couplings, considering different forms of the scalar potential. They derived and solved the system of equations to study the model's behavior under various parameter conditions.

Result: The model shows diverse cosmological behaviors: quasi-de Sitter inflationary expansion (early universe), phantom expansion (dark energy-dominated era with w_eff < -1), power-law and exponential expansion (later stages). The results are visualized through phase portraits.

Conclusion: The study reveals the rich cosmological dynamics of scalar-tensor gravity with non-minimal couplings, offering new insights into inflationary and late-time universe scenarios through detailed analysis and visualization of the model's evolution.

Abstract: This paper explores cosmological scenarios in a scalar-tensor theory of
gravity, including both a non-minimal coupling with scalar curvature of the
form $R\phi^2$ and a non-minimal derivative coupling of the form
$G^{\mu\nu}\phi_{,\mu}\phi_{,\nu}$ in the presence of a scalar field potential
with the monomial dependence $V(\phi) = V_0\phi^n$. Critical points of the
system were obtained and analyzed. In the absence of a scalar field potential,
stability conditions for these points were determined. Using methods of
dynamical systems theory, the asymptotic behavior of the model was analyzed. It
was shown that in the case of $V(\phi)\equiv0$ or $n < 2$, a quasi-de Sitter
asymptotic behavior exists, corresponding to an early inflationary universe.
This asymptotic behavior in the approximation $V_0 \rightarrow 0,\ \xi
\rightarrow 0$ coincides with the value $H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{9|\eta|}}$ obtained
in works devoted to cosmological models with non-minimal kinetic coupling. For
$|\xi|\ \rightarrow \infty$, this asymptotic behavior tends to the value $H =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3|\eta|}}$. Moreover, unstable regimes with phantom expansion
$w_{eff} < -1$ were found for the early dynamics of the model. For the late
dynamics, the following stable asymptotic regimes were obtained: a power-law
expansion with $w_{eff} \ge 1$, an expansion with $w_{eff} =\frac{1}{3}$
($V(\phi)\equiv0$), at which the effective Planck mass tends to zero, and an
exponential expansion with $w_{eff} = 0$ as $n = 2$. In this case, the
asymptotic value of the Hubble parameter depends only on $V_0 = \frac{1}{2}m^2$
and $\xi$. Numerical integration of the model dynamics was performed for
specific values of the theory parameters. The results are presented as phase
portraits.

Abstract: Linearized Einstein-Weyl equations are solved precisely in the context of
sandwich gravitational waves. The neutrino's energy-momentum depends on the
geometry and composition of the gravitational pulse when it is scattered. Since
the background remains unchanged at the test field level, the neutrino's energy
density will exhibit fluctuations between positive and negative extremes when
traversing the sandwich wave. These variations could provide insights into the
behavior of models concerning neutrino oscillations.

Abstract: Gravitational wave astronomy has opened an unprecedented window onto tests of
gravity and fundamental physics in the strong-field regime. In this study, we
examine a series of well-motivated deviations from the classical Kerr solution
of General Relativity and employ gravitational wave data to place constraints
on possible deviations from the Kerr geometry. The method involves calculating
the phase of gravitational waves using the effective one-body formalism and
then applying the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework to constrain the
parameters appearing in these scenarios beyond General Relativity. The
effective one-body method, known for its capability to model complex
gravitational waveforms, is used to compute the wave phase, and the
post-Einsteinian framework allows for a flexible, model-independent approach to
parameter estimation. We demonstrate that gravitational wave data provide
evidence supporting the Kerr nature of black holes, showing no significant
deviations from General Relativity, thereby affirming its validity within the
current observational limits. This work bridges theoretical waveform modeling
with observational constraints, providing a pathway to test the no-hair theorem
and probe the astrophysical viability of modified black holes.

Abstract: We develop a quantum-cosmological framework in which the inflationary
potential emerges from the structure of the wave function of the universe
rather than being postulated. Starting from the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for a
flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker minisuperspace, we express the wave function in
terms of an amplitude and a phase and, in a semiclassical regime where the
expansion dominates the field's evolution, separate these into purely geometric
and purely field-dependent pieces. This yields a closed expression for an
emergent potential that makes transparent the roles of the cosmological
constant, the momenta associated with expansion and field dynamics, and quantum
corrections from the amplitude. Slow-roll conditions follow from properties of
the phase and amplitude, leading to wave-function-level expressions for the
usual slow-roll parameters and to direct links between cosmic microwave
background observables and derivatives of the phase. The approach ties
inflation to the quantum state of the universe and suggests testable
relationships between cosmological data and features of the wave function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding gravitational wave signals from black hole mergers is crucial for extracting information about the system's properties, but terrestrial glitches pose a significant challenge that needs to be mitigated.

Method: The study employs simulated glitches and gravitational wave signals to investigate the impact of glitches on spin measurements, including both high and low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios.

Result: The research conclusively demonstrates that spin measurement biases arise from unresolved glitches even when using traditional mitigation methods. It also highlights that low-SNR glitches can still significantly affect the results, emphasizing the need for improved mitigation techniques.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the importance of incorporating glitch models into the analysis of gravitational wave data to minimize biases in parameter estimation, particularly the spins of binary black holes.

Abstract: Gravitational waves from black hole binary mergers carry information about
the component spins, but inference is sensitive to analysis assumptions, which
may be broken by terrestrial noise transients known as glitches. Using a
variety of simulated glitches and gravitational wave signals, we study the
conditions under which glitches can bias spin measurements. We confirm the
theoretical expectation that inference and subtraction of glitches invariably
leaves behind residual power due to statistical uncertainty, no matter the
strength (signal-to-noise ratio; SNR) of the original glitch. Next we show that
low-SNR glitches - including those below the threshold for flagging
data-quality issues - can still significantly bias spin inference. Such biases
occur for a range of glitch morphologies, even in cases where glitches and
signals are not precisely aligned in phase. Furthermore, we find that residuals
of glitch subtraction can result in biases as well. Our results suggest that
joint inference of the glitch and gravitational wave parameters, with
appropriate models and priors, is required to address these uncertainties
inherent in glitch mitigation via subtraction.

Abstract: Submarines are vital for maritime defense, requiring optimized hydrodynamic
performance to minimize resistance. Advancements in Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD) enable accurate predictions of submarine hydrodynamics for
optimal design. This study compared the meshing capabilities of OpenFOAM and
commercial software as well as the performance of High-Performance Computing
(HPC) and standard PC resources upon hydrodynamic characteristics. The RANS
turbulence model with was employed to analyze the resistances of the MARIN's
BB2-class submarine. CFD simulations were conducted at a model scale (1:35.1)
at a speed of 1.8235 m/s ( of 21 knots) upon various mesh densities from 1 to
97 million cells. Empirical equations were initialized for turbulence
parameters. Mesh sensitivity and iteration convergence ensured validated
results. The findings showed that the results were validated with errors
ranging from 0.3% to 10% across different mesh densities. The lowest error
(0.3%) was achieved with 97 million cells generated by the commercial meshing
tool with HPC, while 13 million cells by OpenFOAM with a standard PC resulted
in a 3.4% error. Accuracy improved with precise initialization of turbulence
parameters, mesh strategy, numerical schemes, and computing resources. The
application of a standard PC with the OpenFOAM meshing tool was able to produce
an acceptable accuracy, with less than 5% error for lower mesh densities. Thus,
it can be suggested that using a standard PC was beneficial for preliminary
hydrodynamic simulations. However, HPC with commercial software was essential
for detailed industrial analyses, such as full-scale resistance and propulsion
simulations.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates factors impacting CFD accuracy in submarine hydrodynamics, focusing on mesh resolution, turbulence models, and appendage effects. High-fidelity meshes and turbulence closures were tested, revealing significant impacts of mesh density, turbulence model choice, and appendages on drag coefficients. Results emphasize the importance of validated CFD workflows for submarine design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate CFD simulations are crucial for optimizing submarine performance, but their reliability heavily depends on factors like mesh resolution and turbulence modeling. This paper aims to identify and quantify these impacts to establish robust and accurate CFD strategies.

Method: The study involved numerical analysis using the RANS turbulence model at Re = 3.6 × 10^6 with wall-resolved meshes (y+ < 5). A mesh convergence study was conducted with resolutions ranging from 13 million to 22 million cells. Turbulence models evaluated included k-ω SST, k-ω 2006, Lien Cubic, k-ε Launder-Sharma, and Spalart-Allmaras. Boundary layer fidelity was assessed by comparing velocity profiles from Cadence and SnappyHexMesh meshes with the theoretical law of the wall. Additionally, the influence of appendages on resistance was analyzed.

Result: The finest mesh (22 million cells) achieved a near mesh-independent solution with an error of 1.16% and extrapolated to less than 0.11% agreement with lab-scale data. The k-ω SST turbulence model demonstrated the most reliable performance, with resistance predictions less than 1.2% of error. The law-of-the-wall analysis showed that Cadence enabled full resolution of the viscous sublayer, while SnappyHexMesh was constrained by wall-normal cell sizing. Appendage analysis revealed that the sail contributed up to 7.1% of pressure drag and 7.7% of viscous drag, while the rudder added 3.7% and 5.6% respectively, significantly impacting overall resistance.

Conclusion: These findings contribute to the development of robust and accurate CFD strategies for submarine hydrodynamics and provide a reliable framework for future resistance evaluation and design assessment in complex maritime applications.

Abstract: This research explores several critical factors affecting CFD-based
prediction accuracy of submarine hydrodynamics and builds upon previous work on
preliminary mesh and solver benchmarking. A scaled submarine model is analyzed
numerically using the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence model
at a Reynold number (Re) of 3.6x106 with wall-resolved meshes targeting y+ <5.
Based on prior work using a 13x106 cells mesh generated with SnappyHexMesh, a
mesh convergence study was performed with increasing resolution of fine (15x106
cells), finer (18x106 cells), and finest (22x106 cells). Subsequently, five
turbulence closure models which are k-$\omega$ SST, k-$\omega$ 2006, Lien
Cubic, k-$\epsilon$ Launder-Sharma, and Spalart-Allmaras were assessed for
predictive performance and computational efficiency. Boundary layer fidelity
was examined by comparing velocity profiles extracted from Cadence and
SnappyHexMesh meshes against the theoretical law of the wall. In the final
phase, the influence of appendages on local and global resistance was analyzed.
The results presented that the finest mesh (22x106 cells) achieved a near
mesh-independent solution with an error of 1.16% and extrapolated to less than
0.11% showing strong agreement with lab-scale data. Among the turbulence
models, the k-$\omega$ SST model demonstrated the most reliable performance,
with resistance predictions less than 1.2% of error. In addition, the
law-of-the-wall analysis illustrated that the Cadence allowed full resolution
of the viscous sublayer, while SnappyHexMesh performance was constrained by
wall-normal cell sizing. Appendage analysis revealed that the sail alone
contributed up to 7.1% of the pressure drag and 7.7% of viscous drag, while the
rudder added 3.7% and 5.6% respectively, indicating a substantial impact on
overall resistance. These findings contribute to developing robust and accurate
CFD strategies for submarine hydrodynamics and offer a reliable framework for
future resistance evaluation and design assessment in complex maritime
applications.

Abstract: We present comprehensive \textsl{ab initio} calculations of CO$_{\rm
2}$-H$_{\rm 2}$ and CO$_{\rm 2}$-He collisional properties from first
principles, employing CCSD(T), potential calculations together with
close-coupling dynamical scattering in the \YUMI~framework. We derive
(in)elastic cross sections, rate coefficients, and pressure-broadening
parameters -- incl., their rotational dependence up to $|m|=50$, and
temperature dependence over the range of 100-800 K. We provide Pad\'e fits for
the broadening coefficients as a function of rotational quantum number,
enabling extrapolation of the results and integration into spectroscopic
databases, including HITRAN and HITEMP. The computed potentials for both
CO$_{\rm 2}$-H$_{\rm 2}$ and CO$_{\rm 2}$-He have a sub-percent precision, and
the dynamics-solving code YUMI ultimately yields the collisional parameters.
Among these, the scaled pressure broadening experimental values meet the 10\%
precision requirement for exoplanetary sciences with \textit{JWST}. This
contrasts with the parameters available before the present calculations, which
at higher temperatures (T$>$400 K) deviate as much as 5$\times$ from the
desired precision requirement. All derivations and collisional properties are
provided with this manuscript, establishing the first of such a comprehensive
ab initio foundation for collisional systems with a target molecule having more

tritium over protium of 38.2 makes the Ag(I)-exchanged zeolite an excellent

Abstract: Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is recognized as a readily available,
mechanically sufficient construction and demolition waste product that is
suitable as a base course substitute for natural, virgin aggregate in pavement
construction. Environmentally responsible applications of RCA must consider the
high alkalinity, high pH leachate, and heavy metal leaching risks reported in
the literature. The existing body of literature does not address discrepancies
between field and laboratory measurements of RCA leachate pH, nor are there any
existing studies of aged RCA leachate composition as a function of time. To
consider the influence of contact time on RCA leachate, the present study
evaluates recovered RCA base course samples from the Minnesota Road Research
highway construction study site using modified batch test methodology. Leachate
pH, alkalinity, and calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration were monitored for 24
hours to understand RCA leachate chemistry during the initial contact period.
Leachate pH is high upon initial contact with water (pH > 10) and decreases
over time as it reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide. Calcium ion
concentration increases rapidly in the initial contact period, then more
gradually as calcium saturation is reached. Alkalinity stabilizes (50-65 mg
CaCO3/L) after a dramatic increase during the initial contact period.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to efficiently study dynamic charge transport in complex systems under extreme conditions, such as those found in warm dense matter.

Method: The authors employ the mDFT formalism, combining deterministic and stochastic methods, to compute optical conductivity spectra using two approaches: Kubo-Greenwood and real-time Time-Dependent mDFT. They also decompose the Onsager coefficients to attribute contributions from different electronic state transitions.

Result: The computational scaling is favorable with system sizes and temperatures, enabling detailed analysis of charge transport in carbon, hydrogen, and beryllium mixtures.

Conclusion: This approach provides a robust framework for understanding electron dynamics in warm dense matter, with potential applications in inertial confinement fusion and other high-energy density scenarios.

Abstract: Pairing the accuracy of Kohn-Sham density-functional framework with the
efficiency of a stochastic algorithmic approach, mixed stochastic-deterministic
Density Functional Theory (mDFT) achieves a favorable computational scaling
with system sizes and electronic temperatures. We employ the recently developed
mDFT formalism to investigate the dynamic charge-transport properties of
systems in the warm dense matter regime. The optical conductivity spectra are
computed for single- and multi- component mixtures of carbon, hydrogen, and
beryllium using two complementary approaches: Kubo-Greenwood in the mDFT
picture and real-time Time-Dependent mDFT. We further devise a decomposition of
the Onsager coefficients leading up to the Kubo-Greenwood spectra to exhibit
contributions from the deterministic, stochastic, and mixed electronic state
transitions at different incident photon energies.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer near-ab initio accuracy
with the efficiency of classical force fields, making them attractive for
modeling electrolytes. Collecting a diverse training set is essential for their
accuracy and reliability, and explicit treatment of strong electrostatic
interactions may be necessary. In this work, we demonstrated that active
learning can automatically generate diverse training sets for moment tensor
potentials (MTPs), enabling reliable molecular dynamics simulations of pure
ethylene carbonate (EC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), their mixtures, and
LiPF6 solutions. The resulting MTPs exhibit excellent transferability across
various EC/EMC compositions, producing ionic conductivities within 11% mean
deviations from experiments. In addition, we assessed the impact of explicitly
incorporating electrostatics by extending MTP with a charge redistribution
scheme. Our results show that this extended MTP achieves accuracy comparable to
MTP for EC/EMC mixtures with fewer parameters and reproduces ionic conductivity
with only a 6% mean deviation from experiment.

Abstract: Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is foundational to catalysis,

experimental challenge. We combine femtosecond optical spectroscopy,
site-specific ultrafast soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and time-resolved
X-ray scattering with advanced calculations to disentangle the elementary steps
of PCET in solution. Using a ruthenium polypyridyl model complex, we directly
resolve photoinduced electron redistribution, ligand-site protonation within
100 ps, and the accompanying solvent reorganization. This unified multi-modal
approach provides an orbital-level, atomistic picture of PCET, showing how
electronic, nuclear, and solvation degrees of freedom can be separated
experimentally. Our results establish a general X-ray framework for
understanding and ultimately controlling PCET in catalysis, artificial

TL;DR: ressive molecular dynamics (MLMD) framework for predictive IR/Raman spectroscopy, combining DetaNet with MLMD and RPMD to accurately compute anharmonic and quantum effects, achieving up to three orders of magnitude speedup compared to ab initio AIMD while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular identification and structural analysis rely heavily on accurate IR and Raman spectroscopy, which often requires computationally intensive quantum chemistry methods. The need for efficient yet precise computational tools drives this research.

Method: The study integrates DetaNet, a deep equivariant tensor attention network, with a velocity-Verlet integrator for MLMD simulations. The framework is trained on QMe1S dataset containing molecular properties, enabling prediction of force fields with high-order tensor capabilities. Time-correlation functions from MLMD and RPMD are used to compute spectroscopic data.

Result: The DetaNet-based MD approach achieves near-experimental spectral accuracy with significant computational speedups over AIMD, and extends to various molecular and crystalline systems.

Conclusion: This work provides a universal and efficient machine learning framework for molecular dynamics simulations and spectroscopic predictions, offering a scalable solution for diverse molecular systems.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of infrared (IR) and Raman spectra is
essential for molecular identification and structural analysis. Traditional
quantum chemistry methods based on the harmonic approximation neglect
anharmonicity and nuclear quantum effects, while ab initio molecular dynamics
(AIMD) remains computationally expensive. Here, we integrate our deep
equivariant tensor attention network (DetaNet) with a velocity-Verlet
integrator to enable fast and accurate machine learning molecular dynamics
(MLMD) simulations for spectral prediction. Trained on the QMe14S dataset
containing energies, forces, dipole moments, and polarizabilities for 186,102
small organic molecules, DetaNet yields a universal and transferable force
field with high-order tensor prediction capability. Using time-correlation
functions derived from MLMD and ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD)
trajectories, we computed IR and Raman spectra that accurately reproduce
anharmonic and nuclear quantum effects. Benchmark tests on isolated molecules,
including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, demonstrate that the DetaNet-based
MD approach achieves near-experimental spectral accuracy with speedups up to
three orders of magnitude over AIMD. Furthermore, the framework extends
seamlessly to molecular and inorganic crystals, molecular aggregates, and
biological macromolecules such as polypeptides with minimal fine-tuning. In all
systems, DetaNet maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing
computational cost. Overall, this work establishes a universal machine learning
force field and tensor-aware MLMD framework that enable fast, accurate, and
broadly applicable dynamic simulations and IR/Raman spectral predictions across
diverse molecular and material systems.

Abstract: This paper extends the previously reported theory of dissipation pathways [J.
Chem. Phys. 160, 214111 (2024)] to incorporate off-diagonal subsystem-bath
coupling, which is often required to model molecular systems where the
environment directly influences transitions and couplings between subsystem
states. We systematically derive master equations for both population transfer
and dissipation into individual bath components, for which we also rigorously
prove energy conservation and detailed balance. The approach is based on
second-order perturbation theory with respect to the subsystem-bath couplings,
whose form is not limited to any specific model. The accuracy of the developed
method is tested by applying it to diverse model Hamiltonians involving
linearly coupled harmonic oscillator baths and comparing the outcomes against
the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method. Overall, our method
accurately quantifies the contributions of specific bath components to the
overall dissipation while significantly reducing the computational cost
compared to numerically exact methods such as HEOM, thus offering a path to
examine how vibronic interactions steer non-adiabatic processes in realistic
chemical systems.

Abstract: The simplest, algebraic quantum-electrodynamical corrections, due to the
double-negative energy subspace and instantaneous interactions, are computed to
the no-pair Dirac-Coulomb(-Breit) energy of two-spin-1/2-fermion systems.
Numerical results are reported for two-electron atoms with a clamped nucleus
and positronium-like genuine two-particle systems. The Bethe-Salpeter equation
provides the theoretical framework, and numerical methods have been developed
for its equal-time time-slice. In practice, it requires solving a
sixteen-component eigenvalue equation with a two-particle Dirac Hamiltonian,
including the appropriate interaction. The double-pair corrections can either
be included in the interaction part of the eigenvalue equation or treated as a
perturbation to the no-pair Hamiltonian. The numerical results have an $\alpha$
fine-structure constant dependence that is in excellent agreement with the
known $\alpha^3E_\mathrm{h}\$-order double-pair correction of non-relativistic
quantum electrodynamics.

Motivation: The need for efficient yet accurate computational tools in materials science, especially for conjugated systems and technological applications, drives this analysis of the PPP Hamiltonian.

Method: The paper uses a combination of theoretical analysis and application to specific cases, such as singlet fission and singlet-triplet energy gaps, to evaluate PPP's efficacy.

Result: The PPP model is acknowledged as useful due to its computational efficiency, yet it struggles with electron correlation, which affects its accuracy. Applications in high-throughput screening and quantum computing integration showPotential for improvement.

Conclusion: The PPP Hamiltonian remains a valuable tool but requires refinement to address electron correlation. Its applications in high-throughput and quantum computing areas suggest new directions for research.

Abstract: The semi-empirical Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) Hamiltonian is reviewed for its
ability to provide a minimal model of the chemistry of conjugated
$\pi$-electron systems, and its current applications and limitations are
discussed. From its inception, the PPP Hamiltonian has helped in the
development of new computational approaches in instances where compute is
constrained due to its inherent approximations that allow for an efficient
representation and calculation of many systems of chemical and technological
interest. The crucial influence of electron correlation on the validity of
these approximations is discussed, and we review how PPP model exact
calculations have enabled a deeper understanding of conjugated polymer systems.
More recent usage of the PPP Hamiltonian includes its application in
high-throughput screening activities to the inverse design problem, which we
illustrate here for two specific fields of technological interest: singlet
fission and singlet-triplet inverted energy gap molecules. Finally, we
conjecture how utilizing the PPP model in quantum computing applications could
be mutually beneficial.

general setup adopting a non-canonical O(3)-sigma model, non-minimally coupled
through an anomalous magnetic dipole interaction to a gauge and real scalar
field. By embracing a hyperbolic non-canonical extension, one finds that
self-dual vortex configurations undergo geometric expansion, deforming ANO-like
vortices into disk-like structures, mitigating their energy, and generating
concentric energy rings around the core. Furthermore, these vortices exhibit
quantized magnetic flux and degenerate solutions. Finally, we highlight that
the analyzed vortices carry energy below the corresponding magnetic flux while
preserving a singularity at their origin.

Abstract: We formulate a precise holographic duality between an ensemble of 4d $U(1)^g$
Maxwell theories living on a spin four-manifold $M_4$ and an Abelian BF-type
2-form gauge theory of level $N$, summed over all five-manifolds with boundary
$M_4$. The elements of the boundary ensemble are Abelian gauge theories
specified by self-dual symplectic codes over $Z_N$, that parameterize
topological boundary conditions in the 5d TQFT. Similarly, the equivalence
classes of topologies distinguished by the 5d theory are parameterized by
orthogonal self-dual codes. Hence the holographic duality can be reformulated
in the language of quantum stabilizer codes. This duality is closely related to
the holographic relationship between ensembles of Narain conformal field
theories in 2d and level-$N$ Abelian Chern-Simons theories in 3d. In both
contexts, the duality extends to correlation functions. In the large-$N$ limit,
we find that the boundary ensemble average converges to an integral over the
moduli space of the gauge couplings and, when finite, is equal to an Eisenstein
series of the orthogonal group, a version of the Siegel-Weil formula that
appears in the 2d/3d context. As a spinoff, we clarify the holographic
relationship between the gauge group of the 4d N=4 super Yang-Mills theory and
the boundary conditions of the singleton sector in the bulk.

Abstract: We provide a holographic prescription to compute real-time thermal
correlators with arbitrary operator ordering. In field theory, these
correlation functions are captured by a multi-fold Schwinger-Keldysh time
contour. We propose a holographic dual for these contours, which generalizes
the gravitational Schwinger-Keldysh geometry previously advocated in the
literature. Our geometry consists of multiple AdS-black holes glued together at
the future and past horizons, with matching conditions determined by unitarity
and the KMS condition. As a proof of concept, we solve for a probe scalar field
in this geometry and compute bulk-bulk and bulk-boundary propagators, in terms
of which we evaluate the 4-point functions at tree-level. We show that in
perturbation theory, the lowest-order diagrams that contribute non-trivially to
the out-of-time order four-point function are exchange diagrams which explore
the full four-fold geometry. Furthermore, these diagrams reduce to a simple
factorized expression. We propose a conjecture on the structure of higher order
observables and provide a partial proof by studying a subset of the
contributing diagrams.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that an $\textit{ad hoc}$ Dirichlet boundary
condition, placed outside but close to an event horizon, for probe degrees of
freedom in an otherwise black hole geometry is capable of capturing non-trivial
level-correlations of the corresponding spectrum of the probe sector. Much of
the interesting physics stems from a hierarchy of scales that is present in the
quantum spectrum, in terms of two quantum numbers that characterize it. In this
work, we establish an explicit connection with the hierarchy of these scales
with a $\textit{radial localization}$ or the absence of it of the probe scalar
WKB-wavefunction. Subsequently, this scale separation can be traced back to the
hierarchy between the local red-shift and the classical light-traversing time
in a geometry that produces a Rindler-throat. The classical null ray takes a
logarithmically divergent time to reach the Dirichlet wall, and interestingly,
we explicitly demonstrate that the scalar quantum spectrum arising from the
Rindler throat yields a Dip-time of the corresponding spectral form factor,
which scales with a universal power of the light traversing time. Armed with
these, we further consider a $\textit{dressed effective model}$ where the
Dirichlet boundary condition is inserted in a ten-dimensional supergravity
geometry, where classical string sources back-react. We demonstrate that, as a
result of this backreaction, the quantum-dynamical time-scales, $\textit{e.g.}$
the Dip time of the corresponding spectral form factor can be further enhanced
with factors of the string length, thereby making the Dirichlet wall
configuration better mimic the true black hole. In the dual field theory, the
geometry corresponds to thermal states of a large $N$ gauge theory in the
Veneziano limit, where both the number of colour and the flavour degrees of
freedom are large.

Abstract: We find an intriguing relation between the chiral algebra and the mixed Hodge
structure of the Coulomb branch of four dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$
superconformal field theories. We identify the space of irreducible characters
of the $\mathcal{N} = 4$ $SU(N)$ chiral algebra
$\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ by analytically computing the Wilson line
Schur index, and imposing modular invariance. We further establish a map from
the $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ characters to the characters of the
$\mathcal{T}_{p, N}$ chiral algebra. We extract the pure part of the mixed
Hodge polynomial $PH_c$ of the Coulomb branch compactified on a circle, and
prove that $PH_c$ encodes the representation theory of
$\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$. We expect this to be a new entry of the 4D
mirror symmetry framework.

Motivation: 弦论和 holography 是当前理论物理前沿领域中的重要研究方向，本次研究通过 C-测度下的弦振荡和 holography 框架探讨了多个理论模型的性质，丰富了弦论和 holography 的应用领域。

Method: 本次研究主要基于 string-world holography 理论框架，利用三维的 C-测度解，通过构造引力场的振荡模型，计算了 Virasoro 代数的中心荷并得到 AdS3 上的中心电荷。除此之外，引入引力波动将其降低到膜上，得到了 JT 引力模型，并在高阶修正下研究了膜的性质。最后通过广义熵的展开分析，计算了 AdS3 中黑洞解的熵并发现主项由 Weyl 安omaly 支配。

Conclusion: 通过研究弦论中 C-测度下的引力振荡及其在 holography 框架中的表现，本文得出 AdS3 中的中心荷计算、JT 引力模型以及高阶曲率修正下的引力行为，并通过计算广义熵揭示了主项由 Weyl 安omaly支配的特性。这些结果为弦论和 holography 理论提供了新的视角和补充。

Abstract: We investigate the dilaton fluctuations near the string based on three
classes of solutions of the 3D C-metric within the framework of the
string-world holography. As a setup of holography, we focus on the asymptotic
symmetry, recover the Virasoro algebra by central extension and get the central
charge of the AdS3. Then we reduce the gravity on the brane as a JT gravity
model by introducing a fluctuation. As an extension of the braneworld, we also
investigate the higher curvature correction to the brane under some conditions.
Finally, we make an expansion on generalized entropy of black hole solution
with respect to small l and find that the leading term comes from Weyl anomaly,
which is different from that in 4-dimensional C-metric.

Abstract: In the paper, the family of conformal four-point ladder diagrams in arbitrary
space-time dimensions is considered. We use the representation obtained via
explicit calculation using the operator approach and conformal quantum
mechanics to study their properties, such as symmetries, loop and dimensional
shift identities. In even integer dimensions, latter allows one to reduce the
problem to two-dimensional case, where the notable factorization holds.
Additionally, for a specific choice of propagator powers, we show that the
representation can be written in the form of linear combinations of classical
polylogarithms (with coefficients that are rational functions) and explore the
structure of the resulting expressions.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper presents a study of the proper-time method in a Lorentz-violating extension of QED, where a term involving the antisymmetric tensor H_{μν} is added to the mass sector. The one-loop Euler-Heisenberg-like action is found to contain only odd degrees of the stress tensor F_{μν}, and the result is UV finite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to investigate the effects of Lorentz violation on quantum electrodynamics using the proper-time method.

Method: The method involves modifying the mass sector of QED with a term proportional to the antisymmetric tensor H_{μν} and calculating the one-loop Euler-Heisenberg-like action.

Result: The computation reveals that the action includes only odd degrees of the stress tensor F_{μν}, and the result is UV finite.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the behavior of the proper-time method in a Lorentz-violating QED extension and confirm the finiteness of the result using Feynman diagrams.

Abstract: We discuss applications of the proper-time method in a Lorentz-violating
extension of QED characterized by the modification of the mass sector through
the addition of the term proportional to the antisymmetric tensor $H_{\mu\nu}$.
Unlike other LV extensions of QED, in our case the one-loop
Euler-Heisenberg-like action turns out to include only odd degrees of the
stress tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$. Our result is shown to be UV finite, and it is
confirmed using the Feynman diagrams framework.

Abstract: Sphalerons in nonlinear Klein-Gordon models are unstable lump-like solutions
that arise from a saddle point between true and false vacua in the energy
functional. Numerical simulations are presented which show the sphaleron
evolving into an accelerating kink-antikink pair whose separation approaches
the speed of light asymptotically at large times. Utilizing a nonlinear
collective coordinate method, an approximate analytical solution is derived for
this evolution. These results indicate that an exact solution is expected to
exhibit a gradient blow-up for large times,caused by energy concentrating at
the flanks of the kink-antikink pair.

Conclusion: 瞬子的存在使带流体的热粘性物质中的粒子具有有效质量，且在较低强度电场时，物质趋向于绝电。

Abstract: Using the gauge-gravity duality, we study the electromagnetic instability of
vacuum with instantons in holographic plasma. The model we employ is the
D(-1)-D3 brane system in which the D(-1)-branes correspond to the instantons in
holography. To take into account the flavored quarks, the coincident probe
D7-branes as flavors are embedded into the bulk geometry so that the effective
electromagnetic Lagrangian with flavors corresponds to the action of the
D7-branes according to gauge-gravity duality. We numerically evaluate the
vacuum decay rate, the critical electric field and the V-A curve of the vacuum
by using the D7-brane action with various values of the electromagnetic field.
It implies the particles in the plasma acquire an effective mass in the
presence of instantons as it is expected in the quantum field theory, and the
plasma trends to become insulating when the electric field is small. This work
reveals the relation between electromagnetic and instantonic properties of the
vacuum in the plasma.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose to work on the Euclidean black hole solution with a corner rather
than with the prevalent conical singularity. As a result, we find that the Wald
formula for black hole entropy can be readily obtained for generic F(Rabcd)
gravity by using both the action without the corner term and the action with
the corner term due to their equivalence to the first order variation, which
implies that it is the corner rather than the corner term that encodes the
entropy related information. With such an equivalence, we further make use of a
special diffeomorphism to accomplish a direct derivation of the ADM Hamiltonian
conjugate to the Killing vector field normal to the horizon in the Lorentz
signature as a conjugate variable of the inverse temperature in the grand
canonical ensemble.

Abstract: In this work, the dynamics of quark-antiquark pair systems is investigated by
modelling them as general time-dependent 3D oscillators perturbed by a Coulomb
potential. Solving this model enables the prediction of key mesonic properties
such as the probability density, energy spectra, and quadrature uncertainties,
offering theoretical insights into the confinement of quarks via gluon-mediated
strong interactions. To tackle the mathematical difficulty raised by the time
dependence of parameters in the system, special mathematical techniques, such
as the invariant operator method, unitary transformation method, and the
Nikiforov-Uvarov functional analysis (NUFA) are used. The wave functions of the
system, derived using these mathematical techniques, are expressed analytically
in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric function whose mathematical properties are
well characterized. Our results provide the quantum mechanical framework of
quark-antiquark systems which are essential for exploring the non-perturbative
aspects of QCD. In addition, the underlying mathematical structure may serve as
a foundation for addressing broader challenges in particle physics, including
the origin of mass and its connection to the Higgs mechanism.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper examines the perturbative structure of the proper time renormalization group flow in scalar and Yang-Mills theories, successfully computing universal coefficients of the beta functions at one and two loops using both O(N) scalar and SU(N) Yang-Mills theories, and demonstrates the flow's reliability in diverse applications, including statistical models and quantum gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation appears to focus on exploring the properties and applications of the proper time renormalization group flow, particularly in scalar and Yang-Mills theories, with an emphasis on its universality and reliability across different physical contexts.

Method: The authors use the proper time renormalization group flow technique to investigate scalar and Yang-Mills theories. For the O(N) scalar theory, they compute the one- and two-loop contributions to the running quartic coupling and confirm the expected anomalous dimension. For the SU(N) Yang-Mills theory, the background field method is employed to compute the gauge coupling renormalization, ensuring the absence of gauge-symmetry-violating terms. The reliability of the approach in extracting universal coefficients of beta functions is demonstrated.

Result: The results show that the PT flow correctly reproduces the universal coefficients of the beta functions at one and two loops for both O(N) scalar and SU(N) Yang-Mills theories. Additionally, for the SU(N) Yang-Mills theory, the calculation recovers the correct two-loop beta function without generating any gauge-symmetry-violating terms. The findings highlight the PT flow's ability to capture essential universal aspects of renormalization, making it reliable for various applications, including statistical models and quantum gravity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that despite the PT flow's limitations in reconstructing the full effective action, it successfully retains the essential universal content of renormalization. The results demonstrate the flow's reliability and applicability across a range of physical theories and contexts, from statistical mechanics to quantum gravity.

Abstract: We investigate the perturbative structure of the proper time renormalization
group flow in scalar and Yang-Mills theories. Although the PT flow does not
belong to the class of exact functional renormalization group equations, we
show that it correctly reproduces the universal coefficients of the
$\beta$-functions at one and two loops. For the ${\rm O(N)}$ scalar theory, we
derive the one- and two-loop contributions to the running quartic coupling and
also confirm the expected anomalous dimension. For the ${\rm SU(N)}$ Yang-Mills
theory, using the background field method, we compute the gauge coupling
renormalization recovering the correct two-loop $\beta$-function without
generating any gauge-symmetry-violating term. These results highlight that,
despite its limitations for reconstructing the full effective action, the PT
flow retains the essential universal content of renormalization, accounting for
its reliability in diverse applications ranging from statistical models to
quantum gravity.

Abstract: In the framework of Lorentz covariant on-shell approach, interacting
continuous-spin fields and integer-spin fields in flat space are investigated.
Continuous-spin fields are considered by using a Lorentz vector superspace
formulation, while integer-spin fields are considered by using oscillator
formulation. All parity-even cubic vertices for self-interacting
continuous-spin fields realized as functions on the Lorentz vector superspace
are obtained. Cross-interactions of continuous-spin fields and integer-spin
fields are also derived. Several representatives of cubic vertices realized as
distributions are obtained. We show that manifestly Lorentz invariant formal
cubic action involving at least one continuous-spin field turns out to be
divergent. We find the modification of such action which maintains Lorentz
invariance and leads to finite cubic action. One-to-one correspondence of
Lorentz covariant cubic vertices and light-cone gauge cubic vertices is
demonstrated explicitly.

Abstract: We investigate the possibility of usage of the parametric X-ray radiation
(PXR) for the selective therapy of superficial sulfur-containing tumor tissues.
In these tissues, the concentration of sulfur atoms is significantly higher
than in healthy ones. Accordingly, the destruction of cancer cells is caused by
the ionization of sulfur atoms. The selective nature of the therapy is
determined by the narrow spectral-angular distribution of the PXR photon beam
and the resonant absorption of radiation by sulfur atoms. This leads to a
significant decrease in the total dose required to achieve the desired effects
compared to irradiation with conventional X-ray tubes or electron accelerators.

Abstract: The development of multicellular organisms entails a deep connection between
time-dependent biochemical processes taking place at the subcellular level, and
the resulting macroscopic phenotypes that arise in populations of up to
trillions of cells. A statistical mechanics of developmental processes would
help to understand how microscopic genotypes map onto macroscopic phenotypes, a
general goal across biology. Here we follow this approach, hypothesizing that
development should be understood as a thermodynamic transition between
non-equilibrium states. We test this hypothesis in the context of the fruit
fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism used widely in genetics and
developmental biology for over a century. Applying a variety of
information-theoretic measures to public transcriptomics datasets of whole fly
embryos during development, we show that the global temporal dynamics of gene
expression can be understood as a process that probabilistically guides
embryonic dynamics across macroscopic phenotypic stages. In particular, we
demonstrate signatures of irreversibility in the information complexity of
transcriptomic dynamics, as measured mainly by the permutation entropy of
indexed ensembles (PI entropy). Our results show that the dynamics of PI
entropy correlate strongly with developmental stages. Overall, this is a test
case in applying information complexity analysis to relate the statistical
mechanics of biomarkers to macroscopic developmental dynamics.

Abstract: We study the local bihamiltonian structures of the asymmetric rational
reductions of the 2D-Toda hierarchy (RR2T) of types $(2,1)$ and $(1,2)$ at the
full-dispersive level, and construct a three-dimensional generalized Frobenius
manifold with non-flat unity associated with the $(2,1)$-type. Furthermore, we
explicitly relate the $(2,1)$-type RR2T to the bi-graded Toda and constrained
KP hierarchies via linear reciprocal and Miura-type transformations.

Abstract: Parity and time-reversal (PT) symmetry is shown as the natural cause of
quasi-integrability of deformed integrable models. The condition for asymptotic
conservation of quasi-conserved charges appear as a direct consequence of the
PT-symmetric phase of the system, ensuring definite PT-properties of the
corresponding Lax pair as well as that of the anomalous contribution. This
construction applies to quasi-deformations of multiple systems such as KdV,

Abstract: We present new theoretical mechanisms for quantum speedup in the global
optimization of nonconvex functions, expanding the scope of quantum advantage
beyond traditional tunneling-based explanations. As our main building-block, we
demonstrate a rigorous correspondence between the spectral properties of
Schr\"{o}dinger operators and the mixing times of classical Langevin diffusion.
This correspondence motivates a mechanism for separation on functions with
unique global minimum: while quantum algorithms operate on the original
potential, classical diffusions correspond to a Schr\"{o}dinger operators with
a WKB potential having nearly degenerate global minima. We formalize these
ideas by proving that a real-space adiabatic quantum algorithm (RsAA) achieves
provably polynomial-time optimization for broad families of nonconvex
functions. First, for block-separable functions, we show that RsAA maintains
polynomial runtime while known off-the-shelf algorithms require exponential
time and structure-aware algorithms exhibit arbitrarily large polynomial
runtimes. These results leverage novel non-asymptotic results in semiclassical
analysis. Second, we use recent advances in the theory of intrinsic
hypercontractivity to demonstrate polynomial runtimes for RsAA on appropriately
perturbed strongly convex functions that lack global structure, while
off-the-shelf algorithms remain exponentially bottlenecked. In contrast to
prior works based on quantum tunneling, these separations do not depend on the
geometry of barriers between local minima. Our theoretical claims about
classical algorithm runtimes are supported by rigorous analysis and
comprehensive numerical benchmarking. These findings establish a rigorous
theoretical foundation for quantum advantage in continuous optimization and
open new research directions connecting quantum algorithms, stochastic
processes, and semiclassical analysis.

Abstract: Current quantum computers require algorithms that use limited resources
economically. In quantum machine learning, success hinges on quantum feature
maps, which embed classical data into the state space of qubits. We introduce
Quantum Feature-Map Learning via Analytic Iterative Reconstructions (Q-FLAIR),
an algorithm that reduces quantum resource overhead in iterative feature-map
circuit construction. It shifts workloads to a classical computer via partial
analytic reconstructions of the quantum model, using only a few evaluations.
For each probed gate addition to the ansatz, the simultaneous selection and
optimization of the data feature and weight parameter is then entirely
classical. Integrated into quantum neural network and quantum kernel support
vector classifiers, Q-FLAIR shows state-of-the-art benchmark performance. Since
resource overhead decouples from feature dimension, we train a quantum model on
a real IBM device in only four hours, surpassing 90% accuracy on the
full-resolution MNIST dataset (784 features, digits 3 vs 5). Such results were
previously unattainable, as the feature dimension prohibitively drives hardware
demands for fixed and search costs for adaptive ans\"atze. By rethinking
feature-map learning beyond black-box optimization, this work takes a concrete
step toward enabling quantum machine learning for real-world problems and
near-term quantum computers.

Abstract: Higher symmetries in interacting many-body systems often give rise to new
phases and unexpected dynamical behavior. Here, we theoretically investigate a
variant of the Dicke model with higher-order discrete symmetry, resulting from
complex-valued coupling coefficients between quantum emitters and a bosonic
mode. We propose a driven-dissipative realization of this model focusing on
optomechanical response of a driven atom tweezer array comprised of $n$
sub-ensembles and placed within an optical cavity, with the phase of the
driving field advancing stepwise between sub-ensembles. Examining stationary
points and their dynamical stability, we identify a phase diagram for $n\geq 3$
with three distinctive features: a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ($\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$)
symmetry-breaking superradiant phase for even (odd) $n$, a normal
unbroken-symmetry phase that is dynamically unstable due to non-reciprocal
forces between emitters, and a first-order phase transition separating these
phases. This $n$-phase Dicke model may be equivalently realized in a variety of
optomechanical or opto-magnonic settings, where it can serve as a testbed for
studying high-order symmetry breaking and non-reciprocal interactions in open
systems.

TL;DR: We developed a software package that computes permanents accurately, supporting multiple algorithms and automatically selecting the best one for different inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This is important because the permanent is used in key areas like computational complexity and machine learning, but no efficient software exists for its computation.

Method: Extend the Glynn algorithm to rectangular matrices, supporting combinatorial, Ryser, and Glynn methods with intelligent algorithm selection.

Result: The software, named matrix-permanent, is open-source and can handle large matrices efficiently, providing exact results for problems previously without viable solutions.

Conclusion: This tool fills a significant gap in computational mathematics, aiding fields that rely on permanent calculations.

Abstract: Evaluating the permanent of a matrix is a fundamental computation that
emerges in many domains, including traditional fields like computational
complexity theory, graph theory, many-body quantum theory and emerging
disciplines like machine learning and quantum computing. While conceptually
simple, evaluating the permanent is extremely challenging: no polynomial-time
algorithm is available (unless $\textsc{P} = \textsc{NP}$). To the best of our
knowledge there is no publicly available software that automatically uses the
most efficient algorithm for computing the permanent. In this work we designed,
developed, and investigated the performance of our software package which
evaluates the permanent of an arbitrary rectangular matrix, supporting three
algorithms generally regarded as the fastest while giving the exact solution
(the straightforward combinatoric algorithm, the Ryser algorithm, and the Glynn
algorithm) and, optionally, automatically switching to the optimal algorithm
based on the type and dimensionality of the input matrix. To do this, we
developed an extension of the Glynn algorithm to rectangular matrices. Our free
and open-source software package is distributed via Github, at

Conclusion: 该研究展示了在实际情况下通过最优控制实现对复杂量子体系的动力学操控的可能性。

Abstract: The quantum control of spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs) holds promise
for the targeted manipulation of magnetic field effects, with potential
applications ranging from the design of noise-resilient quantum information
processors to genetically encodable quantum sensors. However, achieving precise
handles over the intricate interplay between coherent electron spin dynamics
and incoherent relaxation processes in photoexcited radical-pair reactions
requires tractable approaches for numerically obtaining controls for large,
complex open quantum systems. Employing techniques relying on full
Liouville-space propagators becomes computationally infeasible for large spin
systems of realistic complexity. Here, we demonstrate how a control engineering
approach based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) can offer a viable
alternative by reporting on the successful application of PMP-optimal control
to steer the coherent and incoherent spin dynamics of noisy radical pairs. This
enables controls for prototypical radical-pair models that exhibit robustness
in the face of relevant noise sources and paves the way to incoherent control
of radical-pair spin dynamics.

Abstract: Precision sensing and imaging of weak static magnetic fields are crucial for
a variety of emerging nanoscale applications. While nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
centers in diamond provide exceptional AC magnetic field sensitivity with
nanoscale spatial resolution, their sensitivity to static (DC) magnetic fields
is fundamentally limited by the short dephasing time (T2*) due to spin-spin
interactions. In this work, we present a novel hybrid sensing approach that
integrates a soft ferromagnetic microwire with a single near-surface NV center
to amplify its response to external static magnetic fields. This hybrid
configuration achieves a DC magnetic field sensitivity of 63 nT/sqrt(Hz) for a
single NV center - about 500 times greater than conventional inhomogeneous
broadening- or T2*-limited magnetometry, with potential for further
enhancement. The compact and highly sensitive nature of this sensor opens new
opportunities for quantum sensing applications involving the detection of
static or slowly varying magnetic fields across diverse scientific and
technological domains.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that the quantum smooth label cover problem is RE-hard, contrasting with the quantum unique label cover problem's efficient decisional by Kempe, Regev, and Toner. It aligns with the RE-hardness of quantum label cover from MIP* = RE. Techniques include reductions from the halting problem and a quantum-sound version of Feige's 3SAT reduction, which could be of independent interest.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the computational complexity of quantum label cover problems, establishing their hardness under standard assumptions in quantum complexity theory. The motivation stems from understanding the limitations and capabilities of quantum algorithms in solving constraint satisfaction problems like label cover.

Method: The authors employ a series of reductions from the classical halting problem into the quantum smooth label cover problem. They use tools from quantum information theory and complexity, including quantum oracularization and quantum soundness concepts. The paper also incorporates a quantum-sound version of Feige's reduction from 3SAT to 3SAT5, which is a key component in classical complexity proofs.

Result: The main result of the paper is that the quantum smooth label cover problem is RE-hard. This finding contradicts the known efficient decision procedure for the quantum unique label cover problem. Additionally, the paper shows that the quantum oracularized smooth label cover problem is also RE-hard, supporting the alternative quantum unique games conjecture proposed by Mousavi and Spirig.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to the understanding of quantum constraint satisfaction problems by establishing their computational hardness. The techniques and results presented open new avenues for exploring the boundaries of quantum computational power and for developing new quantum algorithms or proving their impossibility.

Abstract: We show that the quantum smooth label cover problem is RE-hard. This
contrasts with the quantum unique label cover problem, which can be decided
efficiently by Kempe, Regev, and Toner (FOCS'08). Our result aligns with the
RE-hardness of the quantum label cover problem, which follows from the
celebrated MIP* = RE result of Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen
(ACM'21). Additionally, we show that the quantum oracularized smooth label
cover problem is also RE-hard. This aligns with the alternative quantum unique
games conjecture on the RE-hardness of the quantum oracularized unique label
cover problem proposed by Mousavi and Spirig (ITCS'25). Our techniques employ a
series of reductions from the halting problem to the quantum smooth label cover
problem, and include a quantum-sound version of Feige's reduction from 3SAT to
3SAT5 (STOC'96), which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Electronic voting systems face growing risks from cyberattacks and data

To address these challenges, we introduce a quantum-secure voting framework
that integrates Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), Dual-Key Symmetric Encryption,
and verifiable receipt mechanisms to strengthen the privacy, integrity, and
reliability of the voting process. The framework enables voters to establish
encryption keys securely, cast encrypted ballots, and verify their votes
through receipt-based confirmation, all without exposing the vote contents. To
evaluate performance, we simulate both quantum and classical communication
channels using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Results
demonstrate that the system can process large numbers of votes efficiently with
low latency and minimal error rates. This approach offers a scalable and
practical path toward secure, transparent, and verifiable electronic voting in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum technologies require efficient methods for verifying entanglement.

Method: Use a metasurface with dual-basis (σ_z and σ_y) projections to simultaneously measure commuting two-photon correlators.

Result: Reduces measurement overhead by half compared to sequential methods, enabling compact and scalable quantum photonics platforms.

Conclusion: The scheme provides a scalable approach for entanglement verification, beneficial for quantum key distribution, repeaters, and networks.

Abstract: Entanglement witnessing is essential for quantum technologies such as
computing, key distribution, and networking. Conventional bulk-optics methods
require sequential reconfiguration across multiple polarization bases, limiting
efficiency and scalability. We propose a metasurface-based analyzer that
performs dual-basis (\sigma_z and \sigma_y) projections simultaneously by
mapping them to orthogonal spatial modes. This allows direct access to the
commuting two-photon correlators \langle \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z \rangle and
\langle \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y \rangle required for entanglement witnessing.
The metasurface design employs meta-atoms engineered to impart independent
linear and circular phase delays through anisotropy and geometric control,
resulting in polarization-dependent beam deflection that separates H/V and R/L
components. This approach halves the measurement overhead compared to
sequential analysis while offering a compact, integrable platform for
chip-scale quantum photonics. The proposed scheme provides a path toward
efficient entanglement verification with applications in quantum key
distribution, quantum repeaters, and scalable quantum networks.

Method: The study involves creating an integrable model of dipolar bosons confined in a four-well potential with a star-shaped configuration. They adjust system parameters to identify a harmonic dynamical regime, allowing analytical description and precise manipulation of atomic population dynamics under external fields.

Result: The paper demonstrates three independent methods of controlling atomic population dynamics: frequency tuning, directional switching, and amplitude modulation, operating under two distinct configurations, which emulate an atomic 1:2 demultiplexer and 2:1 multiplexer.

Conclusion: The research advances the understanding of controlling quantum systems and provides tools for designing more efficient quantum devices.

Abstract: The ability to precisely control and predict the evolution of quantum states
is a fundamental requirement for advancing quantum technologies. Here, we
develop tunable atomic routing protocols based on an integrable model of
dipolar bosons confined in a four-well potential with a star-shaped
configuration. By adjusting the system parameters, we identify a harmonic
dynamical regime of the atomic population that can be treated analytically,
providing a complete description of the system's behaviour for precise
manipulation. We demonstrate three independent modes of control over the atomic
population dynamics under the action of an external field: frequency tuning via
variation in the field intensity, directional switching via spatial
displacement of the field, and amplitude modulation by varying its duration.
These modes operate under two distinct configurations: one source and two
drains, and, in reverse order, two sources and one drain. These cases emulate
an atomic 1:2 demultiplexer and 2:1 multiplexer, respectively. Our results may
contribute to the development of control mechanisms in the design of quantum
devices.

Motivation: Understanding quantum data hiding mechanisms with minimal entanglement.

Method: Constructing group-symmetric states, analyzing convex optimization problems.

Result: States are separable, perfectly orthogonal, and PPT.

Conclusion: Nonlocality can exist without entanglement.

Abstract: Quantum data hiding is the existence of pairs of bipartite quantum states
that are (almost) perfectly distinguishable with global measurements, yet close
to indistinguishable when only measurements implementable with local operations
and classical communication are allowed. Remarkably, data hiding states can
also be chosen to be separable, meaning that secrets can be hidden using no
entanglement that are almost irretrievable without entanglement -- this is
sometimes called `nonlocality without entanglement'. Essentially two families
of data hiding states were known prior to this work: Werner states and random
states. Hiding Werner states can be made either separable or globally perfectly
orthogonal, but not both -- separability comes at the price of orthogonality
being only approximate. Random states can hide many more bits, but they are
typically entangled and again only approximately orthogonal. In this paper, we
present an explicit construction of novel group-symmetric data hiding states
that are simultaneously separable, perfectly orthogonal, and even invariant
under partial transpose, thus exhibiting the phenomenon of nonlocality without
entanglement to the utmost extent. Our analysis leverages novel applications of
numerical analysis tools to study convex optimisation problems in quantum
information theory, potentially offering technical insights that extend beyond
this work.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to computational
electromagnetics (CEM) and photonic design, but classical solvers face high
costs for large or complex structures. Quantum Hamiltonian simulation provides
a framework to encode PDEs into unitary time evolution and has potential for
scalable electromagnetic analysis. We formulate Maxwell's equations in the
potential representation and embed governing equations, boundary conditions,
and observables consistently into Hamiltonian form. A key bottleneck is the
exponential growth of Hamiltonian terms for complex geometries; we examine this
issue and show that logical compression can substantially mitigate it,
especially for periodic or symmetric structures. As a proof of concept, we
simulate optical wave propagation through a metalens and illustrate that the
method can capture wavefront shaping and focusing behavior, suggesting its
applicability to design optimization tasks. This work highlights the
feasibility of Hamiltonian-based quantum simulation for photonic systems and
identifies structural conditions favorable for efficient execution.

Abstract: The diamond sensor has emerged as a promising platform for quantum sensing,
enabling the estimation of physical quantities -- such as microwave~(MW) field
-- with precision unattainable by classical counterpart. However, traditional
diamond sensors suffer severe precision degradation when the signal MW is not
resonant with the sensor transition frequency. Here, we propose and demonstrate
a Floquet diamond sensor~(FDS) for high-precision off-resonant MW amplitude
sensing without attenuating the strength of the signal MW. The periodic driven
field effectively induces an quasi-energy shift that matches the off-resonant
MW frequency. The measurement precision of FDS is characterized by quantum
Fisher information, which approaches the ultimate precision -- Heisenberg limit
-- within the coherent time. Furthermore, the FDS exhibits robust tolerance to
practical control errors and is compatible with dynamical coupling protocol,
enabling a robust and high-sensitivity magnetic sensing. Our results confirm
the quantum advantage of quantum sensing and provide a practical technology for
high-precision off-resonant MW sensing.

Sagnac-type photon source is designed and demonstrated, in which two photons
with wavelengths at 810 and 1550~nm are highly entangled in polarization degree
of freedom. The two photons are generated from a periodically poled lithium
niobate crystal pumped with a 532~nm continuous-wave laser, via type-0
nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The polarization of three
lights is rotated by a single periscope, which makes the Sagnac interferometer
compact and stable. The generated two photons are with high brightness of
$3\times10^4$ pairs/s/mW, which are highly entangled with fidelity of
$0.985\pm0.002$. The entanglement is verified by violating the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality with $\mathcal S =2.756\pm0.007$.
Finally, teleportation is demonstrated with this nondegenerate source, in which
photonic states at 810~nm is teleported to 1550~nm with fidelity of
$0.955\pm0.003$.

*Samuel B. Steakley,Elia Zanoni,Carlo Maria Scandolo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses a hierarchy of quantum resources beyond the first two orders by introducing a systematic framework based on types and a generalized product operation to account for interconvertibility between different orders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a comprehensive framework for quantum resource theory that unites various orders of quantum resources, ensuring a unified approach to their characterization and operational treatment.

Method: The method involves introducing a system of types to categorize quantum objects at different orders, defining a generalized tensor product (parallel product) for maps of distinct orders, and establishing convex cones for generalized complete positivity across orders.

Result: A unified framework is established that allows for the systematic study and characterization of quantum resources at all orders, providing tools for their operational treatment and interconversion.

Conclusion: This framework advances quantum resource theory by addressing all orders uniformly and providing a foundation for the operational treatment of quantum objects at any order, enabling a deeper understanding of their interconvertibility and admissibility.

Abstract: Quantum resources exist in a hierarchy of multiple levels. At order zero,
quantum states are transformed by linear maps (channels, or gates) in order to
perform computations or simulate other states. At order one, gates and channels
are transformed by linear maps (superchannels) in order to simulate other
gates. To develop a full hierarchy of quantum resources, beyond those first two
orders, and to account for the fact that quantum protocols can interconvert
resources of different orders, we need a theoretical framework that addresses
all orders in a uniform manner. We introduce a framework based on a system of
types, which label the different kinds of objects that are present at different
orders. We equip the framework with a parallel product operation that modifies
and generalizes the tensor product so as to be operationally meaningful for
maps of distinct and arbitrary orders. Finally, we introduce a family of convex
cones that generalize the notion of complete positivity to all orders, with the
aim of characterizing the objects that are physically admissible, facilitating
an operational treatment of quantum objects at any order.

Motivation: 研究量子电路与经典电路的计算能力差异。

Method: 相对于随机oracle，证明多项式大小的量子电路可以采样分布，而亚指数大小的经典电路无法近似到TV距离1−o(1)。

Result: Aaronson和Arkhipov 2011年的工作显示了精确采样（TV距离0）的分离，但目前仅有均匀算法的近似采样分离。

Conclusion: 有了新颖的难化提升引理，成功证明近似采样在TV距离1−o(1)下的分离。

Abstract: We give new evidence that quantum circuits are substantially more powerful
than classical circuits. We show, relative to a random oracle, that
polynomial-size quantum circuits can sample distributions that
subexponential-size classical circuits cannot approximate even to TV distance
$1-o(1)$. Prior work of Aaronson and Arkhipov (2011) showed such a separation
for the case of exact sampling (i.e. TV distance $0$), but separations for
approximate sampling were only known for uniform algorithms.
  A key ingredient in our proof is a new hardness amplification lemma for the
classical query complexity of the Yamakawa-Zhandry (2022) search problem. We
show that the probability that any family of query algorithms collectively
finds $k$ distinct solutions decays exponentially in $k$.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A quantum-classical hybrid method for large-scale MIQP is proposed, integrating D-Wave CQM solver into extended Benders decomposition to solve the master problem. Results show near-optimal solutions and potential exponential speedups over classical solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance the efficiency of solving complex optimization problems by leveraging quantum computing capabilities.

Method: The methodology combines extended Benders decomposition with the D-Wave CQM solver to address the computational bottleneck of the master problem in MIQP.

Result: The hybrid approach yields near-optimal solutions and, for certain instances, exponential speedups compared to leading classical solvers.

Conclusion: This research opens new possibilities for utilizing quantum computing in optimization problems, particularly where classical methods fall short in scalability and performance.

Abstract: We propose a quantum-classical hybrid method for solving large-scale
mixed-integer quadratic problems (MIQP). Although extended Benders
decomposition is effective for MIQP, its master problem which handles the
integer and quadratic variables often becomes a computational bottleneck. To
address this challenge, we integrate the D-Wave CQM solver into the
decomposition framework to solve the master problem directly. Our results show
that this hybrid approach efficiently yields near-optimal solutions and, for
certain problem instances, achieves exponential speedups over the leading
commercial classical solver. These findings highlight a promising computational
strategy for tackling complex mixed-integer optimization problems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of scaling up quantum chips and addresses these challenges by demonstrating how spin coherence can be maintained through careful control of the shuttle velocity and regions avoided, providing a pathway for practical integration into silicon quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome scalability issues in quantum computing by understanding and controlling spin coherence in electron-based qubits within silicon quantum shuttling devices.

Method: The method involves fabricating a 40 nm x 400 nm shuttle device, mapping the valley splitting energy (E_{VS}) across its surface, and analyzing spin coherence using conveyor-belt shuttling techniques to observe how E_{VS} variations impact coherence and shuttle velocity.

Result: The key findings are that E_{VS} varies significantly across the shuttle device, with a wide range affecting spin coherence. By selecting optimal shuttle paths around low E_{VS} regions, the researchers achieved enhanced spin coherence sustained by motional narrowing effects.

Conclusion: This experimental work confirms the theoretical predictions about spin decoherence and provides practical strategies for integrating quantum shuttling into scalable quantum computing architectures.

Abstract: Silicon quantum chips offer a promising path toward scalable, fault-tolerant
quantum computing, with the potential to host millions of qubits. However,
scaling up dense quantum-dot arrays and enabling qubit interconnections through
shuttling are hindered by uncontrolled lateral variations of the valley
splitting energy $E_{VS}$. We map $E_{VS}$ across a $40 \, $nm x $400 \, $nm
region of a $^{28}$Si/Si$_{0.7}$Ge$_{0.3}$ shuttle device and analyze the spin
coherence of a single electron spin transported by conveyor-belt shuttling. We
observe that the $E_{VS}$ varies over a wide range from $1.5 \, \mu$eV to $200
\, \mu$eV and is dominated by SiGe alloy disorder. In regions of low $E_{VS}$
and at spin-valley resonances, spin coherence is reduced and its dependence on
shuttle velocity matches predictions. Rapid and frequent traversal of
low-$E_{VS}$ regions induces a regime of enhanced spin coherence explained by
motional narrowing. By selecting shuttle trajectories that avoid problematic
areas on the $E_{VS}$ map, we achieve transport over tens of microns with
coherence limited only by the coupling to a static electron spin entangled with
the mobile qubit. Our results provide experimental confirmation of the theory
of spin-decoherence of mobile electron spin-qubits and present practical
strategies to integrate conveyor-mode qubit shuttling into silicon quantum
chips.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new method for phase estimation in a displacement-assisted SU(1,1) interferometer was proposed, incorporating photon recycling. The method showed improved performance under both single-intensity and homodyne detection, approaching the quantum Cramér-Rao bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase sensitivity in interferometers is crucial for various quantum metrology applications. The challenge of enhancing phase estimation without compromising the efficiency or complexity of the system motivated this research.

Method: The authors used the photon recycling technique within the displacement-assisted SU(1,1) (DSU(1,1)) interferometer framework. They evaluated the system under two detection schemes: single-intensity detection (SID) and homodyne detection (HD). Quantum Fisher information and the quantum Cramér-Rao bound were employed to assess the sensitivity and determine the system's ultimate limits.

Result: The proposed method significantly improved phase estimation sensitivity for some conditions, especially when using photon recycling. The system's performance was comparable to the theoretical quantum limits, suggesting that the method is a viable solution for enhancing phase sensitivity in interferometers.

Conclusion: The research introduces a promising approach for improving phase sensitivity in interferometers through photon recycling, achieving near-optimal performance as indicated by the quantum Cramér-Rao bound.

Abstract: We propose a novel method for enhancing phase estimation in the
displacement-assisted SU(1,1) (DSU(1,1)) interferometer by incorporating the
photon recycling technique, evaluated under single-intensity detection (SID)
and homodyne detection (HD) schemes. Our analysis showed that utilizing the
photon recycling technique, the photon-recycled DSU(1,1) interferometer
performs better than the conventional DSU(1,1) interferometer for some
conditions. We also showed that this improvement is possible in both SID and HD
schemes. In addition, to discuss the maximum sensitivity achieved by our
proposed model, we have calculated the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB)
within the framework and found that our proposed model approaches the QCRB.
Therefore, we believe that our findings offer a promising new approach to
improve phase sensitivity through photon recycling.

Abstract: A quantum computing algorithm for rhythm generation is presented, which aims
to expand and explore quantum computing applications in the arts, particularly
in music. The algorithm maps quantum random walk trajectories onto a
rhythmspace -- a 2D interface that interpolates rhythmic patterns. The
methodology consists of three stages. The first stage involves designing
quantum computing algorithms and establishing a mapping between the qubit space
and the rhythmspace. To minimize circuit depth, a decomposition of a 2D quantum
random walk into two 1D quantum random walks is applied. The second stage
focuses on biasing the directionality of quantum random walks by introducing
classical potential fields, adjusting the probability distribution of the wave
function based on the position gradient within these fields. Four potential
fields are implemented: a null potential, a linear field, a Gaussian potential,
and a Gaussian potential under inertial dynamics. The third stage addresses the
sonification of these paths by generating MIDI drum pattern messages and
transmitting them to a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). This work builds upon
existing literature that applies quantum computing to simpler qubit spaces with
a few positions, extending the formalism to a 2D x-y plane. It serves as a
proof of concept for scalable quantum computing-based generative random walk
algorithms in music and audio applications. Furthermore, the approach is
applicable to generic multidimensional sound spaces, as the algorithms are not
strictly constrained to rhythm generation and can be adapted to different
musical structures.

Abstract: We examine the stationary--state equations for lattices with generalized
Markovian dephasing and relaxation. When the Hamiltonian is quadratic, the
single--particle correlation matrix has a closed system of equations even in
the presence of these two processes. The resulting equations have a vectorized
form related to, but distinct from, Lyapunov's equation. We present an
efficient solution that helps to achieve the scaling limit, e.g., of the
current decay with lattice length. As an example, we study the
super--diffusive--to--diffusive transition in a lattice with long--range
hopping and dephasing. The approach enables calculations with up to $10^4$
sites, representing an increase of $10$ to $40$ times over prior studies. This
enables a more precise extraction of the diffusion exponent, enhances agreement
with theoretical results, and supports the presence of a phase transition.
There is a wide range of problems that have Markovian relaxation, noise, and
driving. They include quantum networks for machine--learning--based
classification and extended reservoir approaches (ERAs) for transport. The
results here will be useful for these classes of problems.

Motivation: Precise measurement of laser parameters for qubit gate operations is crucial in trapped-ion quantum computing, but achieving this in ultra-high vacuum is challenging.

Method: The researchers use the four-photon Stark Shift effect in $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ions to sense the laser beam properties.

Result: By using ion sensing, they successfully optimize laser parameters and achieve higher-speed qubit gates with better error tolerance.

Conclusion: This work opens a new avenue for using ions as sensors to directly characterize required laser parameters for quantum operations, improving system scalability and reliability.

Abstract: Laser-driven operations are a common approach for engineering one- and
two-qubit gates in trapped-ion arrays. Measuring key parameters of these
lasers, such as beam sizes, intensities, and polarizations, is central to
predicting and optimizing gate speeds and stability. Unfortunately, it is
challenging to accurately measure these properties at the ion location within
an ultra-high vacuum chamber. Here, we demonstrate how the ions themselves may
be used as sensors to directly characterize the laser beams needed for quantum
gate operations. Making use of the four-photon Stark Shift effect in
$^{171}$Yb$^+$ ions, we measure the profiles, alignments, and polarizations of
the lasers driving counter-propagating Raman transitions. We then show that
optimizing the parameters of each laser individually leads to higher-speed
Raman-driven gates with smaller susceptibility to errors. Our approach
demonstrates the capability of trapped ions to probe their local environments
and to provide useful feedback for improving system performance.

Abstract: Isospectrally patterned lattices (IPL) have recently been shown to exhibit a
rich band structure comprising both regimes of localized as well as extended
states. The localized states show a single center localization behaviour with a
characteristic localization length. We derive a continuum analogue of the IPL
which allows us to determine analytically its eigenvalue spectrum and
eigenstates thereby obtaining an expression for the localization length which
involves the ratio of the coupling among the cells of the lattice and the phase
gradient across the lattice. This continuum model breaks chiral symmetry but
still shows a pairing of partner states with positive and negative energies
except for the ground state. We perform a corresponding symmetry analysis which
illuminates the continuum models structure as compared to a corresponding
chirally symmetric Hamiltonian.

Abstract: Many quantum algorithms for ground-state preparation and energy estimation
require the implementation of high-degree polynomials of a Hamiltonian to
achieve better convergence rates. Their circuit implementation typically relies
on quantum signal processing (QSP), whose circuit depth is proportional to the
degree of the polynomial. Previous studies exploit the Chebyshev polynomial
approximation, which requires a Chebyshev series of degree
$O(\sqrt{n\ln(1/\delta)})$ for an $n$-degree polynomial, where $\delta$ is the
approximation error. However, the approximation is limited to only a few
functions, including monomials, truncated exponential, Gaussian, and error
functions. In this work, we present the most generalized function approximation
methods for $\delta$-approximating linear combinations or products of
polynomial-approximable functions with quadratically reduced-degree
polynomials. We extend the list of polynomial-approximable functions by showing
that the functions of cosine and sine can also be $\delta$-approximated by
quadratically reduced-degree Laurent polynomials. We demonstrate that various
Hamiltonian functions for quantum ground-state preparation and energy
estimation can be implemented with quadratically shallow circuits.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a quasi-PT-symmetric system of two resonators, one of which
interacts with a finite-size environment. The interaction with the environment
leads to energy losses in the resonators, and the finite size of the
environment leads to a non-Markovian dynamics of the relaxation process. We
demonstrate that non-Markovian processes in the quasi-PT-symmetric system can
make the states of the system infinitely living, loss-protected states, even in
the absence of gain. There is a critical value of the interaction between the
resonator and the environment below which any state of the system is
loss-protected. When the interaction magnitude is greater than the critical
value, depending on the coupling strength between the resonators, either one or
both states are unprotected. We show that the boundaries of regions with
different numbers of protected states are determined by the relaxation rates in
the quasi-PT-symmetric system, calculated in the Markovian approximation. By
changing the coupling strength between the resonators and the interaction
magnitude between the resonator and the environment, the system switches
between modes with two, one, or no loss-protected states. This makes it
possible to realize stable PT-symmetric devices based on purely dissipative
systems. The obtained results are applicable to quantum systems with single
excitations, allowing the concept of PT symmetry to be extended to such
systems.

Motivation: Studying strongly correlated fermionic systems with existing simulation methods is computationally expensive. This paper aims to propose a more efficient approach by leveraging Clifford disentanglers within Grassmann tensor networks.

Method: The authors developed a variational Grassmann tensor network (TN) framework that natively encodes fermionic statistics. They integrated locally defined Clifford circuits to address entanglement entropy and reduce bond dimension.

Result: The proposed method successfully simulates benchmark models, such as tight-binding and t-V models. The implementation significantly reduces the number of disentangling gates, from 720 to just 32, reducing computational effort while increasing accuracy in ground-state energy estimates.

Conclusion: The combination of Clifford-augmented Grassmann tensor networks with fermionic formalism opens a new pathway for studying complex quantum strongly correlated systems in higher dimensions with both efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in combining Clifford circuits with tensor network (TN)
states have shown that classically simulable disentanglers can significantly
reduce entanglement, mitigating the bond-dimension bottleneck in TN
simulations. In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on
Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while
preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within
the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the
tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling
removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a
reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates.
Interestingly, imposing the natural Grassmann-evenness constraint on the
Clifford circuits significantly reduces the number of disentangling gates, from
720 to just 32, yielding a far more efficient implementation. These findings
highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and
accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly
in higher dimensions.

Abstract: With the rapid advances in quantum computer architectures and the emerging
prospect of large-scale quantum memory, it is becoming essential to classically
verify that remote devices genuinely allocate the promised quantum memory with
specified number of qubits and coherence time. In this paper, we introduce a
new concept, proofs of quantum memory (PoQM). A PoQM is an interactive protocol
between a classical probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) verifier and a quantum
polynomial-time (QPT) prover over a classical channel where the verifier can
verify that the prover has possessed a quantum memory with a certain number of
qubits during a specified period of time. PoQM generalize the notion of proofs
of quantumness (PoQ) [Brakerski, Christiano, Mahadev, Vazirani, and Vidick,
JACM 2021]. Our main contributions are a formal definition of PoQM and its
constructions based on hardness of LWE. Specifically, we give two constructions
of PoQM. The first is of a four-round and has negligible soundness error under
subexponential-hardness of LWE. The second is of a polynomial-round and has
inverse-polynomial soundness error under polynomial-hardness of LWE. As a
lowerbound of PoQM, we also show that PoQM imply one-way puzzles. Moreover, a
certain restricted version of PoQM implies quantum computation classical
communication (QCCC) key exchange.

Abstract: Approximate quantum error correction (AQEC) provides a versatile framework
for both quantum information processing and probing many-body entanglement. We
reveal a fundamental tension between the error-correcting power of an AQEC and
the hardness of code state preparation. More precisely, through a novel
application of the Lov\'asz local lemma, we establish a fundamental trade-off
between local indistinguishability and circuit complexity, showing that
orthogonal short-range entangled states must be distinguishable via a local
operator. These results offer a powerful tool for exploring quantum circuit
complexity across diverse settings. As applications, we derive stronger
constraints on the complexity of AQEC codes with transversal logical gates and
establish strong complexity lower bounds for W state preparation. Our framework
also provides a novel perspective for systems with Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type
constraints.

### [126] [Quantum Error Correction with Superpositions of Squeezed Fock States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04209)
*Yexiong Zeng,Fernando Quijandría,Clemens Gneiting,Franco Nori*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new bosonic code uses squeezed Fock states to correct both photon loss and dephasing, with high precision and experiment friendliness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  protect quantum information against common noise processes.

Method:  Uses squeezed states and phase-space rotations to achieve error correction.

Result: Efficient code with error scaling exp(-7r), surpassing previous methods.

Conclusion: Provides a practical alternative for fault-tolerant quantum computing with bosonic qubits.

Abstract: Bosonic codes, leveraging infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces for redundancy,
offer great potential for encoding quantum information. However, the
realization of a practical continuous-variable bosonic code that can
simultaneously correct both single-photon loss and dephasing errors remains
elusive, primarily due to the absence of exactly orthogonal codewords and the
lack of an experiment-friendly state preparation scheme. Here, we propose a
code based on the superposition of squeezed Fock states with an
error-correcting capability that scales as $\propto\exp(-7r)$, where $r$ is the
squeezing level. The codewords remain orthogonal at all squeezing levels. The
Pauli-X operator acts as a rotation in phase space is an error-transparent
gate, preventing correctable errors from propagating outside the code space
during logical operations. In particular, this code achieves high-precision
error correction for both single-photon loss and dephasing, even at moderate
squeezing levels. Building on this code, we develop quantum error correction
schemes that exceed the break-even threshold, supported by analytical
derivations of all necessary quantum gates. Our code offers a competitive
alternative to previous encodings for quantum computation using continuous
bosonic qubits.

Conclusion: 因果关系和非联合可测量性在提升量子体系的功功能中起着关键作用，这对于理解量子效应对功涨落和平均值的影响具有重要意义。

Abstract: We employ the operational quasiprobability (OQ) as a work distribution, which
reproduces the Jarzynski equality and yields the average work consistent with
the classical definition. The OQ distribution can be experimentally implemented
through the end-point measurement and the two-point measurement scheme. Using
this framework, we demonstrate the explicit contribution of coherence to the
fluctuation, the average, and the second moment of work. In a two-level system,
we show that non-joint measurability, a generalized notion of measurement
incompatibility, can increase the amount of extractable work beyond the
classical bound imposed by jointly measurable measurements. We further prove
that the real part of Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) and the OQ are
equivalent in two-level systems, and they are nonnegative for binary unbiased
measurements if and only if the measurements are jointly measurable. In a
three-level Nitrogen-vacancy center system, the OQ and the KDQ exhibit
different amounts of negativities while enabling the same work extraction,
implying that the magnitude of negativity is not a faithful indicator of
nonclassical work. These results highlight that coherence and non-joint
measurability play fundamental roles in the enhancement of work.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new framework for filtered-state preparation in quantum computing is presented, which significantly improves the accuracy of quantum algorithms by enhancing state overlap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State preparation is a critical step in quantum algorithms, especially for quantum error correction and simulation. This paper addresses the challenge of preparing quantum states with sufficient overlap to the desired eigenstates.

Method: The authors propose a unified filtering framework that uses both polynomial and trigonometric realizations for spectral filtering. This method allows for the trade-off analysis between amplifying state overlap and preparation cost. Specific filters introduced include Gaussian and Krylov subspace-based filters, which use low-rank projections to suppress excited-state contributions.

Result: The filtered QPE (FQPE) method shows a significant reduction in runtime for high-precision calculations on Fermi-Hubbard models, achieving an improvement by more than two orders of magnitude while amplifying the state overlap by over a factor of one hundred.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel method for state preparation that effectively mitigates the challenges associated with traditional techniques, demonstrating practical benefits in quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Accurate state preparation is a critical bottleneck in many quantum
algorithms, particularly those for ground state energy estimation. Even in
fault-tolerant quantum computing, preparing a quantum state with sufficient
overlap to the desired eigenstate remains a major challenge. To address this,
we develop a unified framework for filtered-state preparation that enhances the
overlap of a given input state through spectral filtering. This framework
encompasses the polynomial and trigonometric realizations of filters, allowing
a transparent analysis of the trade-offs between overlap amplification and
preparation cost. As examples, we introduce signal-processing-inspired filters,
such as Gaussian filters and Krylov subspace-based filters, that adaptively
suppress excited-state contributions using low-rank projections. Within this
framework, we further develop a filtered variant of QPE (FQPE) that mitigates
the unfavorable dependence on the initial overlap present in standard QPE.
Numerical experiments on Fermi-Hubbard models show that FQPE reduces the total
runtime by more than two orders of magnitude in the high-precision regime, with
overlap amplification exceeding a factor of one hundred.

Abstract: Silicon nitride microresonators driven by strong pump pulses can generate
squeezed light in a dominant spectral-temporal mode, a central resource for
continuous-variable quantum computation. In the high parametric gain regime,
several effects, including self- and cross-phase modulation as well as
time-ordering corrections, become significant and can degrade source
performance. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the generation of
squeezed light from a silicon nitride resonator under pulsed pumping, spanning
from low to high parametric gain up to 16 photons/pulse. We experimentally
study how the average photon number and the first- and second- order
correlations of the squeezed marginal modes evolve with increasing pulse
energy, across various frequency detunings and pulse durations. Furthermore, we
analyze the errors introduced by multi-pair emissions in estimating the joint
temporal intensity via time-resolved coincidence measurements. We propose and
demonstrate an error-correction strategy based on the marginal distributions of
time-resolved multi-photon events. Our results provide a practical strategy for
optimizing the gain and the temporal mode structure of pulsed squeezed light
sources in microresonators, elucidating the physical mechanisms and limitations
that govern source performance in the high gain regime.

Conclusion: 这项研究打破了量子并行化猜想，展示了量子计算的强大潜力。

Abstract: Parallelization is a major challenge in quantum algorithms due to physical
constraints like no-cloning. This is vividly illustrated by the conjecture of
Moore and Nilsson from their seminal work on quantum circuit complexity [MN01,
announced 1998]: unitaries of a deceptively simple form--controlled-unitary
"staircases"--require circuits of minimum depth $\Omega(n)$. If true, this
lower bound would represent a major break from classical parallelism and prove
a quantum-native analogue of the famous NC $\neq$ P conjecture.
  In this work we settle the Moore-Nilsson conjecture in the negative by
compressing all circuits in the class to depth $O(\log n)$, which is the best
possible. The parallelizations are exact, ancilla-free, and can be computed in
poly($n$) time. We also consider circuits restricted to 2D connectivity, for
which we derive compressions of optimal depth $O(\sqrt{n})$.
  More generally, we make progress on the project of quantum parallelization by
introducing a quantum blockwise precomputation technique somewhat analogous to
the method of Arlazarov, Dini\v{c}, Kronrod, and Farad\v{z}ev [Arl+70] in
classical dynamic programming, often called the "Four-Russians method." We
apply this technique to more-general "cascade" circuits as well, obtaining for
example polynomial depth reductions for staircases of controlled
$\log(n)$-qubit unitaries.

Conclusion: The paper opens new possibilities for quantum computing in image processing by applying quantum walk search algorithms to edge detection, offering a faster and more effective solution than classical methods.

Abstract: Quantum walk has emerged as an essential tool for searching marked vertices

algorithm have enabled it to effectively handle multiple marked vertices,
expanding its range of applications further. In this article, we propose a
novel application of this advanced quantum walk search algorithm for the edge

Given the probabilistic nature of quantum computing, obtaining measurement
result with a high success probability is essential alongside faster
computation time. Our quantum walk search algorithm demonstrates a high success
probability in detecting the image edges compared to the existing quantum edge
detection methods and outperforms classical edge detection methods with a
quadratically faster speed. A small Qiskit circuit implementation of our method
using a one-dimensional quantum walk search has been executed in Qiskit's

Abstract: The discrete-time quantum walk on the Johnson graph $J(n,k)$ is a useful tool
for performing target vertex searches with high success probability. This graph
is defined by $n$ distinct elements, with vertices being all the
\(\binom{n}{k}\) $k$-element subsets and two vertices are connected by an edge
if they differ exactly by one element. However, most works in the literature
focus solely on the search for a single target vertex on the Johnson graph. In
this article, we utilize lackadaisical quantum walk--a form of discrete-time
coined quantum walk with a wighted self-loop at each vertex of the graph--along
with our recently proposed modified coin operator, $\mathcal{C}_g$, to find
multiple target vertices on the Johnson graph $J(n,k)$ for various values of
$k$. Additionally, a comparison based on the numerical analysis of the
performance of the $\mathcal{C}_g$ coin operator in searching for multiple
target vertices on the Johnson graph, against various other frequently used
coin operators by the discrete-time quantum walk search algorithms, shows that
only $\mathcal{C}_g$ coin can search for multiple target vertices with a very
high success probability in all the scenarios discussed in this article,
outperforming other widely used coin operators in the literature.

Conclusion: 该研究为基于非物理操作假设的 quantum cryptography 理论基础提供了新的方向，展示了如何构建和证明基本的 primitives，如OWPuzzs，这些贡献有助于更广泛的应用开发。

Abstract: One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs) introduced by Khurana and Tomer [STOC 2024] are a
natural quantum analogue of one-way functions (OWFs), and one of the most
fundamental primitives in ''Microcrypt'' where OWFs do not exist but quantum
cryptography is possible. OWPuzzs are implied by almost all quantum
cryptographic primitives, and imply several important applications such as
non-interactive commitments and multi-party computations. A significant goal in
the field of quantum cryptography is to base OWPuzzs on plausible assumptions
that will not imply OWFs. In this paper, we base OWPuzzs on hardness of
non-collapsing measurements. To that end, we introduce a new complexity class,
$\mathbf{SampPDQP}$, which is a sampling version of the decision class
$\mathbf{PDQP}$ introduced in [Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons, and Lee, ITCS
2016]. We show that if $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ is hard on average for quantum
polynomial time, then OWPuzzs exist. $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ is the class of
sampling problems that can be solved by a classical polynomial-time algorithm
that can make a single query to a non-collapsing measurement oracle, which is a
''magical'' oracle that can sample measurement results on quantum states
without collapsing the states. Such non-collapsing measurements are highly
unphysical operations that should be hard to realize in quantum
polynomial-time. We also study upperbounds of the hardness of
$\mathbf{SampPDQP}$. We introduce a new primitive, distributional
collision-resistant puzzles (dCRPuzzs), which are a natural quantum analogue of
distributional collision-resistant hashing [Dubrov and Ishai, STOC 2006]. We
show that dCRPuzzs imply average-case hardness of $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ (and
therefore OWPuzzs as well). We also show that two-message
honest-statistically-hiding commitments with classical communication and
one-shot signatures [Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, Zhandry, STOC 2020] imply
dCRPuzzs.

Abstract: Meyer and Wallach proposed the average norm squared of the wedge products of
the projections of a state onto the single qubit subspaces as the global
entanglement measure. Meyer and Wallach's global entanglement has the
significant impact. We propose the average determinant of reduced density
matrices for each qubit as a global entanglement measure. We show that these
two measures are the same algebraically though they use different concepts. By
means of the properties of reduced density matrices, we can explore the present
measure. We propose a decomposition law for the present measure, demonstrate
that the present measure just measures the average mixedness for each qubit and
the average 1-tangle, and indicate that for n-qubit W state, the average
mixedness for each qubit and 1-tangle almost vanish for large number of qubits.
We also point out that for two quits, the present measure is just the square of
the concurrence while for three qubits, the present measure is or greater than
3-tangle.

TL;DR:  proposes a new protocol for two-qubit gates in semiconductor quantum computing that addresses decoherence and control errors by eliminating ac-modulation coupling and implementing continuous dynamical decoupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: scalable quantum computation with high-fidelity operations is a key goal in quantum computing. achieving this requires overcoming decoherence and control errors in two-qubit gates.

Method: utilizes local microwave drives on exchange-coupled spin qubits. the scheme employs continuous dynamical decoupling for low-frequency noise suppression. it also eliminates the need for ac-modulation coupling, avoiding associated control issues.

Result: simulations show the protocol achieves high gate fidelity, beyond fault-tolerance thresholds under realistic experimental conditions.

Conclusion: this protocol enables scalable, high-fidelity two-qubit operations in semiconductor spin qubits, providing a foundation for practical quantum processors.

Abstract: Scalable quantum computation demands high-fidelity two-qubit gates. However,
decoherence and control errors are inevitable, which can decrease the quality
of implemented quantum operations. We propose a robust iSWAP gate protocol for
semiconductor spin qubits, which is a promising platform for scalable quantum
computing. Our scheme uses only local microwave drives on conventional
exchange-coupled spin qubits. This approach simultaneously addresses two
critical challenges on semiconductor quantum computing: it suppresses
low-frequency noise via continuous dynamical decoupling, and it circumvents the
control difficulties associated with the ac modulation of the exchange
interaction. We further develop a composite pulse sequence to remove
drive-strength constraints and a dynamically corrected method to provide
first-order immunity to microwave amplitude errors.Numerical simulations
confirm that our scheme can achieve fidelity above the fault-tolerance
threshold under current experimental conditions, offering a building block for
practical quantum processors.

### [138] [Black-Box Separation Between Pseudorandom Unitaries, Pseudorandom Isometries, and Pseudorandom Function-Like States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04486)
*Aditya Gulati,Yao-Ting Lin,Tomoyuki Morimae,Shogo Yamada*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the relationships between quantum analogues of pseudorandom functions, such as pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs), pseudorandom isometries (PRIs), and pseudorandom function-like state generators (PRFSGs). It establishes that there are no black-box constructions for certain parameters, which suggests that these quantum primitives may not be equivalent, despite implications from one to another.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationships and equivalences between different pseudorandom primitives is fundamental in cryptography, particularly in transitioning from classical to quantum cryptographic primitives and ensuring security across various cryptographic applications.

Method: The paper utilizes quantum oracle separation techniques, specifically constructing a unitary oracle and employing an adversary based on quantum singular value transformation to differentiate the constructions of PRUs, PRIs, and PRFSGs.

Result: The paper demonstrates that PRUs imply PRIs, which in turn imply PRFSGs, but the reverse implications do not hold. Furthermore, it shows that black-box constructions for certain parameters (e.g., O(logλ)-ancilla PRUs, PRIs with O(logλ) stretch) from others are impossible, implying stepwise equivalences are not generally possible.

Conclusion: This work provides crucial insights into the hierarchy and separations of quantum pseudorandom primitives, highlighting that they are not all equivalent and that certain constructions may be fundamentally impossible without quantum computational power to differentiate them.

Abstract: Pseudorandom functions (PRFs) are one of the most fundamental primitives in
classical cryptography. On the other hand, in quantum cryptography, it is
possible that PRFs do not exist but their quantum analogues could exist, and
still enabling many applications including SKE, MACs, commitments, multiparty
computations, and more. Pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) [Ji, Liu, Song, Crypto
2018], pseudorandom isometries (PRIs) [Ananth, Gulati, Kaleoglu, Lin, Eurocrypt
2024], and pseudorandom function-like state generators (PRFSGs) [Ananth, Qian,
Yuen, Crypto 2022] are major quantum analogs of PRFs. PRUs imply PRIs, and PRIs
imply PRFSGs, but the converse implications remain unknown. An important open
question is whether these natural quantum analogues of PRFs are equivalent. In
this paper, we partially resolve this question by ruling out black-box
constructions of them:
  1. There are no black-box constructions of $O(\log\lambda)$-ancilla PRUs from
PRFSGs. 2. There are no black-box constructions of $O(\log\lambda)$-ancilla
PRIs with $O(\log\lambda)$ stretch from PRFSGs. 3. There are no black-box
constructions of $O(\log\lambda)$-ancilla PRIs with $O(\log\lambda)$ stretch
from PRIs with $\Omega(\lambda)$ stretch.
  Here, $O(\log\lambda)$-ancilla means that the generation algorithm uses at
most $O(\log\lambda)$ ancilla qubits. PRIs with $s(\lambda)$ stretch is PRIs
mapping $\lambda$ qubits to $\lambda+s(\lambda)$ qubits. To rule out the above
black-box constructions, we construct a unitary oracle that separates them. For
the separations, we construct an adversary based on the quantum singular value
transformation, which would be independent of interest and should be useful for
other oracle separations in quantum cryptography.

Abstract: As of now, an optimal quantum algorithm solving partial differential
equations eludes us. There are several different methods, each with their own
strengths and weaknesses. In past years comparisons of these existing methods
have been made, but new work has emerged since then. Therefore, we conducted a
survey on quantum methods developed post-2020, applying two such solvers to the
heat equation in one spatial dimension. By analyzing their performance
(including the cost of classical extraction), we explore their precision and
runtime efficiency advancements between the two, identifying advantages and
considerations.

Abstract: Recently, bicycle-sharing systems have been implemented in numerous cities,
becoming integral to daily life. However, a prevalent issue arises when
intensive commuting demand leads to bicycle shortages in specific areas and at
particular times. To address this challenge, we employ a novel quantum machine
learning model that analyzes time series data by fitting quantum time evolution
to observed sequences. This model enables us to capture actual trends in
bicycle counts at individual ports and identify correlations between different
ports. Utilizing the trained model, we simulate the impact of proactively
adding bicycles to high-demand ports on the overall rental number across the
system. Given that the core of this method lies in a Monte Carlo simulation, it
is anticipated to have a wide range of industrial applications.

Abstract: Quantum LDPC codes promise significant reductions in physical qubit overhead
compared with topological codes. However, many existing constructions for
performing logical operations come with distance-dependent temporal overheads.
We introduce a scheme for performing generalized surgery on quantum LDPC codes
using a constant number of rounds of syndrome measurement. The merged code in
our scheme is constructed by taking the total complex of the base code and a
suitably chosen homomorphic chain complex. We demonstrate the applicability of
our scheme on an example multi-cycle code and assess the performance under a
phenomenological noise model, showing that fast surgery performs comparably to
standard generalized surgery with multiple rounds. Our results pave the way
towards fault-tolerant quantum computing with LDPC codes with both low spatial
and temporal overheads.

Result: 所提出的方法在错误纠正性能上优于有界距离码。

Conclusion: 文章扩展了Subsystem量子码的研究，并展示了其在实际错误纠正中的有效性。

Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) require high encoding rate in addition
to high threshold unless a sufficiently large number of physical qubits are
available. The many-hypercube (MHC) codes defined as the concatenation of the
[[6,4,2]] quantum error-detecting code have been proposed as high-performance
and high-encoding-rate QECCs. However, the concatenated codes have a
disadvantage that the syndrome weight grows exponentially with respect to the
concatenation level. To address this issue, here we propose subsystem quantum
codes based on the MHC codes. In particular, we study the smallest subsystem
MHC codes, namely, subsystem codes derived from the concatenated [[4,2,2]]
error-detecting codes. The resulting codes have a constant syndrome-measurement
weight of 4, while keeping high encoding rates. We develop the block-MAP and
neural-network decoders and show that they demonstrate superior performance to
the bounded-distance decoder.

Motivation: 了解量子信息中的能力，尤其是在私有信道中的应用，有助于提高量子通信的安全性和效率。

Method: 通过私有信道的Choi-Jamiolkowski算符将私有状态与量子容量联系起来，构建了一个通用框架，通过辅助信道的Holevo信息作为条件，分析了增强容量的过程。

Result: 展现了如何通过辅助信道的增强来实现容量的提升。证明了在某些特定的信道（如恶劣和去极化信道）中，当达到一定的放大阈值时，量子容量可以显著增加。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子容量的增强提供了新的视角和工具，展示了如何通过优化辅助信道来提高私有信道的容量，从而为量子通信技术提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We investigate superadditivity of quantum capacity through private channels
whose Choi-Jamiolkowski operators are private states. This perspective links
the security structure of private states to quantum capacity and clarifies the
role of the shield system: information encoded in the shield system that would
otherwise leak to the environment can be recycled when paired with an assisting
channel, thereby boosting capacity. Our main contributions are threefold:
Firstly, we develop a general framework that provides a sufficient condition
for capacity amplification, which is formulated in terms of the assisting
channel's Holevo information. As examples, we give explicit, dimension and
parameter dependent amplification thresholds for erasure and depolarizing
channels. Secondly, assuming the Spin alignment conjecture, we derive a
single-letter expression for the quantum capacity of a family of private
channels that are neither degradable, anti-degradable, nor PPT; as an
application, we construct channels with vanishing quantum capacity yet
unbounded private capacity. Thirdly, we further analyze approximate private
channels: we give an alternative proof of superactivation that extends its
validity to a broader parameter regime, and, by combining amplification bounds
with continuity estimates, we establish a metric separation showing that
channels exhibiting capacity amplification have nonzero diamond distance from
the set of anti-degradable channels, indicating that existing approximate
(anti-)degradability bounds are not tight. We also revisit the computability of
the regularized quantum capacity and modestly suggest that this fundamental
question still remains open.

Motivation: Quantum information revolution promising, but photonic chip limitations hindered progress.

Method: Multi-rail multi-photon entanglement generation + decoy-state techniques + balanced homodyne detection + loss-equivalent analysis.

Result: Fidelity 92%, CHSH bound 2.59, room-temperature operation for integrated photonic systems.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasible fully integrated high-efficiency quantum systems with practical applications in quantum optics and RNG.

Abstract: High-speed generation and efficient entanglement detection on a photonic chip
are essential for quantum information applications but hard to achieve due to
common photonic chips' material properties and limited component performance.
In this work, we experimentally demonstrate entanglement witness on a silicon
photonic chip, with multi-rail single-photon entanglement generation based on
decoy-state techniques. The detection is based on balanced homodyne detectors
on the same photonic chip with a bandwidth of up to 12.5 GHz, which allows
room-temperature operation. A loss-equivalent analysis method compensates for
optical losses and system noises. Experimental results quantify an entangled
state fidelity of 92% in quantum state tomography and a
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) violation lower bound of 2.59. These results
establish a viable path toward fully integrated, high-bandwidth,
room-temperature quantum photonic systems, with potential applications in
on-chip quantum optics and quantum random number generation.

Abstract: Three-qubit gates are highly beneficial operations in quantum computing,
enabling compact implementations of quantum algorithms and efficient generation
of multipartite entangled states. However, realizing such gates with high
fidelity remains challenging due to crosstalk, complex control requirements,
and the overhead of parametric or tunable couplers. In this work, we propose
and analyze the implementation of fast, high-fidelity three-qubit gates using
giant atoms--artificial atoms coupled to a waveguide at multiple spatially
separated points. By leveraging interference effects intrinsic to the
giant-atom architecture, we demonstrate that native three-qubit gates, such as
the controlled-CZ-SWAP (CCZS) and the dual-iSWAP (DIV), can be realized through
simple frequency tuning, without the need for complex pulse shaping or
additional hardware. We evaluate gate performance under realistic decoherence
and show that fidelities exceeding 99.5% are achievable with current
experimental parameters in superconducting circuits. As an application, we
present a scalable protocol for preparing three- and five-qubit GHZ states
using minimal gate depth, achieving high state fidelity within sub-300ns
timescales. Our results position giant-atom systems as a promising platform for
entangled-state preparation and low-depth quantum circuit design in near-term
quantum computers and quantum simulators.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fault-tolerance using constant space-overhead against long-range correlated
errors is an important practical question. In the pioneering works [Terhal and
Burkard, PRA 2005], [Aliferis et al, PRA 2005], [Aharonov et al, PRL 2006],
fault-tolerance using poly-logarithmic overhead against long-range correlation
modeled by pairwise joint Hamiltonian was proven when the total correlation of
an error at a qubit location with errors at other locations was $O(1)$, i.e.,
the total correlation at a location did not scale with the number of qubits.
This condition, under spatial symmetry, can simply be stated as the correlation
between locations decaying faster than $\frac{1}{\text{dist}^{\text{dim}}}$.
However, the pairwise Hamiltonian model remained intractable for constant
overhead codes. Recently, [Bagewadi and Chatterjee, PRA 2025] introduced and
analyzed the generalized hidden Markov random field (MRF) model, which provably
captures all stationary distributions, including long-range correlations
[Kunsch et al, Ann. App. Prob. 1995]. It resulted in a noise threshold in the
case of long-range correlation, for memory corrected by the linear-distance
Tanner codes [Leverrier and Zemor, FOCS 2022] for super-polynomial time. In
this paper, we prove a similar result for square-root distance qLDPC codes and
provide an explicit expression for the noise threshold in terms of the code
rate, for up to $o(\sqrt{\text{\#qubits}})$ scaling of the total correlation of
error at a location with errors at other locations.

Abstract: Quantum annealing provides a practical realization of adiabatic quantum
computation and has emerged as a promising approach for solving large-scale
combinatorial optimization problems. However, current devices remain
constrained by sparse hardware connectivity, which requires embedding logical
variables into chains of physical qubits. This embedding overhead limits
scalability and reduces reliability as longer chains are more prone to
noise-induced errors. In this work, building on the known structural result
that the average chain length in clique embeddings grows linearly with the
problem size, we develop a mathematical framework that connects
embedding-induced overhead with hardware noise in D-Wave's Zephyr topology. Our
analysis derives closed-form expressions for chain break probability and chain
break fraction under a Gaussian control error model, establishing how noise
scales with embedding size and how chain strength should be adjusted with chain
length to maintain reliability. Experimental results from the Zephyr
topology-based quantum processing unit confirm the accuracy of these
predictions, demonstrating both the validity of the theoretical noise model and
the practical relevance of the derived scaling rule. Beyond validating a
theoretical model against hardware data, our findings establish a general
embedding-aware noise framework that explains the trade-off between chain
stability and logical coupler fidelity. Our framework advances the
understanding of noise amplification in current devices and provides
quantitative guidance for embedding-aware parameter tuning strategies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement has much more complex structures than bipartite
entanglement, such as the semiseparable state. The multipartite state absent of
multipartite entanglement is called a 2-producible state, which is a tensor
product of at most 2-partite states. Recently, it is proved that a tripartite
pure state is 2-producible if and only if the gap between entanglement of
purification and its lower bound vanishes. Here, we show that the entanglement
of purification gap is not sufficient to detect more than tripartite
entanglement with 4-partite random stabilizer states. We then generalize
entanglement of purification to the multipartite case, where the gap between
generalized entanglement of purification and its lower bound quantifies the
quantum communication cost for distributing one part of the multipartite system
to the other parts. We also demonstrate that a multipartite state is
2-producible if and only if the generalized entanglement of purification gaps
vanish. In addition, we show that the generalized entanglement of purification
gaps are related to the local recoverability of the multipartite state from its
marginal state on some parts of the system and the distance between the state
and the 2-producible states with the relative entropy. Moreover, we calculate
the generalized entanglement of purification gaps for the states fulfilling the
generalized Schmidt decomposition, which implies that the 4-partite stabilizer
states do not always have the generalized Schmidt decomposition. Our results
provide a quantitive characterization of multipartite entanglement in
multipartite system, which will promote further investigations and
understanding of multipartite entanglement.

TL;DR: A new method called biframe improves the convergence of series expansions for quantum evolution operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for more efficient computational methods in quantum mechanics.

Method: Introduce a biframe where a physical system’s evolution is observed in two frames simultaneously, proving that this doubles the convergence rate of series expansions.

Result: In the biframe, the error term 
is reduced to  
for the same computational cost, compared to  
in conventional frames.

Conclusion: The biframe is part of an infinite family of methods that balance convergence acceleration with computational effort.

Abstract: We present novel, exotic types of frame changes for the calculation of
quantum evolution operators. We detail in particular the biframe, in which a
physical system's evolution is seen in an equal mixture of two different
standard frames at once. We prove that, in the biframe, convergence of all
series expansions of the solution is quadratically faster than in
`conventional' frames. That is, if in laboratory frame or after a standard
frame change the error at order $n$ of some perturbative series expansion of
the evolution operator is on the order of $\epsilon^n$, $0<\epsilon<1$, for a
computational cost $C(n)$ then it is on the order of $\epsilon^{2n+1}$ in the
biframe for the same computational cost. We demonstrate that biframe is one of
an infinite family of novel frames, some of which lead to higher accelerations
but require more computations to set up initially, leading to a trade-off
between acceleration and computational burden.

Conclusion: 该论文通过李理论为受控开放量子系统提供了系统的数学框架，揭示了李半群与李代数在量子演化中的关键作用。

Abstract: This thesis focuses on the Lie-theoretic foundations of controlled open
quantum systems. We describe Markovian open quantum system evolutions by Lie
semigroups, whose corresponding infinitesimal generators lie in a special type
of convex cone - a Lie wedge. The Lie wedge associated to a given control
system therefore consists of all generators of the quantum dynamical semigroup
that are physically realisable as a result of the interplay between the
coherent and incoherent processes the quantum system is subject to. For
$n$-qubit open quantum systems, we provide a parametrisation of the largest
physically relevant Lie algebra (the system algebra), in which these Lie wedges
are contained: the Lindblad-Kossakowski Lie algebra. This parametrisation
provides several useful benefits. First, it allows us to construct explicit
forms of these system Lie wedges and their respective system Lie algebras.
Second, we analyse which control scenarios yield Lie wedges that are closed
under Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) multiplication and therefore generate
Markovian semigroups of time-independent quantum channels. Lie wedges of this
form are called Lie semialgebras, and we completely solve this open problem by
proving that Lie wedges specialise to this form only when the coherent controls
have no effect on both the inherent drift Hamiltonian and the incoherent part
of the dynamics. Finally, this parametrisation of the Lindblad-Kossakowski Lie
algebra points to an intuitive separation between unital and non-unital
dissipative dynamics, where the non-unital component of the dynamics is
described by affine translation operations. These translation operators are
then exploited to construct purely dissipative fixed-point engineering schemes
to obtain either pure or mixed states as a system's unique fixed point.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement and squeezing associated with the motions of massive
mechanical oscillators play an essential role in both fundamental science and
emerging quantum technologies, yet realizing such macroscopic nonclassical
states remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we investigate how to
achieve strong optomechanical entanglement and mechanical squeezing in a
membrane-embedded cavity optomechanical system incorporating a coherent
feedback loop, where the membrane interacts with the cavity mode through both
linear and quadratic optomechanical couplings. This hybrid optomechanical
architecture offers a flexible tunability of intrinsic system parameters, thus
allowing the membrane to be stiffened or softened through tuning the sign of
quadratic optomechanical coupling and the cavity decay rate to be reduced via
feedback control. Exploiting these unique features, we demonstrate that
optomechanical entanglement can be substantially enhanced with positive
coupling sign and suitable feedback parameters, while strong mechanical
squeezing beyond the 3dB limit is simultaneously achieved over a broad
parameter range with negative coupling sign, reaching squeezing degree above
10dB under optimized conditions. Our proposal, establishing an all-optical
method for generating highly entangled or squeezed states in cavity
optomechanical systems, opens up a new route to explore macroscopic quantum
effects and to advance quantum information processing.

Abstract: Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a leading tail-risk measure in finance,
central to both regulatory and portfolio optimization frameworks. Classical
estimation of CVaR and its gradients relies on Monte Carlo simulation,
incurring $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity to achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy.
In this work, we design and analyze a quantum subgradient oracle for CVaR
minimization based on amplitude estimation. Via a tripartite proposition, we
show that CVaR subgradients can be estimated with $O(1/\epsilon)$ quantum
queries, even when the Value-at-Risk (VaR) threshold itself must be estimated.
We further quantify the propagation of estimation error from the VaR stage to
CVaR gradients and derive convergence rates of stochastic projected subgradient
descent using this oracle. Our analysis establishes a near-quadratic
improvement in query complexity over classical Monte Carlo. Numerical
experiments with simulated quantum circuits confirm the theoretical rates and
illustrate robustness to threshold estimation noise. This constitutes the first
rigorous complexity analysis of quantum subgradient methods for tail-risk
minimization.

Abstract: In this paper, we define and benchmark a hybrid quantum-classical machine
learning pipeline by performing a binary classification task applied to a
real-world financial use case. Specifically, we implement a Quantum Reservoir
Computing (QRC) layer within a classical routine that includes data
preprocessing and binary classification. The reservoir layer has been executed
on QuEra's Aquila, a 256-qubit neutral atom simulator, using two different
types of encoding: position and local detuning. In the former case, classical
data are encoded into the relative distance between atoms; in the latter, into
pulse amplitudes. The developed pipeline is applied to predict credit card
defaults using a public dataset and a wide variety of traditional classifiers.
The results are compared with a fully-classical pipeline including a Deep
Neural Network (DNN) model. Additionally, the impact of hardware noise on
classification performance is evaluated by comparing the results obtained using
Aquila within the classification workflow with those obtained using a
classical, noiseless emulation of the quantum system. The results indicate that
the noiseless emulation achieves competitive performance with the
fully-classical pipeline, while noise significantly degrades overall
performance. Although the results for this specific use case are comparable to
those of the classical benchmark, the flexibility and scalability of QRC
highlight strong potential for a wide range of applications.

Abstract: Secure key leasing (SKL) enables the holder of a secret key for a
cryptographic function to temporarily lease the key using quantum information.
Later, the recipient can produce a deletion certificate, which proves that they
no longer have access to the secret key. The security guarantee ensures that
even a malicious recipient cannot continue to evaluate the function, after
producing a valid deletion certificate.
  Most prior work considers an adversarial recipient that obtains a single
leased key, which is insufficient for many applications. In the more realistic
collusion-resistant setting, security must hold even when polynomially many
keys are leased (and subsequently deleted). However, achieving
collusion-resistant SKL from standard assumptions remains poorly understood,
especially for functionalities beyond decryption.
  We improve upon this situation by introducing new pathways for constructing
collusion-resistant SKL. Our main contributions are as follows:
  - A generalization of quantum-secure collusion-resistant traitor tracing
called multi-level traitor tracing (MLTT), and a compiler that transforms an
MLTT scheme for a primitive X into a collusion-resistant SKL scheme for
primitive X.
  - The first bounded collusion-resistant SKL scheme for PRFs, assuming LWE.
  - A compiler that upgrades any single-key secure SKL scheme for digital
signatures into one with unbounded collusion-resistance, assuming OWFs.
  - A compiler that upgrades collusion-resistant SKL schemes with classical
certificates to ones having verification-query resilience, assuming OWFs.

Abstract: We extend the scheme of neutral atom Rydberg $C_Z$ gate based on double
sequence of adiabatic pulses applied symmetrically to both atoms using
counterdiabatic driving in the regime of Rydberg blockade. This provides
substantial reducing of quantum gate operation times (at least five times)
compared to previously proposed adiabatic schemes, which is important for
high-fidelity entanglement due to finite Rydberg lifetimes. We analyzed schemes
of adiabatic rapid passage with counterdiabatic driving for single-photon,
two-photon and three-photon schemes of Rydberg excitation for rubidium and
cesium atoms. We designed laser pulse profiles with fully analytical shapes and
calculated the Bell fidelity taking into account atomic lifetimes and finite
blockade strengths. We show that the upper limit of the Bell fidelity reaches
${\mathcal F}\simeq0.9999$ in a room-temperature environment.

Abstract: Noncommutativity of observables is a central feature of quantum physics. It
plays a fundamental role in the formulation of the uncertainty principle for
complementary variables and strongly affects the laws of thermodynamics for
systems with noncommuting, that is, non-Abelian, conserved quantities. We here
derive nonequilibrium generalizations of the second law of thermodynamics in
the form of fluctuation relations, both for mechanically and thermally driven
quantum systems. We identify a non-Abelian contribution to the energy and
entropy balances, without which these relations would be violated. The latter
term can be controlled to enhance both work extraction and nonequilibrium
currents compared to what is obtained in commuting thermodynamics. These
findings demonstrate that noncommutativity maybe a useful thermodynamic
resource.

Abstract: We consider the problem of imaging two partially coherent sources and derive
the ultimate quantum limits for estimating all relevant parameters, namely
their separation, relative intensity, as well as their coherence factor. We
show that the separation of the two sources can be super-resolved over the
entire range of all other pertinent parameters (with the exception of fully
coherent sources), with anti-correlated sources furnishing the largest possible
gain in estimation precision, using a binary spatial mode demultiplexing
measurement positioned at the center of intensity of the joint point spread
function for the two sources. In the sub-Rayleigh limit, we show that both the
relative intensity, as well as the real part of the coherence factor, can be
optimally estimated by a simple boson counting measurement, making it possible
to optimally estimate the separation, relative intensity and real coherence
factor of the sources simultaneously. Within the same limit, we show that the
imaging problem can be effectively reduced to one where all relevant parameters
are encoded in the Bloch vector of a two-dimensional system. Using such a model
we find that indirect estimation schemes, which attempt to extract estimates of
the separation of the two sources by measuring the purity of the corresponding
state of the two-level system, yield suboptimal estimation precision for all
non-zero values of the coherence factor.

Abstract: The thermodynamic uncertainty relation quantifies a trade-off between the
relative fluctuations of trajectory currents and the thermodynamic cost,
indicating that the current precision is fundamentally constrained by entropy
production. In classical bipartite systems, it has been shown that information
flow between subsystems can enhance the current precision alongside
thermodynamic dissipation. In this study, we investigate how information flow,
local dissipation, and quantum effects jointly constrain current fluctuations
within a subsystem of interacting quantum systems. Unlike classical bipartite
systems, quantum subsystems can exhibit simultaneous state changes and maintain
quantum coherence, which fundamentally alters the precision-dissipation
trade-off. For this general setting, we derive a quantum thermokinetic
uncertainty relation for interacting multipartite systems, establishing a
thermodynamic trade-off between current fluctuations, information flow, local
dissipation, and quantum effects. Our analysis shows that, in addition to local
dissipation, both information exchange and quantum coherence play essential
roles in suppressing current fluctuations. These results have important
implications for the performance of quantum thermal machines, such as
information-thermodynamic engines and quantum clocks. We validate our
theoretical findings through numerical simulations on two representative
models: an autonomous quantum Maxwell's demon and a quantum clock. These
results extend uncertainty relations to multipartite open quantum systems and
elucidate the functional role of information flow in fluctuation suppression.

Abstract: In this paper we extend the applicability of Fox-Wright functions beyond
mathematics, specifically in quantum physics. We focused our attention on a new
application, on the connection between the Fox-Wright functions and the
generalized coherent states formalism. We constructed the generalized coherent
states in the Barut-Girardello manner, in which the Fox-Wright functions play
the role of normalization functions, and we demonstrated that the Fox-Wright
coherent states satisfy all general conditions imposed on the set of coherent
states. In parallel, we examined the properties of both pure and mixed
(thermal) Fox-Wright coherent states. All calculations were performed within
the diagonal operators ordering technique (DOOT) using the Dirac's bra-ket
formalism. Finally, we introduced some (specifically, integral) feedback
elements that Fox-Wright coherent states induce in the theory of special
functions, including a new integral representation of Fox-Wright functions.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores whether two distinct, multiply degenerate sub-levels in an atomic system can function as a practical qubit for quantum computing. They model the system using an atomic framework and find that Rabi oscillations still occur despite the degeneracy, suggesting potential for quantum gate applications. They also calculate the average fidelity for a single atom and propose the necessary interaction for a controlled Z gate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is likely the ongoing quest to find practical and scalable implementations of quantum bits, which are essential for quantum computing.

Method: The authors use a well-characterized atomic system, approximating it as a two-level system without degeneracy lifting in the magnetic quantum number while using angular momentum addition rules to select state transitions.

Result: The results show that even with degeneracy, Rabi oscillations persist, which are suitable for quantum gate construction. Additionally, they compute the average fidelity for a single degenerate atom and outline the required interaction for constructing a controlled Z gate.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that two distinct, multiply degenerate sub-levels can indeed serve as a practical qubit for quantum computing, given the observed Rabi oscillations and the potential for constructing quantum gates with additional interactions.

Abstract: A qubit, or quantum bit, is conventionally defined as "a physical system for
storing information that is capable of existing in either of two quantum states
or in a superposition of both". In this paper, we examine the simple question
of whether two distinct levels, each consisting of multiply degenerate
sub-states, could serve as a practical quantum bit. We explore this idea using
a well-characterized atomic system of the kind employed in several quantum
computing implementations. We approximate the atom as a two-level system
without degeneracy lifting in the magnetic quantum number while using the
angular momentum addition rules to select the desired state transition. We find
that, in the continuous presence of the field, the atom still undergoes Rabi
oscillations, which are suitable for quantum gate construction. In addition, we
compute the average fidelity in quantum gate performance for a single
degenerate atom and postulate the required form of two-atom interaction to
construct a controlled Z gate.

Abstract: The commutative depth model allows gates that commute with each other to be

commutative depth more efficiently than was previously known. Bravyi, Maslov,
and Nam [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129:230501, 2022] showed that every element of the
Clifford group (on $n$ qubits) can be computed in commutative depth 23 and size
$O(n^2)$. We show that the Prefix Sum problem can be computed in commutative
depth 16 and size $O(n \log n)$, improving on the previous depth 18 and size
$O(n^2)$ bounds. We also show that, for arbitrary Cliffords, the commutative
depth bound can be reduced to 16. Finally, we show some lower bounds: that
there exist Cliffords whose commutative depth is at least 4; and that there
exist Cliffords for which any constant commutative depth circuit has size
$\Omega(n^2)$.

Abstract: We present a new primitive for quantum algorithms that implements a discrete
Hermite transform efficiently, in time that depends logarithmically in both the
dimension and the inverse of the allowable error. This transform, which maps
basis states to states whose amplitudes are proportional to the Hermite
functions, can be interpreted as the Gaussian analogue of the Fourier
transform. Our algorithm is based on a method to exponentially fast forward the
evolution of the quantum harmonic oscillator, which significantly improves over
prior art. We apply this Hermite transform to give examples of provable quantum
query advantage in property testing and learning. In particular, we show how to
efficiently test the property of being close to a low- degree in the Hermite
basis when inputs are sampled from the Gaussian distribution, and how to solve
a Gaussian analogue of the Goldreich-Levin learning task efficiently. We also
comment on other potential uses of this transform to simulating time dynamics
of quantum systems in the continuum.

Abstract: In this work, we develop new pulse designs and embedding strategies to
improve the analog quantum subroutines of hybrid column generation (CG)
algorithms based on neutral-atoms quantum computers (NAQCs). These strategies
are designed to improve the quality and diversity of the samples generated. We
apply these to an important combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in
logistics, namely the fleet assignment. Depending on the instance tested, our
quantum protocol has a performance that is either comparable or worse than the
best classical method tested, both in terms of the number of iterations and
final objective value. We identify the cause of these suboptimal solutions as a
result of our quantum protocol often generating high-quality but degenerate
samples. We address this limitation by introducing a greedy post-processing
technique, Make\_Diff, which applies bit-wise modifications to degenerate
samples in order to return a non-degenerate set. With this modification, our
quantum protocol becomes competitive with an exact solver for the subproblem,
all the while being resilient to state preparation and measurements (SPAM)
errors. We also compare our CG scheme with a Gurobi solver and find that it
performs better on over 50\% of our synthetic instances and that, despite
Gurobi having a more extensive runtime. These improvements and benchmarks
herald the potential of deploying hybrid CG schemes on NISQ devices for
industrially relevant CO problems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Dissipative quantum algorithms for state preparation in many-body systems are
increasingly recognised as promising candidates for achieving large quantum
advantages in application-relevant tasks. Recent advances in algorithmic,
detailed-balance Lindbladians enable the efficient simulation of open-system
dynamics converging towards desired target states. However, the overall
complexity of such schemes is governed by system-size dependent mixing times.
In this work, we analyse algorithmic Lindbladians for Gibbs state preparation
and prove that they exhibit rapid mixing, i.e., convergence in time
poly-logarithmic in the system size. We first establish this for
non-interacting spin systems, free fermions, and free bosons, and then show
that these rapid mixing results are stable under perturbations, covering weakly
interacting qudits and perturbed non-hopping fermions. Our results constitute
the first efficient mixing bounds for non-commuting qudit models and bosonic
systems at arbitrary temperatures. Compared to prior spectral-gap-based results
for fermions, we achieve exponentially faster mixing, further featuring
explicit constants on the maximal allowed interaction strength. This not only
improves the overall polynomial runtime for quantum Gibbs state preparation,
but also enhances robustness against noise. Our analysis relies on oscillator
norm techniques from mathematical physics, where we introduce tailored variants
adapted to specific Lindbladians $\unicode{x2014}$ an innovation that we expect
to significantly broaden the scope of these methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum filtering and measurements in thermal environments are intricate, requiring advanced mathematical frameworks. This work provides a deeper understanding of these processes through modern operator algebraic methods.

Method: The paper employs Araki-Woods representations and Tomita-Takesaki theory to analyze quantum filtering and apply these tools to quantum trajectories in the Davies-Fulling-Unruh model.

Result: The authors demonstrate how the commutant structure in Araki-Woods representations enhances quantum filtering analysis, particularly in the Davies-Fulling-Unruh model by interpreting dual representations in Rindler wedges.

Conclusion: This research advances the mathematical foundation for quantum filtering and its applications, offering new insights into quantum systems in thermal environments.

Abstract: We pose and solve the problem of quantum filtering based on
continuous-in-time quadrature measurements (homodyning) for the case where the
quantum process is in a thermal state. The standard construction of quantum
filters involves the determination of the conditional expectation onto the von
Neumann algebra generated by the measured observables with the non-demolition
principle telling us to restrict the domain (the observables to be estimated)
to the commutant of the algebra. The finite-temperature case, however, has
additional structure: we use the Araki-Woods representation for the measured
quadratures, but the Tomita-Takesaki theory tells us that there exists a
separate, commuting representation and therefore the commutant will have a
richer structure than encountered in the Fock vacuum case. We apply this to the
question of quantum trajectories to the Davies-Fulling-Unruh model. Here, the
two representations are interpreted as the fields in the right and left Rindler
wedges.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work, we generalize the recently-introduced graph composition
framework to the non-boolean setting. A quantum algorithm in this framework is
represented by a hypergraph, where each hyperedge is adjacent to multiple
vertices. The input and output to the quantum algorithm is represented by a set
of boundary vertices, and the hyperedges act like switches, connecting the
input vertex to the output that the algorithm computes.
  Apart from generalizing the graph composition framework, our new proposed
framework unifies the quantum divide and conquer framework, the decision-tree
framework, and the unified quantum walk search framework. For the decision
trees, we additionally construct a quantum algorithm from an improved weighting
scheme in the non-boolean case. For quantum walk search, we show how our
techniques naturally allow for amortization of the subroutines' costs. Previous
work showed how one can speed up ``detection'' of marked vertices by amortizing
the costs of the quantum walk. In this work, we extend these results to the
setting of ``finding'' such marked vertices, albeit in some restricted
settings.
  Along the way, we provide a novel analysis of irreducible, reversible Markov
processes, by linear-algebraically connecting its effective resistance to the
random walk operator. This significantly simplifies the algorithmic
implementation of the quantum walk search algorithm, achieves an amortization
speed-up for quantum walks over Johnson graphs, avoids the need for quantum
fast-forwarding, and removes the log-factors from the query complexity
statements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing relevance of quantum cryptography has highlighted the sensitivity of cryptographic definitions to the number of accessible copies, which can drastically affect various aspects including computational hardness, feasibility, and applicability. This paper aims to address this concerning issue by proposing a general approach to enhance single-copy security to multi-copy security.

Method: The paper presents a generic approach to boost single-copy security to multi-copy security and applies this approach to various settings, including pseudo-random states and pseudorandom unitaries, to achieve new results.

Result: The paper establishes that one-copy stretch pseudorandom state generators can imply the existence of t-copy stretch pseudorandom state generators for any fixed polynomial t. Similarly, one-query pseudorandom unitaries with short keys imply the existence of t-query pseudorandom unitaries with short keys for any fixed polynomial t. Additionally, under mild cryptographic assumptions, identical-copy secure unclonable primitives, such as public-key quantum money, are shown to exist.

Conclusion: By addressing the sensitivity of quantum cryptographic definitions to the number of accessible copies and proposing a general approach to enhance single-copy security to multi-copy security, the paper significantly contributes to the field of quantum cryptography, providing a unified framework for constructing various cryptographic primitives that are secure against multi-copy attacks.

Abstract: Quantum cryptographic definitions are often sensitive to the number of copies
of the cryptographic states revealed to an adversary. Making definitional
changes to the number of copies accessible to an adversary can drastically
affect various aspects including the computational hardness, feasibility, and
applicability of the resulting cryptographic scheme. This phenomenon appears in
many places in quantum cryptography, including quantum pseudorandomness and
unclonable cryptography. To address this, we present a generic approach to
boost single-copy security to multi-copy security and apply this approach to
many settings. As a consequence, we obtain the following new results: -One-copy
stretch pseudorandom state generators (under mild assumptions) imply the
existence of t-copy stretch pseudorandom state generators, for any fixed
polynomial t. -One-query pseudorandom unitaries with short keys (under mild
assumptions) imply the existence of t-query pseudorandom unitaries with short
keys, for any fixed polynomial t. -Assuming indistinguishability obfuscation
and other standard cryptographic assumptions, there exist identical-copy secure
unclonable primitives such as public-key quantum money and quantum
copy-protection.

Abstract: The Clifford hierarchy is a fundamental structure in quantum computation
whose mathematical properties are not fully understood. In this work, we
characterize permutation gates -- unitaries which permute the $2^n$ basis
states -- in the third level of the hierarchy. We prove that any permutation
gate in the third level must be a product of Toffoli gates in what we define as
\emph{staircase form}, up to left and right multiplications by Clifford
permutations. We then present necessary and sufficient conditions for a
staircase form permutation gate to be in the third level of the Clifford
hierarchy. As a corollary, we construct a family of non-semi-Clifford
permutation gates $\{U_k\}_{k\geq 3}$ in staircase form such that each $U_k$ is
in the third level but its inverse is not in the $k$-th level.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Classical error-correcting codes are powerful but incompatible with quantum
noise, which includes both bit-flips and phase-flips. We introduce
Hadamard-based Virtual Error Correction (H-VEC), a protocol that empowers any
classical bit-flip code to correct arbitrary Pauli noise with the addition of
only a single ancilla qubit and two layers of controlled-Hadamard gates.
Through classical post-processing, H-VEC virtually filters the error channel,
projecting the noise into pure Y-type errors that are subsequently corrected
using the classical code's native decoding algorithm. We demonstrate this by
applying H-VEC to the classical repetition code. Under a code-capacity noise
model, the resulting protocol not only provides full quantum protection but
also achieves an exponentially stronger error suppression (in distance) than
the original classical code, and even larger improvements over the surface code
while using much fewer qubits, simpler checks and straight-forward decoding.
H-VEC comes with a sampling overhead due to its post-processing nature. It
represents a new hybrid quantum error correction and mitigation framework that
redefines the trade-offs between physical hardware requirements and classical
processing for error suppression.

Abstract: Quantum state transfer (QST) via homogeneous spin chains plays a crucial role
in building scalable quantum hardware. A basic quantum state transmission
protocol prepares a state in one qubit and transfers it to another through a
channel, seeking to minimize the time and avoid information loss. The fidelity
of the process is measured by functions proportional to the transition
probability between both states. We approach this optimization problem using
constant magnetic pulses and two complementary strategies: deep reinforcement
learning, where an agent learns pulse sequences through rewards, and genetic
algorithms, which develop candidate solutions through selection and mutation.
We analyze the efficiency of both methods and their ability to incorporate
physical constraints.

Abstract: One of the most fundamental problems in the field of hypothesis testing is
the identity testing problem: whether samples from some unknown distribution
$\mathcal{G}$ are actually from some explicit distribution $\mathcal{D}$. It is
known that when the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ has support $[N]$, the optimal
sample complexity for the identity testing problem is roughly $O(\sqrt{N})$.
However, many distributions of interest, including those which can be sampled
efficiently, have exponential support size, and therefore the optimal identity
tester also requires exponential samples. In this paper, we bypass this lower
bound by considering restricted settings. The above $O(\sqrt{N})$ sample
complexity identity tester is constructed so that it is not fooled by any (even
inefficiently-sampled) distributions. However, in most applications, the
distributions under consideration are efficiently sampleable, and therefore it
is enough to consider only identity testers that are not fooled by
efficiently-sampled distributions. In that case, we can focus on efficient
verification with efficient identity testers. We investigate relations between
efficient verifications of classical/quantum distributions and
classical/quantum cryptography, and show the following results: (i) Every
quantumly samplable distribution is verifiable with a $\mathbf{P^{PP}}$
algorithm. (ii) If one-way functions exist, then no sufficiently random
classically samplable distribution is efficiently verifiable. (iii) If one-way
functions do not exist, then every classically samplable distribution is
efficiently verifiable. (iv) If QEFID pairs exist, then there exists a
quantumly samplable distribution which is not efficiently verifiable. (v) If
one-way puzzles do not exist, then it is possible to verify sampling-based
quantum advantage with a efficient quantum computer.

Abstract: We investigate quantum analogues of collision resistance and obtain
separations between quantum ``one-way'' and ``collision-resistant'' primitives.
  1. Our first result studies one-wayness versus collision-resistance defined
over quantum circuits that output classical strings. We show that there is a
classical oracle $\mathcal{O}$ relative to which (sub-exponentially secure)
indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way permutations exist even against
adversaries that make quantum queries to a non-collapsing measurement oracle,
$\mathcal{Q}^{\mathcal{O}}$. Very roughly, $\mathcal{Q}^{\mathcal{O}}$ outputs
the result of multiple non-collapsing measurements on the output of any quantum
$\mathcal{O}$-aided circuit.
  This rules out fully black-box {\em quantum} constructions of $Y$ from $X$
for any $X \in \{$indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way permutations,
public-key encryption, deniable encryption, oblivious transfer, non-interactive
ZK, trapdoor permutations, quantum money$\}, Y \in \{$collision-resistant hash

collision-resistant puzzles$\}$.
  2. Our second result studies one-wayness versus collision-resistance defined
over quantum states. Here, we show that relative to the same classical oracle
$\mathcal{O}$, (sub-exponentially secure) indistinguishability obfuscation and
one-way permutations exist even against adversaries that make quantum queries
to a {\em cloning unitary} $\mathsf{QCol}^\mathcal{O}$. Very roughly, this
latter oracle implements a well-defined, linear operation to clone a subset of
the qubits output by any quantum $\mathcal{O}$-aided circuit.
  This rules out fully black-box constructions of quantum lightning from
public-key quantum money.

Abstract: The asymmetry between heating and cooling in open quantum systems is a
hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics, yet its thermodynamic origin has remained
unclear. Here, we investigate the thermalization of a quantum system weakly
coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on the entropy production rate and the
quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR). We derive an analytical
expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a
higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The
quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat current fluctuations, demonstrating
that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more
stable than cooling. Our results reveal the thermodynamic basis of asymmetric
thermalization and highlight uncertainty relations as key to nonequilibrium
quantum dynamics.

Abstract: In this work, we study the hardness required to achieve proofs of quantumness
(PoQ), which in turn capture (potentially interactive) quantum advantage. A
``trivial'' PoQ is to simply assume an average-case hard problem for classical
computers that is easy for quantum computers. However, there is much interest
in ``non-trivial'' PoQ that actually rely on quantum hardness assumptions, as
these are often a starting point for more sophisticated protocols such as
classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC). We show several
lower-bounds for the hardness required to achieve non-trivial PoQ, specifically
showing that they likely require cryptographic hardness, with different types
of cryptographic hardness being required for different variations of
non-trivial PoQ. In particular, our results help explain the challenges in
using lattices to build publicly verifiable PoQ and its various extensions such
as CVQC.

TL;DR: QuantumBoost improves upon boosting algorithms by using quantum algorithms for faster projections and a lazy projection strategy, achieving the best known runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to enhance the efficiency of boosting algorithms by introducing quantum computing techniques.

Method: QuantumBoost uses quantum algorithms to compute approximate Bregman projections faster and employs a lazy projection strategy, which delays projections until necessary.

Result: The implementation of QuantumBoost achieves the best known runtime efficiency among boosting methods.

Conclusion: QuantumBoost represents a novel approach by combining quantum computing and optimization strategies in boosting, specifically introducing the lazy projection strategy.

Abstract: The technique of combining multiple votes to enhance the quality of a
decision is the core of boosting algorithms in machine learning. In particular,
boosting provably increases decision quality by combining multiple weak
learners-hypotheses that are only slightly better than random guessing-into a
single strong learner that classifies data well. There exist various versions
of boosting algorithms, which we improve upon through the introduction of
QuantumBoost. Inspired by classical work by Barak, Hardt and Kale, our
QuantumBoost algorithm achieves the best known runtime over other boosting
methods through two innovations. First, it uses a quantum algorithm to compute
approximate Bregman projections faster. Second, it combines this with a lazy
projection strategy, a technique from convex optimization where projections are
performed infrequently rather than every iteration. To our knowledge,
QuantumBoost is the first algorithm, classical or quantum, to successfully
adopt a lazy projection strategy in the context of boosting.

Abstract: Simulating time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians is a compelling
application of quantum computers because it lies at the core of predicting the
properties of materials and molecules. Fermions can be simulated on qubit-based
quantum computers using a fermion-to-qubit mapping, subject to an overhead --
the circuit depth on a qubit quantum computer divided by that on a quantum
computer built from native fermionic modes -- at worst scaling linearly with
the number of modes $N$. Existing approaches that lower this depth overhead
usually trade it for space, using $O(N)$ ancilla qubits. We exponentially
reduce the worst-case overhead of ancilla-free fermion-to-qubit mappings to
$O(\log^2 N)$ by constructing circuits that perform any fermionic permutation
on qubits in the Jordan-Wigner encoding in depth $O(\log^2 N)$. We also show
that our result generalizes to permutations in any product-preserving ternary
tree fermionic encoding. When introducing $O(N)$ ancillas and mid-circuit
measurement and feedforward, the overhead reduces to $O(\log N)$. Finally, we
show that our scheme can be used to implement the fermionic fast Fourier
transform, a key subroutine in chemistry simulation, with overhead $\Theta(\log
N)$ without ancillas and $\Theta(1)$ with ancillas, improving exponentially
over the best previously known ancilla-free algorithm with overhead scaling
linearly with $N$. Our results show that simulating fermions with qubit quantum
computers comes at a much lower asymptotic overhead than previously thought.

Abstract: The atomtronic matter-wave triple-well transistor is theoretically predicted
to exhibit current gain and act as a coherent matter-wave emitter. In this
work, we investigate the dynamics of an atomtronic transistor composed of a
triple-well potential -- source, gate, and drain -- modeled by the
time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We systematically explore the
dependence of the drain population and the current on the source bias potential
and the strength of the interatomic interaction. Our simulations reveal
signatures of resonant tunneling when the source chemical potential aligns with
discrete energy levels in the gate well, leading to coherent matter-wave
emission in the drain. Contrary to previous many-body studies that predicted
interaction-induced current gain via coupling to gate well modes, our results
suggest that coherence in the drain is primarily governed by single-particle
resonances, with no evident broadening from nonlinear coupling.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the formation of bound states between dark-antidark solitary
waves in two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates. The excitation
spectrum contains density and spin branches, and a rotonic feature of the spin
branch enables long-range soliton interactions, giving rise to multiple bound
states for a single pair, each with a distinct separation. We show that these
bound states originate from periodic modulations of the inter-soliton
potential, while individual solitons are surrounded by spatial spin-density
oscillations. Both features provide direct signatures of the spin roton.
Collisions between unbound solitons probe this potential, with dipolar
interactions enforcing universal bouncing at low velocities, independent of
soliton sign, whereas nondipolar solitons may either transmit or bounce. This
distinct behavior offers a realistic path to confirming spin rotons
experimentally.

TL;DR: The paper examines a non-Hermitian superfluid model with complex interactions, comparing two theoretical frameworks. One framework, based on right-eigenstate mean-field theory, provides smooth solutions and lower condensation energy, making it more suitable for the system. The other, based on biorthogonal eigenvectors, shows discontinuities under moderate dissipation. Backscattering destabilizes the superfluid state, highlighting its fragility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of non-Hermitian systems is crucial for understanding complex quantum phenomena, especially in ultracold atomic experiments where dissipation is significant.

Method: The researchers utilized two theoretical approaches: right-eigenstate-based mean-field theory and biorthogonal eigenvector method.

Result: The right-eigenstate framework provides smooth, continuous solutions and lower condensation energy. Backscattering destabilizes the superfluid state under certain conditions.

Conclusion: The paper offers insights into the behavior of non-Hermitian superfluids under dissipation and backscattering. The superior performance of the right-eigenstate framework suggests it is more suitable for modeling such systems.

Abstract: We theoretically explore a non-Hermitian superfluid model with complex-valued
interaction, inspired by two-body loss stemming from inelastic scattering
observed in ultracold atomic experiments. Utilizing both the
right-eigenstate-based mean-field theory and its biorthogonal counterpart, we
study the properties of the system. Notably, the right-eigenstate-based
framework produces smooth and continuous solutions, in stark contrast to the
absence of nontrivial solutions and the abrupt discontinuities observed in the
biorthogonal-eigenstate-based framework under moderate dissipation. In
addition, the lower condensation energy obtained in the former framework
suggests its superior suitability for describing this system. Furthermore, we
explore the impact of backscattering, a crucial factor in realistic systems.
Our analysis reveals that, facilitated by two-body loss, even moderate
backscattering destabilizes the superfluid state. Sufficiently strong
backscattering completely destroys it, highlighting a key mechanism for the
fragility of this non-Hermitian quantum phase.

Abstract: Recent experiments with degenerate molecular gases dressed by elliptically
polarized microwave fields have opened new avenues for engineering dipolar
interactions. We identify a set of symmetries of the interaction potential,
which generate degeneracies among the interaction parameters, and use these to
classify the resulting spatial symmetries and equilibrium shapes of the gases.
Exploiting these symmetries we analyze solutions including beyond-meanfield
quantum fluctuations, and develop complementary variational results. We then
map out the phase diagram of self-bound droplets and characterize their key
properties.

### [183] [Insulating transport in anisotropic metals: breakdown of Drude transport and the puzzling $c$-axis resistivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and other layered oxides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03756)
*Sophie Beck,Matthew Shammami,Lorenzo Van Muñoz,Jason Kaye,Antoine Georges,Jernej Mravlje*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new mechanism to explain the non-metallic out-of-plane resistivity in layered metals, such as Hund metals. It suggests that the Drude-Boltzmann expression for the c-axis conductivity emerges from the Kubo formula, with a non-Drude contribution proportional to 1/τ. This non-Drude behavior is significant when 1/τ exceeds 2η*, where η* is small due to rapid variation of c-axis velocities with distance from the Fermi surface. The paper demonstrates agreement between theory and experiment for Sr₂RuO₄, challenging the need for extrinsic mechanisms like impurities or phonons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the fundamental mechanisms behind anomalous transport properties in layered metals has garnered considerable attention given the potential for applications in novel electronic devices. Understanding the underlying physics of non-metallic transport is crucial for advancing materials science research and harnessing these materials' unique properties.

Method: The study employs the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), which combines computational methods with diagrammatic expansions to analyze complex quantum systems. A realistic approach is utilized to model the electronic structure and transport properties of Sr₂RuO₄, enabling precise comparison with experimental data.

Result: The theoretical framework successfully captures the experimentally observed non-Drude behavior in c-axis transport for Sr₂RuO₄. The proposed mechanism attributes this behavior to a unique interplay of structural and electronic factors intrinsic to the body-centered tetragonal lattice, specifically the near-accidental cancellation of contributions from lattice vibrations.

Conclusion: This research uncovers a novel mechanism for non-metallic out-of-plane resistivity in layered metals, offering a compelling alternative to previously invoked extrinsic explanations. The study underscores the importance of intrinsic material properties in determining anomalous transport behaviors, paving the way for further exploration and applications in related materials.

Abstract: We reveal a mechanism that may explain the non-metallic out-of-plane
resistivity in layered metals. By carefully examining how the Drude-Boltzmann
expression for the $c$-axis conductivity emerges out of the Kubo formula, we
find, besides the standard metallic term proportional to the carrier lifetime
$\tau$, a non-Drude contribution proportional to $1/\tau$. The Drude behavior
breaks down when $1/\tau > 2 \eta^*$, the crossover value $\eta^*$ being small
(and hence observable) when the $c$-axis velocities vary rapidly with the
distance from the Fermi surface. We consider the Hund metal Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ as a
test case, which we study within a realistic dynamical mean-field theory
approach. The non-Drude behavior observed experimentally in $c$-axis transport
is reproduced and explained by our considerations, showing that earlier invoked
extrinsic mechanisms that involve either impurities or phonons are unnecessary.
We point out that the small value of $\eta^*$ is due to a peculiar accidental
cancellation due to destructive interference characteristic of body-centered
tetragonal lattices.

Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that are not invariant under
spacetime symmetry actions. We propose a general way to describe the lattice
translation modulated symmetries in 1+1D, including the non-invertible ones,
via the tensor network language. We demonstrate that the modulations can be
described by some autoequivalences of the categories. Although the topological
behaviors are broken because of the presence of modulations, we can still
construct the modulated version of the symmetry TFT bulks by inserting a series
of domain walls described by invertible bimodule categories. This structure not
only recovers some known results on invertible modulated symmetries but also
provides a general framework to tackle modulated symmetries in a more general
setting.

Abstract: We extend a recently defined measure of symmetry breaking, the entanglement
asymmetry, to higher-form symmetries. In particular, we focus on Abelian
topological order in two dimensions, which spontaneously breaks a 1-form
symmetry. Using the toric code as a primary example, we compute the
entanglement asymmetry and compare it to the topological entanglement entropy.
We find that while the two quantities are not strictly equivalent, both are
sub-leading corrections to the area law and can serve as order parameters for
the topological phase. We generalize our results to non-chiral Abelian
topological order and express the maximal entanglement asymmetry in terms of
the quantum dimension. Finally, we discuss how the scaling of entanglement
asymmetry correctly detects topological order in the deformed toric code, where
1-form symmetry breaking persists even in a trivial phase.

Abstract: We demonstrate that a mean field approximation can be confidently employed in
quasiperiodic moir\'e systems to treat interactions and quasiperiodicity on
equal footing. We obtain the mean field phase diagram for an illustrative
one-dimensional moir\'e system that exhibits narrow bands and a regime with
non-interacting multifractal critical states. By systematically comparing our
findings with existing exact results, we identify the regimes where the mean
field approximation provides an accurate description. Interestingly, in the
critical regime, we obtain a quasifractal charge density wave, consistent with
the exact results. To complement this study, we employ a real-space
implementation of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock, enabling the computation of
the excitation spectrum and response functions at the RPA level. These findings
indicate that a mean field approximation to treat systems hosting multifractal
critical states, as found in two-dimensional quasiperiodic moir\'e systems, is
an appropriate methodology.

Abstract: A magnet is a collection of magnetic moments. How those interact is
determined by what lies in between. In transition-metal and rare-earth magnetic
compounds, the configuration of the ligands around each magnetic center and the
connectivity of the ligand cages are therefore pivotal -- for example, the
mutual interaction of magnetic species connected through one single ligand is
qualitatively different from the case of two bridging anions. Two bridging
ligands are encountered in Kitaev magnets. The latter represent one of the
revelations of the 21st century in magnetism research: they feature highly
anisotropic intersite couplings with seemingly counterintuitive directional
dependence for adjacent pairs of magnetic sites and unique quantum spin-liquid
ground states that can be described analytically. Current scenarios for the
occurrence of pair-dependent magnetic interactions as proposed by Kitaev rely

be at least as important, in 5$d$ and 4$d$ $t_{2g}^5$, 3$d$ $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$,
and even rare-earth 4$f^1$ Kitaev-Heisenberg magnets. Our study provides
concept clarification in Kitaev magnetism research and the essential reference
points for reliable computational investigation of how novel magnetic ground
states can be engineered in Kitaev, Kitaev-Heisenberg, and Heisenberg

TL;DR: This paper explores single crystals of C15b Laves phase compounds with enhanced magnetic properties, particularly ferrimagnetic behavior.Various Co-sublattices show superiorCurie temperatures, withDyInCo4 achieving 368K and notable compensation points. The structures and Co-sublattices influence magnetic anisotropy and compensation. The findings suggest potential applications in spintronics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study delves into magnetic properties of specific compound structures, which not only enhances our understanding of materials with itinerant moments but also provides insights for potential technological applications in spintronics.

Method: Magnetometry measurements across Co-doped structures offered systematic analysis of magnetic properties, includingCurie temperatures and magnetic compensation points.

Result: The paper identifiesDyInCo4 with the highestCurie temperature (368K) and a room-temperature compensation point (295K). Structural correlation with magnetization directions ([001], [111], and [110]) highlights factors influencing magnetic anisotropy and compensation. HoInCo4 exhibits different behavior, complicating the ferrimagnetic landscape.

Conclusion: The study contributes to the understanding of magnetic behaviors in Co-doped Co pyrochlores and suggests their potential in next-generation spintronic applications.

Abstract: We successfully synthesized single crystals of a series of C15b Laves phase
compounds, $R{\mathrm{In}}{\mathrm{Co}}_{4}$ ($R=$ Dy-Tm), with Co-pyrochlore
and $R$-fcc sublattices, and systematically studied their magnetic properties
via magnetometry measurements. These itinerant cubic compounds, with Curie
temperatures above room temperature, show compensated ferrimagnetism featuring
an antiferromagnetic coupling between the two sublattices. From this series,
${\mathrm{DyInCo}}_{4}$ exhibits the highest $T_{\rm C}$ (= 368 K) and a
near-room-temperature compensation point $T_{\rm cp}$ (= 295 K). $T_{\rm C}$
does not change drastically with the $R$ atom, whereas $T_{\rm cp}$ depends on
the de Gennes factor of $R^{3+}$. Another magnetization anomaly is observed in
all the compounds at low temperatures, which may be indicative of changes in
the lattice or magnetic structure. The easy axis the ferrimagnetic moment of
${\mathrm{DyInCo}}_{4}$, ${\mathrm{ErInCo}}_{4}$, and ${\mathrm{TmInCo}}_{4}$
is found at $T =$ 5 K to be along the [001], [111] and [110] directions,
respectively. However, the simple easy-axis or easy-plane ferrimagnetic picture
cannot be applied to ${\mathrm{HoInCo}}_{4}$. These observations suggest that
the $R$ sublattice determines magnetic anisotropy and compensation, while the
Co sublattice plays a role in strong magnetic ordering. The high Curie
temperature, together with the magnetization compensation point near room
temperature, renders these itinerant pyrochlore magnets interesting for
spintronic applications.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: We introduce a method to create long-lived discrete-time crystals in one-dimensional systems without disorder, avoiding the traditional challenges in achieving stable phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many-body localization and disorder often lead to losing the desired stability in quantum systems. This research seeks to bypass disorder to create more reliable discrete-time crystals (DTCs) that persist longer.

Method: The study uses periodically driven, one-dimensional spin chains with specific interactions, preserving integrability. The drives are tuned to optimize gap sizes and stabilization of the desired DTC phase.

Result: The researchers successfully demonstrate the existence of a robust DTC phase. The use of nearest and next-nearest neighbor couplings and drive parameters leads to lifetimes that grow exponentially with system size, significantly enhancing stability compared to disordered systems.

Conclusion: This work advances quantum simulations of stable phases of matter and provides a new route to achieving longer-lived coherent states, potentially crucial for quantum computing applications.

Abstract: We demonstrate the realization of a discrete-time crystal (DTC) phase in a
family of periodically driven, one-dimensional quadratic lattice Hamiltonians
that can be obtained using spin chains. These interactions preserve
integrability while opening controllable gaps at resonant quasienergies and
pinning the emergent quasienergy modes that are responsible for subharmonics.
We demonstrate that the DTC phase is rigid in the parameter space of transverse
field and an additional interaction like NNN coupling strength, with the drive
frequency optimized to produce the strongest subharmonic response. We also
provide a detailed phase portrait of the model, exhibiting a variety of new
dynamical phases, such as a fragile time crystal and both spin-liquid and
paramagnetic phases, as well as sharp quantum phase transitions between them.
Finite-size scaling of the Floquet quasienergy splitting between the emergent
subharmonic mode and its conjugate shows that the DTC lifetime diverges
exponentially with system size. Our work thus establishes a novel mechanism for
realizing robust, long-lived DTCs in one dimension, and paves the way for their
experimental realization in near-term quantum simulators. Motivation for this
work stems from the limitations of disorder-based stabilization schemes that
rely on many-body localization and exhibit only prethermal or finite-lived
plateaus, eventually restoring ergodicity. Disorder-free routes are therefore
highly desirable. Integrable (or Floquet-integrable) systems provide an
attractive alternative because their extensive set of conserved quantities and
constrained scattering strongly restrict thermalization channels. Our
construction exploits these integrable restrictions together with short-range
NNN engineering to produce a clean, robust DTC that avoids the prethermal
fragility of disordered realizations.

Abstract: Orbital-selective many-body effects, in which electrons occupying different
orbitals experience distinct interaction strengths, play a crucial role in
correlated multiorbital materials. However, these effects usually manifest in a
complex manner, obscuring their microscopic origins. Here, by combining
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements with theoretical
calculations, we reveal pronounced orbital selectivity in both
electron-electron correlation and electron-phonon coupling in the van der Waals
material V2Se2O. Electron correlation induces distinct bandwidth
renormalization exclusively in the V d_xy-derived band, while the bands mainly
composed of the other d orbitals remain essentially unrenormalized.
Orbital-resolved analyses identify that the filling number and the bandwidth
are decisive factors governing orbital-dependent correlation. Simultaneously,
the d_(xz/yz)-derived band exhibits a sharp kink anomaly, arising from enhanced
coupling to high-energy phonon modes dominated by oxygen vibrations. Such
pronounced orbital selectivity positions V2Se2O as a rare and prototypical
platform for unravelling the microscopic mechanisms of orbital-selective
electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, and offers guiding
principles for the design of correlated multiorbital materials.

Abstract: A two-dimensional topologically nontrivial state of noninteracting electrons,
such as the surface state of a three-dimensional topological insulator, is
predicted to realize a topological superconductor when proximity-coupled to an
ordinary $s$-wave superconductor. In contrast, noninteracting electrons
partially occupying a Landau level, with Rashba spin-orbit coupling that lifts
the spin degeneracy, fail to develop topological superconductivity under
similar proximity coupling in the presence of the conventional Abrikosov vortex
lattice. We demonstrate through exact diagonalization that, at half-filled
Landau level, introducing a repulsive interaction between electrons induces
topological superconductivity for a range of parameters. This appears rather
surprising because a repulsive interaction is expected to inhibit, not promote,
pairing, but suggests an appealing principle for realizing topological
superconductivity: proximity-coupling a composite Fermi liquid to an ordinary
$s$-wave superconductor.

Abstract: Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with
temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low
temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet
finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using
purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected
entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite
temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to
one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the
lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and
compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that
map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a
strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent
parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave
pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results
provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish
dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture
reorganization at finite temperature.

Abstract: The frustrated magnet Bi2Fe4O9 has been reported to exhibit complex spin
dynamics coexisting with conventional spin wave excitations. The magnetic Fe3+
(S = 5/2) ions are arranged into a distorted two-dimensional Cairo pentagonal
lattice with weak couplings between the layers, developing long-ranged
non-collinear antiferromagnetic order below 245 K. In order to enable studies
and modelling of the complex dynamics close to TN, we have reexamined the
magnetic excitations across the complete energy scale (0 < E < 90 meV) at 10 K.
We discover two distinct gaps, which can be explained by introducing,
respectively, easy axis and easy plane anisotropy on the two unequivalent
Fe-sites. We develop a refined spin Hamiltonian that accurately accounts for
the dispersion of essentially all spin-wave branches across the full spectral
range, except around 40 meV, where a splitting and dispersion are observed. We
propose that this mode is derived from phonon hybridization. Polarisation
analysis shows that the system has magnetic anisotropic fluctuations,
consistent with our model. A continuum of scattering is observed above the spin
wave branches and is found to principally be explained by an instrumental
resolution effect. The full experimental mapping of the excitation spectrum and
the refined spin Hamiltonian provides a foundation for future quantitative
studies of spin waves coexisting with unconventional magnetic fluctuations in
this frustrated magnet found at higher temperatures.

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between screening, electronic correlations, and
collective excitations is essential for the design of two-dimensional quantum
materials. Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles study of more than
60 MA$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers, encompassing semiconducting, metallic,
cold-metallic, magnetic, and topological phases. Using the constrained random
phase approximation (cRPA), we compute material-specific effective Coulomb
interaction parameters $U$, $U'$, and $J$, including their spatial dependence
across distinct correlated subspaces defined by local coordination and crystal
symmetry. In semiconducting compounds, long-range nonlocal interactions
persist, revealing unconventional screening and suggesting strong excitonic
effects beyond simple dielectric models. In cold-metallic systems, sizable
long-range Coulomb interactions remain despite the presence of free carriers,
highlighting their atypical metallic screening. Among 33-valence-electron
compounds, we find $U_{\mathrm{eff}} > W$ in the $\beta_2$ phase, indicating
proximity to charge-density-wave or Mott instabilities. Several V- and Nb-based
systems exhibit intermediate-to-strong correlation strength, with $U/W > 1 $ in
multiple cases. Using cRPA-derived Stoner parameters, we identify magnetic
instabilities in various V-, Nb-, Cr-, and Mn-based compounds. Finally,
selected cold-metallic systems display plasmon dispersions that deviate from
the conventional $\sqrt{q}$ behavior, revealing nearly non-dispersive
low-energy modes. These results position MA$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers as a versatile
platform for investigating correlation-driven instabilities and emergent
collective behavior in two dimensions.

Conclusion: 二维金属分子-interface提供了Kondo自旋格点的一个新平台，显示出高温量子相关性和超过常规预期的Nernst效应。这为理解自旋格点与磁性之间的联系以及开发新的磁材料提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Frustration in Kondo spin lattice systems has led to the emergence of both
spin liquids that could be chiral and strange metals that deviate from Fermi
liquid behaviour when not in their antiferromagnetic ground state. In two
dimensions (2D), where deviations from bulk systems are expected, Kondo spin
lattice emergence have recently been observed in van der Waals systems.
Metallo-molecular interfaces of supramolecular lattices have also been
suggested as an alternative 2D Kondo spin lattice system where a single-ion
Kondo effect as well as an inter spin-site Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)
coupling has been demonstrated in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS)
studies. Here, going beyond ultrahigh vacuum STS studies on metallo-molecular
interfaces, we report a metastable frustrated antiferromagnetic state, with
ultra-high spin freezing temperatures (T_f), ranging from 240 K to 300 K on the
interfaces of highly textured Pt(111) and Pt(111)/Co films with organic
molecules grown in ultra-high vacuum 10^(-10) mbar. In the vicinity of the
spin-freezing transition, we measure a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) in
the Pt/Co/molecular heterostructure, with a Nernst coefficient of at least 3
microV per K. Our results suggest a 2D metallo-molecular Kondo spin lattice
with high temperature quantum correlations where an ANE beyond magnetisation is
manifested around room temperature.

Abstract: We report single crystal neutron spectroscopy and bulk characterization on
hydrothermally grown $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$, revealing magnetic moment
fragmentation embedded within the all-in-all-out ordered state. The spectra
reveal a nearly flat band with pinch-point momentum dependence accompanied by
dispersive branches that produce half-moon features across multiple Brillouin
zones. These defining signatures are captured quantitatively by a minimal
dipolar-octupolar spin Hamiltonian, demonstrating excellent agreement between
experiment and theory. The higher flat-mode energy helps account for the
absence of dynamical interference in prior $\mathrm{\mu SR}$ studies, while the
lack of any photon-like excitation imposes strict constraints on the proposed
Coulombic antiferromagnet scenario. Our results extend moment fragmentation to
$\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$ and identify it as a clean, tractable platform for
quantitative exploration of emergent gauge field physics in frustrated magnets.

Abstract: We introduce a general corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm
tailored to projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice. By
integrating automatic differentiation, our approach enables direct variational
energy minimization on this lattice geometry. In contrast to conventional
approaches that map the triangular lattice onto a square lattice with diagonal
next-nearest-neighbour interactions, our native formulation yields improved
variational results at the same bond dimension. This improvement stems from a
more faithful and physically informed representation of the entanglement
structure in the tensor network and an increased number of variational
parameters. We apply our method to the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour
Heisenberg model on the triangular and kagome lattice, and benchmark our
results against previous numerical studies.

which in the bulk or in a free-standing monolayer protects the band
degeneracies at the Brillouin zone boundary. Our results demonstrate that
ultraflat gold substrates do more than modify carrier densities and screening:
they can lift symmetry-protected degeneracies and thus fundamentally reshape

Abstract: The interplay of charge and spin orders lies at the heart of correlated
electron physics and plays a critical role in the emergence of unconventional
quantum phases. Kagome magnets provide a particularly promising platform to
investigate these phenomena, owing to their geometrically frustrated lattice
structure. However, resolving spin and charge orders microscopically and
establishing ways to control them remain fundamental challenges. Here, we
demonstrate magnetic field control of an altermagnetic spin density wave order
intertwined with charge density wave order in kagome magnet CsCr3Sb5. Scanning
tunneling microscopy down to deep cryogenic temperature of 50 mK reveals two
previously unreported charge density wave orders in the Sb surface. Density
functional theory confirms that one of them is coupled to a spin density wave
with an altermagnetic ground state. The charge density waves can be tuned in
both amplitude and phase by an external magnetic field, reflected in domain
switching and stripe sliding of the charge density wave. Our findings deepen
the understanding of symmetry-breaking in kagome systems, providing a tunable
platform to explore the interplay of electronic correlation with emergent
quantum magnetism.

Abstract: Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum
materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work
we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated
electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the
electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the
material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we
focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic
Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often
energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may
form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the
electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the
Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular
orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the
interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic
electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal
nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the
anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$
times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes.
This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with
currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the
Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by
discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum
Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of
competing correlated electronic phases.

Abstract: The orbital motion of chargeless bosons, unlike that of electrons, does not
generate a magnetic moment and thus cannot directly interact with magnetic
fields. Utilizing the Aharonov-Casher effect and perturbation theory, we
formulate a proper theory for the magnon orbital angular momentum (OAM) at
finite temperatures, explicitly identifying both self-rotation and topological
contributions, analogous to the electronic counterpart but with correct bosonic
statistics. Comparing with previous studies on magnon OAM, the magnon spin
Nernst effect can only be correctly reproduced using the proper theory for
magnon OAM. In a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, we show that the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces a large magnon OAM in both
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states. Our formulation provides a
foundation for studying orbital dynamics of chargeless bosons with intrinsic
spin.

TL;DR: It was proven that via contactless electrostatic actuation, graphene can be rotated by simply locally charging an hBN flake without mechanical contact. All the necessary conditions for this controlled rotation have been validated within the same system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential for scalable and mechanically neutral electrostatic actuation in 2D materials opens up new possibilities in nanoscale device engineering, particularly for applications requiring dynamic reconfiguration without the constraints of traditional methods.

Method: The method involves selectively charging a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flake on top of a grounded graphene layer, creating an in-plane electrostatic torque that induces angular displacement. Validation through in-situ Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and twist-dependent Raman spectroscopy confirmed the functionality and precision of the actuation mechanism.

Result: The experiment demonstrated that the graphene layer could be successfully rotated by electrostatic means without any mechanical interference or contact between the layers.

Conclusion: This study presents a contactless electrostatic actuation technique that enables precise in-plane rotation of 2D van der Waals heterostructures. The methodology offers scalability and simplicity, suggesting broad applications in nanoscale electronic devices and flexible circuitry fabrication.

Abstract: The ability to dynamically control the relative orientation of layers in two
dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures represents a critical
step toward the realization of reconfigurable nanoscale devices. Existing
actuation methods often rely on mechanical contact, complex architectures, or
extreme operating conditions, which limit their applicability and scalability.
In this work, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration of contactless
electrostatic actuation based on electron-beam-induced charge injection. By
locally charging an insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flake on an
electrically grounded graphene layer, we create an interfacial electric field
that generates in-plane electrostatic torque and induces angular displacement.
We validate the induced rotation through in-situ scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and twist-dependent Raman spectroscopy.

Abstract: Head-to-head ferroelectric domain walls are intrinsically charged, and are
typically compensated by a mix of oppositely charged defects and free
electrons. The free electrons form a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) along
the domain wall. In many cases, inversion symmetry is broken at the wall, which
implies that the 2DEG is subject to nontrivial spin-orbit coupling. Here, we
use symmetry arguments to construct a generic six-band tight-binding electronic
Hamiltonian for a $90^\circ$ head-to-head ferroelectric domain wall. The model,
which includes spin-orbit physics and has a multi-orbital $t_{2g}$ band
structure that is common to transition-metal perovskites, is applied to
BaTiO$_3$. We find that the 2DEG develops an Ising spin texture, with spins
aligned perpendicular to the domain wall. We contrast this with the Rashba spin
texture that should emerge at weakly conducting $90^\circ$ head-to-tail domain
walls. We then show that the head-to-head domain walls should have a measurable
Edelstein effect (that is, a current-induced magnetization), even in the dilute
limit and at room temperature, and describe a simple experiment to measure it.

TL;DR: 研究向半导体中引入磁性掺杂物以工程高自旋磁性状态，展现了这种状态对经典和量子信息存储及磁性记忆技术的重要意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算和高性能电子设备的发展，开发高效、稳定的磁性材料至关重要。在半导体中原有的自旋状态通常不适合高存储容量，因此需要新的方法来实现高自旋磁性。

Method: 在单谷半导体（如GaAs）中，掺杂物状态为类氢型，通常导致低自旋状态，但多谷半导体（如AlAs、Ge、Si）由于交换耦合的振荡形式因子，可以通过调控跳跃过程来控制自旋状态。

Result: 在多谷半导体中，通过精确的掺杂排列，实现了系统自旋与系统大小呈正比的增长，尤其在二维晶体中，部分掺杂排列可实现接近50%的自旋极化，甚至在较高温下也保持了稳定的磁性。

Conclusion: 该研究为利用半导体中的谷-反谷分立来工程高自旋磁性状态提供了一种普适的设计框架，并在此基础上提出了实验实现的 pathways，如精确掺杂技术。

Abstract: High-spin states hold significant promise for classical and quantum
information storage and emerging magnetic memory technologies. Here, we present
a systematic framework for engineering such high-spin magnetic states in dopant
clusters formed from substitutional impurities in semiconductors. In
single-valley materials such as gallium arsenide, impurity states are
hydrogenic and exchange interactions generally favor low-spin configurations,
except in special geometries. In contrast, multivalley semiconductors exhibit
oscillatory form factors in their exchange couplings, enabling the controlled
suppression of selected hopping processes and exchange couplings. Exploiting
this feature, we demonstrate how carefully arranged impurities in aluminum
arsenide, germanium, and silicon can stabilize ground states with a net spin
that scale extensively with system size. Within effective mass theory and the
tight-binding approximation for hopping, we construct explicit examples ranging
from finite clusters to extended lattices and fractal-like tilings. In two
dimensions, we identify several favorable dopant geometries supporting a net
spin equal to around half of the fully polarized value in the thermodynamic
limit, including one which achieves over $70\%$ polarization. Our results
provide a general design principle for harnessing valley degeneracy in
semiconductors to construct robust high-spin states and outline a pathway for
their experimental realization via precision implantation of dopants.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for generating and controlling spin
currents in an antiferromagnetic twisted honeycomb bilayer in response to an
elastic deformation. Utilizing a continuum model, closely based upon the
seminal Bistritzer-MacDonald model, that captures the essential physics of
low-energy moir\'e bands, we calculate the spin current response to the
deformation in terms of the familiar Berry phase formalism. The resulting
moir\'e superlattice potential modulates the electronic band structure, leading
to emergent topological phases and novel transport properties such as quantized
piezo responses both for spin and charge transport. This approach allows us to
tune the system across different topological regimes and to explore the
piezo-spintronic responses as a function of the band topology. When inversion
symmetry is broken either by a sublattice potential $V$, alignment with an hBN
substrate, uniaxial strain, or structural asymmetry present in the moir\'e
superlattice, the system acquires a finite Berry curvature that is opposite in
the $K$ and $K'$ valleys (protected by valley time reversal symmetry). In
contrast, for strain, the valley-contrasting nature of the pseudo-gauge field
ensures that the quantized response is robust and proportional to the sum of
the valley Chern numbers. These notable physical properties make these systems
promising candidates for groundbreaking spintronic and valleytronic devices.

Abstract: Single nuclear spins in silicon are a promising resource for quantum
technologies due to their long coherence times and excellent control
fidelities. Qubits and qudits have been encoded on donor nuclei, with
successful demonstrations of Bell states and quantum memories on the spin-1/2
$^{31}$P and cat-qubits on the spin-7/2 $^{123}$Sb nuclei. Isoelectronic
nuclear spins coupled to gate-defined quantum dots, such as the naturally
occurring $^{29}$Si isotope, possess no additional charge and allow for the
coupled electron to be shuttled without destroying the nuclear spin coherence.
Here, we demonstrate the coupling and readout of a spin-9/2 $^{73}$Ge nuclear
spin to a gate-defined quantum dot in SiMOS. The $^{73}$Ge nucleus was
implanted by isotope-selective ion-implantation. We observe the hyperfine
interaction (HFI) to the coupled quantum dot electron and are able to tune it
from 180 kHz to 350 kHz, through the voltages applied to the lateral gate
electrodes. This work lays the foundation for future spin control experiments
on the spin-9/2 qudit as well as more advanced experiments such as entanglement
distribution between distant nuclear spins or repeated weak measurements.

Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall state (FQHS) observed in the lowest Landau level
at filling factor $\nu=1/2$ in wide quantum wells has been enigmatic for
decades because the two-dimensional electron system (2DES) has a bilayer charge
distribution but with significant interlayer tunneling. Of particular interest
is whether the 1/2 FQHS in this system has a one-component (1C) or
two-component (2C) origin; these are typically identified as the Pfaffian
(non-Abelian) or the $\Psi_{331}$ (Abelian) FQHSs, respectively. We report here
our experimental study of the evolution of the correlated states of an
ultrahigh-quality 2DES confined to a 72.5-nm-wide GaAs quantum well. At the
lowest densities, the 2DES displays only odd-denominator FQHSs, and the ground
state at $\nu = 1/2$ is a composite fermion Fermi sea. As the density is
increased, a FQHS emerges at $\nu = 1/2$, and becomes very strong. In a finite
density range where the 1/2 FQHS is strongest, we also observe its daughter
FQHSs at $\nu = 8/17$ and 7/13, consistent with the theoretically expected
daughter states of a Pfaffian 1/2 FQHS. At the highest densities, the 2DES
becomes 2C, signaled by the emergence of a bilayer Wigner crystal state and the
transitions of FQHSs flanking $\nu=1/2$. The 1/2 FQHS remains robust near this
transition and, notably, its charge transport energy gap exhibits an
\textit{upward} cusp with a maximum value of about 6 K on the 1C side of the
transition; this is the largest gap reported for any even-denominator FQHS. Our
observation of the transition of the 2DES ground states near $\nu=1/2$ to 2C
states at high densities, and our measurements of the robustness of the 1/2
FQHS against charge distribution asymmetry, suggest that the 1/2 FQHS also
makes a transition from 1C to 2C. Such a transition from a non-Abelian to
Abelian state can open avenues for topological quantum information and quantum
criticality.

TL;DR:  papers develop an effective linear response theory for far-from-equilibrium quantum transport.

Real anyon collisions are linked to broken symmetry.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  motivate the study of quantum transport with far-from-equilibrium phenomena, such as anyon collisions in collider systems. It's especially interesting due to high symmetry breaking in anyonic systems. 

Method:  employ linear response theory to model transport in far-from-equilibrium states and apply it to tunnel-coupled anyonic beams in collider gamex geometries with braiding and collisions. Confirm transport coefficients derived from fractional charge and statistics. Investigate thermoelectric coefficients linked to real anyon collisions. 

Result:  success in developing a linear response theory applicable to far-from-equilibrium quantum transport. Transport coefficients directly reflect anyon properties, avoiding the need for higher-order current correlations. The emergence of finite thermoelectric coefficients indicates successful capture of real anyon collisions and broken symmetry. 

Conclusion:  successful development of a linear response theory for far-from-equilibrium quantum transport of anyons. The results highlight the importance of symmetry breaking in capture real anyon collisions and provide tools to study such phenomena in quantum systems. 

Abstract: Linear response theory serves as a fundamental tool in the study of quantum
transport, extensively employed to elucidate fundamental mechanisms related to
the nature of the particles involved and the underlying symmetries. This
framework is, however, limited to equilibrium or near-equilibrium conditions.
Here, we develop an effective linear response theory designed to describe
charge and thermal quantum transport, where the reference far-from-equilibrium
stationary state comprises anyons forming a dilute beam. We apply our theory to
study tunnel-coupled anyonic beams in collider geometries, enabling braiding,
collisions, and tunneling of anyons at the central collider. Our
linear-response transport coefficients directly reflect the fractional charge
and statistics of the anyons involved, avoiding the need to measure
higher-order current correlations. Moreover, the emergence of finite
thermoelectric (Peltier and Seebeck) coefficients signifies the presence of
real anyon collisions (as opposed to virtual braiding in the time domain),
intimately associated with a broken particle-hole symmetry, specific to anyonic
gases.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper investigates double-Weyl states in cubic SrSi2 via optical spectroscopy, employing complex measurements spanning a wide frequency range and low temperatures. The study reveals that while conventional density-functional theory struggles to accurately describe the electronic structure of SrSi2 near the Fermi level, a semi-local exchange-correlation potential provides a better fit, suggesting a trivial (gapped) band structure with a direct gap of approximately 40 meV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding materials' electronic structure using optical spectroscopy and computational methods is motivated by the need to verify exotic states such as the double-Weyl state and to improve theoretical models in solid-state physics.

Method: The research employs optical spectroscopy techniques combined with ab initio calculations. The method involves measuring optical properties over a broad frequency range and low temperatures, and using computational models with varying levels of exchange-correlation potentials to analyze and interpret the data.

Result: The key findings are that the optical response of SrSi2 exhibits intraband (free carriers) and interband contributions, and the experiment shows that the electronic structure cannot be accurately described by conventional density-functional theory. Instead, using a semi-local exchange-correlation potential leads to a much better agreement with the experimental results, indicating a trivial band structure with a direct gap of approximately 40 meV.

Conclusion: This work provides evidence for the presence of a trivial (gapped) band structure in SrSi2, challenges the applicability of conventional density-functional theory in such materials, and suggests that a semi-local exchange-correlation functional may yield more accurate descriptions of their electronic properties.

Abstract: We probe the possible double-Weyl state in cubic SrSi2 using optical
spectroscopy. The complex optical conductivity was measured in a frequency
range from 70 to 22 000 cm-1 at temperatures down to 10 K at ambient pressure.
The optical response of SrSi2 can be well separated into the intraband (free
carriers) and interband contributions. Additionally, four infrared-active
phonons are detected. As follows from the optical spectra, the free-carrier
density decreases with decreasing temperature, consistent with an activation
behaviour. Experimental interband conductivity juxtaposed with ab initio
calculations shows that conventional density-functional theory fails to
describe the electronic structure of SrSi2 in the vicinity of the Fermi level.
A semi-local exchange-correlation potential allows a much better agreement with
the experiment, resulting in the trivial (gapped) band structure of SrSi2. The
direct gap estimated from the measurements is approximately 40 meV.

Abstract: Anyon colliders -- quantum Hall devices where dilute quasiparticle beams
collide at a quantum point contact -- provide an interferometer-free probe of
anyonic exchange phases through current cross correlations. Within a
non-equilibrium bosonization framework, the normalized cross-correlations take
a universal form depending only on the exchange phase and the dynamical
exponent, enabling experimental demonstration of anyonic statistics. This
result can be interpreted as time-domain interference -- braiding in time
rather than spatial exclusion or real-space interferometry. Extension to
hierarchical states shows that the semiclassical step-function description of
quasiparticles fails at large statistical angles. Introducing a finite soliton
width resolves this issue and enables quantitative modeling of charge-$e/5$
quasiparticle collisions.

Abstract: The use of spin waves in magnetic thin films at cryogenic temperatures has
long been hindered by the lack of a suitable material platform. Yttrium iron
garnet (YIG) is the leading candidate, yet it is typically grown on gadolinium
gallium garnet (GGG) substrates, which develop a large paramagnetic moment at
low temperatures. This substrate effect limits spin-wave propagation. In this
work, we demonstrate that thin YIG films grown on yttrium scandium gallium
garnet (YSGG) substrates support robust spin-wave propagation in the
Damon-Eshbach geometry, measurable down to 2 K under applied magnetic fields up
to 150 mT. Compared with YIG/GGG, YIG/YSGG films exhibit narrower ferromagnetic
resonance (FMR) linewidths at low temperatures and are free from the atomic
interdiffusion effects that degrade the performance of YIG/GGG systems. These
results establish YIG/YSGG thin films as a promising low-temperature platform,
overcoming the intrinsic limitations of YIG/GGG and opening new opportunities
for scalable magnonic and hybrid quantum devices operating under cryogenic
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the modeling of spintronic devices under high Joule heating effects, which is critical for advancing magnetic data storage and spintronic applications.

Method: The method involves deriving a dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski equation framework by treating the magnetization magnitude as a dynamic variable coupled to a thermal bath, which is then integrated and compared to stochastic equivalents.

Result: The results demonstrate that incorporating a dynamic magnetization magnitude leads to accurate modifications of the energy landscape and switching dynamics in high-anisotropy systems, enabling precise predictions of critical currents and switching times.

Conclusion: This approach provides a robust theoretical framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of spintronic devices under high Joule heating, which is essential for optimizing their performance and scalability.

Abstract: The atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is challenged when modeling
spintronic devices where Joule heating is significant, due to its core
assumption of a constant magnetization magnitude. Based on a statistical
framework that treats the magnetization magnitude as a dynamic variable coupled
to a thermal bath, we derive a dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski set of
equations for torques, that captures the transient, heating-induced
demagnetization that occurs during high-current operation. Integrating these
dynamic equations and comparing them to their stochastic equivalents reveals
that both the energy landscape and switching dynamics in high-anisotropy
systems are similarly modified. This approach yields accurate and accelerated
predictions of critical currents and switching times.

Motivation: The paper aims to explore the use of halide perovskites and polymer spacers in creating devices for spin control in light-matter interactions.

Method: They created a microcavity with two-dimensional halide perovskites, adjusting the polymer spacer thickness to control exciton-photon detuning. They used angle-resolved optical spectroscopy and circularly polarized laser excitation to study polariton behavior.

Result: The study showed that under circularly polarized excitation, high-energy excitons transfer to the lower polariton branch. This spin injection is preserved, enabling non-resonant spin control, with polaritons decaying fast enough for efficient emission.

Conclusion: This work provides new insights into controlling polaritons through spin mechanisms, which is crucial for applications like chiral lasers and switches.

Abstract: Exciton-polaritons, hybrid photon-exciton quasiparticles, constitute a useful
platform for the study of light-matter interaction and nonlinear photonic
applications. In this work, we realize a monolithic Tamm-plasmon microcavity
embedding a thin film of two-dimensional halide perovskites with a tunable
polymer spacer that controls the exciton-photon detuning. Angle-resolved
optical spectroscopy at room temperature reveals the lower polariton branch
dispersions in the linear regime for several detunings. Under circularly
polarized, non-resonant laser excitation, the spin injection of high-energy
excitons and their relaxation towards the lower polariton branch demonstrates
its preservation, in contrast to the bare exciton case. The spin-polarized
emission survives due to the fast decay of polaritons. Our results provide
promising insights into the non-resonant spin control of polaritonic devices,
including chiral lasers and switches.

### [218] [Stability of graphene hyperbolic pseudospheres under harsh conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04699)

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the creation of stable curved graphene structures under various stresses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation lies in studying the stability of graphene under extreme conditions, inspired by classical and quantum gravity analogies.

Method: The method involves a two-step Molecular Dynamics simulation: first forcing carbon atoms into a pseudospherical shape, then annealing them to form stable graphene.

Result: The pseudosphere structures are stable under significant deformation and temperature changes, suggesting they could be useful for testing graphene properties.

Conclusion: This methodology provides a practical approach for simulating curved graphene, aiding the development of future experiments.

Abstract: We demonstrate the high stability of simulated graphene hyperbolic
pseudospheres under large externally imposed deformations and high temperature
annealing. Hyperbolic pseudospheres are produced in a two-step Molecular
Dynamics simulation process. First, carbon atoms are forced down a thin
three-dimensional volume of a chosen shape. During this extrusion process the
carbon atoms form a precursor to graphene that is unrealistically less stable
than graphite or diamond. Then the unstable carbon structure is annealed inside
the thin volume at high temperature, turning the carbon into realistic
polycrystalline, curved graphene. Point defects naturally appear in numbers and
places that stabilize the graphene in the desired shape, without high residual
stresses. We applied this new methodology to the creation of graphene
hyperbolic pseudosphere surfaces, which reproduce analogs to some aspects of
classical or quantum gravity. The free edges of the pseudosphere cause bending
of the graphene. When these free edges are removed from the simulations by
attaching periodic flat graphene sheets to the pseudosphere edges, the carbon
atoms assume positions just some tenths of \r{A} from the mathematical
hyperbolic pseudosphere surface. In demanding tests of their stability, the
hyperbolic pseudospheres proved stable against $20^\circ$ shearing or $20\%$
elongation and then being released, which eventually raised their temperatures
by $\sim 300 \ \text{K}$. Our methodology is relatively easy to use and offers
a practical way to create simulated curved graphene surfaces of almost any
shape. It allows for thorough testing in advance of the stability of graphene
shapes that are to be produced experimentally.

Abstract: In recent years, the study of Majorana signatures in quantum transport has
become a central focus in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a rigorous
and systematic derivation of the fermionic superoperator describing the open
quantum dynamics of electron transport through Majorana zero modes, building on
the techniques introduced in Phys. Rev. B 105, 035121 (2022). The numerical
implementation of this superoperator is to construct its differential
equivalence, the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The HEOM approach
describes the system-bath correlated dynamics. Furthermore, we also develop a
functional derivative scheme that provides exact expressions for the transport
observables in terms of the auxiliary density operators introduced in the HEOM
formulation. The superoperator formalism establishes a solid theoretical
foundation for analyzing key transport signatures that may uncover the unique
characteristics of Majorana physics in mesoscopic systems.

Abstract: This paper presents mathematical modeling and numerical analysis of
bifurcation and synchronization phenomena in a system of coupled oscillators
driven by a finite-power energy source and generating two-dimensional
stick-slip translational-rotational vibrations. The mechanical system consists
of rigid disks placed on moving belts and asymmetrically connected to a support
via springs, with each disk simultaneously performing translational and
rotational motion. The belts are driven by a common DC motor. The disk contacts
the belt over a finite contact area, resulting in mutually coupled frictional
force and torque through their dependence on the linear and angular slip
velocity. The paper utilizes special approximations of the resultant frictional
forces and torques based on generalizations of Pad\'e's developements, in which
special smoothing elements are introduced to avoid singularities when the
relative motion between the disk and belt disappears. Furthermore, the model
also provides a smooth approximation of the friction model, in which static
friction is greater than kinetic friction. Numerical analysis was conducted
based on direct numerical simulations, Poincare maps, and bifurcation diagrams.
It was shown that the system can exhibit a two-dimensional stick-slip
phenomenon, and the system exhibits predominantly periodic dynamics, sometimes
with a very long period. In this work, a system of two oscillators driven by a
common, limited-power motor was studied, which can synchronize and oscillate in
phase or in counterphase.

### [221] [Seal Whisker-Inspired Sensor for Amplifying Wake-Induced Vibrations in Underwater Marine Animal Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03664)
*Yuyan Wu,Sanjay Giridharan,Leixin Ma,Hae Young Noh*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: Paper proposes a new whisker-inspired sensor with spiral perforations for detecting animal-induced wakes, achieving 51x amplification in vibrations compared to baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective underwater monitoring is vital for ecological studies and marine conservation. Current sensors like tagging or sonar are invasive, energy-inefficient, or limited by environmental conditions. Inspired by seal whiskers, which sense flow through vibratory cues, this research aims to create a more effective and less invasive solution for detecting animal-induced wake patterns using hydrodynamic principles.

Method: The research employs a combination of experimental design and computational analysis. Frequency response simulations of a whisker-base structure under harmonic water pressure were conducted to assess the sensor's performance. They optimized spiral perforated designs using these simulations to enhance frequency sensitivity. Field experiments using the optimized sensor were performed to validate the theoretical findings.

Result: The sensor, designed with a spiral-perforated base, showed significant enhancement in vibration response. Simulations revealed up to 51x root mean squared displacement at sensor locations for frequency bands linked to animal-induced wakes. Physical testing confirmed these results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the spiral design for detecting wake patterns.

Conclusion: The study makes a valuable contribution to the development of wk-based sensors through parametric testing and optimization, opening doors to more effective methods for underwater animal monitoring.

Abstract: Underwater marine animal monitoring is essential for assessing biodiversity,
evaluating ecosystem health, and understanding the effects of offshore
structures. Traditional approaches such as tagging, sonar, and camera systems
are often invasive, energy-intensive, or limited by poor visibility and water
turbidity. Inspired by the hydrodynamic sensing of seal whiskers, wavy whisker
vibration sensors have been developed for flow velocity and angle-of-attack
detection. However, most prior work has focused on sensor characterization and
only forward modeling, with limited exploration of the inverse problem of
inferring animal movement. Moreover, current sensor sensitivity to vortex
street wakes generated by swimming animals remains insufficient for practical
monitoring. To address this gap, we develop a whisker-inspired sensor with a
spiral-perforated base that amplifies vibrations within frequency ranges
relevant to animal-induced wakes. We further characterize the influence of
spiral parameters on the sensitive frequency band, enabling adaptation of the
design to specific species. We evaluated the amplification effect of the
spiral-perforated design using frequency response simulations of the
whisker-base structure under harmonic water pressure. Results show up to 51x
enhancement in root mean squared displacement at the target sensor location
within frequency bands associated with animal-induced wakes compared to the
baseline design, confirming the effectiveness of the amplification.

Abstract: Manoeuvring untethered, centimetre-scale airborne structures has been a
long-standing challenge. Active flight systems, relying on high-power-density
actuators alongside mechanical and electronic components, are constrained by
critical limitations in energy delivery and miniaturisation. In contrast,
passive systems transported and distributed by the wind typically lack the
capability for mid-air controlled manoeuvrability. Here we report an
ultra-light (1.2 mg) hexagonal polymeric assembly capable of passive flight
with optical control of its trajectory. This dandelion-inspired micro-flyer
incorporates six radially arranged filamentous structures, of which morphology
is dynamically controlled through photomechanical deformation by six
independent soft actuators made of liquid crystalline elastomer thin films.
Compared to the diaspore of the dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), micro-flyer
demonstrate a similar terminal velocity (~0.5 m s-1), 45% better positional
stability and nearly zero rotational rate (1.68 s-1; natural seeds: 50.8 s-1).
Particle image velocimetry reveals that a stable asymmetric separated vortex
ring underlies its flight stability, enabling mid-air steerability. When
free-falling in a low-turbulent airstream, the light-driven hexapodal fliers
demonstrate precise altitude control, reversible body flipping, pattern
formation, interactive swarm, and controlled trajectories across
three-dimensional space. The results show that responsive materials with
light-induced asymmetry can bring about manoeuvrability in air, paving the way
for agile, untethered controlled micro-fliers.

reversibility. We also highlight the emerging use of SAW devices to probe
adsorption desorption dynamics, offering analyte specific interaction
signatures beyond equilibrium, offering a new perspective into analyte specific
interaction pathways. Additionally, the integration of machine learning is
discussed as a transformative tool for signal decoding, environmental
compensation, and adaptive calibration. We also identify key challenges, cross
sensitivity, signal drift, material degradation, and deployment at the edge and
review recent strategies to address them. Looking ahead, we envision the
evolution of SAW platforms into intelligent, autonomous sensing systems with
applications in environmental monitoring, industrial process control, and

Abstract: Non-conventional beyond-the-state-of-the-art signal processing schemes
require parallelism, scalability, robustness and energy efficiency to meet the
demands of complex data-driven applications. With further research, magnonic
and spintronic circuits can potentially help to fulfill these requirements. We
present an experimental proof-of-concept of a hybrid device that can employ
broad deteriorated microwave signals to excite and detect low energy
propagating spin waves (SWs). For this, we use the output signal of a
spin-transfer torque nano-oscillator (STNO) and connect it to a RF filter based
on a magnonic delay-line. The STNO serves as a tunable nano-scaled signal
generator with a broad output linewidth. Its RF output is fed as input into the
magnonic delay-line circuit. Tuning the magnetic field solely at the magnonic
circuit, we demonstrate the capability to selectively filter a broad RF input,
obtaining a spin-wave output signal with a much narrower linewidth. This allows
to tune the frequency of the RF signal at the output simply by tuning the
magnetic field. Our findings are a first step towards a versatile,
energy-efficient and compact wave-based filter with high sensitivity. Such a
device can use even low-power, degraded signals and convert them into tunable
SW outputs, effectively reducing the need for charge-based signal processing.
