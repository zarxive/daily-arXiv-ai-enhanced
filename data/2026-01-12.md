### [1] [Phase Frustration Induced Intrinsic Bose Glass in the Kitaev-Bose-Hubbard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05781)

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

Abstract: We report an intrinsic "Bubble Phase" in the two-dimensional Kitaev-Bose-Hubbard model, driven purely by phase frustration between complex hopping and anisotropic pairing. By combining Inhomogeneous Gutzwiller Mean-Field Theory with a Bogoliubov-de Gennes stability analysis augmented by a novel Energy Penalty Method, we demonstrate that this phase spontaneously fragments into coherent islands, exhibiting the hallmark Bose glass signature of finite compressibility without global superfluidity. Notably, we propose a unified framework linking disorder-driven localization to deterministic phase frustration, identifying the Bubble Phase as a pristine, disorder-free archetype of the Bose glass. Our results provide a theoretical blueprint for realizing glassy dynamics in clean quantum simulators.

Abstract: Rotation is a natural tool in ultracold gases to break time-reversal symmetry, yet its impact on the collective excitations of supersolids remains largely unexplored. We show theoretically that tuning the rotation frequency, (rather than the interparticle interactions), can trigger the superfluid-to-supersolid transition in Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs). Computing excitation spectra in the presence of vortices and persistent currents, we uncover a vortex-driven de-softening mechanism whereby quantized vorticity elevates the gapless Goldstone mode to a finite-energy roton, restoring superfluidity. This effect results in re-entrant supersolid phases as a function of rotation frequency, revealing a fundamental coupling between topological defects and crystalline order.

### [3] [Emission Dynamics of Rydberg Excitons in $\mathbf{\mathrm{Cu_2O}}$: Distinguishing Second Harmonic Generation from Secondary Emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05372)
*Kerwan Morin,Poulab Chakrabarti,Delphine Lagarde,Maxime Mauguet,Sylwia Zielińska - Raczyńska,David Ziemkiewicz,Xavier Marie,Thomas Boulier*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: This paper investigates the optical response of Cu₂O under resonant two-photon excitation, identifying two distinct mechanisms: coherent second-harmonic generation (SHG) and radiative decay (secondary emission, SE).

motivation: Understanding these mechanisms is critical for interpreting nonlinear and quantum-optical experiments involving high-n states.

method: Time-resolved resonant two-photon excitation is used to separate and analyze SHG and SE independently.

result: The study reveals the different sensitivities of SHG and SE to phonons, defects, and many-body effects, and provides practical criteria for distinguishing them in experiments.

conclusion: A unified framework is established for interpreting Rydberg exciton emission, with guidelines for future research.

Motivation: Understanding the behavior of Rydberg excitons under resonance is key to interpreting nonlinear optical phenomena and optimizing experimental conditions for their study.

Method: Time-resolved resonant two-photon excitation is employed to distinguish secondary emission (SE) and coherent second-harmonic generation (SHG).

Result: The research demonstrates that SHG and SE have distinct temperature, power, and phonon sensitivities, enabling their separate identification under various experimental conditions.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive approach to analyzing and controlling the emission mechanisms of Rydberg excitons, facilitating their application in quantum optics and related fields.

Abstract: Rydberg excitons in $\mathrm{Cu_2O}$ simultaneously give rise to two very different optical responses under resonant two-photon excitation: a coherent second-harmonic signal mediated by the excitonic second order susceptibility tensor $χ^{(2)}$, and a secondary emission originating from the radiative decay of real exciton populations. Distinguishing these two channels is essential for interpreting nonlinear and quantum-optical experiments based on high-$n$ states, yet their temporal, spectral, and power-dependent signatures often overlap. Here we use time-resolved resonant two-photon excitation to cleanly separate SHG and SE and to map how each depends on $n$, temperature, excitation power, and crystal quality. This approach reveals the markedly different sensitivities of the two processes to phonons, defects, and many-body effects, and establishes practical criteria for identifying SE and SHG in a wide range of experimental conditions. Our results provide a unified framework for interpreting emission from Rydberg excitons and offer guidelines for future studies aiming to exploit their nonlinear response and long-range interactions.

The paper also explores quantum features such as vorticity and dissipation, suggesting potential applications in quantum turbulence and supersolid-like states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding pattern formation in quantum systems under external modulation bridges quantum hydrodynamics with classical studies, offering insights into collective phenomena and potential technological applications.

Method: The paper reviews experimental studies involving different quantum gas systems, mathematical modeling of surface and internal waves, and analysis of hydrodynamic instabilities and quantum features.

Result: Key findings include universal hydrodynamic behavior, evidence of quantum turbulence, and collective quantum phenomena like vortices and sound modes in driven condensates.

Conclusion: The review suggests that studying quantum fluids under external driving could lead to new insights into quantum turbulence, hydrodynamic instabilities, and the interplay between quantum and classical dynamics in nonequilibrium systems

Abstract: Spontaneous pattern formation out of homogeneous media is one of the well-understood examples of hydrodynamic instabilities in classical systems, which naturally leads to the question of its manifestation in quantum fluids. Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of atomic gases have been an ideal platform for studying many-body quantum phenomena, such as superfluidity, and simultaneously providing an opportunity to broaden our understanding of classical hydrodynamics into quantum systems. In this review, we introduce a range of experimental studies on the pattern formation in quantum fluids of atomic gases under external driving, including Faraday waves in one and two dimensions, surface patterns, and counterflow instabilities in a mixture of superfluids. The pattern formation in the quantum system can be understood through the parametric amplification process, where an unstable dynamical mode can be exponentially amplified, similar to classical systems. Remarkably, the governing equations for surface excitations of trapped BECs can be mathematically equivalent to those of shallow water, indicating a universal description of the hydrodynamic instability across classical and quantum domains. However, the condensates, as superfluids, also possess fundamental quantum characteristics, such as quantized vorticity and a distinct dissipation channel. These unique features showcase many-body fragmentation under strong modulation and the generation of vortices in the nonlinear regime, which could offer a pathway to the study of quantum turbulence. Furthermore, the coexistence of long-range phase coherence and density modulation in driven condensates could provide unexplored features, such as those seen in supersolid-like sound modes, within nonequilibrium settings.

Abstract: At its lowest frequencies, LIGO is limited by noise in its many degrees of freedom of suspended optics, which, in turn, introduce noise in the interferometer through their feedback control systems. Nonlinear interactions are a dominant source of low-frequency noise, mixing noise from multiple degrees of freedom. The lowest-order form is bilinear noise, in which the noise from two feedback-controlled subsystems multiplies to mask gravitational waves. Bilinear couplings require control trade-offs that simultaneously balance high- and low-frequency noise. Currently, there is no known lower limit to bilinear control noise. Here, we develop benchmark cost functions for bilinear noise and associated figures of merit. Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control then establishes aggressive feedback that saturates the lower bounds on the cost functions. We then develop a mixed LQG and $H_\infty$ approach to directly compute stable, robust, and optimal feedback, using the LIGO's alignment control system as an example. Direct computations are fast while ensuring a global optimum. By calculating optimal robust control, it is possible to construct the lower bound on controls noise along the Pareto front of practical controllers for LIGO. This method can be used to drastically improve controls noise in existing observatories as well as to set subsystem control noise requirements for next-generation detectors with parameterized design.

Abstract: At MAX IV pixelated area detectors are operated at high frame rates to take advantage of the X-ray beam properties available from the fourth generation synchrotron in scattering, diffraction and imaging applications. A variety of photon counting and charge integrating detectors and sCMOS cameras have been integrated into a common data acquisition (DAQ) system in which data are streamed to a central Kubernetes cluster, mounting an IBM Storage Scale (GPFS) file system. The DAQ system provides live feedback from the detectors/cameras and extends to enable on-the-fly data processing. Control system integration via Tango provides a standardised single interface for controlling all DAQ components. Starting from an overview of the detector types in use, we describe the design and implementation of the MAX~IV detector-DAQ system and report a quantitative study of its performance in terms of data throughput and detector operating rates.

Abstract: We investigate the characteristics of circular geodesics around loop quantum Reissner-Nordström black hole (LQRNBH) and the radiation properties and observational appearance of a thin accretion disk around it. By calculating the shadow radius and utilizing observational data from M87* and Sgr A*, we derive constraints on the quantum parameter $ζ$ and charge parameter $Q$. The timelike circular geodesics around LQRNBH and the influence of the model parameters on the circular motion are also discussed. It is found that contrary to the case of the parameter $Q$, the increase of the quantum parameter $ζ$ leads to the increase of the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). Then, by considering a thin accretion disk model, various radiation properties of the LQRNBH and the effects of the model parameters on them are studied. Concrete examples are provided for quantitative comparison of the radiation properties between LQRNBH and Schwarzschild black hole. With the ray-tracing method, the isoradial curves, redshift distributions, and the observed radiation fluxes of the direct and secondary images of the LQRNBH with the thin accretion disk for various model parameters and observation angles are numerically calculated and discussed. These results are beneficial for us to understand the physical consequences of loop quantum gravity effect.

Conclusion: SwKB方法在量子宇宙学的隧穿研究中是有效的补充方法。

Abstract: The WKB approximation is a standard tool for studying tunnelling problems in quantum cosmology. We compare this method to the Supersymmetric WKB (SWKB) applied to a closed FRW minisuperspace model. We consider the transition from a dust towards a dark energy-dominated epoch can be explained by a generalized Chaplygin gas. Using analytic approximations for the superpotential (power-series and a Picard approximation), we derive closed-form SWKB tunnelling expressions and compute transmission probabilities as functions of the Chaplygin parameters $A$, $B$ and $α$. Numerical root-finding locates classical turning points and numerical integration allows comparison with standard WKB results. We find that SWKB and WKB agree when the WKB validity condition holds, while the SWKB yields systematically larger (and plausibly more accurate) tunnelling probabilities for parameter values where the WKB assumptions break down. The results support the SWKB as a useful complementary approach for barrier-transmission studies in quantum cosmology.

Abstract: The detection of quadratic quasi-normal modes would provide a direct probe into black hole nonlinear perturbations. We report the first observational evidence of a set of quadratic quasi-normal modes in the gravitational-wave ringdown of a binary black hole merger. Analyzing the signal from GW250114, we detect six nonlinear modes from the quadratic coupling of the fundamental $(2,2,0)$ mode and its first two overtones. At 5 final mass ($M_\mathrm{f}$) after the merger, the evidence for these nonlinear modes reaches a Bayes factor of 74. To single out these contributions, we employ recent theoretical progress to compute the waveforms and subtract the corresponding nonlinear modes from a numerical relativity surrogate waveform. Our data analysis uses a novel method that incorporates inspiral-merger inference results as a highly constraining prior for the ringdown inference. We further perform a test allowing for phenomenological deviations for the theoretically predicted amplitudes of the quadratic modes. The results show that an amplitude of zero is excluded at $3.0~σ$ significance level, while the theoretical expectation is consistent with the inference. This detection marks a first step towards observationally characterizing nonlinear perturbations in the ringdown of a black hole.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This work systematically investigates the post-Newtonian behavior of general quadratic gravity in the weak-field regime. By extending the Einstein-Hilbert action to include quadratic curvature terms as $\mathcal{L}\propto R-λC^2+μR^2$, the theory introduces two massive modes: a scalar mode and a ghost tensor mode. Using the post-Newtonian expansion method, we derive the explicit expressions for the metric for a general source up to 1.5PN order. Furthermore, for a point-mass source, we extend the solution to 2PN order and evaluate the effective Parameterized Post-Newtonian parameters $γ(r)$ and $β(r)$. The results show that deviations from General Relativity are exponentially suppressed. The theory has the feature $γ(r)\equiv 1$ when $m_R=m_W$, and to ensure that gravity remains attractive, we have $m_W>m_R/4$. The leading correction to $β(r)$ exhibiting a characteristic $\mathcal{O}(r \ln (r)e^{-mr})$ dependence. Based on the Solar System experiments, we derive preliminary constraints on the theory's parameters: $m_R,m_W\gtrsim23~\mathrm{AU}^{-1}$, corresponding to $λ\lesssim2.1\times10^{19}~\mathrm{m}^2$ and $μ\lesssim 7.1\times 10^{18}~\mathrm{m}^2$. This study provides a theoretical foundation for future tests of quadratic gravity using pulsar timing arrays, gravitational-wave observations, and laboratory-scale short-range gravity experiments.

*Robin Geyer,Sven Zschocke,Michael Soffel,Sergei Klioner,Lennart Lindegren,Uwe Lammers*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Small-field astrometric missions face significant challenges in detecting gravitational waves due to limited field size and the absorption of differential effects by calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the detection of gravitational waves using astrometric methods, particularly in small-field data, and to highlight the limitations of such an approach.

Method: The paper employs theoretical derivations and numerical simulations to model the astrometric effects of gravitational waves and assess their detectability in small fields.

Result: Small-field missions are limited in their ability to measure gravitational wave effects due to the small differential astrometric signals and the impact of calibration inaccuracies.

Conclusion: Small-field astrometric data are not well-suited for detecting gravitational waves because the measurable effects are too small and heavily affected by calibration errors.

Abstract: Astrometric observations can, in principle, be used to detect gravitational waves. In this paper we give a practical overview of the gravitational wave effects which can be expected specifically in small-field astrometric data. Particular emphasis is placed on the differential effect between pairs of sources within a finite field of view. We also present several general findings that are not restricted to the small-field case. A detailed theoretical derivation of the general astrometric effect of a plane gravitational wave is provided. Numerical simulations, which underline our theoretical findings, are presented.
  We find that small-field missions suffer from significant detrimental properties, largely because their relatively small fields only allow the measurement of small differential effects which can be expected to be almost totally absorbed by standard plate calibrations.

Abstract: The trapping (or apparent) horizon serves as a key tool for tracing the complete evolution of black holes. We investigate a class of coordinate singularities induced by such trapping (or apparent) horizons in a spherically symmetric, dynamic spacetime, which are distinct from the well-known coordinate singularities associated with the Killing horizon. In particular, we clarify the geometric structure of this coordinate singularity by means of the Kodama vector field, thereby avoiding unphysical artifacts. We further employ the evolving Ellis drainhole as an analytical model to illustrate key details of this phenomenon.

Abstract: Topology change in Lorentzian quantum gravity demands geometric regulators that control curvature, spin structure, and chirality during nontrivial interpolations. We develop a framework for regulated topology change based on smooth Lorentzian spin cobordisms with interpolating metrics, allowing a transient failure of global hyperbolicity while preserving smoothness, Lorentz signature, and spin compatibility. Within this framework we introduce the Chiral Weyl Curvature Diagnostic, a curvature-based functional that weights topology-changing geometries by conformal curvature, spin admissibility, and topological complexity. The diagnostic functional is built from Weyl curvature invariants and includes a parity-odd dual Weyl term that is sensitive to geometric chirality. Spin consistency is enforced via a Stiefel-Whitney constraint, ensuring that only physically admissible cobordisms contribute. As an example, we construct a smooth spin cobordism between a Morris-Thorne wormhole and asymptotically flat Minkowski spacetime. In the throat region the curvature response is shown to be Weyl-dominated, and the parity-odd Weyl contribution sharply distinguishes chiral knotted embeddings while vanishing for amphichiral configurations. We then show that braids provide a natural language of throat dynamics: evolving wormhole throats trace time-dependent braid movies, with elementary braid generators representing the fundamental topological operations of the cobordism. Replacing crossing number by a braid-based complexity refines the diagnostic functional to operate at the level of these elementary exchanges and extends it naturally to multithroat and networked configurations.

Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) uniquely combines the advantages of optical contrast with deep tissue penetration capability of acoustic waves, enabling imaging at depths of several centimeters. Conventional photoacoustic imaging methods have relied on pulsed lasers to induce the photoacoustic effect, coupled with arrays of pressure transducers to detect the resulting ultrasound signals. In this work, we propose an alternative all-optical approach that leverages optical deflection to record photoacoustic waves by an array of detection beams. The measured signal is shown to be the Radon transform of the pressure gradients. An optimization-based inversion procedure is used to reconstruct the initial time pressure gradient field. Subsequently, a Galerkin method is used to reconstruct the pressure field from the pressure gradient field. The new modality offers the potential for enhanced sensitivity and reduced signal distortion, advancing the capabilities of photoacoustic imaging beyond traditional transducer-based systems.

Abstract: Whisker-like touch sensors offer unique advantages for short-range perception in environments where visual and long-range sensing are unreliable, such as confined, cluttered, or low-visibility settings. This paper presents a framework for estimating contact points and robot localization in a known planar environment using a single whisker sensor. We develop a family of virtual sensor models. Each model maps robot configurations to sensor observations and enables structured reasoning through the concept of preimages - the set of robot states consistent with a given observation. The notion of virtual sensor models serves as an abstraction to reason about state uncertainty without dependence on physical implementation. By combining sensor observations with a motion model, we estimate the contact point. Iterative estimation then enables reconstruction of obstacle boundaries. Furthermore, intersecting states inferred from current observations with forward-projected states from previous steps allow accurate robot localization without relying on vision or external systems. The framework supports both deterministic and possibilistic formulations and is validated through simulation and physical experiments using a low-cost, 3D printed, Hall-effect-based whisker sensor. Results demonstrate accurate contact estimation and localization with errors under 7 mm, demonstrating the potential of whisker-based sensing as a lightweight, adaptable complement to vision-based navigation.

Abstract: Magnetrons are widely used as a high-efficiency, large-power, and low-cost microwave source. This article proposes a method to improve the magnetron output characteristics based on regulating its anode current by a novel active distortion eliminator. It takes advantage of the constant current state of MOSFETs to suppress the anode current ripple and eliminate the magnetron output ripples. An improved switch-mode power supply is applied to a 1-kW commercial S -band magnetron in the experiment. The peak-to-peak anode current ripple is reduced from 31 to 7 mA. The spectral width of the free-running magnetron is decreased from 246 to 87 kHz. In the injection locking state, the spur noise is significantly reduced with a maximum suppression strength of 23 dB at a 100-Hz offset. The peak-to-peak value of the magnetron magnitude and phase jitter are suppressed to 15% and 16% of their original values at a power injection ratio of 0.13. This method provides a novel approach for stabilizing the output phase of an injection-locked magnetron, making it promising for applications in phased arrays, wireless power transfer, particle accelerators, large-power communication, and other scenarios that require high phase stability.

TL;DR: 在 grown 晶圆片上分析 GaN Schottky 隔离二极管（SBD）的反向电流机制，发现使用 Sapphire 晶圆时有两种导电机制，分别是 Poole-Frenkel 发射（PFE）和陷阱辅助隧道化（TAT），对应的陷阱电位分别为 0.9 eV 和 0.3 eV。而在 native GaN 晶圆上只有 PFE 被观察到，陷阱电位为 0.75 eV。这一差异表明，在 Sapphire 晶圆上生长的结构中存在较高的位错密度，导致 TAT 的出现。

Result: 在 Sapphire 晶圆上，除了 PFE 外，还观察到陷阱辅助隧道化 (TAT)，其陷阱电位较低。在 native GaN 晶圆上仅存在 PFE，陷阱电位较高。这表明 Sapphire 晶圆片中较高的位错密度与 TAT 的出现有关。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，GaN Schottky 隔离二极管在不同晶圆片上的反向电流机制不同，这与材料生长环境和结构缺陷有关，对优化二极管性能具有重要参考价值。

Abstract: In this work, we analyse the reverse current mechanisms in GaN Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) grown on sapphire and native GaN substrates. For the sapphire-substrate sample, two conduction mechanisms are identified: Poole-Frenkel emission (PFE) and trap-assisted tunneling (TAT), with corresponding trap energy levels of 0.9 eV and 0.3 eV, respectively. In contrast, only PFE is observed in the GaN-substrate sample, with a trap energy of 0.75 eV, suggesting that the presence of TAT is related to the higher dislocation density in structures grown on sapphire substrates. The leakage mechanisms and associated trap energies are extracted by comparing experimental current-voltage (I-V) characteristics with a model that includes thermionic emission and tunneling contributions for different temperatures, from 298K up to 443K.

### [19] [The Self-Duality Equations on a Riemann Surface and Four-Dimensional Chern-Simons Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05309)
*Roland Bittleston,Lionel Mason,Seyed Faroogh Moosavian*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: We propose a four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory framework that underlies Hitchin's self-duality equations and its integrable structure, identifying the twistor parameter with dependence on a CP^1-valued parameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying the geometric and integrable structures of moduli spaces, especially that of Higgs bundles, is a central goal in modern geometry and theoretical physics. Understanding how such frameworks underlie key equations like Hitchin's self-duality provides deeper insights into the mathematical physics of these systems.

Method: We start from a four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory on Σ x CP^1, incorporating appropriate boundary conditions and analyzing the dependence on a CP^1-valued parameter. By reducing this four-dimensional theory to two dimensions, we derive two-dimensional action principles governing Hitchin's self-duality equations. We then compute the symplectic structures induced by the four-dimensional theory and relate them to the hyperkähler symplectic forms on the Hitchin moduli space, identifying the CP^1 parameter with the twistor parameter.

Result: By constructing a novel four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory framework, we elucidate how the integrable structures of the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles arise from this four-dimensional theory. The key result is that by varying the CP^1-valued parameter, we obtain a family of symplectic structures on the moduli space that correspond to its hyperkähler structure. This identifies the twistor parameter of the Hitchin moduli space as the CP^1-valued parameter of the four-dimensional theory.

Conclusion: This paper bridges four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory with the study of moduli spaces of Higgs bundles, providing a novel framework to understand their integrable structures and highlighting the role of the twistor parameter.

Abstract: We construct a Lagrangian formulation of Hitchin's self-duality equations on a Riemann surface $Σ$ using potentials for the connection and Higgs field. This two-dimensional action is then obtained from a four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory on $Σ\times \mathbb{CP}^1$ with an appropriate choice of meromorphic 1-form on $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and boundary conditions at its poles. We show that the symplectic structure induced by the four-dimensional theory coincides with the canonical symplectic form on the Hitchin moduli space in the complex structure corresponding to the moduli space of Higgs bundles. We further provide a direct construction of Hitchin Hamiltonians in terms of the four-dimensional gauge field. Exploiting the freedom in the choice of the meromorphic one-form, we construct a family of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theories depending on a $\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter. Upon reduction to two dimensions, these descend to a corresponding family of two-dimensional actions on $Σ$ whose field equations are again Hitchin's equations. Furthermore, we obtain a family of symplectic structures from our family of four-dimensional theories and show that they agree with the hyperkähler family of symplectic forms on the Hitchin moduli space, thereby identifying the $\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter with the twistor parameter of the Hitchin moduli space. Our results place Hitchin's equations and their integrable structure within the framework of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory and make the role of the twistor parameter manifest.

Abstract: Exciton dynamics in layered magnetic semiconductors provide a sensitive probe of the interplay between spin order and light-matter interaction. Here, we study thin CrSBr layers using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy in an external magnetic field, revealing a step-like reduction in the exciton lifetime from 11 to 7 ps, during the magnetization flip from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase. The reduction of the exciton lifetime in the ferromagnetic phase persists below the Néel temperature, as evidenced by its strong magnetic-field dependence that disappears in the paramagnetic phase. Ab initio calculations reveal a one-dimensional nature of free excitons accompanied by a pronounced change in the oscillator strength across the magnetic phase transition predicting a shorter radiative lifetime of free excitons in the antiferromagnetic phase of CrSBr contradicting the experimental observations. This discrepancy is explained by strong localization of excitons at low tempature. We show both experimentally and theoretically that the observed magnetic switching of the exciton lifetime is attributed to a larger exciton localization volume leading to a larger oscillator strength in the ferromagnetic phase. The results show that disorder-induced localization effects play a key role in exciton dynamics in CrSBr.

Abstract: In applications such as atmospheric monitoring of greenhouse gases and pollutants, the detection and identification of trace concentrations of harmful gases is commonly achieved using non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors. These devices employ a broadband infrared emitter, thermopile detector, and a spectrally selective bandpass filter tuned to the vibrational resonance of the target analyte. However, the fabrication of these filters is costly and limited to a single frequency. This limitation introduces a fundamental tradeoff, as broadening the optical passband width enhances sensitivity but compromises selectivity, whereas narrowing improves selectivity at the expense of sensitivity. In this work, we validate a filterless NDIR approach using a multi-peak thermal emitter developed through inverse design. This emitter enhances detection sensitivity by targeting multiple absorption bands, demonstrated through the creation of a sensor designed for the C-H vibrational modes of propane. Additionally, a set of single-peak emitters were developed to showcase the capability of designing highly selective sensors operating within close spectral proximity. These emitters, targeting the stretching modes of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, exhibit Q-factors above 50 and minimal crosstalk, enabling accurate detection of the target gas without interference from gases with spectrally adjacent absorption bands. This is enabled by the implementation of an aperiodic distributed Bragg reflectors, which allows for higher Q-factors with fewer layers than a periodic Bragg reflector using the same materials and number of layers, thereby reducing fabrication complexity and cost. Experimental results validate that this approach breaks the tradeoff between sensitivity and selectivity. This work highlights the potential of optimized thermal emitters for more efficient and compact gas sensing applications.

Abstract: Interfacial interactions in two parallel-stacked hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) layers facilitate sliding ferroelectricity, enabling novel device functionalities. Additionally, when Bernal or twisted bilayer graphene is aligned with an hBN layer, unconventional ferroelectric behavior was observed, though its precise origin remains unclear. Here, we propose an alternative approach to engineering such an unconventional ferroelectricity in graphene-hBN van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures by creating specific types of hBN boundaries and interfaces. We found that the unconventional ferroelectricity can occur--without the alignments at graphene-hBN or hBN-hBN interfaces--when there are hBN edges or interfaces with line defects. By systematically analyzing the gate dependence of mobile and localized charges, we identified key characteristics of localized states that underlie the observed unconventional ferroelectricity, informing future studies. These findings highlight the complexity of the interfacial interactions in graphene/hBN systems, and demonstrate the potential for defect engineering in vdW heterostructures.

Abstract: Altermagnet-superconductor heterostructures have been shown, in principle, to provide a route towards realising topological superconductivity, and therefore host topologically protected boundary states. In this work we demonstrate that the topological states observed are dependent on the structure of the underlying lattice. By deriving and analysing a model on a honeycomb lattice, we demonstrate that the topological phase diagram has a rich structure containing both chiral edge modes and Majorana corner modes, the latter of which are an indication of higher-order topology. We analyse the effect of disorder on these states and find that whilst the edge modes are robust to a disordered system, any potential observation of the corner modes may be sensitive to the microscopic details. In particular, we show that vacancies can lead to other low energy bound states that may be difficult to distinguish from the corner modes.

Abstract: When subjected to a strong magnetic field, electrons on a two-dimensional lattice acquire a fractal energy spectrum called Hofstadter's butterfly. In addition to its unique recursive structure, the Hofstadter butterfly is intimately linked to non-trivial topological orders, hosting a cascade of ground states characterized by non-zero topological invariants. These states, called Chern insulators, are usually understood as replicas of the ground states of the quantum Hall effect, with electrical and thermal conductances that should be quantized, reflecting their topological order. The Hofstadter butterfly is now commonly observed in van-der-Waals heterostructures-based moiré superlattices. However, its thermal properties, particularly the quantized heat flow expected in the Chern insulators, have not been investigated, potentially questioning their similarity with standard quantum Hall states. Here we probe the heat transport properties of the Hofstadter butterfly, obtained in a graphene~/~hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattice. We observe a quantized heat flow, uniquely set by the topological invariant, for all investigated states of the Hofstadter butterfly: quantum Hall states, Chern insulators, and even symmetry-broken Chern insulators emerging from strong electronic interactions. Our work firmly establishes the universality of the quantization of heat transport and its intimate link with topology.

Abstract: Coherent interconnects between gate-defined silicon quantum processing units are essential for scalable quantum computation and long-range entanglement. We argue that one-dimensional electron channels formed in the silicon quantum well of a Si/SiGe heterostructure exhibit strong Coulomb interactions and realize strongly interacting Luttinger liquid physics. At low electron densities, the system enters a Wigner regime characterized by dominant 4kF correlations; increasing the electron density leads to a crossover from the Wigner regime to a Friedel regime with dominant 2kF correlations. We support these results through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the interacting ground state under both screened and unscreened Coulomb potentials. We propose experimental signatures of the Wigner-Friedel crossover via charge transport and charge sensing in both zero- and high-magnetic field limits. We also analyze the impact of short-range correlated disorder - including random alloy fluctuations and valley splitting variations - and identify that the Wigner-Friedel crossover remains robust until disorder levels of about 400 micro eV. Finally, we show that the Wigner regime enables long-range capacitive coupling between quantum dots across the interconnect, suggesting a route to create long-range entanglement between solid-state qubits. Our results position silicon interconnects as a platform for studying Luttinger liquid physics and for enabling architectures supporting nonlocal quantum error correction and quantum simulation.

Abstract: We present an extensive theoretical analysis of transport and circular currents and the associated induced magnetic fields in Fibonacci rings, explored in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian descriptions, with particular attention to configurations preserving or breaking PT symmetry. By engineering physically balanced gain and loss following a Fibonacci sequence, we realize two distinct geometrical configurations in which the ring either preserve or explicitly break PT symmetry, and further explore complementary realizations obtained by reversing the signs of the on site potentials. Using the non equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we analyze transmission properties and bond current densities to quantify both transport and circulating currents. A comparison with the Hermitian limit establishes a clear baseline, where the ring supports only weak responses upon introducing disorder. In sharp contrast, non-Hermiticity leads to a pronounced amplification of transport and circular currents, and hence of the induced magnetic field. We further demonstrate that non-Hermitian transport is highly sensitive to gain and loss sign reversal and, in the non-PT-symmetric case, exhibits an unconventional dependence on system size governed by the parity of the Fibonacci sequence and hopping correlations. Remarkably, the current does not decay monotonically with increasing system size, revealing a distinct scaling behavior absent in conventional Hermitian systems. Our results highlight non-Hermitian quasiperiodic rings as versatile platforms for engineering and amplifying current driven magnetic responses through symmetry, topology, and gain-loss design.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effect of twist angle on moiré excitons in TMDC hetero-bilayers, showing how phonon interactions and band structure influence absorption spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of moiré excitons under varying twist angles is crucial for optimizing optoelectronic properties of TMDC materials for potential applications in quantum computing and light-emitting diodes.

Method: Theoretically analyzed twist angle dependence of phonon effects on absorption spectra using models of intralayer and interband excitons.

Result: Phonon interactions dominate at small twist angles, leading to non-Markovian dynamics and distinct absorption features. At larger angles, Markovian processes become more significant, causing line broadening. The absorption spectra exhibit asymmetric peaks reminiscent of single-layer TMDCs, and interband scattering suppresses absorption of higher-energy bands when their bandwidth exceeds phonon energy.

Conclusion: The results provide insights into controlling moiré exciton properties through twist angle modulation, which could pave the way for engineering desired optical responses in TMDC heterostructures.

Abstract: The properties of moiré excitons in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) vary significantly with the twist angle, ranging from quasi localized excitons with flat dispersions for small twist angles to delocalized excitons for larger ones. This twist angle dependence directly impacts the exciton-phonon coupling, which plays a significant role for the optical properties of these materials. In this work we theoretically investigate the twist angle dependent influence of phonons on absorption spectra of intralayer moiré excitons in a twisted TMDC hetero-bilayer. For the lowest-lying intralayer moiré exciton we find that the exciton-phonon coupling interpolates between two physically distinct regimes when tuning the twist angle. At small twist angles non-Markovian polarization dynamics and phonon sidebands dominate the properties of absorption spectra for localized excitons. For larger twist angles Markovian processes become more important leading to additional line broadening. Furthermore, the absorption spectra here show a characteristic asymmetric peak similar to monolayer TMDCs. When taking into account multiple bright moiré exciton bands we find that intraband scattering due to optical phonons has a significant impact on absorption spectra, effectively suppressing absorption peaks of higher lying bands when their bandwidth surpasses the optical phonon energy.

Abstract: A pair of quantized spin-wave modes is driven by two-tone parallel pumping in a YIG microdisk. The nonlinear dynamics is experimentally investigated by probing the resulting steady state, which is found to critically depend on the chosen pair of modes, the detuning between the pump frequencies and the modes parametric resonance, as well as the temporal sequence of the two rf tones. A general theory of parametric excitation in confined structures based on magnetization normal modes is developed and quantitatively accounts for the observed dependence and non-commutative behaviors, which emerge from the interplay between the self and mutual nonlinear frequency shifts of the spin-wave modes. Owing to its high degree of external controllability and scalability to larger sets of modes, this dynamical system provides a model platform for exploring nonlinear phenomena and a promising route toward rf driven state mapping relevant to neuromorphic and unconventional computing.

Abstract: Spintronics has emerged as a promising field for next-generation devices, offering functionalities beyond complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS). A critical challenge in spintronics is to develop systems that can efficiently generate spin currents and enable their long-distance transport. Here, we demonstrate a graphene (Gr)/heavy metal (HM) heterostructure system that combines strong charge-spin interconversion efficiency, induced by the spin Hall effect, with a long spin diffusion length. By employing an industry-friendly magnetron sputtering technique, we deposit HM layers onto few-layer Gr while minimizing structural damage. The proximity effect from the HM enhances the spin Hall angle of Gr while limiting the reduction in its spin diffusion length. Additionally, the spin Hall angle can be tuned via an applied gate voltage, offering high controllability of the system. Importantly, these properties are observed across heterostructures composed of different HMs, indicating the generality of this approach. Our findings establish Gr/HM heterostructures as a scalable and versatile platform for spin current generation, paving the way for advanced spintronic devices with high efficiency, long spin propagation, and straightforward fabrication processes.

Abstract: We reveal the higher energetic luminescence part of interlayer exciton ensembles in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures upon excitation by an optical Laguerre-Gaussian mode. The excitation is achieved with the help of a spatial light modulator giving rise to a ring-shaped distribution of interlayer excitons. A hyperspectral analysis of the exciton photoluminescence suggests that the excitation scheme allows the accumulation of high-energetic excitons in the rings' center. We discuss the mechanisms leading to such a distribution, including exciton-exciton interaction, phase-space filling, and an incomplete thermalization.

### [32] [Evolution of the Berry curvature dipole in uniaxially strained bilayer graphene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05962)
*Karel Cuypers,Robin Smeyers,Bert Jorissen,Lucian Covaci*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The study examines the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) in strained bilayer graphene, showing that it is influenced by uniaxial strain and doping, with significant parameterization sensitivity. Out-of-plane compression enhances the BCD response. The findings underscore the importance of realistic tight-binding models for predicting strain effects in bilayer graphene.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding strain effects in bilayer graphene is vital due to its potential for novel electronic devices, particularly for applications requiring precise control of charge transport mechanisms.

Method: This research employed a tight-binding model built on the Slater-Koster parameterization, incorporating lattice deformation effects and longer-range interlayer skew hoppings.

Result: The BCD shows high sensitivity to parameterization choices and material deformation. Out-of-plane strain typically broadens Dirac cones and amplifies the BCD. These results validate the necessity of using realistic tight-binding models for predicting strain-induced electronic phenomena in bilayer graphene.

Conclusion: The study concludes that bilayer graphene's strain response must be carefully modeled due to significant parameterization sensitivities and structural effects, crucial for future applications in electronic materials.

Abstract: While in pristine bilayer graphene the Berry curvature dipole (BCD), a necessary ingredient for the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect, is zero, uniaxial strain can give rise to finite BCD. We investigate this by using a tight-binding (TB) approach build on the Slater-Koster parameterization to capture lattice deformation effects often missed by continuum models. We demonstrate that the BCD's evolution with strain and doping is highly sensitive to the choice in parameterization, particularly when including the longer range interlayer skew hoppings. Additionally, out-of-plane compression enhances the response by broadening the Dirac cones. These findings benchmark low-energy continuum models and highlight the necessity of realistic tight-binding models for accurately predicting strain-engineered Hall effects in bilayer graphene.

Abstract: We study ballistic electron transport through electrostatic barriers in AB-stacked bilayer graphene within a full four-band framework. A mode-resolved analysis reveals how propagating and evanescent channels couple across electrostatic interfaces and how channel selectivity governs transport at normal incidence. We show that, even when decoupled channels remain inactive, perfect transmission can occur at discrete energies due to phase matching of a single internal mode within an individual barrier. This effect is interpreted as a ghost quantum well, namely an effective cavity formed by internal phase coherence inside the barrier, without true bound states and without restoring coupling to decoupled channels. For single- and double-barrier geometries, we derive compact analytical expressions for the transmission and identify the corresponding resonance conditions. Extending the analysis to multibarrier structures using a transfer-matrix approach, we demonstrate how perfect resonances driven by internal phase matching coexist with Fabry-Perot-like resonances arising from inter-barrier interference. Our results provide a unified, channel-resolved description of tunnelling suppression and resonance-assisted transport in bilayer graphene barrier systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Cloud-accessible quantum processors enable direct execution of quantum algorithms on heterogeneous hardware platforms. Unlike classical systems, however, identical quantum circuits may exhibit substantially different behavior across devices due to architectural variations in qubit connectivity, gate fidelity, and coherence times.
  In this work, we systematically benchmark five representative quantum algorithms - Bell state preparation, GHZ state generation, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Grover's Search, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) - across trapped-ion, superconducting, and simulator backends using Amazon Braket. Performance metrics including fidelity, CHSH violation, success probability, circuit depth, and gate counts are evaluated.
  Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of algorithmic performance on hardware topology and noise characteristics. For example, 10-qubit GHZ states achieved fidelities above 0.8 on trapped-ion hardware, while superconducting platforms dropped below 0.15 due to routing overhead and accumulated two-qubit gate errors. These findings highlight the importance of hardware-aware algorithm selection and provide practical guidance for benchmarking in the NISQ era.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of a unified understanding among different quantum state formalisms by extending the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution to multi-time scenarios.

Method: The authors generalized the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution to multi-time processes, defining left, right, and doubled quasiprobabilities, as well as their real components, the Margenau-Hill quasiprobabilities. They demonstrated experimental accessibility through interferometric measurement schemes and characterized nonclassical features.

Result: The extension of the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution provides a unified operational foundation for various quantum state approaches and shows feasibility for direct implementation via Bloch tomography.

Conclusion: This advancement offers a comprehensive and experimentally grounded framework for analyzing quantum correlations across time and space, bridging gaps in existing temporal quantum state models.

Abstract: Temporal quantum states generalize the multipartite density operator formalism to the time domain, enabling a unified treatment of quantum systems with both timelike and spacelike correlations. Despite a growing body of temporal state formalisms, their precise operational relationships and conceptual distinctions remain unclear. In this work, we resolve this issue by extending the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution to arbitrary multi-time quantum processes and, more broadly, to general spatiotemporal settings. We define left, right, and doubled temporal KD quasiprobabilities, together with their real components, which we identify as temporal Margenau-Hill (MH) quasiprobabilities. All of these quantities are experimentally accessible through interferometric measurement schemes. By characterizing their nonclassical features, we show that the generalized KD framework provides a unified operational foundation for a wide class of temporal state approaches and can be directly implemented via temporal or spatiotemporal Bloch tomography.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum batteries, microscopic devices designed to address energy demands in quantum technologies, promise high power during charging and discharging processes. Yet their practical usefulness and performance depend critically on reliability, quantified by the noise-to-signal ratios (NSRs), i.e., normalized fluctuations of work and power, where reliability decreases inversely with increasing NSR. We establish fundamental limits to this reliability: both work and power NSRs are universally bounded from below by a function of charging speed, imposing a reliability limit inherent to any quantum battery. More strikingly, we find that a quantum mechanical uncertainty relation forbids the simultaneous suppression of work and power fluctuations, revealing a fundamental trade-off that also limits the reliability of quantum batteries. We analyze the trade-off and limits, as well as their scaling behavior, across parallel (local), collective {(fully non-local)}, and hybrid (semi-local) charging schemes for many-body quantum batteries, finding that increasing power by exploiting stronger entanglement comes at the cost of diminished reliability of power. Similar trends are also observed in the charging of quantum batteries utilizing transverse Ising-like interactions. These suggest that achieving both high power and reliability require neither parallel nor collective charging, but a hybrid charging scheme with an intermediate range of interactions. Therefore, our analysis shapes the practical and efficient design of reliable and high-performance quantum batteries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate the fundamental principles of Quantum Darwinism and their role in explaining the emergence of classicality in quantum systems, with a focus on practical applications to quantum computing hardware benchmarking.

Method: The authors analyze a specific model under Quantum Darwinism to study the breaking of the framework and its impact on measurement statistics, conducting experiments on NISQ devices like IonQ and IBM.

Result: The study demonstrates that the breakdown of Quantum Darwinism corresponds to non-classical measurement statistics and provides tools to assess the quantum nature of NISQ hardware.

Conclusion: The findings enhance our understanding of the emergence of classicality within quantum systems and offer practical methods to evaluate quantum hardware characteristics.

Abstract: Quantum Darwinism explains how tenets of classical reality, such as objectivity and repeatability, emerge within a quantum universe. As a mathematical framework, Quantum Darwinism also provides guiding principles that determine what physical models support emergent classical behavior, what specific observables obey classical laws, and much more. For instance, in a recent work we elucidated that the limit under which Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distributions become effectively classical coincides with the regime where the underlying physical model obeys the rules of Quantum Darwinism. In the present work, we study the breaking of Quantum Darwinism in a specific model and how that translates to non-classical measurement statistics. Interestingly, this provides effective tools for benchmarking the genuine quantum characteristics of NISQ hardware, which we demonstrate with IonQ's trapped-ion and IBM's superconducting quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: We propose and analyze a scheme to generate squeezed light by storing a classical probe pulse in a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) and exploiting the nonlinear evolution caused by atom--atom collisions during the storage time. A $Λ$-type optical memory interface maps a chosen temporal probe mode onto a single phase-matched collective spin wave; for a coherent input this prepares a tunable coherent spin state of a two-component BEC, with its initial spin orientation set by the stored mean excitation number and the phase relation between the probe and control fields. Collisional interactions during storage then implement one-axis-twisting dynamics and generate spin squeezing in the atomic ensemble. We account for realistic loss and finite memory and retrieval efficiencies, and model readout as a single-mode beam-splitter mapping that transfers the atomic quadrature squeezing onto a propagating optical mode. We identify optimal storage times and predict that, under realistic conditions, several dB of squeezing can be transferred to the retrieved light.

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了故障容限下的量子测定能够通过量子错误校正来达到海森堡极限。这一方法不仅适用于 Pauli-Z 信号，还可以推广到其他类型的数据，从而为量子 metrology 提供了一种可靠的方法，特别是在面对噪声干扰的情况下。

Abstract: Quantum effect enables enhanced estimation precision in metrology, with the Heisenberg limit (HL) representing the ultimate limit allowed by quantum mechanics. Although the HL is generally unattainable in the presence of noise, quantum error correction (QEC) can recover the HL in various scenarios. A notable example is estimating a Pauli-$Z$ signal under bit-flip noise using the repetition code, which is both optimal for metrology and robust against noise. However, previous protocols often assume noise affects only the signal accumulation step, while the QEC operations -- including state preparation and measurement -- are noiseless. To overcome this limitation, we study fault-tolerant quantum metrology where all qubit operations are subject to noise. We focus on estimating a Pauli-$Z$ signal under bit-flip noise, together with state preparation and measurement errors in all QEC operations. We propose a fault-tolerant metrological protocol where a repetition code is prepared via repeated syndrome measurements, followed by a fault-tolerant logical measurement. We demonstrate the existence of an error threshold, below which errors are effectively suppressed and the HL is attained.

Abstract: We report a three-dimensional lumped-element multimode microwave resonator that enables homogeneous collective manipulation and dispersive readout of a macroscopic spin ensemble. By exploiting geometric symmetry, two antisymmetric modes with strongly suppressed cross-talk are engineered to spatially overlap and couple to the same ensemble at distinct frequencies. Using negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond at 28 mK, we observe collective strong coupling with a coupling strength of 5.0 MHz and demonstrate non-destructive dispersive readout via a detuned mode. The compact design, tunable coupling, and high field homogeneity make this resonator a versatile device for hybrid spin-photon systems and multimode solid-state quantum technologies.

*Marco A. Jimenez-Valencia,Charles A. Stafford*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses entropy production in a quantum wire under Joule heating and external bias, showing that macroscopic irreversibility arises from microscopic reversible dynamics through measurement-induced entropy production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Second Law of Thermodynamics is a fundamental concept, and its apparent disparity between elementary proofs and practical verification has been a point of interest. Joule heating provides a practical scenario to explore this discrepancy.

Method: The authors use an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire, modeling independent quantum particles under unitary evolution. They analyze entropy production using an entropy current formula and consider the impact of local measurements and decoherence.

Result: Entropy production due to Joule heating does not emerge automatically in the microscopic model. Instead, it arises in the limit of many local measurements along the wire, with each measurement (acting as a floating thermoelectric probe) injecting entropy by obtaining information about the system. Decoherence from inelastic processes linked to measurements is crucial for this phenomenon.

Conclusion: This study bridges the gap between microscopic reversibility and macroscopic irreversibility by demonstrating how measurement-induced entropy production leads to entropy generation in Joule heating, aligning with the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

Abstract: As remarked by Boltzmann, the Second Law of Thermodynamics is notable for the fact that it is readily proved using elementary statistical arguments, but becomes harder and harder to verify the more precise the microscopic description of a system. In this article, we investigate one particular realization of the 2nd Law, namely Joule heating in a wire under electrical bias. We analyze the production of entropy in an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire wherein the conserved flow of entropy under unitary quantum evolution is taken into account using an exact formula for the entropy current of a system of independent quantum particles. In this exact microscopic description of the quantum dynamics, the entropy production due to Joule heating does not arise automatically. Instead, we show that the expected entropy production is realized in the limit of a large number of local measurements by a series of floating thermoelectric probes along the length of the wire, which inject entropy into the system as a result of the information obtained via their continuous measurements of the system. The decoherence resulting from inelastic processes introduced by the local measurements is essential to the phenomenon of entropy production due to Joule heating, and would be expected to arise due to inelastic scattering in real systems of interacting particles.

Abstract: We observe time-correlated four photons within a correlation window of 20ns from spontaneous four-wave mixing via a double-Lambda scheme in a cold cloud of Rb-87 atoms. In contrast to high-power pulsed pumping of chi^(2) nonlinear processes in crystals, our scheme generates correlated four-photon states by direct continuous-wave pumping at nominal powers. We verify the presence of genuinely correlated four-photon states over accidentals by higher-order intensity cross-correlation measurements and accidental subtraction. We infer a time-correlated four-photon generation rate of 2.5(4)x10^6 counts per second close to saturation. The photons produced are near-resonant with atomic transitions, and have a bandwidth in the order of MHz, making them readily compatible with quantum networking applications involving atoms.

Abstract: We present a theoretical model for realizing squeezed lasing in a trapped-ion system without relying on engineered baths or tailored dissipative reservoirs. Our approach leverages the intrinsic ion-phonon interactions, where two trapped ions, each interacting with a shared vibrational mode, are driven on both red- and blue-sideband transitions. This enables the creation of a squeezed state of motion through the dynamic coupling between the ions' internal states and the phonon mode. Unlike traditional methods that require bath engineering, our model demonstrates that squeezed lasing can be achieved through a direct manipulation of ion-phonon interactions, with no external reservoirs required. We explore the steady-state behavior of the system, analyzing the onset of lasing, gain-loss balance, and the role of the squeezing parameter in shaping the phonon field's statistical properties. Furthermore, we show how external coherent drives can stabilize phase coherence and achieve controlled quadrature squeezing, offering a simple yet effective method for achieving squeezed lasing in quantum mechanical systems. Our findings provide new insights into the realization of squeezed states in phonon-based systems, with potential applications in quantum metrology and information processing.

Abstract: We investigate the simultaneous estimation of two optical phases in a three-mode interferometer assisted by optical parametric amplification (OPA). By employing the normally ordered characteristic-function formalism, we analytically obtain all photon-number moments of the output quantum state, enabling an explicit evaluation of the quantum Fisher information matrix for multiparameter phase estimation. In the lossless scenario, we show that uniformly applied OPA significantly enhances the attainable precision beyond that of an unamplified interferometer. By analyzing the second-order correlation functions, we demonstrate that this enhancement originates from the amplification of intra-mode photon-number correlations, rather than from inter-mode correlations. We further extend our analysis to realistic interferometers with photon loss using a purification-based variational approach. Although loss degrades the achievable precision, the OPA-assisted scheme retains a clear advantage for moderate loss, indicating a degree of robustness against dissipation. Our results clarify the physical mechanism underlying OPA-enhanced multiparameter quantum metrology and provide guidelines for optimizing phase estimation protocols in realistic noisy environments.

Abstract: We investigate thermalization and the quantum-classical correspondence in the fully-connected Bose-Hubbard model, focusing on the four-site case. Our analysis of the classical phase-space structure and its excited-state quantum phase transitions leads us to three dynamical regimes: symmetry-breaking low-energy states, an intermediate region where quantum and classical equilibrium states markedly disagree, and a high-energy regime with restored correspondence. The observed classical intermittency above the first excited-state quantum phase transition contrasts with quantum dynamics, which remains trapped in symmetry-breaking sectors despite the existence of a classically connected phase space. This mismatch originates from the population of imbalance-carrying eigenstates and persists even for relatively large number of particles. Our results reveal unexpectedly slow convergence to the classical limit, signaling robust finite-size effects in collective many-body dynamics.

Abstract: High-visibility quantum interference between independent photons is essential for demonstrating multi-photon quantum information processing, and it is closely linked to the spectral purity of correlated photon pairs. In this study, we investigate two approaches to enhance the purity of photon pairs generated from a type-0 PPLN waveguide by systematically varying both the pump bandwidth and the interference-filter bandwidth, and we directly compare their performance under identical experimental conditions. The spectral purity is evaluated from measured joint spectral intensities using Schmidt decomposition. Both methods significantly improve the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility to approximately 80%. However, the former approach also yields a higher three-fold coincidence rate, which is advantageous for our ongoing efforts to increase the state fidelity and generation rate of multi-photon time-bin Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states.

Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous emission of a two-level system coupled to a photonic waveguide, showing that dynamical dephasing in the photon modes profoundly alters the decay law. In the absence of dephasing, the emitter displays conventional exponential decay followed by a long-time power-law tail -- observable only at extremely low survival probabilities. Strikingly, when dephasing is introduced, a robust power-law decay emerges already at short times, driven by photon diffusion in the dynamically disordered environment rather than spectral edge effects. These results reveal a novel, decoherence-induced mechanism for non-exponential spontaneous emission in waveguide QED platforms.

Abstract: The Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) provides a powerful framework with the potential for quantum speedups across a wide range of applications. Its core input model is the block encoding framework, in which non-unitary matrices are embedded into larger unitary matrices. Because the gate complexity of the block-encoding subroutine largely determines the overall cost of QSVT-based algorithms, developing new and more efficient block encodings is crucial for achieving practical quantum advantage. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for constructing quantum circuits that block encode linear combinations of Pauli strings. Our approach relies on two key components. First, we apply a transformation that converts the Pauli strings into pairwise anti-commuting ones, making the transformed linear combination unitary and thus directly implementable as a quantum circuit. Second, we employ a correction transformation based on the stabilizer formalism which uses an ancilla register to restore the original Pauli strings. Our method can be implemented with an ancilla register whose size scales logarithmically with the number of system qubits. It can also be extended to larger ancilla registers, which can substantially reduce the overall quantum circuit complexity. We present four concrete examples and use numerical simulations to compare our method's circuit complexity with that of the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) approach. We find that our method achieves circuit complexities comparable to or better than LCU, with possible advantages when the structure of the target operators can be exploited. These results suggest that our approach could enable more efficient block encodings for a range of relevant problems extending beyond the examples analyzed in this work.

Abstract: Photonic quantum computers use the bosonic statistics of photons to construct, through quantum interference, the large entangled states required for measurement-based quantum computation. Therefore, any which-way information present in the photons will degrade quantum interference and introduce errors. While quantum error correction can address such errors in principle, it is highly resource-intensive and operates with a low error threshold, requiring numerous high-quality optical components. We experimentally demonstrate scalable, optimal photon distillation as a substantially more resource-efficient strategy to reduce indistinguishability errors in a way that is compatible with fault-tolerant operation. Photon distillation is an intrinsically bosonic, coherent error-mitigation technique which exploits quantum interference to project single photons into purified internal states, thereby reducing indistinguishability errors at both a higher efficiency and higher threshold than quantum error correction. We observe unconditional error reduction (i.e., below-threshold behaviour) consistent with theoretical predictions, even when accounting for noise introduced by the distillation gate, thereby achieving actual net-gain error mitigation under conditions relevant for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We anticipate photon distillation will find uses in large-scale quantum computers. We also expect this work to inspire the search for additional intrinsically bosonic error-reduction strategies, even for fault-tolerant architectures.

Abstract: We propose a quantum distance measure between probability distributions encoded in quantum states based on the fragility of quantum interference under entangling evolution. The Quantum Interference-Induced Bhattacharyya Distance (QIBD) is defined through a single-ancilla interferometric circuit in which an interaction Hamiltonian generates correlation-dependent phases that modulate interference visibility. When the interaction vanishes, QIBD reduces to the classical Bhattacharyya distance; however, for entangling interactions, it cannot be expressed as a function of fidelity alone. Numerical simulations demonstrate that QIBD responds to correlation structure in ways that overlap-based measures do not, suggesting potential utility in contexts where interaction-aligned correlations are physically relevant.

Abstract: We investigate the Floquet spectrum of a detuned, driven two-level system and show that it exhibits exact quasienergy crossings when the detuning is an integer multiple of the energy quantum of the driving field. This behavior can be explained by a hidden time-nonlocal parity, which allows the Floquet modes to be classified as even or odd. Then a generic feature is the emergence of exact crossings between quasienergies of different parity. A constructive proof of the existence of the symmetry is based on a scalar recurrence relation. Moreover, we present a general scheme for its numerical computation, which can be applied to models beyond the two-level system. Analytical results are illustrated with numerical data.

Abstract: We propose an analysis of the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm applied to electronic systems by investigating its free parameters such as the time step, number of phase qubits, initial state preparation, number of measurement shots, and parameters related to the unitary operators implementation. A deep understanding of these parameters is crucial to pave the way towards more automation of QPE applied to predictive computational chemistry and material science. To our knowledge, various aspects remain unexplored and a holistic parameter selection method remains to be developed. After reviewing key QPE features, we propose a constructive method to set the QPE free parameters. We derive, among other things, explicit conditions for achieving chemical accuracy in ground energy estimation. We also demonstrate that, using our conditions, the complexity of the Trotterized version of QPE tends to depend only on physical system properties and not on the number of phase qubits. Numerical simulations on the H2 molecule provide a first validation of our approach.

Abstract: The rate of $m$-photon transitions in matter, induced by an incident light field, depends on the field's $m$th order coherence function. Consequently, the coherence properties of the light field may be shaped to increase the rate of multi-photon transitions. Here, we determine the optimal state of a weak fixed-intensity, narrow-band incident light field, with a restricted maximal photon number, that optimally drives $m$-photon transitions in the case of a short-lived atomic multilevel system. We show that, in this case, no quantum properties of the light field need to be exploited, but that classical mixtures of coherent states are optimal.

Abstract: Sub-Planck structures in non-Gaussian probability densities of phase space variables are pervasive in bosonic quantum systems. They are almost universally present if the bosonic system evolves via nonlinear dynamics or nonlinear measurements. So far, identification and comparison of such structures remains qualitative. Here we provide a universally applicable and experimentally friendly method to identify, quantify and compare sub-Planck structures from directly measurable or estimated probability densities of single phase space variables. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method on experimental high order Fock states of a single-atom mechanical oscillator, showing provably finer sub-Planck structures as the Fock occupation increases despite the accompanying uncertainty increase in the phonon, position, and momentum bases.

Abstract: The distribution of entanglement between the nodes of a quantum network plays a fundamental role in quantum information applications. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a network of qubits where each edge corresponds to an independent two-qubit interaction. By applying tools from percolation theory, we study how entanglement dynamically spreads across the network. We show that the interplay between unitary evolution and spatially correlated disorder leads to a non-standard percolation phenomenology, significantly richer than uniform bond percolation and featuring hysteresis. A two-colour correlated bond percolation model, whose phase diagram is determined via numerical simulations and a mean-field theory, fully elucidates the physics behind this phenomenon.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A quantum computing framework for simulating N-dimensional linear Itô SDEs with additive or multiplicative noises using a unitary dilation technique, embedding the SDEs into a Stochastic Schrödinger Equation (SSE) on a dilated Hilbert space, with two algorithms for implementation: a sequential weak measurements-based approach and an ensemble-based deterministic Lindblad master equation approach.

Motivation: Developing quantum algorithms for efficient simulation of stochastic differential equations is crucial for advancing quantum-enhanced computational methods in various scientific and engineering fields.

Method: The framework uses a unitary dilation technique to embed the general linear SDE into a SSE, establishing a pathwise exact correspondence between the classical solution and the dilated quantum state. The stochastic Wiener increments in the SSE correspond directly to measurement outcomes of ancillary qubits, which are used in quantum processors for simulation. Two algorithmic strategies are developed: a trajectory-based sequential weak measurements approach and an ensemble-based deterministic Lindblad quantum master equation approach.

Result: The quantum framework provides efficient implementations for simulating linear Itô SDEs with both additive and multiplicative noises. The stochastic light-cone analysis provides error bounds for the algorithms, and numerical simulations validate the framework for practical applications.

Conclusion: This work advances quantum computing methods for simulating complex stochastic systems, offering pathways for potential quantum advantage in computational tasks involving stochastic dynamics.

Abstract: We present a universal framework for simulating $N$-dimensional linear Itô stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on quantum computers with additive or multiplicative noises. Building on a unitary dilation technique, we establish a rigorous correspondence between the general linear SDE \[ dX_t = A(t) X_t\,dt + \sum_{j=1}^J B_j(t)X_t\,dW_t^j \] and a Stochastic Schrödinger Equation (SSE) on a dilated Hilbert space. Crucially, this embedding is pathwise exact: the classical solution is recovered as a projection of the dilated quantum state for each fixed noise realization. We demonstrate that the resulting SSE is {naturally implementable} on digital quantum processors, where the stochastic Wiener increments correspond directly to measurement outcomes of ancillary qubits. Exploiting this physical mapping, we develop two algorithmic strategies: (1) a trajectory-based approach that uses sequential weak measurements to realize efficient stochastic integrators, including a second-order scheme, and (2) an ensemble-based approach that maps moment evolution to a deterministic Lindblad quantum master equation, enabling simulation without Monte Carlo sampling. We provide error bounds based on a stochastic light-cone analysis and validate the framework with numerical simulations.

*Gabriele Bressanini,Yue Ma,Hyukjoon Kwon,M. S. Kim*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Analogue quantum simulators offer a promising route to explore quantum many-body dynamics, but their vulnerability to noise limits their accuracy. We have developed a new framework for mitigating noise in analogue quantum simulation. This framework is fully analogue, achieves exact noise cancellation without requiring many ancillary qubits, and is robust to realistic noise. The protocol avoids any discretization and preserves the continuous-time nature of the system's dynamics, offering a new direction for high-fidelity quantum simulation in the presence of noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to explore quantum systems beyond classical computational capabilities has driven the development of analogue quantum simulators. However, the challenge of dealing with noise in these systems remains a significant obstacle. The potential for exact noise cancellation in a noise-robust, hardware-efficient framework makes this research particularly important.

Method: We present a protocol that achieves exact noise cancellation in a time-continuous manner. This protocol requires minimal additional resources beyond a small number of ancillary qubits and classical post-processing. Importantly, the method is Hamiltonian-independent, meaning it can be applied to a wide range of quantum systems without detailed knowledge of the system's Hamiltonian. The protocol incorporates both quantum resources and classical data processing in a unified approach.

Result: The proposed framework successfully mitigates noise in analogue quantum simulations. The small number of required ancillary qubits demonstrates that this approach is efficient and feasible with current quantum hardware. Actionable steps have been outlined to implement the protocol, including the selection of system parameters and the design of measurement protocols. The protocol's robustness against realistic noise conditions validates its practicality and scalability.

Conclusion: This research introduces a noise cancellation framework for analogue quantum simulators, addressing their susceptibility to noise in near-term applications. By requiring minimal additional qubits and effectively integrating classical processing, the protocol overcomes noise challenges while maintaining the continuous-time nature of the simulated dynamics. This approach opens new possibilities for achieving high-fidelity quantum simulations despite noise Constraints and offers actionable steps for practical implementation.

Abstract: Analogue quantum simulators offer a promising route to explore quantum many-body dynamics beyond classical reach in the near term. However, their vulnerability to noise limits the accuracy of simulations. Here, we establish a new framework for mitigating noise in analogue quantum simulation, operating in a time-continuous manner. To our knowledge, this is the first protocol that is fully analogue and that achieves exact noise cancellation. Our method requires a small number of ancillary qubits, whose interaction with the system$-$combined with classical post-processing of joint measurement data$-$is tailored to cancel the effect of noise. Furthermore, the protocol is Hamiltonian-independent, robust to realistic ancilla noise, and avoids any discretization, preserving the continuous-time nature of the system's dynamics. This work opens a new direction for achieving high-fidelity analogue quantum simulation in the presence of noise.

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the efficiency and scalability of quantum algorithms for molecular simulations on NISQ devices, addressing challenges like barren plateaus and circuit depth.

Method: The proposed method integrates ADAPT-VQE with counterdiabatic driving. It involves mapping the molecular Hamiltonian to qubits, constructing an adiabatic Hamiltonian, computing an approximate adiabatic gauge potential using nested commutators, and iteratively selecting relevant operator terms for the ansatz using ADAPT-VQE.

Result: The results demonstrate that the hybrid method outperforms both counterdiabatic algorithms and ADAPT-VQE using fermionic excitation operators, showing improvements in performance and reductions in circuit depth.

Conclusion: The study concludes that combining ADAPT-VQE with counterdiabatic driving is a promising approach for enhancing quantum algorithms in molecular simulations.

Abstract: Among variational quantum algorithms designed for NISQ devices, ADAPT-VQE stands out for its robustness against barren plateaus, particularly in estimating molecular ground states. On the other hand, counterdiabatic algorithms have shown advantages in both performance and circuit depth when compared to standard adiabatic approaches. In this work, we propose a hybrid method that integrates the ADAPT-VQE framework with counterdiabatic driving within an adiabatic evolution scheme. Specifically, we map the molecular Hamiltonian to a qubit representation and construct an adiabatic Hamiltonian, from which an approximate adiabatic gauge potential is computed using nested commutators. The resulting operator terms define the operator pool, and the ADAPT-VQE algorithm is applied to iteratively select the most relevant elements for the ansatz. Our results demonstrate improvements in performance and reductions in circuit depth compared to using either counterdiabatic algorithms or ADAPT-VQE with fermionic excitation operators, thus supporting the effectiveness of combining both paradigms in molecular simulations.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of cooperative radiation phenomena in ensembles of two-level atoms coupled to a lossy resonant cavity beyond the Markovian and mean-field approximations. By deriving a complete analytical solution for the two-emitter case and employing a numerically exact method for larger ensembles, we characterize the full transition from Markovian to non-Markovian collective dynamics for systems of up to $10^3$ emitters. Our results reveal three distinct regimes: a Markovian phase exhibiting the standard superradiant burst, a non-Markovian phase featuring spontaneous superabsorption of the emitted field, and a critical regime marked by pulsed collective emission. We show that the critical spectral width separating these behaviors increases monotonically with the number of emitters, demonstrating that environmental memory effects can be enhanced by cooperativity. Finally, we find that the superradiant scaling of the peak intensity progressively degrades with increasing system size, approaching a subquadratic law in the limit of a perfect cavity. In this regime, spontaneous superabsorption emerges as a distinct manifestation of non-Markovian cooperativity.

Abstract: Analogue Hamiltonian simulation (AHS) in photonic systems can be an enticing alternative to direct experimental study of complex Hamiltonian systems as a result of the low cost and high degree of control one can have over the system's properties. Notably, the field of topological photonics has emerged in the last decade primarily by simulating tight-binding models of electrons within topologically nontrivial condensed-matter systems. Optical simulation of topologically nontrivial Hamiltonians requires optical resonators with minimal loss and well-matched frequencies whose intersite coupling can also be precisely controlled. The Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics (SNAP) platform satisfies all these requirements, exhibiting ultra-low loss operation and sub-angstrom fabrication precision, making it an excellent platform for AHS. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the first topologically nontrivial photonic SNAP devices by coupling together axial modes of adjacent SNAP microresonators to form a variety of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattices. The devices manifest numerous distinct topological band structures corresponding to each axial mode of the microresonators, enabling us to observe behavior both close to and far from the topological-trivial phase transition. We further expand the scope of topological SNAP systems to contain not just higher-order generalizations of SSH lattices, but junctions between multiband lattices with dissimilar topological phases created by coupling up to 21 uniform and well-matched SNAP microresonators. Analyzing such "heterojunctions" necessitated our development of generalized topological polarization methods. We thus demonstrate the exceptional promise of the SNAP platform for AHS of 1D topological insulators, and also open the door to the potential for simulating >2 dimensional systems by utilizing nonlinear interactions.

Abstract: The Fabry-Pérot resonator is a cornerstone of photonics and wave physics, providing a universal mechanism for spectral confinement and resonant enhancement of wave-matter interactions. In this work, we establish an analytically tractable class of Fabry-Pérot metacavities in which the reflecting elements are realized by single-layer periodic arrays of circular dielectric cylinders acting as metamirrors. Both the reflection efficiency and reflection phase of such metamirrors are obtained in closed form and shown to be widely and independently tunable, encompassing ideal electric and magnetic mirror limits with unit reflectivity. Building on these results, we derive explicit analytical expressions that fully describe the optical responses of Fabry-Pérot cavities composed of two such parallel metamirrors. Our combined analytical and numerical investigations reveal that these metamirrors provide exceptional flexibility for tailoring Fabry-Pérot resonances across a broad spectral range, enabling precise control over resonance positions and quality factors. In particular, the framework naturally predicts the emergence of Fabry-Pérot bound states in the continuum with formally infinite Q-factors. These results establish dielectric-metamirror-based Fabry-Pérot cavities as a versatile and fundamentally transparent platform for engineering high-Q optical resonances.

Abstract: Large and abrupt variations in the electromagnetic properties of materials lead to dramatic effects: even a single step-like change in the refractive index induces striking phenomena, such as time-refraction and time-reflection. When the refractive index varies periodically in time, multiple time-refractions and -reflections interfere, giving rise to photonic time-crystals (PTCs). Importantly, PTCs display momentum bands separated by gaps in which the modes experience exponential amplification, drawing energy from the modulation in a non-resonant fashion. Ordinary nonlinear optics does not operate in this regime: the material response is either very weak or very slow. One of the immediate consequences is that time-reflection of light at optical frequencies has never been observed in experiments. Here, we experimentally realize an order-unity change in the refractive index occurring at sub-cycle rates, and explore the phenomena emerging from it. By varying the duration of the index change from extending over many cycles to being significantly below a single cycle, we observe that the frequency shift of the time-refraction is enhanced as the index variation occurs faster. Our experiment is the gateway for realizing sharp time-interfaces at optical frequencies, which are the key for experimenting with time-reflection, PTCs and new phenomena expected from light-matter interactions in time-varying media.

Abstract: Chirality, the absence of mirror symmetry, is a fundamental molecular property with far-reaching consequences from chemistry to biology. Yet enantiosensitive optical responses are very weak. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework in which a chiral optical cavity under strong coupling directly lifts the degeneracy of opposite enantiomers at the electronic-dipole level. The cavity's parity-breaking field inside the cavity induces distinct site-energy shifts for left- versus right-handed molecules, producing robust enantioselective polariton states that overcome the weakness of traditional chiroptical effects. Using cavity quantum electrodynamics simulations, we show that strong light-matter coupling reshapes the polaritonic energy landscape and leads to enantiomer-specific coherence lifetimes and relaxation pathways. To reveal these dynamics, we propose ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) as a probe, capable of resolving polaritonic splittings on femtosecond timescales. Simulated 2DES spectra exhibit unambiguous enantioselective signatures of the cavity-induced asymmetry. These findings establish that chiral cavities provide a powerful platform for detecting and controlling molecular handedness beyond the limits of conventional optical methods.

Abstract: Film bulk acoustic wave resonators (FBARs) underpin modern wireless communication by enabling compact, high-performance RF filters in modern smartphones. Traditionally, these FBAR devices work with quasi-plane waves of sound where the transverse extent of the acoustic field $\gg$ the acoustic wavelength ($λ_a$). On the other hand, strong modal confinement is needed for achieving the interaction strengths necessary for building efficient microwave to optical quantum photon transducers (MW-OT) around an FBAR opto-mechanical cavity platform. Here, we fabricate a small mode-volume phonon trapping lateral field excited FBAR resonator (XBAR) by shaping the piezoelectric layer into a spherical lens, show an improvement in modal confinement and quality factor ($\approx$ 4$\times$), and discuss the improvements needed for building efficient MW-OTs around this XBAR geometry.

### [66] [Spectral Tailoring of Inhomogeneous Optical Response Using Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05753)
*Pradeep Kumar,Rohan Singh*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper compares two spectral tailoring approaches using 2DCS: prepulse and DP methods, highlighting the DP method's advantages over the prepulse approach in manipulating the coherent optical response of inhomogeneous ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling the coherent optical response is crucial for advancing light-matter interaction engineering, particularly for quantum memory devices.

Method: Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) was used to compare two methods: prepulse and DP. The study involved Rabi oscillations, spectral amplitude and lineshape modulation, and frequency component modulation using relative phase between DP pulses.

Result: The DP method was found to provide more versatile control over the coherent optical response compared to the prepulse method. The DP method eliminates the spectral bandwidth constraint present in the prepulse approach.

Conclusion: The DP method offers a more reliable and versatile route for controlling the coherent optical response of inhomogeneous ensembles, which is beneficial for applications in optical switching and coherent storage for quantum memory devices.

Abstract: Controlling the coherent optical response of inhomogeneous ensembles is a key challenge in advancing light-matter interaction engineering. We present a comparative study of two spectral tailoring approaches using two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS): the prepulse and double-pulse (DP) methods. In the prepulse scheme, a high-intensity pulse induces Rabi oscillations, modulating the 2D spectral amplitude and lineshape when its spectral bandwidth matches the ensemble full width at half maximum (FWHM). To overcome this limitation, the DP method employs variable inter-pulse delay to generate predetermined periodic spectral modulation without bandwidth constraints. Moreover, tuning the relative phase between DP pulses allows selective switching of frequency components, enabling controlled enhancement or suppression of distinct spectral features. These observations highlight that, while the prepulse approach is constrained by spectral bandwidth, the DP method provides a more versatile and reliable route to manipulate the coherent optical response of inhomogeneous ensembles. We are hoping these findings might stimulate further research in optical switching and coherent storage for quantum memory devices using inhomogeneous ensembles.

Abstract: Recent progress in ultrafast x-ray sources helped establish x-rays as an important tool for probing lattice and magnetic dynamics initiated by femtosecond optical pulses. Here, we explore the potential of ultrashort hard x-ray pulses for driving magnetic dynamics. We use a transient grating technique in which a spatially periodic x-ray excitation pattern gives rise to material excitations at a well-defined wave vector, whose dynamics are monitored via diffraction of an optical probe pulse. The excitation of a ferrimagnetic gadolinium bismuth iron garnet film placed in an external tilted magnetic field by x-rays at the Gd L3 edge results in both magnetic and non-magnetic transient gratings whose contributions to the diffracted signal are separated by polarization analysis. We observe the magnetization precession at both longitudinal acoustic and spin wave frequencies. An analysis with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation indicates that the magnetization precession is driven by strain resulting from thermal expansion induced by absorbed x-rays. The results establish x-ray transient gratings as a tool for driving coherent phonons and magnons, with the potential of accessing wave vectors across the entire Brillouin zone.

Abstract: This study focuses on developing a metal-dielectric sensor structure with optimized unit cell geometry for determination of protein Immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration in aqueous solutions. The research combines both experimental and theoretical investigations, utilizing the differential microwave dielectrometry method and numerical modeling with COMSOL software. Complex permittivity (CP) values dependence of IgG water solutions on the protein concentration was experimentally obtained at the microwaves using original microwave dielectrometer setup. It was shown that increase of IgG concentration resulted in the CP values of the solutions studied decrease. The experimentally obtained CP data for the IgG water solutions were used as a basis for microwave metal-dielectric metasurface unit cell numerical modeling. The metal-dielectric metasurface consisting of Teflon substrate and plane copper microresonators was combined with a standard 96-well microplate used in clinical laboratories. Optimization of the obtained metasurface unit cell revealed that the size and position of the copper microresonators within the unit cell significantly impact the sensor sensitivity for determining the IgG concentration in aqueous solutions. The metasurface with the unit cell containing four copper microresonators provided the most sensitive platform for detecting variations in the IgG concentration in the sample. The frequency shift of the reflection coefficient was directly related to changes in the protein concentration. The calibration graph was developed for effective determination of IgG concentrations in the aqueous solutions.

TL;DR: A flexible metasurface sensor made of graphene microstrips shows potential for biosensing in detecting proteins and biomolecules using terahertz resonance modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biosensors are important for early detection of diseases and environmental monitoring, making the development of accurate and reliable sensors a key focus in research.

Method: The study involves designing a metasurface using graphene microstrips, modeling its spectral properties via COMSOL Multiphysics, and testing it with liquid samples like water and Bovine Serum Albumin. Changes in resonance modes under these samples are used to infer biomolecule presence.

Result: Experiments showed that the sensor's resonance frequencies shift when exposed to liquid samples, with the magnitude of shift correlating with the refractive index of the samples. This indicates the sensor can detect proteins and other biomolecules accurately.

Conclusion: This metasurface-based sensor offers a promising technological solution for liquid biomolecule detection, leveraging the unique properties of graphene and terahertz range applications.

Abstract: The study is devoted to development and optimization of a metasurface-based sensor with graphene constituents for potential biosensing applications. A unit cell of the proposed metasurface consists of a thin flexible dielectric substrate layer with a centrally positioned graphene microstrip. As a result of numerical modeling of spectral properties of the metasurface by COMSOL Multiphysics software in terahertz range from 5 to 35 THz the absorption spectrum maxima (resonance modes) are revealed. The following stages of the study demonstrate that placement of a layer of tested liquid sample (water or Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) solution) on the metasurface causes a low frequency shift of the plasmonic resonance mode chosen for biosensing measurements. This frequency shift, along with the change in the amplitude of the absorption peak, are highly sensitive to the refractive index of the tested liquid sample. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of the developed metasurface-based sensor with graphene microstrips for application as a sensing structure to determine proteins and other biomolecules in liquid samples.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: A modified plasmonic sensor based on the Kretschmann-Reather configuration exhibits a 10% enhanced sensitivity (12.3 vs. 11.1 RIU) compared to the standard configuration after modeling through finite element method. The new sensor showed an average error of ~3% when tested against human biological samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to improve the sensitivity of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) sensors to detect subtle changes in biological samples for medical diagnosis and monitoring.

Method: This work employed a finite element method to model the sensor and computed its reflection parameter dependency. The modification involved incorporating Ti3C2MXene material into the Kretschmann-Reather configuration.

Result: The sensitivity increased by 10%, achieving 12.3 RIU, surpassing the 11.1 RIU of conventional setups. Additionally, human biological samples were tested, with approximately 3% error in measurement.

Conclusion: This study successfully designed and validated a more sensitive SPR sensor using Ti3C2MXene and FEM modeling, making it a promising tool for real-time medical sensing.

Abstract: Sensors based on the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance have limited sensitivity, up to 123 degree/Refractive Index Unit, which restricts their applicability in detecting subtle changes gin biological media (around 10-5 RIU). To address this, a sensor dependent on the Kretschmann-Reather configuration was modified using Ti3C2 MXene material. The sensor was modeled using the finite element method (FEM), yielding the dependence of the wave reflection parameter on the angle of incidence. Founded on these results, the sensitivity of the sensor was calculated and demonstrated a 10% improvement compared to the conventional Kretschmann-Reather configuration. In addition, human biological real-world samples were modeled using refractive index data, and the error of the proposed approach was determined to be approximately 3%.

TL;DR:  Multi-blade injectors improve the pumping efficiency of room-temperature masers by enhancing light transfer in the gain medium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  The abstract highlights the challenges in pumping room-temperature masers and introduces a novel approach to address these challenges.

Method:  The researchers developed a multi-blade injector using high-refractive-index glass, simulated its performance, fabricated the injector, and grown molecular crystals for the gain medium.

Result:  The multi-blade injector was found to be more effective and scalable than previous designs, with experiments demonstrating its performance.

Conclusion:  The study demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-blade injectors for scaling up room-temperature masers.

Abstract: Though the performance of room-temperature masers has improved over the last decade, relatively little attention has been paid to the optics used to pump the maser's gain medium. In this work, we investigate a novel multi-blade optical ``injector'' that permits more effective and more scaleable pumping. The reported work encompasses an interdisciplinary mix of conceptualization, simulation, crystal growth, fabrication, and microwave engineering. Our gain medium is pentacene dissolved as a solid solution with para-terphenyl (Pc:PTP) molecular crystal. We accurately determine this pentacene's molecular absorption cross-section as a function of wavelength. Ray-tracing is then used to assess how different designs of waveguide inject light into the Pc:PTP crystal. A multi-blade injector made of high-refractive-index glass (namely Ohara S-TIH6) is predicted to pump it more completely and uniformly than previous designs. Upon hand-fabricating such an injector and Bridgman-growing a crystal of 0.1% Pc:PTP over it, an experimental maser oscillator using this combined injector-crystal assembly is demonstrated. The performance and scaleability of multiblade injection vis-a-vis alternative strategies is analyzed.
