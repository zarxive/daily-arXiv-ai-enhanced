In this work, a Low-Level RF system architecture combined with White Rabbit based timing system has been tested through a collaboration between KEK (Japan) and CNRS/IN2P3, IJClab (France). The setup combines a frequency standard generator, an IDROGEN carrier board with an embedded White Rabbit node, and SkyWorks synthesizers of different form factors to distribute phase-locked clock signals over telecommunication fiber. Phase noise power spectral density measurements were performed at several RF sub-harmonics to confirm synchronization performance.

Here, we examine strongly repulsive fermions on a ladder -- a minimal platform for unconventional $d$-wave pairing -- and show that flattening of the lower band through an additional diagonal hopping term produces non-Fermi liquid behavior, evidenced by the violation of Luttinger's theorem, as well as axial $d$-wave pairing correlations. Alternatively, plaquette ring exchange can also generate pairing, albeit with a distinct diagonal $d$-wave pairing symmetry. Hence, our finding showcases a competition of different unconventional pairing channels, and demonstrates via a simple model how band geometry can induce fermionic pairing. This offers broadly relevant insights for correlated flat-band systems, ranging from ultracold atoms to strongly interacting electrons in solids."}

Using Rindler conformal field theories and the large-$q$ SYK chain as illustrative examples, we argue that the pole-skipping points of few-body operators organize into trajectories in the complex frequency-momentum plane, with the leading trajectory encoding the quantum Lyapunov exponent. We further propose that these trajectories admit a natural interpretation as Regge trajectories of stringy excitations in a dual stringy black hole geometry. From this perspective, pole-skipping for an individual operator can be viewed as tracking the stringy horizon through the response of a single excitation. Our results suggest that pole-skipping reflects intrinsic properties of quantum chaotic systems and may be deeply connected to the structure of horizons in the stringy regime."}

In these devices, accurate time-dependent Hamiltonian models are imperative for predicting their dynamics and designing high-fidelity quantum operations. Existing numerical methods, such as black-box quantization (BBQ) and energy-participation ratio (EPR), excel at modeling the static Hamiltonians of Josephson circuits. However, these techniques do not fully capture the behavior of driven circuits stimulated by external microwave drives, nor do they include a generalized approach to account for the inevitable noise and dissipation that enter through microwave ports. Here, we introduce novel numerical techniques that leverage classical microwave simulations that can be efficiently executed in finite element solvers, to obtain the time-dependent Hamiltonian of a microwave-driven superconducting circuit with arbitrary geometries. Importantly, our techniques do not rely on a lumped-element description of the superconducting circuit, in contrast to previous approaches to tackling this problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by characterizing the driven properties of realistic circuit devices in complex electromagnetic environments, including coherent dynamics due to charge and flux modulation, as well as drive-induced relaxation and dephasing. Our techniques offer a powerful toolbox for optimizing circuit designs and advancing practical applications in superconducting quantum computing."}

Phys. 163, 174109 (2025)] for low-rank tensor compression, to enable a formally $O(N^3)$-scaling $GW$ algorithm. By integrating BTD with an imaginary-time $GW$ formalism and introducing a real space screening strategy for the polarizability, we achieve an observed scaling of approximately $O(N^2)$ in test systems. Key parameters of the algorithm are optimized on the S66 dataset using the JADE algorithm, ensuring a balanced compromise between accuracy and efficiency. Our BTD-based random phase approximation also exhibits $O(N^2)$ scaling, and eigenvalue-self-consistent $GW$ calculations become feasible for systems with over 3000 basis functions.

We evaluate both contributions over the full parameter space, using a Gel'fand-Yaglom approach to reduce the calculation of the fluctuation spectrum to an initial value problem. In addition, we obtain a closed-form expression for the critical droplet in the limit of small potential tilts, and use it to formulate an effective theory of domain nucleation and growth as a Kramers escape problem for the droplet size. Our results determine the parametric dependence of the nucleation rate and its signature on experimental images of a nucleating gas, and should allow for a rigorous comparison between nucleation theory and experiment."}

We focus on a specific science case involving short-duration, massive and high-redshift binary black hole (BBH) mergers with detector-frame chirp masses $M_{\\mathrm{d}} > 100$ M$_\\odot$. These systems encompass early-Universe stellar and primordial black holes, as well as intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, for which XG observatories are expected to deliver major discoveries. Validation against standard Bayesian inference demonstrates that NPE robustly reproduces complex and disconnected posterior structures across all network configurations. For a network of two misaligned L-shaped ET detectors (2L MisA), the posterior distributions on luminosity distance can become multimodal and degenerate with the sky position, leading to less precise distance estimates compared to the triangular ET configuration. However, the number of sky-location multimodalities is substantially lower than the eight expected with the triangular ET, resulting in improved sky and volume localization. Adding CE to the network further reduces sky-position degeneracies, and the better performance of the 2L MisA configuration over the triangle remains evident."}

We demonstrate that for high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits), the resources required to break this barrier are strictly governed by the number-theoretic structure of the Hilbert space dimension $d$. By analyzing the adjoint action of the Clifford group, we establish a classification of single-qudit universality as a trichotomy. (I) For prime dimensions, the Clifford group is a maximal finite subgroup, and universality is robustly achieved by any non-Clifford gate. (II) For prime-power dimensions, the group structure fragments, requiring tailored diagonal non-Clifford gates to restore irreducibility. (III) Most notably, for composite dimensions with coprime factors, we demonstrate that standard entangling operations alone -- specifically, generalized intra-qudit CNOT gates -- generate the necessary non-Clifford resources to guarantee a dense subgroup of $\\mathrm{SU}(d)$ without explicit diagonal magic injection. Our proofs rely on a new geometric criterion establishing that a subgroup with irreducible adjoint action is infinite if it contains a non-scalar element with projective distance strictly less than $1/2$ from the identity. These results establish that \"coprime architectures\" -- hybrid registers combining subsystems with coprime dimensions -- can sustain universal computation using only classical entangling operations, rendering the explicit injection of magic resources algebraically unnecessary."}

We theoretically prove the effectiveness of HiUCCSD within the scope of Abelian point groups. Furthermore, we compare the performance of HiUCCSD and the established SymUCCSD via VQE and Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter (ADAPT)-VQE numerical experiments on ten molecules with distinct point groups. The results show that HiUCCSD achieves equivalent performance to SymUCCSD for Abelian point group molecules, while avoiding the potential performance failure of SymUCCSD in the case of non-Abelian point group molecules. Across the studied molecular systems, HiUCCSD cuts the parameter count by 18%-83% for VQE and reduces the excitation operator pool size by 27%-84% for ADAPT-VQE, as compared with the UCCSD ansatz.

While matter ranges widely from atoms, particles, to solids, photons are predominantly in a confined physical space, such as a pair of mirrors, for enhanced photon-matter interactions known as cavity QED. Since position and momentum are canonically conjugate variables governed by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, a fundamental question arises - what if light confinement is in the not-so-intuitive momentum or reciprocal space? The realization of photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) has made possible this exotic scenario. Here, we summarize the most recent advancements at this research frontier in optics and photonics, covering weak coupling, strong coupling, and nonlinear optics. We can designate such photon-matter interactions enabled by reciprocal light confinement through BICs with truly open systems as reciprocal QED, which holds great promise to comprehend and extend cavity QED for optics, photonics, and related fields."}

Here, we examine how the topologically quantized charge pump in insulators generates spin polarizations, and assess whether this mechanism may offer distinct insight into the widely known spin-selective transport in chiral wires-commonly referred to as chirality-induced spin selectivity. We performed time-dependent Schrodinger equations of multi-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonians driven by a circularly polarized electric field. Our main findings are twofold. First, the intrinsic screw-like geometry of the system generates a distinctive winding structure governed by a single control parameter, in contrast to conventional adiabatic pumping mechanisms that require at least two independently modulated parameters, thereby providing a clear interpretation of one-dimensional pumping in terms of the topological structure in a (1+1)-dimensional Brillouin zone. Second, while the energy gap remains open throughout the pumping cycle, the Berry-phase driven real-time dynamics of the charge flow induces a nonequilibrium orbital polarization. Through spin-orbit coupling, this orbital response is partially converted into spin polarization whose direction is determined by the current and chirality.

In contrast to coincidence-based pipelines that collapse timing into a binary window, Synchromodulametry exposes coherence as a continuous, hardware-native state variable that persists under detector liveness gaps and metric-modulated delays."}

As a leading platform, neutral atom arrays rely on atomic fluorescence imaging for qubit readout, requiring short exposure, low photon count schemes to mitigate heating and atom loss while enabling mid-circuit feedback. However, a fundamental challenge arises in the single-photon regime where severe overlap in state distributions causes conventional threshold discrimination to fail. Here, we report an AI-accelerated Bayesian inference method for fluorescence readout in neutral atom arrays. Our approach leverages Bayesian inference to achieve reliable state detection at the single-photon level under short exposure. Specifically, we introduce a weakly anchored Bayesian scheme that requires calibration of only one state, addressing asymmetric calibration challenges common across quantum platforms. Furthermore, acceleration is achieved via a permutation-invariant neural network, which yields a 100-fold speedup by compressing iterative inference into a single forward pass. The approach achieves relative readout fidelity above 99% and 98% for histogram overlaps of 61% and 72%, respectively, enabling reliable extraction of Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interference results unattainable with conventional threshold based methods.

For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \\times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \\times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,β} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $β$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O > N_C$ or $N_C > N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\\cal T}_{GNR}(\\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient.

Our emphasis is on how these relations arise from unitarity and hermitian analyticity in interacting quantum field theories on de Sitter space-time. Instead of analyzing wave-function coefficients, we apply these relations directly to cosmological correlators. By studying conformally coupled and massless scalar fields with $φ^n$ self-interactions, we demonstrate that the discontinuity of a cosmological correlator can be expressed as a sum of products of lower-point discontinuities, stemming from a single-cut of one internal line in the corresponding tree-level exchange Witten diagram. Notably, beyond lower-point correlators, the decomposition of the discontinuities of cosmological correlators includes contributions from auxiliary elements that consist of both the real and imaginary parts of the lower-point wave-function coefficients, which have not been reported in the existing literature. Interestingly, depending on whether $n$ is even or odd in a $φ^n$ interaction, these different lower-point discontinuities contribute as the leading or sub-leading piece in the late-time limit to the discontinuity relations. Additionally, our single-cut discontinuity relation leads to a decomposition rule for the residue of the cosmological correlators at partial energy singularities, incorporating contributions from these auxiliary objects. Through explicit calculations in several models, we confirm that our discontinuity relations are consistent with results from the in-in formalism. While primarily developed using tree-level exchanges with polynomial interactions, we also demonstrate that our framework can be extended to include loop corrections and cases with derivative interactions."}

In one dimension, the information lattice provides a position- and scale-resolved decomposition of von Neumann information. Its generalization is nontrivial because overlapping subsystems can form loops, allowing multiple regions to encode the same information. This prevents information from being assigned uniquely to any one of them. We address this by introducing a higher-dimensional information lattice in which local information is defined through an inclusion-exclusion principle. The inclusion-exclusion local information is assigned to the lattice vertices, each labeled by subsystem position and scale. We implement this construction explicitly in two dimensions and apply it to a range of many-body ground states with distinct entanglement structures. Within this position- and scale-resolved framework, we extract information-based localization lengths, direction-dependent critical exponents, characteristic edge mode information, long-range information patterns due to topological order, and signatures of non-Abelian fusion channels.

Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes.

The prototype consists of 563 channels and represents about 10 percent of the final ZDC design in terms of both channel count and detector volume. It was irradiated at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) with a dose equivalent to 10$^{11}$ protons/cm$^2$. We demonstrate that, despite significant radiation damage to the SiPMs and non-uniform degradation across the detector volume, the detector can be successfully calibrated on a channel-by-channel basis using cosmic-ray data. The damage profile, similar to what is expected in the experiment, varies by an order of magnitude or more across the detector. Even for the most heavily damaged channels, the signal-to-noise ratio for a MIP signal remains above 5. This study provides a realistic test of the system's performance under irradiation.

We focus on a specific form given by $ f(R,T^φ) = R + αT^φ+ β(T^φ)^2/2$, in which the parameters $α$ and $β$ control the strength of non-minimal couplings between geometry and matter. We derive the set of cosmological equations for a spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe and construct the autonomous system of first-order differential equations using a compact set of dimensionless variables. This formulation provides a foundation for the qualitative analysis of the asymptotic behavior. We identify and classify all critical points and analyze their stability properties. Finally, the energy conditions and the presence of dynamical instabilities are examined. We study the general scenario $α\\neq 0$ and $β\\neq 0$, along with the subcases $α= 0$ and $β= 0$, in order to compare with minimally coupled quintessence $α= β= 0$. We find that the quadratic term in $T^φ$ admits late-time accelerated de Sitter-like critical solutions at the background level. However, several accelerated points lie in a degenerate scalar sector with $Q_s=0$, where the standard linear perturbation criteria are inconclusive, while the quasi-de Sitter point with $Q_s>0$ is of saddle type. Therefore, establishing full perturbative viability requires going beyond the linear analysis in the degenerate sector."}

On quantum computers, chemical dynamics can be simulated efficiently using either universal, qubit-only devices or specialized mixed-qudit-boson (MQB) simulators, which natively host electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. Here, we compare the quantum resources required for a qubit-only approach to achieve the same accuracy as an MQB device at simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. We find that MQB simulations require orders-of-magnitude fewer quantum operations than qubit-only simulations, with a one-gate MQB circuit requiring a qubit-equivalent circuit volume of over 400,000 when simulating an isolated molecule, which increases to over ten million when environmental effects are included. These estimates assume perfect qubits and gates, and would increase by additional orders of magnitude if error correction were used for fault tolerance. When errors are small, the advantage of MQB simulators becomes even larger as system size increases. Our results highlight the enormous resource advantages of representing non-qubit chemical degrees of freedom natively, rather than encoding them into qubits."}

Our analysis reveals pronounced thermal hysteresis in phonon self-energy parameters and dynamic Raman susceptibility, confirming the first-order nature of the antipolar transition near TC1 ~ 145 K and a second-order transition near TC2 ~ 190 K. Low-frequency modes associated with Cu+ and Cr3+ ions exhibit softening and anomalous linewidth behaviour, in particular phonon mode P2 (~ 37 cm-1) showing non-monotonic temperature dependence and intensity enhancement near 60 K suggesting persistent off-centre Cu+ dynamics in the quasi-antipolar phase. The coexistence and coupling of soft phonon modes and central peaks indicate a crossover from displacive to order-disorder type transition mechanisms. Additionally, phonon anomalies below the Néel temperature (TN ~ 32 K) reflect spin-phonon coupling, linking lattice vibrations to long-range magnetic correlations. Our findings provide critical insight into the lattice instabilities, symmetry evolution, and quasiparticle interactions in CuCrP2S6, offering a deeper understanding of phase transition dynamics in two-dimensional multiferroic systems and guiding future design of magnetoelectric and spintronic devices."}

D \\textbf{106}, L021501 (2022)}, a geometric approach to circular photon orbits was proposed for spherically symmetric spacetimes. In the present study, we give an extension of this geometric approach from spherically symmetric spacetimes to axially symmetric rotational spacetimes. In such a geometric approach, light rings in the equatorial plane are determined through the intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of Lorentz spacetime, which gives rise to a Randers-Finsler geometry for axially symmetric spacetimes. Specifically, light rings can be precisely determined by the condition of vanishing geodesic curvature, and the stability of light rings is classified through the intrinsic flag curvature in Randers-Finsler optical geometry. This geometric approach presented in this work is generally applicable to any stationary and axially symmetric spacetime, without imposing any restriction on the spacetime metric forms. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous demonstration to show that our geometric approach yields completely equivalent results with those derived from the conventional approach (based on the effective potential of photons)."}

According to this system, the cooling power of the liquid xenon in the reboiler of 178K could be transferred to the product xenon cryostat to liquefy the gaseous product xenon by the R14 circulation, thus the liqueffed xenon could return to the detector with the same condition of which extracted from the detector to form a stable cooling cycle and prevent the instability of the detector.

The small energy differences between candidate spin orders make theoretical studies less reliable, and probing magnetic order at a nonzero wave vector is experimentally challenging. In modern realizations of Wigner crystals, the electronic spin degree of freedom is often replaced by a valley pseudospin associated with nonzero Berry curvature. The resulting anomalous velocity couples the electrons' pseudospin texture to their orbital vibration. We show that this mechanism enables optical detection of pseudospin orders in Wigner crystals by producing sharp signatures in the terahertz optical conductivity. For example, antiferromagnetic pseudospin order enables light to excite collective electronic vibrations at the ordering wave vector, generating a characteristic absorption peak. Based on the same principle, we further show that a strong optical drive generates an effective potential that reshapes the pseudospin energy landscape, inducing phase transitions to stripe antiferromagnetic states. These results point to a route for optical detection and control of spin order via its coupling to orbital motion."}

In contrast to the predominantly thermorefractive noise in silicon photonic platforms, TCCR noise represents a distinct mechanism that becomes critical for applications requiring high frequency stability and phase coherence, including optomechanical sensing, low-phase-noise microwave synthesis, and on-chip quantum squeezing. A quantitative understanding of the deterministic parameters that control TCCR noise is therefore essential for engineering the next generation of low-noise TFLN photonic systems. Here, we identify two dominant contributors to the TCCR noise in TFLN microresonators: material anisotropy and surface states. Material anisotropy results in increased noise for extraordinarily polarized optical modes and leads to a geometry dependent phase noise. Surface-state effects manifest as increased noise in higher-order transverse modes as well as more than 120-fold higher noise in suspended microresonators. Finally, we demonstrate that post-fabrication annealing -- widely used to reduce defect densities and recover crystal quality -- suppresses frequency noise by a factor of 8.2 in cladded microresonators.

In particular, we compute the full set of excitations, fusion, and shrinking data at the microscopic lattice level and verify exact agreement between the microscopic $\\mathbb{D}_4$ quantum double lattice model and the continuum $BF$ field theory with an $AAB$ twist and $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ gauge group, thereby placing the latter field theory, originally discovered in 2018 in connection with Borromean-ring braiding, on a solid microscopic footing. Our results bridge continuum topological field theory and exactly solvable lattice models, elevate fusion--shrinking consistency from a continuum field-theoretical principle to a genuine topological phenomenon defined at the microscopic lattice scale, and provide a concrete microscopic foundation for experimentally engineering higher-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in controllable quantum simulators, such as trapped-ion systems."}

Unlike thermally modified earlier studies, SNS and CSNS constitute fully non-thermal, number-state-dependent quantum configurations. By embedding these states within the framework of semiclassical theory of gravity, we derive state-resolved expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy variation, and corresponding mass loss of an evaporating black hole. The influence of the squeezing parameter $ρ$ and number state parameter $n$ on Hawking emission is examined through a series of analytical results supported by twelve detailed plots. The analysis reveals that the Hawking temperature exhibits monotonic growth with increasing $ρ$ and $n$, thereby elevating the effective temperature experienced at the black hole horizon. The entropy variations $Δ\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathrm{SNS}}$ and $Δ\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathrm{CSNS}}$ show strong nonlinear enhancement, especially at moderate and large squeezing values. Overall, the study extends earlier thermal squeezed-state approaches to a fully number-state-resolved framework, highlighting the sensitivity of Hawking emission to nonclassical quantum configurations.

The transmon qubit is then introduced as a state-of-the-art application, with a detailed derivation of its Hamiltonian and its interaction with control and readout circuitry. The theoretical formalism is consolidated through a numerical simulation of vacuum Rabi oscillations in a driven transmon-resonator system, a canonical experiment that demonstrates the coherent energy exchange characteristic of the strong coupling regime.

Based on vector diffraction theory, our analysis shows that the multi-zone amplitude mask redistributes the beam energy, thereby leading to the formation of a hollow beam. The proposed method provides control over the beam width which maintains a uniform dark core size after focusing through the various NA lens across all the higher order modes. Further the width of high intensity ring can be tuned by varying the NA of the focusing lens. This study shows that the proposed method is well suited for trapping particles or atoms while avoiding exposure to high central intensity, enabling improved contrast and resolution, facilitating ring-shaped ablation or heating, guiding atoms through dark regions to minimize thermal effects, and supporting information encoding using orbital angular momentum and other advanced optical applications."}

For small Q, it shifts to W = 0, characteristic of a Hawking-Page transition. This topological classification provides a model-independent validation of the conventional thermodynamic analysis. Crucially, we find that the non-minimal coupling lambda stabilizes the Hawking-Page universality class W=0 for black holes with non-zero charge, a phenomenon absent in the standard Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS case. This establishes a direct link between the microscopic coupling and the macroscopic topological class, demonstrating the power of topological methods in decoding thermodynamic universality across modified gravity theories."}

As a leading platform, neutral atom arrays rely on atomic fluorescence imaging for qubit readout, requiring short exposure, low photon count schemes to mitigate heating and atom loss while enabling mid-circuit feedback.

Here, we report an AI-accelerated Bayesian inference method for fluorescence readout in neutral atom arrays. Our approach leverages Bayesian inference to achieve reliable state detection at the single-photon level under short exposure. Specifically, we introduce a weakly anchored Bayesian scheme that requires calibration of only one state, addressing asymmetric calibration challenges common across quantum platforms. Furthermore, acceleration is achieved via a permutation-invariant neural network, which yields a 100-fold speedup by compressing iterative inference into a single forward pass. The approach achieves relative readout fidelity above 99% and 98% for histogram overlaps of 61% and 72%, respectively, enabling reliable extraction of Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interference results unattainable with conventional threshold based methods.

We develop a hybrid numerical framework to signify nonperturbative effects on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background sourced by primordial curvature perturbations, focusing on the acoustic channel (fluid motions). Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power.

However, its implementation remains challenging, especially in the mid-infrared region. This work presents the development of a robust DC spectroscopic system based on electro-optical (EO) frequency comb generators and difference frequency generation (DFG), specifically designed for the characterization of laboratory flames. Operating at a center wavelength of 3427.43 nm, the system utilizes a differential detection strategy to enable precise, calibration-free measurements of unburned methane ($\\mathrm{CH_{4}}$) concentrations in a McKenna burner. The experimental results demonstrate a detection limit of 1.1 ppm for a 1 m path length and effectively resolve spatial concentration gradients across the combustion region. Furthermore, the system's high temporal resolution allowed for the identification of dynamic combustion instabilities, including self-sustained pulsations and fuel leakage under fuel-lean conditions. These findings validate the proposed EO architecture as a flexible and highly sensitive tool for advanced flame characterization."}

The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy.

Moreover, we find another phase: once one subsystem exceeds half of the total system, the leading genuine tripartite entanglement vanishes and reduces to that for global AdS${}_3$. This transition is indeed consistent with recent arguments for distillable EPR pairs in tripartite Haar-random states. Motivated by finite-cutoff holography, we further study the radial cutoff dependence of multi-entropy and show that genuine multi-entropy acquires nontrivial size dependence even for the tripartite case in AdS${}_3$.

By classifying these spacetimes into three fundamental types, Type I (Kretschmann scalar K_max increasing with mass M), Type II (mass-independent K_max), and Type III (K_max decreasing with M), we demonstrate how subtle variations in the core geometry imprint distinguishable features on the BH shadow. A detailed analysis of photon dynamics reveals that the parameters α and n, which control the deviation from Schwarzschild geometry and the radial decay of the regularizing factor, respectively, systematically alter the properties of the photon sphere. These intrinsic geometric differences propagate outward: for fixed parameters, Type III BHs, with the most compact photon sphere, produce the smallest and brightest shadows, whereas Type I BHs yield the largest and dimmest ones. Shadow computations under both static and infalling spherical accretion models confirm that the curvature-based classification directly corresponds to observable differences. Critically, Type III BHs exhibit the strongest sensitivity to parameter variations, making them optimal probes for constraining the underlying spacetime geometry. Our work reveals that even among nonsingular BHs sharing the same asymptotic core, differences in internal curvature are reflected in the shadow morphology, thereby providing a new pathway to test quantum-gravity-inspired models using upcoming high-resolution observations."}

One recently proposed method makes use of ancilla qubits and controlled unitary operators to implement weak measurements related to imaginary-time evolution.

We first generalize the algorithm from exact to approximate optimization, taking advantage of several properties unique to classical problems. In particular we show how to select parameters such that the success probability of each measurement step is bounded away from $1/2$. We then show how to adapt our paradigm to the setting of constrained optimization for a number of important classes of hard problem constraints. For this we compare and contrast both penalty-based and feasibility-preserving approaches, elucidating the significant advantages of the latter approach. Our approach is general and may be applied to easy-to-prepare initial states as a standalone algorithm, or deployed as a quantum postprocessing stage to improve performance of a given parameterized quantum circuit. We then propose a more sophisticated variant of our algorithm that adaptively applies a mixing operator or not, based on the measurement outcomes seen so far, as to speeds up the algorithm and helps the system evolution avoid slowing down or getting stuck suboptimally. In particular, we show that mixing operators from the quantum alternating operator ansatz can be imported directly, both for the necessary eigenstate scrambling operator and for initial state preparation, and discuss quantum resource tradeoffs."}

In a two-port (single-channel-per-side) description, we derive closed-form conditions for (i) canceling back-reflection toward the transmitter and (ii) maximizing the net extracted power at the receiver side. In the lossless limit these conditions imply unit transmitter-to-receiver efficiency (all transmitter power is routed to the receiver side) even when the barrier is nearly opaque under one-sided illumination. We validate the concept using (1) an analytically solvable high-index Fabry--Pérot slab and (2) a numerically simulated perforated PEC metasurface exhibiting vanishing one-sided transmission; in both cases, coherent assistance yields near-unity transmission and large enhancement factors. We further analyze dissipative barriers using a receiver-side energy-balance metric, showing that substantial net delivery can persist well into the lossy regime.

One-port, loop-coupled S11 measurements supported by full-wave simulations reveal twist-driven hybridization of the dominant resonant manifold. For small G, the lower hybrid resonance redshifts continuously from 409 MHz to 210 MHz (2:1 tuning), enabling compact, twist-programmable resonant surfaces.

We further propose that these trajectories admit a natural interpretation as Regge trajectories of stringy excitations in a dual stringy black hole geometry. From this perspective, pole-skipping for an individual operator can be viewed as tracking the stringy horizon through the response of a single excitation. Our results suggest that pole-skipping reflects intrinsic properties of quantum chaotic systems and may be deeply connected to the structure of horizons in the stringy regime."}

In this work, we develop and validate a practical framework for extracting thermodynamic properties of materials using such hardware. As a test case, we consider nitrogen-doped graphene. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT) formation energies, we map the material energetics onto a Rydberg-atom Hamiltonian suitable for quantum annealing by fitting an on-site term and distance-dependent pair interactions. The Hamiltonian derived from DFT cannot be implemented directly on current QuEra devices, as the largest energy scale accessible on the hardware is two orders of magnitude smaller than the target two-body interaction in the material. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a rescaling strategy based on a single parameter, $α_v$, which ensures that the Boltzmann weights sampled by the hardware correspond exactly to those of the material at an effective temperature $T' = α_vT$, where $T$ is the device sampling temperature. This rescaling also establishes a direct correspondence between the global laser detuning $Δ_g$ and the grand-canonical chemical potential $Δμ$. We validate the method on a 28-site graphene nanoflake using exhaustive enumeration, and on a larger 78-site system where Monte Carlo sampling confirms preferential sampling of low-energy configurations."}

By harnessing quantum information scrambling, the protocol converts local interactions into delocalized metrologically useful correlations, enabling robust signal amplification through interference of the scrambled and polarized quantum states. We validate the time-reversal ability via Loschmidt echo measurements and quantify the information scrambling through out-of-time-ordered correlators, establishing the essential quantum resources of our protocol.

Our emphasis is on how these relations arise from unitarity and hermitian analyticity in interacting quantum field theories on de Sitter space-time. Instead of analyzing wave-function coefficients, we apply these relations directly to cosmological correlators. By studying conformally coupled and massless scalar fields with $φ^n$ self-interactions, we demonstrate that the discontinuity of a cosmological correlator can be expressed as a sum of products of lower-point discontinuities, stemming from a single-cut of one internal line in the corresponding tree-level exchange Witten diagram. Notably, beyond lower-point correlators, the decomposition of the discontinuities of cosmological correlators includes contributions from auxiliary elements that consist of both the real and imaginary parts of the lower-point wave-function coefficients, which have not been reported in the existing literature. Interestingly, depending on whether $n$ is even or odd in a $φ^n$ interaction, these different lower-point discontinuities contribute as the leading or sub-leading piece in the late-time limit to the discontinuity relations. Additionally, our single-cut discontinuity relation leads to a decomposition rule for the residue of the cosmological correlators at partial energy singularities, incorporating contributions from these auxiliary objects. Through explicit calculations in several models, we confirm that our discontinuity relations are consistent with results from the in-in formalism. While primarily developed using tree-level exchanges with polynomial interactions, we also demonstrate that our framework can be extended to include loop corrections and cases with derivative interactions."}

This separation allows depth to scale without expanding the classical search space, mitigating overparameterization and optimization challenges typical of deep QAOA circuits, such as barren plateaus-like behaviors. We benchmark FPC-QAOA on random MaxCut instances and the Tail Assignment Problem, achieving performance comparable to or better than standard QAOA with nearly constant classical effort and significantly fewer quantum circuit evaluations.

The analysis is further generalized to higher-dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, where the characteristics of tEE are obtained with increasing size of the boundary subsystem. Besides, we also show that the boundary subsystem length diverges at a dimension-dependent critical turning point. Notably, this critical point moves closer to the black hole horizon as the dimensionality of the bulk increases. For large subsystem lengths, the finite part of the tEE displays a characteristic volume-plus-area structure, with a real volume term and a complex coefficient of the area term approaching constant values at large dimensions. Besides, we also study the monotonicity of a new quantity, timelike entanglement density, which offers insights into a timelike area theorem in specific limits.

A central difficulty in such large-scale systems with all-microwave gates and, therefore, strong static couplings, is suppressing parasitic interactions that extend beyond nearest neighbors to include next-nearest elements. We address this issue by introducing several design strategies: the frequency allocation of both qubits and couplers, the localization of coupler wavefunctions, and a differential oscillator that suppresses residual long-range interactions.

Finally, we present analytical expressions for phase-space distributions (Wigner and characteristic functions) representing ordinary squeezed multiplets. We use this to show that some squeezed multiplets are highly sensitive to perturbations in all phase-space directions, making them interesting for metrological applications."}

This is a natural generalization of a random purification channel, that transforms copies of an unknown mixed state to copies of a randomly chosen purification state. Our construction is based on the quantum Schur transform and the quantum Fourier transform over the symmetric group. By using the efficient construction of these quantum transforms, we can implement the random dilation superchannel with the circuit complexity $O(\\mathrm{poly}(n, \\log d_I, \\log d_O))$, where $n$ is the number of queries and $d_I$ and $d_O$ are the input and output dimensions of the input channel, respectively.

For the case where the Kraus rank $r$ is the least possible (i.e., $r = d_I/d_O$), we show quantum circuits transforming $n$ parallel queries of an unknown quantum channel $Λ$ to $Θ(n^α)$ parallel queries of $Λ$ for any $α<2$ approximately, and its Petz recovery map for the reference state given by the maximally mixed state probabilistically and exactly.

This review presents a coherent and pedagogical framework that bridges foundational theory with observational frontiers. We begin by developing the theory of gravitational radiation within linearized general relativity, deriving gravitational waves as solutions to the linearized Einstein equations and clarifying their physical interpretation, polarization states, and key properties. We then deepen the discussion through a geometric perspective, tracing the connection between gravitational radiation and the algebraic structure of the Weyl tensor and its role in defining energy and angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Extending beyond flat backgrounds, we examine gravitational waves in an expanding universe, following their evolution across cosmological epochs and their generation during inflation. Within this setting, we discuss adiabatic modes and consistency relations that reveal universal properties of long-wavelength perturbations, and derive the inflationary spectrum of vacuum gravitational waves together with their contribution to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also survey the main observational strategies for detecting gravitational waves across a broad frequency range, including cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing arrays, ground- and space-based laser interferometers, and resonant cavity detectors. We then discuss the astrophysical and cosmological mechanisms responsible for generating gravitational radiation. We conclude by summarizing the current status of the field and outlining promising directions for future theoretical and observational developments."}

We derive the charge associated to divergent superphaserotations and show that it exactly vanishes to all orders in the electromagnetic coupling. This is in agreement with the vanishing of the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem which is one-loop exact. Special care is required for massless matter due to potential collinear divergences which, as we show, do however not affect the superphaserotation charge. We furthermore compute the infrared corrections to the charge associated to the subleading tree-level soft photon theorem. As a corollary of our result, we find that the tail to the velocity kick memory due to the long-range interactions between soft electromagnetic radiation and massless matter vanishes."}

The nonclassical area quantifier rooted in homodyne tomography, allows us to assess the nonclassical nature of the vdPo's state directly from the tomogram without requiring full state reconstruction or the Wigner function negativity. Within a well-defined parameter regime of drive strength and detuning, both $δ$ and $g^{(2)}(0)$ exhibit pronounced signatures of synchronization that complements the phase coherence between the drive and the vdPo. We derive an analytical expression for the steady-state density matrix and the corresponding tomogram of the system, valid for arbitrary strengths of the harmonic drive. Analysis of the quantum tomogram uncovers clear phase-locking behavior, enabling the identification of the synchronization region (Arnold tongue) directly in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. Furthermore, the behaviour of $g^{(2)}(0)$ provides a statistical perspective that reinforces the tomographic signatures of QS. By analyzing the interplay between these metrics, we can gain more profound insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern QS in such systems."}

We work out both of these deformations explicitly and verify that $T \\overline T$-deforming the boundary theory corresponds to imposing mixed boundary conditions on the metric at the conformal boundary, whereas the bulk \"Dirichlet deformation\" gives rise to a field theory deforming operator that includes $T \\overline T$ as well as other irrelevant terms.

We demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances entanglement distillation for weakly entangled states via two complementary strategies: optimized local state transformation and probabilistic local transformation.

Alternatively, plaquette ring exchange can also generate pairing, albeit with a distinct diagonal $d$-wave pairing symmetry. Hence, our finding showcases a competition of different unconventional pairing channels, and demonstrates via a simple model how band geometry can induce fermionic pairing.

We further propose that these trajectories admit a natural interpretation as Regge trajectories of stringy excitations in a dual stringy black hole geometry. From this perspective, pole-skipping for an individual operator can be viewed as tracking the stringy horizon through the response of a single excitation. Our results suggest that pole-skipping reflects intrinsic properties of quantum chaotic systems and may be deeply connected to the structure of horizons in the stringy regime."}

To study this phenomenon and others, we extend Tomita-Takesaki theory to accommodate states of soft radiation such as arise in the electromagnetic and gravitational memory effects, and provide a general framework for computing the distinguishability of general coherent states. Applying these tools, we use the methods of unambiguous state discrimination and approximate quantum error correction to prove some new relations regarding the distinguishability of quantum states, and the quantum information content of soft radiation, and thereby show that a black hole (or any horizon) decoheres its environment as though its interior were full of optimal observers."}

Moreover, we find another phase: once one subsystem exceeds half of the total system, the leading genuine tripartite entanglement vanishes and reduces to that for global AdS${}_3$. This transition is indeed consistent with recent arguments for distillable EPR pairs in tripartite Haar-random states. Motivated by finite-cutoff holography, we further study the radial cutoff dependence of multi-entropy and show that genuine multi-entropy acquires nontrivial size dependence even for the tripartite case in AdS${}_3$.

Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes.
