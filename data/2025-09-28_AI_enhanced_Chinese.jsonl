Single-tone experiments demonstrate a net line rate of 400\nGbps per polarization (16-QAM, 120 GBd) in silicon within the O-band, achieving\na record shoreline density of 4 Tbps/mm while consuming only 10 fJ/bit for\nmodulation.

Twin images disrupt the reconstruction in solving the\nill-posed phase retrieval problem. The known parameters are less than the\nunknown parameters, causing phase ambiguities. State-of-the-art deep-learning\nor non-learning methods face challenges in balancing data fidelity with\ntwin-image disturbance.

GSH uses Gaussian splatting\nfor optical field representation and compresses the number of unknown\nparameters by a maximum of 15 folds, transforming the original ill-posed phase\nretrieval into a well-posed one with reduced phase ambiguities. Additionally,\nthe Gaussian splatting tends to form sharp patterns rather than those with\nnoisy twin-image backgrounds as each Gaussian has a spatially slow-varying\nprofile.

This\nraises a natural question: what happens at transitions between inequivalent\ngapless SPTs? We address this for the simplest known case among gapless SPTs\nprotected by a unitary symmetry group acting faithfully on the low-energy\ntheory. To this end, we consider a qutrit version of the nearest-neighbor XX\nchain. Trimerizing the chain explicitly breaks an anomalous symmetry and\nproduces three distinct gapped SPT phases protected by a unitary $\\mathbb{Z}_3\n\\times \\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry. Their phase boundaries are given by three\ninequivalent gapless SPTs without any gapped symmetry sectors, each described\nby a symmetry-enriched version of an orbifolded Potts$^2$ conformal field\ntheory with central charge $c=\\frac{8}{5}$. We provide an analytic derivation\nof this critical theory in a particular regime and confirm its stability using\ntensor network simulations. Remarkably, the three gapless SPTs meet at a $c =\n2$ multicritical point, where the protecting $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3$\nsymmetry exhibits a mixed anomaly with the $\\mathbb Z_3$ entangler symmetry\nthat permutes the SPT classes. We further explore how discrete gauging gives\ndipole-symmetric models, offering insights into dipole symmetry-breaking and\nSPTs, as well as symmetry-enriched multiversality.

The quantum-chemistry study employs a\nfour-component relativistic coupled-cluster (CC) method, including excitations\nup to the triple level, namely: the contribution of triple-cluster amplitudes\nwas studied both perturbatively (CCSD(T)) and through fully iterative\ncalculations (CCSDT). The resulting oxygen- and hydrogen-induced HFS functions\nrepresent the most accurate and reliable theoretical predictions to date\nexhibiting excellent agreement with semiempirical curve for hydrogen-induced\nHFS derived from high-resolution spectroscopic data for the lowest vibrational\nlevels ($v\\in [0,2]$) of the electronic $X^2\\Pi$ state. Vibrationally averaged\n$\\textit{ab initio}$ values are consistent with experimental values within\n$1\\%$ for all states considered. Furthermore, the internuclear distance range\nover which the HFS curves are defined has been extended beyond that of previous\nstudies, thereby providing a robust foundation for accurate HFS treatments of\nhigher-lying rovibrational levels of OH isotopologues within both adiabatic and\nnon-adiabatic frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6c34\u5206\u5b50\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\uff08\u542b\u6c27-17\u548c\u6c22-1D\uff09\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u78c1\u77e9\u53cc\u6781\u5fae\u5206\u81ea\u65cb Splitting (HFS) \u5e38\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4ece 0.6\u00c5 \u5230 1.8\u00c5 \u5185\u952e\u957f\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u6001 X^2\u03a0 \u7535\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6c27\u548c\u6c22\u6838\u5bf9 HFS \u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001 A^2\u03a3^+ \u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6c22\u8bf1\u5bfc HFS \u66f2\u7ebf\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u7ec4\u5206\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u8026\u5408-\u5757\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u91cd\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u5f0f\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u4e09\u91cd\u5757\u632f\u5e45\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6c27\u548c\u6c22\u6838\u7684 HFS \u51fd\u6570\u662f\u6700\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u7b26\u5408\u5ea6\u5728 1% \u4ee5\u5185\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u952e\u957f\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5bf9\u66f4\u9ad8\u80fd\u7ea7\u7684 HFS \u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u81ea\u65cb Splitting \u5e38\u6570\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c34\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u9760\u7684 HFS \u5e38\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u56db\u7ec4\u5206\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u8026\u5408-\u5757\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u91cd\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u632f\u8361\uff08\u81f3 CCSD(T) \u548c CCSDT\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u7684\u632f\u8361\u6c34\u5e73\u8ba1\u7b97\u6c27\u548c\u6c22\u6838\u5bf9 HFS \u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u57fa\u6001\u548c\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u952e\u957f\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u80fd\u7ea7\u7684 HFS \u5206\u6790\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6c27\u548c\u6c22\u6838\u5bf9 HFS \u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u5177\u6709 1% \u4ee5\u5185\u7684\u543b\u5408\u5ea6\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u503c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u503c\u7684\u543b\u5408\u7a0b\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u6c34\u5206\u5b50\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u7684\u7cbe\u786e HFS \u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u952e\u957f\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u9ad8\u80fd\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u6c34\u5206\u5b50\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u7684 HFS \u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5b50\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u9ad8\u80fd\u7ea7\u548c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5b50\u7684 HFS \u5c5e\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

While the bandwidth of Rydberg sensors are limited by the transit time\nof atoms and the Rabi frequency of the coupling field, achieving higher\nbandwidth through smaller beam sizes is thought to compromise sensitivity due\nto reduced EIT signal strength.

The\nhysteresis is often reported with attributes like \"negligible\" or \"small\"\nwithout giving any specifics as to how this was determined and against what\nreference the measured values were compared to. Quite surprisingly, there\nappears to be only a fragmentary understanding of the mechanisms actually\ncontributing to hysteresis and the sensitivity of the actual measurement on\nvarious experimental parameters. We attempt to close this gap by first\nproviding a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the dominant mechanisms\ncontributing to hysteresis: charge trapping by defects from the channel or the\ngate, the drift of mobile charges, and eventually ferroelectricity. We continue\nby suggesting methods to experimentally distinguishing between these phenomena.\nBased on these discussions it becomes clear that previously reported hysteresis\nvalues have little meaning as they have been non-systematically recorded under\narbitrary conditions. In order to resolve this predicament, we propose a\nstandardized hysteresis measurement scheme to establish the hysteresis as a\ncomparable metric for the assessment of device stability. Our standardized\nscheme ensures that hysteresis data can be effectively compared across\ndifferent technologies and, most importantly, provide a means to extrapolate\ndata obtained on thicker prototypes to subnanometer equivalent oxide\nthicknesses. This facilitates the systematic benchmarking of insulator/channel\ncombinations in terms of stability, which thereby enables the screening of\nmaterial systems for more stable and reliable 2D-material-based MOSFETs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\u4e2d seen \u7684\u9000\u78c1\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5668\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0d\u540c\u5148\u8fdb\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u539a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u9000\u78c1\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5e2e\u52a9\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9000\u78c1\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u5668\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6750\u6599\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5668\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6750\u6599\u7b5b\u9009\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9000\u78c1\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7f3a\u9677\u6355\u83b7\u3001\u79fb\u7535\u8377\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u4f0f-\u5b89\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u533a\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u9000\u78c1\u503c\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u548c\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u539a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6750\u6599\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u9000\u78c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599 Mos \u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

In many cases of interest, time-reversal symmetry selects the\nGaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) as the relevant universality class. In\nholographic CFTs, this is mirrored by the presence of non-orientable geometries\nin the dual gravitational path integral. In this work, we analyze general\nproperties of these matrix models and their gravitational counterparts. First,\nwe develop a formalism to express the universal level statistics in the\ncanonical ensemble for arbitrary spectral curves, leading to a topological\nexpansion with finite radius of convergence in the late-time $\\tau$-scaling\nlimit. Then, we focus on topological gravity and study topological recursion on\nthe moduli space of non-orientable surfaces. We find that the Weil-Petersson\nvolumes display non-analytic behaviour multiplying polynomials in the boundary\nlengths. The volumes give rise to wormholes with late-time divergences, in\ncontrast with the orientable case, which is finite. We identify systematic\ncancellations among WP volumes implied by the consistency and finiteness of the\n$\\tau$-scaling limit. In particular, the cancellation of late-time divergences\nrequires a nontrivial genus resummation. Working in the gravitational\nmicrocanonical ensemble, we derive and resum all orders of the topological\nexpansion matching the GOE matrix model in the high-energy regime.", "AI": {"tldr":

Our results show that relativistic corrections can enhance the\nmagnitude of the torque by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to purely Newtonian\nexpressions when the orbit of the compact object is smaller than $10$\nSchwarzschild radii of the supermassive black hole. We also demonstrate that\nstrong relativistic shifts the inner Lindblad resonances closer to the compact\nobject than the outer Lindblad resonances when the compact object is closer\nthan 4 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole, potentially leading\nto a reversal in the direction of the torque acting on the compact object.\nFinally, we provide a dephasing estimate and show that using the relativistic\ntorque formula is crucial to obtain reliable estimates for extreme mass ratio\ninspirals in orbits closer than 5 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black\nhole.

In contrary,\nstudy on the topological properties of the asymmetric systems is rather\nlimited, especially in higher-dimensional systems. In this work, we explore a\nnew theory to study the topology in various one-dimensional (1D) and\ntwo-dimensional (2D) asymmetric systems with chiral boundary states. Starting\nfrom the simple SSHm model, we show the chiral topology of its edge states by\nredefining sublattices. Meanwhile, based on its Rice-Mele-like effective\nHamiltonian, a new topological invariant $\\bar{Z}$ can be defined and the\nbulk-edge correspondence is established. With this clear physical picture, our\ntheory can be extended to the more complex asymmetric ladder models, or even\nthe 2D asymmetric systems. In the 2D BBH3 model, new chiral corner states with\nredefined lattices are found based on our method. These corner states are\nindependent of any spatial symmetry and exhibit the characteristics of\ntopological bound states in the continuum (TBICs). Moreover, the topological\ninvariant can be calculated by introducing $\\bar{Z}$ into 2D.

By identifying all three spaces with discrete simplices\nand representations of the Lie group $SU(q)$, we prove that many codes and\ntheir gates in $SU(q)$ can be inter-converted between the three state spaces.\nWe construct new code instances for all three spaces using classical $\\ell_1$\ncodes and Tverberg's theorem, a classic result from convex geometry. We obtain\nnew families of quantum codes with distance that scales almost linearly with\nthe code length $N$ by constructing $\\ell_1$ codes based on combinatorial\npatterns called Sidon sets and utilizing their Tverberg partitions. This\nimproves upon the existing designs for all the state spaces. We present\nexplicit constructions of codes with shorter length or lower total\nspin/excitation than known codes with similar parameters, new bosonic codes\nwith exotic Gaussian gates, as well as examples of short codes with distance\nlarger than the known constructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1a\u7531\u8bb8\u591a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6216\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u590d\u5408\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u7531\u8bb8\u591a\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u590d\u5408\u5e38\u523a\u6fc0\u5916\u8bbe\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u539f\u5b50\u3001\u79bb\u5b50\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u590d\u5408\u6838\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u548c\u674e\u7fa4SU(q)\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u7801\u548c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u95e8\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f8\u4e92\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u21131\u7801\u548cTverberg\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u65b0\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684Sidon\u96c6\u548c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684Tverberg\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u8ddd\u79bb\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0e\u7801\u957f\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u65b0\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u65cf\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u8fd8\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u8f83\u77ed\u7684\u7801\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u603b\u81ea\u65cb/\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u65b0\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u7801\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e9b\u8f83\u77ed\u7684\u7801\uff0c\u5176\u8ddd\u79bb\u8d85\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u6784\u9020\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u548c\u674e\u7fa4SU(q)\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u7801\u548c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u95e8\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f8\u4e92\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u21131\u7801\u548cTverberg\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u65b0\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u6210\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u65b0\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684Sidon\u96c6\u548cTverberg\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u8ddd\u79bb\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0e\u7801\u957f\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u65b0\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u65cf\uff1b3) \u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b4) \u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u8f83\u77ed\u7684\u7801\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u603b\u81ea\u65cb/\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u65b0\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u7801\uff1b5) \u6784\u9020\u4e86\u8f83\u77ed\u7684\u7801\uff0c\u5176\u8ddd\u79bb\u8d85\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u6784\u9020\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u8054\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u548c\u674e\u7fa4SU(q)\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While\nsignificant progress has been made in directionally routing photoluminescence\nfrom these materials, key challenges remain: notably, how to link routing\neffects to the degree of valley polarization, and how to distinguish genuine\nvalley-dependent routing from spin-momentum coupling - an optical phenomenon\nrelated to electromagnetic scattering but not the light source itself. In this\nstudy, we address these challenges by experimentally and numerically\nestablishing a direct relationship between the intrinsic valley polarization of\nthe emitters and the farfield emission pattern, enabling an accurate assessment\nof valley-selective emission routing. We report valley-selective manipulation\nof the angular emission pattern of monolayer tungsten diselenide mediated by\ngold nanobar dimer antennas at cryogenic temperature. Experimentally, we study\nchanges in the system's emission pattern for different circular polarization\nstates of the excitation, demonstrating a valley-selective circular dichroism\nin photoluminescence of 6%. These experimental findings are supported by a\nnovel numerical approach based on the principle of reciprocity, which allows\nmodeling valley-selective emission in periodic systems. We further show\nnumerically, that these valley-selective directional effects are a\nsymmetry-protected property of the nanoantenna array owing to its extrinsic\nchirality for oblique emission angles, and can significantly be enhanced when\ntailoring the distribution of emitters.

This principle has been\nwidely adopted to make grating spectrometers more compact. Conventional\nimmersed gratings have blazed profiles which typically show the highest\nefficiency for one main design wavelength. In addition, the blazed profiles\ntend to cause significant polarization sensitivity. In this work, we propose an\nalternative approach for designing an immersed grating composed of\nsub-wavelength structures, designed to increase diffraction efficiency and\nreduce polarization dependence. For a theoretical demonstration, a reflective\nmetagrating immersed in silicon is optimized over the short-wave infrared\nband-3 (SWIR-3, here $2.304~\\mu$m-$2.405~\\mu$m), targeting the same diffraction\nangles as the immersion grating used in the Sentinel-5 Earth observation\nmission. The structure is optimized using a modified Covariance Matrix\nAdaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). The optimized immersed metagrating\nachieves an average efficiency of (over the SWIR-3 band) $\\sim 78\\%$, compared\nto $\\sim 62\\%$ for the conventional immersed blazed grating, and reduces\npolarization sensitivity from roughly $\\sim 15\\%$ to $\\sim 5\\%$.

For this problem, we demonstrate\nthe first lower bounds which scale with the number of parameters of the unknown\nHamiltonian. When the unknown Hamiltonian is arbitrary, we show that learning\nto error $\\epsilon$ requires $2^{(1/2 - o(1))n} / \\epsilon$ rounds of\ninteraction with the Hamiltonian.

Our\nlower bounds hold even for very simple planted spike detection problems, where\nthe goal is to detect the presence of a single coefficient which is\nsuper-polynomially larger than the other coefficients of the Hamiltonian, as\nwell as for average case instances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fians\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528$e^{-iHt}$\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e$n$\u4e2aqubit\u4e0a\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fians\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u6062\u590d\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fians\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u91cf\u5b50 metrology, \u611f\u77e5, \u8bbe\u5907\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u672a\u77e5\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fians\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u3002\u5f53\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fians\u662f\u4efb\u610f\u7684\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u8bef\u5dee$\betweenepsilon$\u9700\u8981$2^{(1/2 - o(1))n} / \betweenepsilon$\u6b21\u4e0e\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fians\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fians\u662f$k$-\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5e38\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u9700\u8981$n^{\between\theta(k)}$\u6b21\u4e0e\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fians\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Tang\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0b\u754c\u8868\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u53bb\u6838\u5c16\u5cf0\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u603b\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5355\u4e2a\u8d85\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fians\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e73\u5747\u60c5\u51b5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fians\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50 metrology, \u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u539f\u7406\u548c\u6982\u7387 amplify\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e0b\u754c\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e$k$-\u5c40\u90e8\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fians\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u4e3a\uff1a\u4efb\u610f\u60c5\u51b5\u9700\u8981$2^{(1/2 - o(1))n} / \betweenepsilon$\u6b21\u4e92\u52a8\uff1b$k$-\u5c40\u90e8\u60c5\u51b5\u9700\u8981$n^{\between\theta(k)}$\u6b21\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u56de\u7b54\u4e86Tang\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u53bb\u6838\u5c16\u5cf0\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u60c5\u51b5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u603b\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fians\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0a\u8ff0\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u677f\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u5bfb\u627e\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

Thinned to the single layer phase, 2D-TMDs are unique solid-state\nsystems with excitonic states able to persist at room temperature and\ndemonstrate notable tunability of their energies in the optical range. Based on\nthese properties, they offer important opportunities for hybrid nanophotonic\nsystems where a nanophotonic structure serves to enhance the light-matter\ninteraction in the 2D-TMDs, while the 2D-TMDs can provide various active\nfunctionalities, thereby dramatically enhancing the scope of nanophotonic\nstructures. In this work, we combine 2D-TMD materials with resonant photonic\nnanostructures, namely, metasurfaces composed of high-index dielectric\nnanoparticles. The dependence of the excitonic states on charge carrier density\nin 2D-TMDs leads to an amplitude modulation of the corresponding optical\ntransitions upon changes of the Fermi level, and thereby to changes of the\ncoupling strength between the 2D-TMDs and resonant modes of the photonic\nnanostructure. We experimentally implement such a hybrid nanophotonic system\nand demonstrate voltage tuning of its reflectance as well as its different\npolarization-dependent behavior.

A key challenge lies in\nthe \"curse of dimensionality\", where the number of possible reaction terms\ngrows exponentially with the number of species, and the computation of reaction\nrates involving many-body interactions becomes intractable in polynomial time\non classical computers. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithmic\nframework designed to overcome these challenges, leveraging the architecture of\nquantum computing to simultaneously compute reaction rates and track the\nspatiotemporal dynamical evolutions of subcellular systems.

To investigate this, we solve\nMaxwell's equations using the charge and current densities derived from an\nelectron in the NSLG state.
