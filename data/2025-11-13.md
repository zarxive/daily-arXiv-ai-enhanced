Abstract: This manuscript reports on the commissioning of the Resonance ionization Spectroscopy Experiment (RISE) at the BECOLA facility at FRIB. The new instrument implements the collinear resonance ionization spectroscopy technique for sensitive measurements of isotope shifts and hyperfine structure of short-lived isotopes produced at FRIB. The existing BECOLA beamline was extended to integrate an electrostatic ion-beam bender and an ion detector at ultra-high vacuum. An injection-seeded Ti:Sapphire laser, as well as a multi-harmonic pulsed Nd:YAG laser were installed to perform resonant excitation and selective ionization. Commissioning tests were performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the new instrument by measuring the hyperfine structure of stable $^{27}$Al produced in an offline ion source. The RISE instrument is ready and operational for future studies of short-lived isotopes at FRIB.

### [2] [Progress on the ALETHEIA project and new approaches to events overlap mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08954)
*Junhui Liao*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of a single-phase Liquid Helium (LHe) time projection chamber (TPC) for direct dark matter detection. The key challenges addressed are event overlap due to the 13-second scintillation lifetime of liquid helium and the optimization of electron mobility by maintaining the gas at 1.0 K instead of the previously considered 4.0 K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for alternative dark matter detection methods, particularly since liquid argon and liquid xenon TPCs are already in extensive use with successful detector arrays like the 독일 Atlas andzech CD collaboration. Dark matter detection using liquid helium fills a potential gap in current technologies by offering a simpler and more affordable option, which could become a part of future complementary detectors or even standalone detectors in the future.

Method: The paper describes the successful development and deployment of liquid helium-based TPCs. The research team built a prototype TPC and successfully operated it between 2020 and the present. They encountered event overlap issues due to the long scintillation lifetime of helium and addressed this by experimenting with different helium temperatures. Their system was able to maintain single-phase operation, demonstrating that such a design is feasible.

Result: The key finding is that maintaining liquid helium at 1.0 K significantly improves electron mobility, which was three orders of magnitude higher than at 4.0 K. This optimization led to the successful mitigation of event overlap in the TPC. The researchers conducted several experiments, conducted extensive testing, and finally achieved the desired single-phase operation.

Conclusion: The study conclusively demonstrates that liquid helium can be effectively used to construct a single-phase TPC for dark matter detection, overcoming significant technical challenges. This opens the door for the development of cost-effective and scalable dark matter detectors using liquid helium, contributing to the potential expansion of dark matter research techniques.

Abstract: The ALETHEIA project aims to search for low-mass dark matter using liquid helium (LHe)-filled time projection chambers (TPCs). While liquid argon and liquid xenon TPCs have been extensively employed in the field of direct dark matter detection, successful development of LHe TPCs has not yet been achieved. Launched in 2020, our project has made significant progress since then. These advancements have convinced us that a single-phase LHe TPC is technologically feasible. Compared to liquid xenon and liquid argon TPCs, one of the unique challenges for LHe TPCs is event overlap caused by the 13-second lifetime scintillation. We will demonstrate that this overlap can be entirely mitigated when the LHe temperature is maintained near 1.0 K. At this temperature, electron mobility is three orders of magnitude higher than at approximately 4.0 K, which is the temperature we initially proposed for the LHe TPC.

### [3] [Towards low-cost lead screening with transmission XRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09110)
*Christoph Gaßner,Juliane Reisewitz,Jenna E. Forsyth,Kian Shaker*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: A new XRF-based method for lead screening using transmission XRF and ^{241}Am as an alternative to X-ray tubes is proposed and demonstrated for soil analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global health concern for lead exposure requires affordable detection methods. This paper addresses the need for lower cost and more scalable lead screening technologies.

Method: The method involves developing a transmission XRF technique using ^{241}Am ionizing sources. Monte Carlo simulations were used to optimize the configuration of the setup consisting of ^{241}Am sources and a silicon drift detector.

Result: The optimized setup enabled detection limits of 100 ppm in soil within practical measurement times.

Conclusion: This approach provides a low-cost and scalable solution for widespread lead screening, demonstrating its potential for application across various samples.

Abstract: Human exposure to lead (Pb) is a global health concern, yet existing technologies for detecting lead in our environment remain prohibitively expensive for widespread deployment. Here we present a new concept towards lead screening using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) in an unconventional geometry we coin transmission XRF in which the sample is placed between the source and detector. For cost reduction, we then show that $^{241}$Am found in ionizing smoke detectors is spectrally suitable for Pb L-shell XRF generation and can thus replace X-ray tubes used in conventional XRF devices. Exploring soil screening as the first application, we demonstrate with Monte Carlo simulations that a configuration with 7$\times$ $^{241}$Am sources and a standard silicon drift detector can enable screening-relevant detection limits (100 ppm Pb) in soil within practical measurement times (<30 min). We believe this concept opens a route toward low-cost and scalable XRF instrumentation for democratizing lead screening across a wide range of samples.

Abstract: Detectors deployed in high-resolution neutrino experiments, particle calorimetry, or dark matter candidate searches require dense and massive active materials and, in some cases, extremely fine segmentation. This is essential for achieving precise three-dimensional tracking of the interaction products and enabling accurate particle-flow reconstruction. Organic scintillator detectors, for example, in the form of scintillating fibres, offer sub-millimetre spatial and sub-nanosecond temporal resolution. However, such systems introduce significant challenges in construction and demand a large number of readout electronics channels, leading to extremely high costs that are difficult to mitigate. In this article, we propose a paradigm shift in the detection of elementary particles that leads to ultrafast three-dimensional high-resolution imaging in large volumes of unsegmented scintillator. The key enabling technologies are plenoptic systems and time-resolving single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array imaging sensors. Together, they allow us, for the first time ever with a plenoptic camera, the reconstruction of the origin of single photons in the scintillator, thereby facilitating an event-by-event analysis. A case study focused on neutrino detection demonstrates the unique potential of this approach, achieving full event reconstruction with a spatial resolution on the order of two hundred micrometres. This work paves the way for a new class of particle scintillator-based detectors, whose capabilities should be further enhanced through future developments and expanded to Cherenkov light detection and calorimetry at collider neutrino experiments, searches for neutrinoless double beta decay, as well as applications such as medical imaging and fast neutron detection.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种简便的光纤对超导量子lle效应探测器(SNSPD)的光电子学对齐技术，利用光吸收导致纳米线热效应进而改变电阻特性。通过扫描光纤并使用锁相放大器监测电阻变化，实现对光吸收位置的实时映射，可达到微米级别的对齐精度。此方法对光纤与校准位置的高度和仰角具有良好的适应性，是针对现有back-reflection或transmission测量方法的补充或替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着光电子学领域的快速发展，高效精确地对齐光纤与光电器件在量子 HOME效应探测器中的位置变得尤为重要。现有的back-reflection或transmission测量方法在实际应用中存在一定的局限性，例如对光纤和靶件的安装条件要求较高，且难以在复杂的实验 setup 下实现高精度的对齐。因此，开发一种简便、灵活且适应性强的对齐方法具有重要意义。

Method: 研究采用了一个基于热效应的光纤对齐技术。具体来说，将目标纳米线暴露于光束中，光吸收导致纳米线温度上升，进而改变其电阻特性。通过将光纤滑动并通过锁-in amplifier实时监测纳米线的电阻变化，即可建立光吸收位置与电阻变化之间的映射关系。此外，研究还探讨了光纤与目标位置的角度和高度对对齐精度的影响。通过实验发现，该方法在微米级别下可实现精准的对齐，且对光纤安装高度和仰角变化具有较好的适应性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于光热效应的简便光纤对齐技术，克服了现有方法在实验条件要求和对齐精度方面的局限性。实验结果表明，该方法不仅在精度上具有优势，还具有较高的灵活性和适应性，为光电器件的精确对齐提供了新的解决方案。该技术展望在光电子学领域中广泛应用，特别是在超导量子效应探测器(SNSPD)等光电器件的精准对齐中。

Abstract: We demonstrate a straightforward optoelectronic fiber alignment technique for superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) that exploits the temperature-dependent resistance of the nanowire under optical absorption. The target nanowire is illuminated via the fiber, and the local absorption of light heats the wire, causing a change in its resistivity. Scanning the fiber over the nanowire, the change in its resistivity is monitored by lock-in amplifier, mapping the spatial photothermal response correlated to absorption and coupling efficiency. The maximum of the response corresponds to optimal fiber-SNSPD alignment. This method allows for aligning the fiber to the center of the meander with sub-micron precision. The response is robust to variations in the angle and height of the fiber, providing an alternative or complement to fiber-to-chip alignment methods based on the back-reflection or transmission measurement.

Abstract: Obtaining the amplitude, phase, and polarization profiles of light beams is essential, with applications spanning metrology, microscopy, astronomy, and optical communication/computing technologies. However, most modern measurement approaches cannot retrieve these parameters easily, often relying on bulky and expensive hardware, or lacking the capability for single-shot sensing. Here, we introduce a compact, snapshot, low-cost, fully vectorial field sensor based on an inkjet-printed nematic liquid crystal droplet array to measure these properties. Polarization and intensity are measured via division-of-wavefront polarimetry, exploiting the droplets' spatially varying birefringence, while the phase is reconstructed by treating each droplet as a microlens in a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor configuration. To demonstrate the system's performance, we characterize aberrated dual-wavelength beams carrying distinct intensity, phase, and polarization information, confirming accurate retrieval of the optical field profiles for both spectral components.

### [7] [Ultrafast Pulse Retrieval from Partial FROG Traces Using Implicit Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08764)
*Abhimanyu Borthakur,Jack Eden Hirschman,Sergio Carbajo*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: A generative diffusion framework is introduced for recovering ultrafast pulses from incomplete FROG data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate characterization of ultrashort laser pulses is vital for scientific and technological progress, yet this task is hindered by the need for high-quality pulse characterization data. In online settings, traditional methods like Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) face challenges due to cost, impracticality, or limitations in the wavelength regime and spectrometer resolution, leading to undersampled FROG traces.

Method: The proposed method utilizes a generative diffusion framework specifically designed to handle the recovery of ultrafast pulse intensity and phase from incomplete and aggressively downsampled FROG measurements.

Result: The diffusion approach demonstrates superior accuracy and stability compared to existing convolutional neural network (CNN) and sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) baselines in the context of FROG-pulse reconstruction, while maintaining efficiency for near real-time deployment.

Conclusion: This work addresses the critical challenge of FROG-based pulse characterization in resource-constrained environments by introducing a novel generative diffusion framework that effectively reconstructs ultrafast pulses from incomplete data, thereby enabling more efficient and reliable pulse measurements in diverse scientific and technological applications.

Abstract: Ultrashort laser pulses enable attosecond-scale measurements and drive breakthroughs across science and technology, but their routine use hinges on reliable pulse characterization. Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) is a leading solution, forming a spectrogram by scanning the delay between two pulse replicas and recording the nonlinear signal spectrum. In online settings, however, dense delay-frequency scans are costly or impractical-especially for long pulses, wavelength regimes with limited spectrometer coverage (e.g., UV), or hardware with coarse resolution, yielding severely undersampled FROG traces. Existing reconstruction methods struggle in this regime-iterative algorithms are computationally heavy, convolutional networks blur fine structure, and sequence models are unstable when inputs are discontinuous or sparse. We present a generative diffusion framework tailored to recover ultrafast pulse intensity and phase from incomplete FROG measurements. Our model infers missing spectro-temporal content with high fidelity, enabling accurate retrieval from aggressively downsampled inputs. On a simulated benchmark of FROG-pulse pairs, the diffusion approach surpasses strong CNN and Seq2Seq baselines in accuracy and stability while remaining efficient enough for near real-time deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生物医学研究需求的增加，非侵入式的生物显微镜技术得到了广泛关注。然而，现有技术在多细胞标本中的成像深度有限，无法满足对复杂动态生物过程的观察需求。因此，提高多细胞标本中的成像深度和分辨率成为一个关键的技术挑战。

Method: 该研究采用了一种两光子斜面平面显微镜，结合高数值孔径单目标高NA检测和多光子平面照照射的方法。通过使用近红外非线性激发和标准玻璃基片固定技术，成功实现了高分辨率的体积成像。

Result: 该显微镜系统在体外实验中表现出优异的性能。其横向分辨率为约300纳米，纵向分辨率为约650纳米，能够在体外实验中实现单分子灵敏度的在 vivo 分子成像。与两光子点扫描技术相比，该系统具有更低的照火强度，能够在更高速率（最高达 3.25 × 10^6 voxels s^-1）下进行体积成像，且能够有效降低光损伤。近红外非线性激发技术显著提升了荧光对比度和体积分辨能力。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种高效、高灵敏度的体积显微镜系统，为观察多细胞生物体内的动态生物过程提供了强有力的技术支持。该技术不仅提高了成像速度和分辨率，还有效降低了光损伤，且无需复杂的样本处理，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: High-numerical-aperture (NA) oblique plane microscopy enables noninvasive fluorescence imaging of subcellular dynamics without requiring radical sample modification. However, performance degrades at depth in multicellular specimens as scattering and refractive-index heterogeneity raise out-of-focus background. We report a two-photon oblique plane microscope that improves resolution at depth by combining high-NA single-objective detection with multiphoton plane illumination. The microscope achieves $\sim\!300$ nm lateral and $\sim\!650$ nm axial resolution, with single-molecule sensitivity in vivo. Compared with two-photon point scanning, the lower illumination NA delivers an order of magnitude lower peak intensity, enabling $>\!5\times$ faster volumetric acquisition (up to $3.25 \times 10^6$ voxels s$^{-1}$) with reduced photodamage. In multicellular contexts, near-infrared nonlinear excitation enhances contrast throughout the illumination depth by $\sim\!2\times$ and restores volumetric resolving power by $>\!2\times$ relative to linear excitation. We demonstrate these capabilities through molecular imaging of epithelial tissue, stem-cell-derived gastruloids, and living fruit fly embryos, including multicolor transcription-factor dynamics, optogenetic subcellular control, and single-mRNA tracking, all using standard glass-based mounting.

Abstract: The stability of optical vortex structures in turbulent environments is critical for their applications in optical communication, quantum information, and structured light technologies. Although topological invariants, such as crossings and linking numbers, are fundamentally invariant, recent studies reveal that their observed values deteriorate considerably in turbulent conditions due to environmental effects. In this study, we introduce an alternative approach based on the geometric stability of three-dimensional singularity line shapes, demonstrating that shape-based tracing of singularities outperforms both topological and spectral methods in turbulence. To test this concept, we propose Flower Beams, a novel class of structured optical fields featuring controllable petal-like singularity morphologies. We construct an 81-element optical alphabet and classify these structures after turbulence using deep learning. Our findings reveal that shape-based tracing achieves classification accuracy exceeding 90% in the weaker turbulence regimes and remains highly competitive even in stronger turbulence, significantly outperforming spectral and topology-based approaches. Experimental results confirm that the predicted shape stability holds in real-world conditions. This study stablishes the shape of the singularities' lines as a scalable and resilient alternative for structured light tracing and transmission, opening new avenues for turbulence-robust-applications.

Abstract: The geometric phase is a fundamental quantum mechanical phenomenon uniquely associated with conical intersections (CI) between potential energy surfaces and serves as a definitive signature of their presence. In this study, we propose a novel spectroscopic approach to directly detect the geometric phase using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) enhanced by strong light-matter interactions within an optical cavity. Focusing on a prototypical pentacene dimer undergoing singlet fission, we model the nonadiabatic wave packet dynamics as it evolves through a CI between electronically excited states. The optical cavity enables dynamic modulation of the coupling between the optical field and molecular vibrational modes, allowing precise control over the wave packet pathways. Importantly, we identify a cancellation in the spectral amplitude, arising from phase differences accumulated along different trajectories, which serves as a clear spectroscopic manifestation of the geometric phase (GP). This cavity-enhanced 2DES framework not only enables direct observation of GP effects but also offers a versatile platform for probing ultrafast nonadiabatic processes. Our results provide fundamental insights into topological effects in molecular dynamics and pave the way for experimental strategies in quantum control, photochemistry, and the design of advanced optoelectronic materials.

Abstract: Exciton condensation--an interaction-driven, macroscopically coherent paired-fermion state--offers the prospect for dissipationless energy transport in solids, akin to that in superconductivity. Although their light effective mass and strong Coulomb binding favour high transition temperatures, convincing demonstrations of pure-exciton condensation have hitherto been limited to cryogenic conditions. Here, we report the direct observation of quasi-equilibrium condensation of dark excitons in monolayer tungsten diselenide at 300 K and ambient pressure. We achieve this by creating nanoscale spacing-graded Stark traps to confine free excitons, setting the finite-size scale, non-resonant off-axis optical injection to control the local density-temperature trajectory, and employing surface plasmon polariton-enhanced microsphere-assisted microscopy to boost dark-exciton emission and directly image first-order spatial coherence with sub-diffraction resolution. We observe a sharp degeneracy threshold and a clear phase transition, evidenced by extended first-order spatial coherence with algebraic decay and a critical exponent consistent with the universal Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless criterion. Identical condensation signatures are observed in over 30 independent samples. Our work establishes a room-temperature excitonic platform for exploring strongly correlated many-body physics and advancing near-dissipationless, coherent quantum technologies.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a microfiber waveguide for temperature and air pressure measurement. To improve mechanical strength of the sensor, a C-shaped fiber is sandwiches between two single mode fibers (SMFs) by fusion splice. The microfiber waveguide is 3D printed between two SMFs to connect two fiber cores by two-photon polymerization technology. Due to multimode property of this printed waveguide, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is obtained. This sensor exhibits a high temperature sensitivity of 361 pm/°C at 25°C to 45°C and a high air pressure sensitivity of 55 pm/kPa from 300hpa to 1000hpa. The MZI sensor features significant advantages such as small size, high stability, and easy fabrication, without the need for complex post-processing, showing great potential and broad application prospects in many sensing applications.

Conclusion: 提出了半自动对齐方法，扩展性好，对光波控制有应用前景。

Abstract: The conjugation of multiple spatial light modulators (SLMs) enables the construction of optical diffractive neural networks (DNNs). To accelerate training, limited by the low refresh rate of SLMs, spatial multiplexing of the input data across different spatial channels is possible maximizing the number of available spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). Precise alignment is required in order to ensure that the same physical operation is performed across each channel. We present a semi-automatic procedure for this experimentally challenging alignment resulting in a pixel-level conjugation. It is scalable to any number of SLMs and may be useful in wavefront shaping setups where precise conjugation of SLMs is required, e.g. for the control of optical waves in phase and amplitude. The resulting setup functions as an optical DNN able to process hundreds of inputs simultaneously, thereby reducing training times and experimental noise through spatial averaging. We further present a characterization of the setup and an alignment method.

Abstract: Mechanical translation of samples along several axes is often required in microscopy, and automated positioning requires motorizing the translation stages. Stepper motors are commonly employed but require specialized driver electronics for reliable operation. Here we describe a low-cost, open-source controller design that drives several stepper motors and implements important safety features, such as monitoring of mechanical limit switches, stall detection, and protective software limits. If rotational encoders in the motors or linear encoders on the stages are available, the controller can monitor the stage position and correct it in a feedback loop. The stages can be controlled with serial commands via USB, or optionally from a remote control box that incorporates a joystick for real-time multi-axis speed control, rotary dials for fine axis positioning, and a display to indicate the stage positions. To ease adoption, we provide driver libraries in Python and C, a driver for the commonly used microscopy control software $μ$Manager, and an example graphical user interface for calibration and testing.

Abstract: Quantum reflection occurs when ultra-cold atoms are incident on a material surface with sufficiently low velocity. The reflecting matter wave can interfere with the incident wave to form a detectable pattern, and this pattern contains information about atom-surface interactions at micrometer scales. We discuss how such an interferometer could be used to probe for anomalous short-range forces that are predicted by some beyond-standard model theories. We compare a simple analytical model for the anomalous phase to numerical solution of both the linear and non-linear Schrodinger equations, finding good agreement. With interactions, the phase does depend on the atomic density, which can be a source of noise. We nonetheless predict that under realistic conditions, the reflection technique can reach sensitivities approaching those obtained with macroscopic objects, and significantly improve the limits on anomalous coupling to atoms.

Abstract: We propose atom interferometers based on quantum droplet (QD), which is also being reported as a superior platform for interferometry. The emphasis has been given to harmonic-oscillator (HO) or ring-shaped potentials. In the HO trap, a Gaussian barrier induces coherent splitting; in the ring, one or two barriers guide the splitting and subsequent recombination. The atom number and relative mean-field interaction strength critically affect the interferometric performance. The transmission-coefficient analysis identifies values of the barrier parameters for the balanced $50:50$ splitting. The post-recombination atom-number imbalance serves as a sensitive indicator of the relative phase between merging daughter QDs. We demonstrate that the HO-based setup may serve as a tilt-meter and target detector, and the ring geometry may be used as a compact QD Sagnac interferometer for rotation sensing.

*Joshua Lin,Bruno Scheihing-Hitschfeld,Thomas Steingasser*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Tunneling rates are determined by false vacuum contributions, but pre-asymptotic behavior can be systematically evaluated using semi-classical methods in the steadyon picture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the factors influencing tunneling rates is crucial, as it is a fundamental mechanism in particle physics and cosmology. Accurate determination of tunneling dynamics is essential for predicting phenomena such as vacuum decay and particle production.

Method: The study employs first-principles path integral analysis within the semi-classical approximation, utilizing the recently developed steadyon picture to evaluate the behavior of tunneling rates in the pre-asymptotic regime.

Result: Systematic evaluation of tunneling rates reveals the role of physical scales and assumptions, facilitating the development of an improved, non-perturbative framework for their computation.

Conclusion: This work advances the theoretical understanding of tunneling dynamics and provides a robust method for evaluating tunneling rates in scenarios where traditional asymptotic approaches are insufficient.

Abstract: When tunneling occurs out of generic initial states, a significant fraction of probability is lost at early times during which the dynamics is governed by excited resonance states. However, first-principles analyses based on path integrals have only captured the leading asymptotic behavior during which the tunneling rate is dominated by the false vacuum contribution. In this work, we discuss the behavior in the pre-asymptotic regime from a first-principles path integral perspective. We demonstrate how the relevant expressions can be evaluated systematically through semi-classical methods in the recently developed steadyon picture. This approach allows one to trace the role of the relevant physical scales, making transparent the underlying assumptions and approximations and offering a clear path to establishing a systematically improvable framework to evaluate tunneling rates non-perturbatively.

Abstract: Recent developments in the understanding of real-time path integrals led to the development of the ``steadyon picture'' for the semi-classical calculation of quantum tunneling rates. We discuss tunneling out of a generic localized initial state in this picture and present its application for the important example of a resonance state in a one-dimensional point particle potential. We find that the steadyon picture indeed reproduces existing results obtained using the WKB method. Our analysis furthermore demonstrates how applying this picture to physical states naturally addresses open conceptual questions regarding this framework. Finally, we perform a numerical study for a specific potential. We demonstrate in particular the existence of regimes in which the tunneling rate is dominated by higher resonances, rather than the false vacuum, as well as their importance.

Abstract: The particle model building of cosmological collider physics often involves boost-breaking bilinear mixing between a heavy particle and the nearly massless inflaton mode. In cosmological correlators, such a mixing is obtained by taking a folded limit of a generic tree graph, which is a special case of degenerate kinematics. In this work, we continue our exploration of massive inflationary amplitudes with a focus on degenerate kinematics. With a suitable change of variables, we derive new differential equations and full analytical solutions for generic tree graphs, making it trivial to take the folded limit and partial-energy limit at a vertex. Our result shows that folded tree graphs generally involve functions of smaller transcendental weights than their nondegenerate counterparts. In particular, the inflaton bispectrum with triple massive exchanges can be expressed in terms of a trivariate Kampé de Fériet function and simpler hypergeometric functions.

Abstract: We develop a variational framework for addressing two-dimensional non-integrable quantum field theories through the exact structure of their integrable counterparts. Concentrating on the $\varphi^4$ Landau-Ginzburg model, we use the analytical Vacuum Expectation Values and Form Factors of local operators in the sinh-Gordon theory as the foundation of a variational ansatz. In this way, we obtain controlled estimates of central physical quantities of the $\varphi^4$ theory - such as the finite-volume ground-state energy and the physical mass as a function of the coupling constant. The strengths of the variational methods are leveraged in combination with the Hamiltonian truncation techniques and the LeClair-Mussardo formula, which also allow to probe the accuracy of the variational approximation varying the system size. Within the weak-coupling regime, a detailed numerical analysis reveals the behaviour of the finite-volume spectrum, the ground-state energy, and the elastic part of the scattering matrix, showing how the rigorous machinery of integrable models can serve as a guiding light into the complex landscape of non-integrable quantum field dynamics.

Abstract: The emergence of the quantum $R$-matrix in the double-scaled SYK model points to an underlying quantum group structure. In this work, we identify the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ as a subalgebra of the chord algebra. Specifically, we construct the generators of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ from combinations of operators within the chord algebra and show that the one-particle chord Hilbert space decomposes into the positive discrete series representations of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$. Using the coproduct structure of the quantum group, we build the multi-particle Hilbert space and establish its equivalence with previous results defined by the chord rules. In particular, we show that the quantum $R$-matrix acts as a swapping operator that reverses the ordering of open chords in each fusion channel while incorporating the corresponding $q$-weighted penalty factors. This action enables an explicit derivation of the chord Yang-Baxter relation. We further explore a realization of the quantum group generators on the quantum disk, and present a novel factorization formula for the bulk gravitational wavefunction in the presence of matter. We further discuss the relation between the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ structure uncovered here and the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{l}(2, \mathbb{R}))$ algebra previously studied from the boundary perspective. Finally, we study the gravitational wavefunction with matter in the Schwarzian regime.

Abstract: The standard, gapped entanglement boundary condition in Chern Simons theory breaks the topological invariance of the theory by introducing a complex structure on the entangling surface. This produces an infinite dimensional subregion Hilbert space, a non-trivial modular Hamiltonion, and a UV-divergent entanglement entropy that is a universal feature of local quantum field theories. In this work, we appeal to the combinatorial quantization of Chern Simons theory to define a purely topological notion of a subregion. The subregion operator algebras are spaces of functions on a quantum group. We develop a diagrammatic calculus for the associated $q$-deformed entanglement entropy, which arise from the entanglement of anyonic edge modes. The $q$-deformation regulates the divergences of the QFT, producing a finite entanglement entropy associated to a $q$-tracial state. We explain how these ideas provide an operator algebraic framework for the entanglement entropy computations in topological string theory \cite{Donnelly:2020teo,Jiang:2020cqo, wongtopstring}, where a large- $N$ limit of the $q$-deformed subregion algebra plays a key role in the stringy description of spacetime.

*Ian Low,Ming-Lei Xiao,Yu-Hui Zheng*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: A new on-shell recursion relation for scattering amplitudes with Nambu-Goldstone bosons and gauged unbroken symmetry is developed. The recursion addresses the issue of gauge interactions breaking Adler's zero condition, which invalidates the standard soft recursion. A 'gauged soft recursion' is introduced that utilizes the soft theorems of gauge bosons and a novel decomposition of amplitudes into gauge-invariant components, partially restoring Adler's zero. The formalism also incorporates internal gauge bosons via angular momentum constraints, enabling the systematic construction of tree-level amplitudes with arbitrary numbers of Goldstone benignes and gauge bosons in both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. Explicit examples are provided to demonstrate the formalism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work is motivated by the need to overcome the challenges posed by gauge interactions in deriving on-shell recursion relations for scattering amplitudes involving Nambu-Goldstone bosons with a gauged unbroken symmetry. The standard soft recursion is invalidated by these interactions breaking Adler's zero condition, necessitating the development of a 'gauged soft recursion' to address this issue.

Method: The approach introduces a novel recursion relation that combines the soft theorems of gauge bosons with a decomposition of amplitudes into gauge-invariant components. This method partially restores Adler's zero condition and incorporates internal gauge bosons via angular momentum constraints, allowing for the systematic construction of tree-level amplitudes with arbitrary numbers of Goldstone bosons and gauge bosons in both Abelian and non-Abelian settings.

Result: The proposed 'gauged soft recursion' successfully addresses the limitation of the standard soft recursion in the presence of gauge interactions. By leveraging the soft theorems of gauge bosons and decomposing amplitudes into gauge-invariant components, the formalism enables the systematic construction of scattering amplitudes with arbitrary numbers of Goldstone bosons and gauge bosons. Explicit examples in both Abelian and non-Abelian theories demonstrate the validity and applicability of the new recursion relation.

Conclusion: This work presents a groundbreaking method for constructing on-shell recursion relations for scattering amplitudes involving Nambu-Goldstone bosons with a gauged unbroken symmetry. The 'gauged soft recursion' developed in this paper represents a significant advancement in the field of theoretical physics, particularly in the study of scattering amplitudes and gauge theories.

Abstract: We present a new on-shell recursion relation for scattering amplitudes involving Nambu-Goldstone bosons with a gauged unbroken symmetry. A central challenge is that gauge interactions break Adler's zero condition for charged scalars, invalidating the standard soft recursion. To overcome this, we introduce a ``gauged soft recursion'' that leverages the soft theorems of the gauge bosons themselves, combined with a novel decomposition of amplitudes into gauge-invariant components where Adler's zero is partially restored. The formalism, which also incorporates internal gauge bosons via angular momentum constraints, enables the systematic construction of tree-level amplitudes with arbitrary numbers of Goldstone bosons and gauge bosons in both Abelian and non-Abelian theories, as we demonstrate with explicit examples.

Abstract: We further develop celestial Mellin amplitudes arXiv:2412.11992 to capture the exchange of particles with spin. For massless external scalar fields, we derive closed-form celestial Mellin amplitudes for a spin-1 and spin-2 exchange$\unicode{x2014}$both massless and massive$\unicode{x2014}$and extract the associated OPE data in the direct-channel. For gauge-boson and graviton exchanges, we identify in the celestial OPE the spin-1 current and the spin-2 stress tensor, together with the boundary gauge boson and graviton. Perturbative time-ordered correlators involving spinning fields can be obtained from those of scalars through the action of differential operators on the external points. In Mellin space these actions become finite-difference (shift) operators in the Mellin variables, which we use to extend our results to arbitrary integer spin.

The $SO(7)$ theory contains a pair of additional graviton (monotone) and non-graviton (fortuitous) cohomologies, whose net contributions cancel in the superconformal index. We show that the quantum-corrected $Q$, inferred from the generalized Konishi anomaly, pairs and lifts these extra cohomologies.

This approach enables robust thermal-state preparation and quantum simulations of open-system dynamics in bosonic and spin-boson models at well-controlled finite temperatures. We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures. We observe that, when the process occurs at a higher temperature, the transfer rate spectrum broadens, with reduced rates at small donor-acceptor energy gaps and enhanced rates at large gaps. We then employ our scheme to study local-temperature effects in a two-mode vibrationally assisted exciton transfer system, where we observe thermally activated interference pathways for excitation transfer.

Abstract: We present a technique for vectorial magnetic sensing using a cold-atom cloud trapped in a magnetic quadrupole. The center of the trapped cloud is determined by absorption imaging and compared for opposite polarities of the quadrupole. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the displacement of the cloud depends on both the field's direction and magnitude. By analyzing this shift under polarity reversal, we infer the two transverse components of a homogeneous external magnetic field relative to the imaging axis, without requiring spectroscopic interrogation. Assuming micron-scale position sensitivity and typical magnetic field gradients, the method enables resolution at the milli-Gauss level. It is compatible with standard cold-atom setups and offers a practical tool for field compensation in magnetically sensitive experimental stages. As such, it establishes a bridge between traditional macroscopic magnetic field probes and atomic-physics-based precision sensors.

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) has emerged as a promising approach for solving NP hard combinatorial optimization problems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, its performance is critically dependent on the selection of the circuit depth a parameter that must be specified a priori without clear guidance. In this paper, we introduce a variant of QAOA called dynamic depth Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (DDQAOA) that resolves the challenge of pre selecting a fixed circuit depth. Our method adaptively expands circuit depth, starting from p = 1 and progressing up to p = 10, by transferring learned parameters to deeper circuits based on convergence criteria. We tested this approach on 100 instances of the Constrained Shortest Path Problem (CSPP) at 10 qubit and 16 qubit scales. Our DDQAOA achieved superior approximation ratios and success probabilities with fewer CNOT gate evaluations than the standard QAOA for p = 3, 5, 10, and 15. In particular, while standard QAOA at p = 15 achieved results close to our approach, it used 217% and 159.3% more CNOT gates for 10 qubit and 16 qubit instances, respectively. This demonstrates the performance and practical applicability of DDQAOA to solve combinatorial optimization problems on near term devices.

Abstract: Solid-state molecular qubits with open-shell ground states have great potential for addressability, scalability, and tunability, but understanding the fundamental limits of quantum coherence in these systems is challenging due to the complexity of the qubit environment. To address this, we develop a random Hamiltonian approach where the molecular $g$-tensor fluctuates due to classical lattice motion obtained from molecular dynamics simulations at constant temperature. Atomistic $g$-tensor fluctuations are used to construct Redfield quantum master equations that predict the relaxation $T_1$ and dephasing $T_2$ times of copper porphyrin qubits in a crystalline framework. Assuming one-phonon spin-lattice interaction processes, $1/T$ temperature scaling and $1/B^3$ magnetic field scaling of $T_1$ are established using atomistic bath correlation functions. Atomistic $T_1$ predictions overestimate the available experimental data by orders of magnitude. Quantitative agreement with measurements at all magnetic fields is restored by introducing a magnetic field noise model to describe lattice nuclear spins, with field-dependent noise amplitude in the range $δB\sim 10\,μ{\rm T}- 1\,{\rm mT}$ for the copper porphyrin system. We show that while $T_1$ scales as $1/B$ experimentally due to a combination of spin-lattice and magnetic noise contributions, $T_2$ scales strictly as $ 1/B^2$ due to low-frequency dephasing processes associated with magnetic field noise. Our work demonstrates the potential of dynamical methods for modeling the open quantum system dynamics of molecular spin qubits.

Abstract: We analyze the distribution of multipartite entanglement in states produced in a one-dimensional random monitored quantum circuit where local Clifford unitaries are interspersed with single-site measurements performed with a probability $p$. This circuit has a measurement-induced phase transition at $p=p_c$, separating a phase in which the entanglement entropy scales with the system size (a volume law state) and one in which it scales with the boundary (an area law state). We calculate the entanglement depth, corresponding to the size of the largest cluster of entangled qubits, finding that it scales as a power law with system size in both the phases. The power law exponent is 1 in the volume law phase ($p < p_c$) and continuously decreases to 0 as $p \to 1$ in the area law phase. We explain this behavior by studying the spatial distribution of entangled clusters. We find that the largest cluster of entangled qubits in these states has a fractal dimension between 0 and 1 and appears to be self-similar. Away from the critical point, this fractal dimension matches the entanglement depth power law exponent.

Abstract: We present an approach for efficiently simulating strongly damped quantum systems subjected to periodic driving, employing a periodic matrix product operator representation of the influence functional. This representation enables the construction of a numerically exact Floquet propagator that captures the non-Markovian open system dynamics, thus providing a dissipative analogue to the Floquet Hamiltonian of driven isolated quantum systems. We apply this method to study the asymptotic heating of a reservoir in spin-boson models, characterizing the deviation from equilibrium conditions. Moreover, we show how a local driving of two qubits can be utilized to stabilize a transient entanglement buildup of the qubits originating from the interaction with a common environment. Our results make it possible to directly study both stationary and transient dynamics of strongly damped and driven quantum systems within a transparent theoretical and numerical framework.

Abstract: Coherent control and braiding of anyons remain central challenges in realizing topologically protected quantum operations. We propose a Ramsey interferometry protocol to directly access the geometric phases associated with anyons in fractional Chern insulators. Our approach employs impurities with individually addressable internal states that bind to the anyons, allowing their adiabatic motion and exchange under full spatial control. By combining Ramsey and spin-echo sequences, the protocol isolates the Aharonov-Bohm and exchange contributions to the total geometric phase, providing an unambiguous probe of anyonic statistics. Our scheme can potentially be implemented in cold-atom quantum simulators as well as in van der Waals heterostructures. Complementary finite-size simulations in non-interacting Chern insulators quantify the system sizes required to faithfully extract geometric phases, highlighting the role of edge effects. Our results establish impurity-based interferometry as a feasible route toward direct anyon braiding experiments in quantum simulators and lay the groundwork for future explorations of non-Abelian braiding and topological quantum control.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum transport of delocalized states in continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) on a one-dimensional lattice containing a single defect. The defect is modeled by assigning complex-valued hopping amplitudes to the edges that connect the site corresponding to the mean position of the initial delocalized state to its nearest neighbors. We find that this single defective site is sufficient to enhance the ballistic spreading of an initially Gaussian wave packet. Extending these results, we implement a time-dependent alternation protocol between two distinct defect configurations, each individually yielding poor propagation of the state. The combination of these two unfavorable configurations improves the transport efficiency of the quantum walker, revealing a manifestation of Parrondo's paradox in CTQWs with delocalized initial states. This study provides new insights into the role of complex-phase defects and time-dependent protocols in CTQWs, demonstrating that the interplay between quantum interference and graph engineering can effectively enhance quantum transport in discrete lattices.

Abstract: We critically explore the applicability of a recently proposed framework to sample the quantum dynamics of a many-body quantum system interacting with light by stochastic trajectories, applying it to the closed and open Tavis-Cummings model (TCM). The stochastic differential equations (SDEs) sample the positive P phase-space representation by analog complex-valued dynamical variables that are linked to the quantum operators. Statistical average over the stochastic trajectories yields the evolution of the quantum mechanical expectation values. However, numerical implementation of these SDEs for the TCM indicates divergent solutions, also known from other phase-space methods. This limits the applicability of the framework to finite propagation times, that are strongly dependent on the physical parameters and initial conditions of the system. We outline the underlying mathematical reason for these divergences and show that their contribution to the averages are, however, essential. To attempt to regularize the divergences, we transform the SDEs to an equivalent set of SDEs with different noise realisations, thereby pushing the valid time boundary. Quantum collapse and revival of the TCM, however, cannot be recovered by the stochastic trajectory approach, pointing to the general difficulty of the applicability of stochastic phase-space sampling methods to systems with strong quantum features.

Motivation: With fault-tolerance as the future of quantum computing, reducing resource requirements for practical applications is essential. Early FTQC systems face stringent constraints, making efficient compilation techniques crucial for enabling quantum advantage in the near term.

Method: We introduced distillation-adaptive qubit layouts and routing techniques, paired with simple greedy heuristics to optimize qubit usage and execution time. Our approach minimizes qubit requirements while maintaining manageable overheads.

Result: Our techniques achieved significant qubit reduction (up to 60%) with only a modest 1.2X increase in execution time, approaching theoretical lower bounds.

Conclusion: This work provides practical solutions for optimizing quantum programs running on early FTQC systems, laying the groundwork for efficient execution as quantum hardware evolves.

Abstract: Fault-tolerance is the future of quantum computing, ensuring error-corrected quantum computation that can be used for practical applications. Resource requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) are daunting, and hence, compilation techniques must be designed to ensure resource efficiency. There is a growing need for compilation strategies tailored to the early FTQC regime, which refers to the first generation of fault-tolerant machines operating under stringent resource constraints of fewer physical qubits and limited distillation capacity. Present-day compilation techniques are largely focused on overprovisioning of routing paths and make liberal assumptions regarding the availability of distillation factories. Our work develops compilation techniques that are tailored to the needs of early FTQC systems, including distillation-adaptive qubit layouts and routing techniques. In particular, we show that simple greedy heuristics are extremely effective for this problem, offering up to 60% reduction in the number of qubits compared to prior works. Our techniques offer results with an average overhead of 1.2X in execution time for a 53% reduction in qubits against the theoretical lower bounds. As the industry develops early FTQC systems with tens to hundreds of logical qubits over the coming years, our work has the potential to be widely useful for optimising program executions.

Abstract: Extending the quantum formulation of [Phys. Rev. X 3, 041003 (2013)] to a more general setting for studying the thermodynamics of information processing including initial correlations, we generalize the second law of thermodynamics to account for information processing in such autonomous systems. We consider a composite quantum system consisting of a principal system, heat bath, memory, and work source, and adopt an autonomous Hamiltonian framework. We derive constraints on the total Hamiltonian that ensure the work source to act as a catalyst preserving its original randomness, namely that the total unitary evolution must have a unitary partial transpose. We show that this requirement is equivalent to the commutativity of operators acting on the joint system of the principal system, bath, and memory, which underlies the Hamiltonian structure. Next, we generalize the quantum speed limit for the joint dynamics of system and memory to the quantum thermodynamic speed limit, from which we obtain a dynamical version of Landauer's bound. More importantly, we also interpret this quantum thermodynamic speed limit in the context of quantum hypothesis testing.

TL;DR: massive quantum systems can be used as tabletop systems to study quantum gravity, but traditional methods face major decoherence problems. This new research introduces a reservoir-engineered method to study how gravity alters the steady-state entanglement between oscillators. It shows that gravitational effects can still be detected even with low mechanical quality factors and are resistant to other forces like Casimir and Coulomb forces, making gravity verification more feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: quantum gravity is a challenging field, and tabletop experiments are crucial for exploring its quantum nature. This paper addresses a key limitation in current methods by introducing an alternative reservoir-engineered approach to study gravity's effects on entanglement.

Method: the study employs reservoir-engineered techniques to quantify the impact of gravity on steady-state entanglement between two mechanical oscillators. The method involves analyzing how gravity modifies entanglement compared to quantum or classical gravitational effects and demonstrating that the scheme can maintain entanglement under sub-optimal mechanical quality factors and noise from other forces.

Result: the protocol shows that quantum gravity can be tested with more relaxed experimental conditions. Specifically, it differentiates between quantum and classical gravity by focusing on entanglement characteristics under low-quality factors and in the presence of non-gravitational couplings, highlighting the scheme's potential for near-term implementation.

Conclusion: this work presents a promising approach for verifying quantum gravity using massive quantum systems as tabletop interfaces. By focusing on entanglement dynamics under realistic experimental conditions, it opens new avenues for advancing quantum gravity research with feasible setups.

Abstract: Massive quantum systems have emerged as compelling tabletop interface-systems for testing the quantum nature of gravity. However, conventional schemes that focus on directly using gravity to induce entanglement suffer from overwhelming environmental decoherence: maintaining entanglement between two oscillators requires an impractically high mechanical quality factor. In this work, we put forward an alternative reservoir-engineered scheme, whose core function is to quantify how gravity modifies (rather than prepares) the steady-state entanglement. Compared to quantum gravity, classical gravity introduces additional dissipative channels, which in turn give rise to distinct entanglement characteristics and thus enable the discrimination between the two types of gravity. Notably, this entanglement difference can still be maintained even when the mechanical quality factor is far below the threshold required by conventional schemes. Moreover, it demonstrates significant robustness against non-gravitational couplings, specifically, those like Casimir and Coulomb forces that are inherent in experimental setups. Our scheme relaxes the experimental requirements for verifying quantum gravity, thereby paving a new path toward its near-term realization.

TL;DR:  //. This paper introduces a novel quantum LiDAR technique using stealth beam steering that is inherently unpredictable, enhancing operational stealth. By leveraging the diffraction of probe photons and their arrival time, multiple targets can be detected in parallel, achieving a 1000-fold improvement in signal-to-noise ratio compared to classical LiDAR. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in quantum sensing, metrology, and secure communications. //


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to improve the stealth and noise resilience of quantum LiDAR, making it more suitable for low-light, high-security scenarios, such as quantum metrology and secure communications. By exploiting the inherent randomness of quantum phenomena, the authors propose a new method to enhance the detection of multiple targets while ensuring operational stealth that is difficult to predict.

Method: The stealth beam steering method described in the paper utilizes the phenomenon of diffraction in a photon pair. When the probe photon passes through a grating, it diffracts in an unpredictable direction due to wavelength randomness. The arrival time of the associated heralding photon, which is delayed by its propagation through a dispersive medium, is used to determine the direction of the diffraction. This method allows for simultaneous detection of multiple targets while maintaining high sensitivity and reducing noise.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that the novel quantum LiDAR system offers superior performance compared to classical LiDAR. By detecting multiple targets in parallel, the system achieves a signal-to-noise ratio that is 1000-fold higher. This significant enhancement underscores the potential of quantum sensors in various advanced applications, such as quantum metrology and secure communication systems, while also addressing the challenge of maintaining stealth in low-light environments.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this paper presents a groundbreaking approach to quantum LiDAR through the development of a stealth beam steering method. The demonstrated capability to detect multiple targets in parallel, coupled with a substantial improvement in signal-to-noise ratio, highlights the profound implications of this innovation for a wide range of fields including quantum metrology and secure communications. This research not only advances the capabilities of LiDAR technology but also sets a new standard for quantum sensing systems requiring high security and reliability.

Abstract: Quantum LiDAR offers noise resilience and stealth observation capabilities in low-light conditions. In prior demonstrations, the telescope pointing was raster-scanned, making the observation direction predictable from the pointing direction. However, while Quantum LiDAR can enable stealth observation, operational stealth is enhanced by inherently unpredictable beam steering. Here, we introduce a novel stealth beam steering method that is fundamentally immune to prediction. In a photon pair, the probe photon undergoes diffraction in an unpredictable direction at a grating due to wavelength randomness. The arrival time of the heralding photon, delayed by propagation through a dispersive medium, enables the determination of the probe photon's diffraction direction. Our method successfully detects multiple targets in parallel, demonstrating up to a 1000-fold enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio compared to classical LiDAR. This breakthrough establishes a new paradigm for quantum-enhanced sensing, with far-reaching implications for quantum metrology, secure communications, and beyond.

Abstract: Negatively charged boron vacancy ($\mathrm{V_B^-}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is the most extensively studied room-temperature quantum spin system in two-dimensional (2D) materials. Nevertheless, the current effective readout of $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ spin states is carried out by systematically optical methods. This limits their exploitation in compact and miniaturized quantum devices, which would otherwise hold substantial promise to address quantum sensing and quantum information tasks. In this study, we demonstrated a photoelectric spin readout technique for $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ spins in hBN. The observed photocurrent signals stem from the spin-dependent ionization dynamics of boron vacancies, mediated by spin-dependent non-radiative transitions to a metastable state. We further extend this electrical detection technique to enable the readout of dynamical decoupling sequences, including the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) protocols, and of nuclear spins via electron-nuclear double resonance. These results provide a pathway toward on-chip integration and real-field exploitation of quantum functionalities based on 2D material platforms.

Abstract: Private remote quantum sensing (PRQS) aims at estimating a parameter at a distant location by transmitting quantum states on an insecure quantum channel, limiting information leakage and disruption of the estimation itself from an adversary. Previous results highlighted that one can bound the estimation performance in terms of the observed noise. However, if no assumptions are placed on the channel model, such bounds are very loose and severely limit the estimation. We propose and analyse a PRQS using, for the first time to our knowledge, continuous-variable states in the single-user setting. Assuming a typical class of lossy attacks and employing tools from quantum communication, we calculate the true estimation error and privacy of our protocol, both in the asymptotic limit of many channel uses and in the finite-size regime. Our results show that a realistic channel-model assumption, which can be validated with measurement data, allows for a much tighter quantification of the estimation error and privacy for all practical purposes.

Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum processors benefits from superconducting qubits that can operate at elevated temperatures and be fabricated with scalable, foundry-compatible processes. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is increasingly being adopted as an industrial standard for thin-film growth, particularly in applications requiring precise control over layer thickness and composition. Here, we report superconducting qubits based on NbN/AlN/NbN trilayers deposited entirely by ALD. By varying the number of ALD cycles used to form the AlN barrier, we achieve Josephson tunneling through barriers of different thicknesses, with critical current density spanning seven orders of magnitude, demonstrating the uniformity and versatility of the process. Owing to the high critical temperature of NbN, transmon qubits based on these all-nitride trilayers exhibit microsecond-scale relaxation times, even at temperatures above 300 mK. These results establish ALD as a viable low-temperature deposition technique for superconducting quantum circuits and position all-nitride ALD qubits as a promising platform for operation at elevated temperatures.

Method: The paper proposes and demonstrates an all-optical scheme for remote preparation of entangled photons. It achieves a 15-dB channel loss and an 82% heralding efficiency. The teleportation-based method is then compared with direct transmission to show a 2.95-fold enhancement in efficiency.

Result: The experiment shows that quantum teleportation-based teleportation offers a significant improvement in transmission efficiency, surpassing the limitations of direct transmission.

Conclusion: This research advances the field of quantum communication by proving the feasibility and benefits of using quantum teleportation with entanglement to mitigate photon loss issues, paving the way for more advanced applications.

Abstract: Photon loss is the biggest enemy in quantum communications. Direct transmission typically results in a small fraction of photons surviving over long distances, hindering advanced applications such as loophole-free Bell tests and device-independent quantum key distribution. Quantum teleportation offers a "disembodied" way of transferring particles through a virtual channel--quantum entanglement--which, in principle, could overcome the photon transmission loss. Experimentally, however, no previous quantum teleportation of single photons has shown a higher survival probability than using direct transmission. To overcome this challenge, here we first propose and demonstrate an all-optical scheme for remote preparation of entangled photons. Through an effective 15-dB channel loss, we realize a heralding efficiency of 82% for event-ready entangled photons. Based on the prior distributed entanglement, we demonstrate that teleportation-based transmission efficiency offers a 2.95-fold enhancement, compared to using direct transmission through the same channel, therefore establishing an unconditional teleportational advantage.

Abstract: We investigate a two-parametric family of one-dimensional non-Hermitian complex potentials with parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. We find that there exist two distinct types of phase transitions, from an unbroken phase (characterized by a real spectrum) to a broken phase (where the spectrum becomes complex). The first type involves the emergence of a pair of complex eigenvalues bifurcating from the continuous spectrum. The second type is associated with the collision of such pairs at the bottom of the continuous spectrum. The first transition type is closely related to spectral singularities (SSs), at which point the transmission and reflection coefficients are divergent simultaneously. The second is associated with the emergence of bound states. In particular, under specific parameter conditions, we construct an exact bound state solution. By systematically exploring the parameter space, we establish a universal relationship governing the number of SSs in these potentials. These findings provide a fundamental theoretical framework for manipulating wave scattering in non-Hermitian systems, offering promising implications for designing advanced optical and quantum devices.

Abstract: Quantum communication and quantum sensing, which leverage the unique characteristics of quantum systems, enable information-theoretically secure communication and high-precision measurement of physical quantities. However, they both face numerous challenges on the path to practical application. Artificial intelligence (AI), as a major technological advancement in current scientific landscape, offers powerful data processing and analytical capabilities, providing new ideas and methods for optimizing and enhancing quantum communication and sensing systems. In quantum communication, AI techniques have greatly improved the performance and security of quantum key distribution, quantum memory, and quantum networks through parameter optimization, real-time feedback control, and attack detection. In quantum sensing, quantum sensing technology enables ultra-high sensitivity detection of physical quantities such as time and magnetic fields. The introduction of AI has opened up new avenues for achieving high-precision and high-sensitivity quantum measurements. With AI, sensor performance is optimized, and measurement accuracy is further enhanced through data analysis. This paper also analyzes the current challenges in using AI to empower quantum communication and sensing systems, such as implementing efficient algorithm deployment and system feedback control under limited computational resources, and addressing complex task environments, dynamically changing scenarios, and multi-task coordination requirements. Finally, this paper discusses and envisions future development prospects in this field.

Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that a set of coherent measurements leverages semi-device-independent (SDI) steering and local randomness generation. To this end, we show that coherent measurements are a necessary resource for demonstrating SDI steering. Conversely, through one-to-one mapping of an SDI steerable correlation to a set of measurements, the coherence of the measurements, in turn, is a necessary and sufficient criterion for SDI steering. This result aligns with the relationship between the standard steering scenario and the measurement incompatibility. Then a nonconvex resource theory for SDI steering is formulated and a nonconvex monotone of the resource is obtained in the two-setting scenario using the above-mentioned one-to-one mapping. Finally, we apply this monotone to the quantification of local randomness from two-qubit states without requiring entanglement to be certified.

Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit SWAP thermal machine -- a streamlined analogue of the four-stroke Otto cycle -- whose working medium comprises inertially moving Unruh-DeWitt qubit detectors, each coupled to a thermal quantum field bath prepared at a different temperature. In the presence of relative motion between the working medium and the thermal baths, we derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) that quantify the trade-off between performance, entropy production, and power fluctuations. Our analysis identifies regimes where relativistic motion leads to stronger violation of classical TURs, previously observed in static quantum setups. In addition, we establish generalized performance bounds for the thermal machine operating as either a heat engine or a refrigerator, and discuss how relativistic motion can enhance their performances beyond the standard Carnot limits defined by rest-frame temperatures.

Abstract: One-dimensional quantum systems that undergo spontaneous symmetry-breaking, having a symmetric (non-degenerate) and a broken-symmetry (doubly-degenerate) phase, have been intensely studied in different branches of physics. In most cases, the spontaneously-broken symmetry is parity. However, it is possible to obtain similar phases in systems without parity symmetry, through an antiunitary symmetry that implies a two-fold symmetry either on momentum or coordinate in the system's classical limit. To illustrate this phenomenon, we use a Kerr parametric oscillator (KPO) with one- and two-photon drives that, despite the breaking of parity symmetry, may have doubly-degenerate levels. Different realizations of squeezed KPOs convey a great deal of attention, as effective Hamiltonians for driven superconducting circuits and the occurrence of degeneracy in such systems could be of practical interest in their application to obtain protected qubits in parity-breaking setups. In addition to this, the reported spectral features strongly indicate the existence of additional symmetries in the system.

Abstract: Quantum computing promises a revolution in information processing, with significant potential for machine learning and classification tasks. However, achieving this potential requires overcoming several fundamental challenges. One key limitation arises at the prediction stage, where the intrinsic randomness of quantum model outputs necessitates repeated executions, resulting in substantial overhead. To overcome this, we propose a novel measurement strategy for a variational quantum classifier that allows us to define the unambiguous quantum classifier. This strategy achieves near-deterministic predictions while maintaining competitive classification accuracy in noisy environments, all with significantly fewer quantum circuit executions. Although this approach entails a slight reduction in performance, it represents a favorable trade-off for improved resource efficiency. We further validate our theoretical model with supporting experimental results.

Abstract: Motivated by the perspective of advanced time-series prediction and exploitation of Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC), we explored the design and implementation of a Hybrid Photonic-Quantum Reservoir Computing (HPQRC) paradigm. It brings together the high-speed parallelism of photonic systems with the quantum reservoir's capacity of modeling complex, nonlinear dynamics, and hence acts as a powerful tool for performing real-time prediction in resource resource-constrained environment with low latency. We have engineered a solution using this architecture to address issues like computational bottlenecks, energy inefficiency, and sensitivity to noise that are common in existing reservoir computing models. Our simulation results show that HPQRC attains much higher accuracy with lower computational time than both classical and quantum-only models. This model is robust when environments are noisy and scales well across large datasets, and therefore is suitable for application on diverse problems such as financial forecasting, industrial automation, and smart sensor networks. Our results substantiate that HPQRC performs significantly faster than traditional architectures and could be a viable and highly scalable platform for actual edge computing systems. Overall, HPQRC demonstrates significant advancements in time series modeling capabilities. In combination with enhanced predictive accuracy with reduced computational requirements, HPQRC establishes itself as an effective analytical tool for complex dynamic systems that require both precision and processing efficiency.

Abstract: We present a tensor network model (TNM) for forecasting nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, bridging quantum many-body methods with classical complex systems. The TNM leverages hierarchical tensor contractions to encode non-Markovian temporal correlations and multiscale structures, enabling compact and interpretable representations of chaotic flows. Using the Lorenz and Rössler systems as benchmarks, we show that the TNM accurately reconstructs short-term trajectories and faithfully captures the attractor geometry. The model enables robust short-term forecasting beyond several Lyapunov times, offering a meaningful horizon for data-driven prediction under chaos. Inhomogeneous parametrization of weight tensors improves convergence and robustness compared to homogeneous parametrization, while scaling with bond dimension reveals saturation beyond modest values, consistent with the low intrinsic dimensionality of the chaotic attractor. This work establishes tensor networks as a universal paradigm for data-driven modeling of complex dynamical systems, offering physically motivated control of model expressivity and opening pathways toward applications in climate systems and hybrid quantum-classical simulations.

Abstract: We study the transversality of the Toffoli gate in a hybrid-code system that employs two quantum error correction codes with special structure. We find that a system using a triorthogonal code with its paired code supports a fully transversal implementation of the Toffoli gate. Through circuit-level analysis, we prove the transversality of the Toffoli operation in this system. Based on this hybrid-code framework, we propose a Toffoli state distillation protocol that does not rely on pre-distilled $\mathbf{T}$-gate magic states. In our approach, the Toffoli state is directly distilled layer by layer within the hybrid-code system using only transversal operations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method uses approximately 50\% fewer qubit resources than previously reported protocols.

Method: Quantum electrodynamics and numerical modeling were used to examine the coupling dynamics under varying nanoscale factors.

Result: Multipolar effects and size-dependent plasmonic coupling significantly impact entanglement generation, especially at close coupling distances, potentially guiding future quantum devices.

Conclusion: While nanophotonics holds promise for quantum technologies, practical challenges related to multipolar effects must be addressed for efficient entanglement-based applications.

Abstract: The generation of quantum entanglement is important for a wide range of quantum technology protocols. In nanophotonics, a promising platform for quantum technologies, entanglement generation via plasmon-mediated coupling in quantum dot qubits is often modeled within the dipole limit, where only dipolar plasmons of the mediating nanoparticle are considered, and the local response approximation, where nonlocal corrections are ignored. However, multipolar effects manifest strongly at coupling distances less than the nanoparticle size, while nonlocal optical effects stem from a size-induced dielectric response. We investigated these two important effects in the generation of two-qubit entanglement mediated by plasmonic coupling. A cavity quantum electrodynamic approach is employed, where the induced plasmonic effects lead to modified transition rates in the dynamics of the coupled quantum dot qubits. We find that multipolar modes and size-dependent damping lead to entanglement decay at small coupling distances and limit mediated entanglement with certain particle sizes. We discuss potential implications of multipolar modes in entanglement-based quantum sensing.

We evaluate Dual Annealing, Constrained Optimization by Linear Approximation, and the Powell Method across noiseless, sampling noise, and two thermal noise models. Our Cost Function Landscape Analysis revealed that the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm angle parameters $γ$ were largely inactive in the noiseless regime. This insight motivated a parameter-filtered optimization approach, in which we focused the search space exclusively on the active $β$ parameters. This filtering substantially improved parameter efficiency for fast optimizers like Constrained Optimization by Linear Approximation (reducing evaluations from 21 to 12 in the noiseless case) and enhanced robustness, demonstrating that leveraging structural insights is an effective architecture-aware noise mitigation strategy for Variational Quantum Algorithms.

Abstract: Simulating molecular systems on quantum computers requires efficient mappings from Fermionic operators to qubit operators. Traditional mappings such as Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev often produce high-weight Pauli terms, increasing circuit depth and measurement complexity. Although several local qubit mappings have been proposed to address this challenge, most are specialized for structured models like the Hubbard Hamiltonian and perform poorly for realistic chemical systems with dense two-body interactions. In this work, we utilize a suite of techniques to construct compact and noise-resilient Fermion-to-qubit mappings suitable for general molecular Hamiltonians. Building on the Generalized Superfast Encoding (GSE) and other similar works, we demonstrate that it outperforms prior encodings in both accuracy and hardware efficiency for molecular simulations. Our improvements include path optimization within the Hamiltonian's interaction graph to minimize operator weight, introduction of multi-edge graph structures for enhanced error detection without added circuit depth, and a stabilizer measurement framework that directly maps logical terms and stabilizers to the Z-basis using Clifford simulation. Applying these methods to simulations of $(H_2)_2$ and $(H_2)_3$ systems yields significantly improved absolute and correlation energy estimates under realistic hardware noise, with further accuracy gains achieved by increasing code distance. We also propose a [[2N, N, 2]] variant of GSE compatible with square-lattice and (quasi-)linear hardware topologies, demonstrating a twofold reduction in RMSE for orbital rotations on IBM Kingston hardware. These results establish GSE as a very attractive mapping for molecular quantum simulations.

Abstract: We describe the generation of correlated photon pairs by means of spontaneous parametric down-conversion of an optical pump in the form of a finite energy Airy beam. The optical system function, which contributes to the propagation of the down-converted beam before being registered by the detectors, is computed. The spectral function is utilized to calculate the biphoton amplitude for finding the coincidence count of the inbound Airy photons in both far-field and near-field configurations. We report the reconstruction of the finite energy Airy beam in the spatial correlation of the down-converted beams in near field scenario. In far field, the coincidence counts resembles the probability density of the biphoton in momentum space, revealing a direct mapping of the anti-correlation of the biphoton momentum. By examining the spatial Schmidt modes, we also demonstrate that longer crystals have tighter real-space correlations, but higher-dimensional angular correlations, whereas shorter crystals have fewer modes in momentum space and broader multimode correlations in position space.

We utilize a 25-mode femtosecond laser-written interferometer with five output channels connected to five input channels to create correlations between consecutive photon arrival events. We have reconstructed the unitary matrix of the chip and have conducted Bayesian analysis to validate the sampler and confirm that the system exhibits behavior distinct from standard boson sampling. We also built a theoretical description of the system based on the transformation of annihilation operators and, using it, delivered the structure of the transmission matrix and the complexity of our boson sampler in terms of a conventional boson sampler. This work advances photonic quantum computing by demonstrating a resource-efficient method to increase sampling complexity, paving the way for scalable demonstration of quantum advantage with single photons.

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is regarded as a crucial physical resource in quantum network communication. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of quantum many-body systems, identifying a multipartite entanglement measure that is both efficiently computable and capable of accurately characterizing entanglement remains a challenging problem. To address these issues, we propose a family of two-parameter multipartite entanglement measures for mixed states, termed unified-entropy concentratable entanglements. Many well-known multipartite entanglement measures are recovered as special cases of this family of measures, such as the entanglement of formation and the concentratable entanglements introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 140501 (2021)]. We demonstrate that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements constitutes a well-defined entanglement monotones, and establish several desirable properties it satisfies, such as subadditivity and continuity. We further investigate the ordering relations of unified-entropy concentratable entanglements and discuss how these quantities can be efficiently estimated on near-term quantum devices. As an application, we demonstrate that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements can effectively distinguish between multi-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and W states. The ordering relations of these entanglement measures are further validated using four-partite star quantum network states and four-qubit Dicke states. Moreover, we find that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements exhibit greater sensitivity than the original concentratable entanglements in detecting certain four-partite star quantum network states.

Abstract: Quantum memory plays a critical role in quantum communication, sensing, and computation. However, studies on quantum memory under a unified benchmarking framework remain scarce. In this paper, we propose a weight-based quantifier as a benchmarking method to evaluate the performance advantage of quantum memory in nonlocal exclusion tasks. We establish a general lower bound for the weight-based measure of quantum memory. Moreover, this measure provides fundamental theoretical bounds for transforming a general channel into an ideal quantum memory. Finally, we present explicit calculations of the weight-based quantifier for various channels, including unitary channels, depolarizing channels, maximal replacement channels, stochastic damping channels, and erasure channels.

Abstract: Quantum noise is known to strongly affect quantum computation, thus potentially limiting the performance of currently available quantum processing units. Even models of quantum neural networks based on variational quantum algorithms, which were designed to cope with the limitations of state-of-the art noisy hardware capabilities, are affected by noise-induced barren plateaus, arising when the noise level becomes too strong. However, the generalization performances of such quantum machine learning algorithms can also be positively influenced by a proper level of noise, despite its generally detrimental effects. Here, we propose a pre-training procedure to determine the quantum noise level leading to desirable optimization landscape properties. We show that an optimal quantum noise level induces an ``equalization'' of variational parameters: the least important parameters gain relevance in the computation, while the most relevant ones lose it. We analyse this noise-induced equalization through the lens of the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix, thus providing a recipe that allows to estimate the noise level inducing the strongest equalization. Then, we report on extensive numerical simulations providing evidence of the beneficial noise effects in the neighborhood of the best equalization, often leading to improved generalization.

Abstract: Entanglement classification of pure multipartite quantum states is a challenging problem in quantum information theory that can be mathematically stated as orbit classification for some given group action on the ambient Hilbert space. The group action depends on the grained classification one expects, the finer-grained one being the classification up to local unitary transformation (LU). In this article, we show how a variational quantum circuit approach can be used to learn entanglement orbits, and we apply our findings to build a classifier for four-qubit states.

Abstract: As established in the seminal work by Berry et al.[1], expanding the time evolution operator using truncated Taylor series (up to some order $K$) makes a good candidate for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics. Here, we adapt the method but present an alternative quantum circuit that maintains an equivalent asymptotic elementary gate cost but has an exponentially reduced number of ancilla qubits. This is realized by utilizing mid-circuit measurements (with early abort-and-restart of circuit execution), and transforming a series of multi-controlled$(H^k)$ to a series of singly-controlled$(H^{k'})$, where $H$ is a linear combination of unitaries and $k, k'$ are integers. The proposed circuit utilizes a total of $\lceil \log(K) \rceil + \lceil \log(L) \rceil +n$ qubits, where $L$ is the number of terms in the Hamiltonian and $n$ is the system qubit size. Our shorter width circuit with mid-measurements protocol is implemented and evaluated using the programming language Guppy[2,3].

TL;DR: The paper describes the application of a PINN-based physics-informed deep learning method to quantum optimal control problems. A neural network architecture is used to model optimal pulses for two-qubit gates, with loss functions based on quantum dynamics, Schrödinger's equation, and the Lindblad equation. The NN generates pulse shapes for high-fidelity quantum operations, successfully avoiding exploding/destructing norms during evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Our information society is moving increasingly toward a quantum-one era, and with this comes the task of reliable quantum computers who must handle gate operations with high fidelity. This paper introduces a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to model quantum optimal control problems, learning high-fidelity control pulses for quantum gates.

Method: We presented a feedforward PINN architecture incorporating quantum physical constraints (Schrödinger and Lindblad equations) into the loss function. The neural network is trained using a sinusoidal activation function and variance-type weight initialization, tailored to the physical system being modeled. We found that by carefully choosing the activation function and initialization, we avoided the issues of exploding/vanishing gradients and the PINN was successful in capturing the underlying patterns of the optimal pulses.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that our PINN-based approach successfully learned solutions to quantum optimal control problems. The NNs, when trained using our custom loss functions, were able to discover high-fidelity two-qubit gate pulses across a range of quantum operations, showing both flexibility and robustness as a physics-informed deep learning method.

Conclusion: We have shown that physics-informed deep learning is a promising approach for solving quantum optimal control problems. The effective use of domain-specific physics constraints in the loss function enables the PINN to discover solutions with high fidelity.

Abstract: Implementing quantum gates on quantum computers can require the application of carefully shaped pulses for high-fidelity operations. We explore the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for quantum optimal control to assess their usefulness in predicting such pulses. Our PINN is a feedforward neural network that utilizes an unsupervised learning approach, whose loss function includes terms that enforce the equations that govern the evolution of a quantum system, measure how close the learned unitary is to the target unitary operation, and ensure state normalization. We use a sinusoidal activation function and adopt variance-type weight initialization, tailored to our activation function. By analyzing the model's performance with important machine learning metrics, we demonstrate that the choice of our architecture is well-suited for this type of problem. We ensure that our network avoids the vanishing and exploding gradients with our relevant choices. We build two different PINNs, one based on the Schrödinger equation and another one based on the Lindblad equation. Our PINNs are able to discover high-fidelity two-qubit gate pulses for a variety of quantum operations, demonstrating its flexibility and robustness.

Abstract: Advancing quantum information processors and building fault-tolerant architectures rely on the ability to accurately characterize the noise sources and suppress their impact on quantum devices. In practice, noise often drifts over time, whereas conventional noise characterization and decoding methods typically assume stationarity or provide only a time-average behavior of the noise. This treatment can result in suboptimal decoding performance. In this work, we present a rigorous analytical framework to capture time-dependent Pauli noise, by exploiting the syndrome statistics of quantum error correction experiments. We propose a sliding-window estimation method which allows us to recover the frequency components of the noise, by using optimal window sizes that we derive analytically. We prove the noise-filtering behavior of sliding windows, linking window size to spectral cutoff frequencies, and provide an iterative algorithm that captures multiple drift frequencies. We further introduce an overlapping window algorithm that enables us to capture rapid multi-frequency noise drifts in a single-pass fashion. Simulations for both phenomenological and circuit-level noise models validate our framework, demonstrating robust tracking of multi-frequency drift. The logical error rate obtained from our estimated models consistently align with the ground-truth logical error rate, and we find suppression of logical errors compared to static error models. Our window-based estimation methods and adaptive decoding offer new insights into noise spectroscopy and decoder optimization under drift using only syndrome data.

Conclusion: 通过基分解映射及其半序和范畴迹，成功扩展了半因果和半局部的等价性到非因子子系统，丰富了量子系统局部性理论。

Abstract: We extend the usual process-theoretic view on locality and causality in subsystems (based on the tensor product case) to general quantum systems (i.e. possibly non-factor, finite-dimensional Von Neumann algebras). To do so, we introduce a primitive notion of splitting maps within dagger symmetric monoidal categories. Splitting maps give rise to subsystems that admit comparison via a preorder called comprehension, and support an adaptation of the usual categorical trace. We show that the comprehension preorder precisely captures the inclusion partial order between Von Neumann algebras, and that the splitting map trace captures the natural notion of Von Neumann algebra trace. As a consequence of the development of these diagrammatic tools, we prove that the known equivalence between semi-causality and semi-localisability for factor subsystems extends to all (including non-factor) subsystems.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography seeks to reconstruct an unknown state from measurement statistics. A finite measurement (POVM) is \emph{pure-state informationally complete} (PSI-Complete) if the outcome probabilities determine any pure state up to a global phase. We study \emph{rank-one} POVMs that are minimally sufficient for this task. We call such a POVM \emph{vital} if it is PSI-Complete but every proper subcollection is not PSI-Complete.
  We prove sharp upper bounds on the size of vital rank-one POVMs in dimension \(n\): the size is at most \(\binom{n+1}{2}\) over \(\mathbb{R}\) and at most \(n^{2}\) over \(\mathbb{C}\), and we give constructions that attain these bounds. In the real case, we further exhibit a connection to block designs: whenever \(w \mid n(n-1)\), an \((n,w,w-1)\) design produces a vital rank-one POVM with \(n + n(n-1)/w\) outcomes. We provide explicit constructions for \(w=2,n-1\), and \(n\).

Abstract: Entanglement, a defining property of quantum mechanics in which two physical subsystems cannot be seen as independent entities, challenges our everyday experience and classical intuition. However, only such strong quantum correlations enable quantum technologies, including quantum computing or communication, while revealing the limits of our classical worldview by violating local realism. Given its importance in modern quantum science, we present this tutorial addressing the questions: What is entanglement, how does it differ from classical correlations, and how can it be experimentally verified? Using celebrated examples, such as Schrödinger's cat, we highlight the distinction between classical and quantum correlations and illustrate the definition of entangled and separable states. We review entanglement criteria by discussing Heisenberg-type uncertainty relations for continuous variables and the CHSH inequality for discrete systems. Focusing on concepts of quantum correlations and operational entanglement witnesses, we provide accessible tools and illustrative examples aimed at demystifying entanglement for a broad readership.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is driven by the search for fault-tolerant quantum computing methods, leveraging topological systems for robust qubit operations and universal quantum computation.

Method: The method involves formulating the quantum compiling problem as a mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem to design braiding sequences for quantum gates in topological systems, specifically using Ising anyons.

Result: The framework successfully models the task of compiling quantum gates in topological systems, and an explicit example of constructing a controlled-NOT gate is provided, demonstrating the approach's applicability.

Conclusion: This work advances quantum computing by providing a practical methodology for synthesizing quantum gates using topological systems, potentially leading to scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computing implementations.

Abstract: We introduce the Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming framework for the quantum compilation problem and apply it in the context of topological quantum computing. In this setting, quantum gates are realized by sequences of elementary braids of quasiparticles with exotic fractional statistics in certain two-dimensional topological condensed matter systems, described by effective topological quantum field theories. We specifically focus on a non-semisimple version of topological field theory, which provides a foundation for an extended theory of Ising anyons and which has recently been shown by Iulianelli et al., Nature Communications {\bf 16}, 6408 (2025), to permit universal quantum computation. While the proofs of this pioneering result are existential in nature, the mixed integer programming provides an approach to explicitly construct quantum gates in topological systems. We demonstrate this by focusing specifically on the entangling controlled-NOT operation, and its local equivalence class, using braiding operations in the non-semisimple Ising system. This illustrates the utility of the Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming for topological quantum compilation.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We construct a classical oracle proving that, in a relativized setting, the set of languages decidable by an efficient quantum verifier with a quantum witness (QMA) is strictly bigger than those decidable with access only to a classical witness (QCMA). The separating classical oracle we construct is for a decision problem we coin spectral Forrelation -- the oracle describes two subsets of the boolean hypercube, and the computational task is to decide if there exists a quantum state whose standard basis measurement distribution is well supported on one subset while its Fourier basis measurement distribution is well supported on the other subset. This is equivalent to estimating the spectral norm of a "Forrelation" matrix between two sets that are accessible through membership queries.
  Our lower bound derives from a simple observation that a query algorithm with a classical witness can be run multiple times to generate many samples from a distribution, while a quantum witness is a "use once" object. This observation allows us to reduce proving a QCMA lower bound to proving a sampling hardness result which does not simultaneously prove a QMA lower bound. To prove said sampling hardness result for QCMA, we observe that quantum access to the oracle can be compressed by expressing the problem in terms of bosons -- a novel "second quantization" perspective on compressed oracle techniques, which may be of independent interest. Using this compressed perspective on the sampling problem, we prove the sampling hardness result, completing the proof.

*Andrés Ledesma,Karo Michaelian*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper suggests that life on Earth-like planets arises from photon dissipative structures in their atmospheres, which are more likely to form on F, G, and high-Mars-like K-type stars but not on low-Mars-like K or M stars. The authors propose biosignatures linked to photon dissipation and life origin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of life origin is a central goal in astrobiology. This paper explores the role of thermodynamic and photon interaction principles in such a process.

Method: Mathematical modeling integrating thermodynamics, photon interaction, and atmospheric dynamics was used to simulate the formation and evolution of dissipative structures on candidate stars. Computer simulations of stellar emission spectra and atmospheric conditions were also conducted.

Result: The model predicts that planets orbiting stars of types F, G, and high-Mars-like K are more likely to exhibit life-inducing features than others. The paper suggests that biosignatures tied to photon dissipation can serve as indicators of life in distant exoplanets.

Conclusion: The study posits that the thermodynamic imperative for photon dissipation is key in life's origin, with the most promising environments being exoplanets similar to Earth's. The findings emphasize the importance of considering energy balance and photon flux in astrobiological studies.

Abstract: The thermodynamic dissipation theory for the origin of life asserts a thermodynamic imperative for the origin of life, suggesting that the fundamental molecules of life originated as self-organized molecular photon dissipative structures (chromophores or pigments) that proliferated over the ocean surface to absorb and dissipate into heat the Archean solar soft UV-C (205-285 nm) and UV-B light ($<$320 nm) of our G-type star. Shorter wavelength hard UV-C light ($<$205 nm) may, depending on atmospheric conditions, have reached Earth's surface and ionized and dissociated or otherwise degraded these carbon-based pigment molecules (as probably occurred on Mars after losing most of its atmosphere). Here we assess the possibility for an abiogenesis of life similar to ours through molecular photon dissipative structuring on planets similar to early Earth but orbiting different star types at distances normalized to the solar constant. Emission spectra of star types are analyzed to determine the ratio of integrated photon fluxes in the soft UV-C wavelength (dissipative structuring) to hard UV-C wavelength (degradation) regions. Our analysis suggests that star types favorable to the dissipative structuring of life, potentially evolving towards complex life forms such as bacteria, are only the F, G and high mass K-types, with intelligent life only possible on G-type stars. Low mass K and M-type stars are highly unlikely to harbor life. Biosignatures related to the thermodynamic imperative of photon dissipation are proposed.

Abstract: Protein nanoclustering is a characteristic feature of their activated state and is essential for forming numerous subcellular structures. The formation of these nanoclusters is highly dependent on a series of post-translational modifications, such as mono-and multi-phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of residues. We theoretically simulate how a protein can be either mono-or multi-phosphorylated on several residues in functional nanoclusters, depending on effective biophysical parameters (diffusion, dwell time, etc.). Moving beyond a binary view of phosphorylation, this approach highlights the interplay between mono-and multi-phosphorylation, the cooperative effects generally associated with multi-phosphorylation networks, and stresses the role of phosphatases in transforming graded phosphorylation signals into almost switch-like responses. The results are discussed in light of experiments that probe the distribution of phospho-residues.

Abstract: Deploying nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale quantum sensors for condensed matter and materials physics requires placing the NV centers close to the sensing target. One solution is to fabricate diamond nanostructures and integrate them with materials and devices. However, diamond etching and ion milling can introduce subsurface damage and surface defects that degrade the charge stability and spin coherence of NV centers near the surface. Here we report a procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes, and we show that this fabrication scheme preserves the optical and spin properties of state-of-the-art shallow NV center quantum sensors, within nanometers of the diamond surface, while providing significant photonic enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate a pick-and-place transfer method, which enables integration with diverse sensing targets.

Conclusion: 这表明纯涨 Kohl效应可能不会导致传统意义上的Anderson局部化，而是在开放系统中通过纯相位相干机制实现临界性。该研究为理解量子霍尔效应的机制提供了新的理论视角和实验依据。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that static disorder is indispensable to the integer quantum Hall effect, underpinning both quantized plateaus and the plateau-plateau transition. We show that pure dephasing, without elastic disorder, is sufficient to generate the same $θ$ driven criticality. Starting from a Keldysh formulation, we derive an open system nonlinear $σ$ model (NL$σ$M) for class A with a topological $θ$ term but no Cooperon sector, and we demonstrate that nonperturbative instantons still govern a two parameter flow of $(σ_{xx},σ_{xy})$. Evaluating $θ$ in a dephasing quantum anomalous Hall setting, we predict a quantum Hall critical point at $σ_{xy}=1/2$ with finite $σ_{xx}$ the hallmark of the integer quantum Hall universality class realized without Anderson localization. Boundary driven simulations of the Qi_Wu_Zhang model with local dephasing confirm this prediction and provide an experimentally aligned protocol to extract $(σ_{xx},σ_{xy})$ from Hall potential maps. By establishing dephasing as a self contained route to Hall criticality, our framework reframes plateau physics in open solid state and cold atom platforms and offers practical diagnostics for topological transport in nonunitary matter.

Motivation: The study aims to investigate how mechanical bending due to differential heating currents affects electrical properties of a misfit layered compound, possibly revealing insights into the role of surface adsorption in electrical behavior.

Method: In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the device under study, measuring electrical properties and analyzing surface adsorption.

Result: The presence of a nano-sized gap facilitated mechanical bending, leading to a high intrinsic voltage influenced by the gap size, vacuum conditions, and heating current history. Adsorption of molecules was identified as a key factor.

Conclusion: Electrical properties in high vacuum can be significantly influenced by surface adsorption and mechanical features such as nano-gaps, suggesting that surface interactions play a crucial role in electrical behavior under such conditions.

Abstract: In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has become an important technique to study dynamic processes at highest spatial resolution and one branch is the investigation of phenomena related with electrical currents. Here, we present experimental results obtained from a peculiar in-situ TEM device, which was prepared with the aim to analyze the relationship between (thermo)electric properties and specific crystal orientations of a misfit layered compound. The formation of a nano-sized gap at a grain boundary facilitated a precisely controllable mechanical bending of the device by application of differential heating currents. The devices' electrical properties were found to be substantially influenced by the gap, leading to a high intrinsic voltage. This voltage additionally depends on the vacuum environment and on the history of applied heating currents. These findings are largely attributed to the presence of adsorbed molecules within the gap region. The electrical in-situ TEM studies of this work illustrate that interior surfaces can strongly influence electrical properties even under high vacuum conditions.

Abstract: We show that the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of electrons is dynamically induced by chiral phonons. The induced OAM originates from the adiabatic evolution in which electrons dynamically acquire Berry phase. By introducing a tight-binding model with p orbitals on a honeycomb lattice, we show a microscopic picture that chiral phonons modulate orbital overlaps of electrons, and calculate the generated OAM, whose sign depends on phonon chirality. We then construct an effective model for valley phonons with different phonon pseudoangular momenta (PAM) and identity their distinct intervalley-scattering channels. Our model obeys the selection rule between phonons and electrons with the orbital degree of freedom. Extending this framework to d-orbital electrons, our model is applied to describe the induced OAM in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Our results reveal a direct lattice-OAM transfer mechanism that emerges even in materials with weak spin-orbital coupling, opening a new promising way for orbitronics applications.

Abstract: We investigate orbital current induced effects arising from the orbital Hall effect in light-metal/ferromagnet bilayers. Thin films of Ti in ohmic contact with Ni were studied using second-harmonic longitudinal and transverse voltage measurements under an applied a.c. current. From these signals, we extract the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). Insertion of a Cu interlayer between the Ni/Ti interface leads to an enhancement of both OHT efficiency and UOMR compared to both Ni/Ti and Ni/Cu bilayers. Furthermore, systematic variation of Ti thickness reveals that both OHT efficiency and UOMR increase with increasing Ti thickness, indicating that the observed phenomena predominantly originate from the bulk orbital Hall effect rather than purely from interfacial mechanisms and Lowering the temperature leads to a clear reduction in both the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). The nearly linear and correlated temperature dependence of both parameters suggests a common underlying mechanism, namely, the orbital Hall effect in the light-metal layer, which governs both the generation of orbital current and its subsequent influence on the ferromagnet through orbital torque and orbital magnetoresistance.

Abstract: We investigate spin- and orbital-to-charge conversion phenomena in nonmagnetic materials with broken inversion symmetry, treating the contributions from the Hall effect and the Rashba-Edelstein effect on an equal footing. We develop a general formalism for this interconversion based solely on macroscopic observables. The theory is validated through a case study of ferroelectric GeTe, where we find that the effective Rashba parameter obtained is smaller than previously reported values for the same material. Incorporating these parameters into a drift-diffusion model, we show that the generated charge current is primarily governed by the Rashba-Edelstein effect, rather than by the spin or orbital Hall effects. Our work redefines the spin- and orbit-to-charge interconversion coefficients in terms of directly measurable observables, encouraging the community to revisit these processes in other quantum materials lacking inversion symmetry.

TL;DR: Bilayer graphene (BLG) tunneling conductance is enhanced at hole doping and exhibits asymmetric resonance behavior when subjected to vertical electric fields. The conductance is sensitive to gate voltage changes. Theory and experiment match.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates electronic properties of BLG under various conditions and their dependence on doping and electric fields, which could lead to applications in electronic devices.

Method: The research employs experimental measurements of tunneling conductance in devices with BLGs separated by insulators and through theoretical modeling incorporating electrostatics, quantum capacitance, and gap dynamics.

Result: Experiments show that at small bias voltages and with twist angles less than 1°, tunneling conductance depends on energy and momentum conservation. Hole doping increases conductance, while dual-gated BLGs exhibit asymmetric tunneling resonances with strong gate voltage sensitivity.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into the interplay between band structure, doping, and external fields in BLG, revealing mechanisms you mentioned.

Abstract: Tunneling conductance between two bilayer graphene (BLG) sheets separated by 2 nm-thick insulating barrier was measured in two devices with the twist angles between BLGs less than 1°. At small bias voltages, the tunneling occurs with conservation of energy and momentum at the points of intersection between two relatively shifted Fermi circles. Here, we experimentally found and theoretically described signatures of electron-hole asymmetric band structure of BLG: since holes are heavier, the tunneling conductance is enhanced at the hole doping due to the higher density of states. Another key feature of BLG that we explore is gap opening in a vertical electric field with a strong polarization of electron wave function at van Hove singularities near the gap edges. This polarization, by shifting electron wave function in one BLG closer to or father from the other BLG, gives rise to asymmetric tunneling resonances in the conductance around charge neutrality points, which result in strong sensitivity of the tunneling current to minor changes of the gate voltages. The observed phenomena are reproduced by our theoretical model taking into account electrostatics of the dual-gated structure, quantum capacitance effects, and self-consistent gap openings in both BLGs.

*Yan Li,Ya-Rong Xia,Ruo-Xia Yao,S. Y. Lou*

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new type of solitons called Painlevé solitons, which result from the interaction between Painlevé waves and solitons in integrable systems. Analogous to elliptic solitons, Painlevé solitons can be seen as solitons moving through a Painlevé wave background. The authors use a novel symmetry decomposition method, leveraging nonlocal residual symmetries, to construct extended Painlevé II solitons for the KdV equation and extended Painlevé IV solitons for the Boussinesq equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to deepen the understanding of soliton interactions and their relationships with Painlevé waves, which are significant in nonlinear wave phenomena. By extending the concept of solitons, the authors aim to provide new tools and insights for analyzing complex nonlinear systems in fields such as fluid dynamics and optics.

Method: The method employed in this paper involves advanced symmetry analysis and the application of nonlocal residual symmetries to decompose and construct the new types of solitons. This approach allows for the explicit derivation of Painlevé II and Painlevé IV solitons for the KdV and Boussinesq equations, respectively.

Result: The paper successfully demonstrates the existence and construction of extended Painlevé II solitons for the KdV equation and extended Painlevé IV solitons for the Boussinesq equation. This achievement contributes to the theoretical framework of soliton interactions and provides a foundation for further research into nonlinear wave phenomena.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this study represents a significant advancement in the study of soliton interactions and their connections with Painlevé waves. The development of extended Painlevé II and IV solitons for specific equations not only enriches the existing knowledge of soliton theory but also opens new avenues for exploring similar phenomena in other nonlinear systems.

Abstract: This letter introduces the novel concept of Painlevé solitons -- waves arising from the interaction between Painlevé waves and solitons in integrable systems. Painlevé solitons may also be viewed as solitons propagating against a Painlevé wave background, in analogy with the established notion of elliptic solitons, which refer to solitons on an elliptic wave background. By employing a novel symmetry decomposition method aided by nonlocal residual symmetries, we explicitly construct (extended) Painlevé II solitons for the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and (extended) Painlevé IV solitons for the Boussinesq equation.

Conclusion: 该研究进了一步理解量子纠缠与量子涨落的本质问题，提出了贝肯斯坦界与GUP间的对应理论，为探索量子纠缠与引力的深层联系提供了新的思路。

Abstract: We develop a fully expectation--value formulation of the GUP/Bekenstein--bound (BEB) correspondence, building on \cite{Ali:2024tbd,Ali:2022ckm,Ali:2022ulp}. Using Dirac's commutator--Poisson equivalence, the BEB supplies an information backreaction on the GUP--deformed bracket; at saturation the residual uncertainty in a sector cancels, enabling \emph{operational} simultaneity of conjugate expectations and resolving the EPR tension without hidden variables. A single self-consistency then fixes intrinsic confinement scales: the full (linear$+$quadratic) GUP reproduces the hydrogen Bohr radius (electron) and the proton charge radius (hydrogen nucleus). The same correspondence predicts an information--controlled crossover from a short--distance complex (evanescent) regime to an emergent real (Lorentzian) regime, with a symmetry flow from complex $SU(4)$ frames to $SO(1,3)$; under scale transmutation the short--distance $SU(4)$ is repurposed as the Pati--Salam $SU(4)_c$. Incorporating exterior--field entropy at horizons defines an effective Planck constant consistent with generalized--entropy extremality, tying entropy--area physics directly to the GUP at the expectation level.

TL;DR: A new computational scheme for solving the inhomogeneous Sasaki-Nakamura equation in the context of black hole perturbation theory is presented, overcoming the need for an additional radial integration step and showing excellent agreement with literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving the computational methods for black hole perturbation theory, particularly for gravitational waveforms from compact and extended sources, is motivated by the importance of these phenomena in gravitational wave astronomy.

Method: The research employs a novel integration by parts approach to modify the Sasaki-Nakamura (SN) formalism. This method eliminates an extra radial integration step that is typically required when using the Green's function method to solve for the inhomogeneous solution in the SN formalism.

Result: The proposed scheme is validated through comparisons with existing literature. The method achieves efficient computation of gravitational waveforms within the SN formalism for both compact and extended sources, performing comparably to existing methods without requiring special optimizations.

Conclusion: The integration by parts-based scheme for solving the inhomogeneous SN equation represents a significant advancement in the field of black hole perturbation theory, making it more efficient and versatile for different types of source scenarios.

Abstract: In linear perturbation theory for Kerr black holes, there are two equivalent formalisms, namely the Teukolsky and the Sasaki-Nakamura (SN) formalism. Typically, one defaults to the Teukolsky formalism, especially when calculating extreme mass ratio inspiral waveforms, and uses the SN formalism when dealing with extended sources, as it offers superior convergence when employing the Green's function method for calculating the inhomogeneous solution. In this work, we present a new scheme for solving the inhomogeneous SN equation, based on integration by parts, that eliminates the extra radial integration step required in the standard formulation to construct the source term for convolution with the SN variable. Our approach enables efficient computations of gravitational waveforms within the SN formalism in all cases, from compact to extended sources. We validate our scheme and code implementation against the literature and find excellent agreement, achieving comparable performance without employing any special optimization techniques.

Abstract: We present an analytical and numerical investigation of the quasinormal excitation factors of ultracompact horizonless objects. These systems possess long lived quasinormal modes with extremely small imaginary parts, originating from the effective cavity between the photon sphere and the object's interior. We show that the excitation of such modes is strongly suppressed, scaling with the imaginary part of their frequency, and therefore they contribute to the waveform only at very late times. This hierarchy naturally explains the structure of echo signals: the prompt ringdown is dominated by standard light ring modes, the early echoes arise from moderately damped cavity modes, and only the latest echoes are governed by long lived modes. Based on this, we propose a practical ringdown waveform model based on a superposition of ordinary black hole quasinormal modes and cavity modes, which captures the complexity of the ringdown of horizonless ultracompact objects. We further demonstrate that the combination of small excitation factors and weak damping enhances the robustness of long lived modes against localized perturbations, in contrast to the spectral instabilities affecting standard black hole quasinormal modes. Finally, we extend the analysis of greybody factors to exotic compact objects and wormholes, showing that they remain stable under small deformations of the effective potential and thus represent robust observables. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding excitation, stability, and echoes in ultracompact horizonless objects, with direct implications for their spectral properties and gravitational wave signatures.

Motivation: Exploring black hole perturbations mathematically using Heun equations and their singularities.

Method: Frobenius power-series solutions near singularities, cline concept for organizing singular points, and Möbius transformations.

Result: Derivation of scalar perturbation solutions for a 7-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole and calculation of static scalar tidal Love numbers.

Conclusion: Cline structures reveal Möbius invariance in black hole perturbations, simplifying problem-solving in this area.

Abstract: We revisit black hole perturbations through Heun differential equations, focusing on Frobenius power-series solutions near regular singularities and their connection formulas. Central to our approach is the notion of a cline in the complex plane, which organizes singular points of the differential equations and remain invariant under Möbius transformations. Building on the cline structure we identified in black hole horizons, we carry out a systematic reduction and relocation of poles in the differential equation to obtain explicit representations of the solutions. We illustrate our approach by extracting the scalar perturbation solutions for the 7-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole and deriving the static scalar tidal Love numbers. These results suggest that clines expose a Möbius-invariant order within black hole perturbations, rendering black hole perturbation problems remarkably tractable.

Abstract: We model the general relativistic interaction of a small hyperelastic sphere with a Schwarzschild black hole as it follows an initially marginally-bound orbit through a close encounter. While the interaction reveals effects that are encoded by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) multipolar equations through quadrupole order, the calculation is made using an independent general relativistic finite element scheme that we described earlier (Phys.~Rev.~D 108(8):084020, October 2023). The finite element calculation is done in Schwarzschild coordinates, following a large and scalable number of mass elements in interaction with each other through elastic forces derived from a potential energy function and with the spacetime geometry. After the fact, we analyze the dynamics using a local Fermi coordinate system, computing (1) the deviation of the center of mass of the body relative to the initial marginally-bound orbit, (2) changes in orbital and spin angular momenta, and (3) the decrease in orbital energy and accompanying deposition of energy into internal elastic dynamics. The interaction leads to the capture of the small body into a highly eccentric orbit ($e \simeq 0.99998$ in a sample calculation).

Result: 主要结果包括：1. 证明了在子极 Kerr 外区域的广义外区域时空上，高频解到捕获频率的能量是有限的；2. 该结果还被推广到仅与其相关度量 C^1 接近的静态对称度量；3. 显示了几类近似子极 Kerr 度量可能具有稳定捕获的光子轨道，表明 ILED 估计并不适用这类度量。

Conclusion: 该研究在广义相对论和时空稳定性方面取得了重要进展。通过消除对传统 ILED 估计的依赖，提供了更一般性和更强大的结果，为进一步研究极端时空上的解能量行为开辟了新途径。

Abstract: On the full range of sub-extremal Kerr exterior spacetimes we give a new proof of energy boundedness for high-frequency projections of solutions to the wave equation onto trapped frequencies. A key feature of the new estimate is that it circumvents the use of an integrated local energy decay (ILED) statement. As an illustration of the robustness of the estimate, we use it to establish energy boundedness for solutions to the wave equation on stationary and axisymmetric metrics which are merely $C^1$ close to a sub-extremal Kerr spacetime. We show explicitly that such perturbed metrics may possess stably trapped null geodesics, and thus one does not expect ILED statements to hold.

Conclusion: r^{-3}衰减的曲率是基础几何边界，统一了引力和电磁场的红外行为，揭示了记忆效应的根源，并通过数值模拟验证了结果。

Abstract: We identify the $r^{-3}$ curvature-decay rate as a universal geometric threshold separating compact from non-compact perturbations of Laplace-type operators on asymptotically flat manifolds. For the coupled Einstein--Maxwell system, we prove that the linearized operator $\mathcal{L}$ is essentially self-adjoint and that curvature and field strengths decaying faster than $r^{-3}$ act as relatively compact perturbations, while decay exactly at $r^{-3}$ places $0\inσ_{\mathrm{ess}}(\mathcal{L})$ through delocalized zero modes. This threshold mechanism unifies the infrared behavior of spin-1, spin-2, and mixed spin-$(1\oplus2)$ fields, linking the onset of spectral delocalization with the appearance of gravitational and electromagnetic memory. Finite-difference simulations corroborate the analytic scaling and reproduce the characteristic quadrupolar and dipolar sky maps predicted for the coupled memory fields. These results demonstrate that curvature decay at $r^{-3}$ constitutes a fundamental geometric boundary underlying infrared universality in gauge and gravitational theories, providing a spectral counterpart to the asymptotic-symmetry and soft-theorem formulations of memory.

Motivation: Understanding physical phenomena in curved spacetime is crucial for astrophysics and cosmology, as curved spacetime affects observations such as neutron stars and early universe physics.

Method: The paper uses Riemann-normal coordinates to develop thermal field theory in curved spacetime and calculates specific thermodynamic observables to demonstrate curvature corrections.

Result: The study successfully extends thermal field theory to curved spacetime and explicitly calculates the effects of curvature on thermodynamic observables.

Conclusion: Extending thermal field theory to curved spacetime provides a new tool for studying physical phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology, particularly where spacetime curvature is significant.

Abstract: Thermal field theory is an essential tool for comprehending various physical phenomena, including astrophysical objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, as well as the early stages of the universe. Nonetheless, the traditional thermal field theory formulated in Minkowski spacetime is not capable of considering the effects originating from the curved spacetime. These effects are crucial for both astrophysical and cosmological observations, making it essential to extend the domain of thermal field theory to curved spacetimes. This article's primary focus is to explore the extension of thermal field theory to curved spacetimes and its implications. We employ Riemann-normal coordinates to describe thermal field theories in curved spacetime, and we also calculate several thermodynamic observables to demonstrate the curvature corrections explicitly.

Conclusion: 只有当质量函数仅取决于物面坐标时，Vaidya度量才能光滑匹配。否则，其表示无界且包含内部热流。

Abstract: We prove that there can not be a smooth matching of the Generalized Vaidya metric with an exterior Schwarzschild/Vaidya patch across a finite boundary hypersurface unless the mass function is a function of the null coordinate alone. By explicitly deriving the extrinsic curvature components, we show that for $\partial m / \partial r \neq 0$ one has a discontinuity in the curvature and induces a surface stress-energy tensor, corresponding to a thin shell of matter. This discontinuity also appears in the geometric invariant $\mathcal{K} = K_{ab}K^{ab}$ and in the Kodama current, indicating a mismatch in quasi-local energy flux across the boundary. The analysis of timelike geodesics leads to the same condition, reinforcing that the generalized Vaidya geometry with $\partial m / \partial r \neq 0$ cannot represent a consistent stellar interior bounded by a regular surface. We therefore note that the generalized Vaidya spacetime should be interpreted as an unbounded geometry with intrinsic heat flux rather than a viable bounded source.

TL;DR: The paper explores inflationary physics beyond General Relativity by proposing f(Q, L_m) gravity models in symmetric teleparallel geometry. They derive expressions for scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio in both linear and non-minimal coupling scenarios, finding that while the linear model fits Planck constraints for positive parameters, the nonlinear model aligns better with data but for negative parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing beyond General Relativity's inflationary universe explanation is crucial for resolving late-time cosmic acceleration conundrums. This paper aims to develop alternative gravitational frameworks that address both early and late universe dynamics.

Method: The study employs f(Q, L_m) gravity based on symmetric teleparallel geometry, formulating slow-roll dynamics and deriving analytical predictions for key cosmological parameters (n_s, r) in two distinct coupling models.

Result: The linear coupling model (-a Q + 2 L_m + β) aligns with observational constraints when a and β are positive. Conversely, the nonlinear model (-a Q + (2 L_m)^2 + β) where a and β are negative offers better concordance with data.

Conclusion: f(Q, L_m) gravity presents distinct inflationary regimes, offering a competitive alternative to GR without the limitations of its theoretical framework.

Abstract: Cosmological inflation remains a key paradigm for explaining the earliest stages of the Universe, yet the theoretical limitations of General Relativity (GR) motivate the development of alternative formulations capable of addressing both early and late cosmic acceleration. In this work, we investigate cosmological inflation within the $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity framework based on symmetric teleparallel geometry, where the non-metricity scalar $Q$ couples directly to the matter Lagrangian. We formulate the slow-roll dynamics and derive analytical predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in both linear and nonlinear non-minimal coupling models, assuming a power-law inflaton potential. Our findings show that the linear case, $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})=-αQ + 2\mathcal{L}_{m}+β$, becomes compatible with Planck+BK15+BAO constraints for positive $α$ and $β$, producing narrow viable contours in parameter space. In contrast, the nonlinear model, $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})=-αQ+(2\mathcal{L}_{m})^{2}+β$, achieves observational viability only for negative $α$ and $β$, and its predictions predominantly fall inside the $68\%$ confidence region of joint data. These results demonstrate that $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity produces distinct inflationary regimes, providing a highly competitive alternative to GR.

Abstract: Motivated by a geometric understanding of the angular velocity of a Kerr black hole in terms of a quasi-conformal map that describes a 2d Beltrami fluid flow, a new way to construct initial data sets for binary rotating black holes by prescribing the angular velocities of the two black holes at their horizons is discussed. A set of elliptic equations with prescribed Dirichlet boundary conditions at the horizons and at spatial infinity is established for constructing the initial data. To explore the dynamics encoded in these initial data, we consider the conformally flat three-metric case and numerically evolve it using the BSSN code for two co-rotating and counter-rotating black holes with angular velocities prescribed at the horizons. When the angular velocities are non-uniform and deviate from a constant value at the horizons, new gravitational waveforms are generated which display certain oscillatory pattern reminiscent of that of quasi-normal ringing in the inspiral phase before merger takes place.

Motivation: We aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the low-frequency s-wave dynamics of a massless scalar field propagating on a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole background. Our study focuses on understanding the connection between the scalar's evolution near the black hole horizon and its behavior on cosmological scales. By applying the method of matched asymptotic expansions, we seek to bridge the gap between these two phenomena and compute key parameters such as scattering coefficients, greybody factors, and Wigner time delay. Our analysis considers both small and large black holes, exploring the regime where the ratio of the cosmological horizon radius to the black hole radius is either small or comparable. This multi-regime approach allows us to understand how these parameters vary under different conditions, providing a more complete picture of scalar field behavior in such spacetimes.

Method: We solve analytically the low-frequency s-wave dynamics of a massless scalar field propagating on a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole background. A rigorous application of the method of matched asymptotic expansions allows us to connect the scalar's evolution in the proximity of the black hole horizon with that on cosmological scales.

Result: We compute explicitly the scattering coefficients, greybody factors, and Wigner time delay. We consider both small and large black holes, with the black-hole to cosmological horizon radii parametrically small and of order unity, respectively. This extends previous studies confined to the small black-hole regime only. Additionally, for small black holes, we perform a calculation that remains agnostic about the relative size between the ratio of the geometry's horizons and the scalar's frequency in units of the black-hole radius. When the two are comparable, we find that they are interchangeable in the greybody factor, which is symmetric under ω ↔ 1/r_c (where ω is the scalar's frequency and r_c the cosmological horizon radius).

Conclusion: In summary, we have extended the understanding of scalar field dynamics in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes to include both small and large black holes. Our calculations demonstrate that the greybody factor exhibits symmetry under the exchange of ω and 1/r_c when the black-hole and cosmological horizon radii are of comparable scale. This result has implications for understanding the scattering properties of scalar waves in these spacetimes and may inform further studies on black hole thermodynamics and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Our methodology, which combines analytical techniques with asymptotic expansions, provides a robust framework for future investigations into related phenomena.

Abstract: Establishing quantum gravity theory remains one of the major challenges in modern physics, as the lack of experimental evidence makes it difficult to explore. In response to this challenge, proposals to test quantum entanglement induced by Newtonian gravity in table-top experiments have attracted significant attention as a potentially feasible approach far below the Planck energy scale. In this work, we propose a scheme to amplify gravity-induced entanglement between two masses using parametric resonance. Specifically, we consider two parametrically resonant oscillators interacting through Newtonian gravity, each governed by the Mathieu equation. We analyzed the logarithmic negativity between two oscillators and investigate the effects of random force noise and linear damping. As a result, we find an exponential growth of gravity-induced entanglement between the oscillators, which reflects the dynamical instability of parametric resonant systems.

Abstract: Hybrid metric-Palatini gravity unifies the metric and Palatini formalisms while preserving a propagating scalar degree of freedom, offering a compelling route to modified gravity consistent with current observations. Motivated by this success, we consider an extended framework -- the hybrid metric-Palatini scalar-tensor (HMPST) theory -- in which an additional scalar field $φ$ modulates the curvature couplings, enriching the dynamics and enabling nontrivial self-interactions through scalar potentials. We focus on the analytically tractable linear-$f(\hat{R})$ subclass and study its cosmological, strong-field, and weak-field regimes. In homogeneous and isotropic settings, we identify de Sitter and matter-dominated cosmological solutions describing accelerated expansion and early-universe behavior. For static, spherically symmetric configurations, the field equations yield analytic solutions generalizing the Janis-Newman-Winicour and Buchdahl metrics, including the Schwarzschild-de Sitter limit. In the weak-field regime, linearized perturbations around Minkowski space lead to Yukawa-type corrections to the gravitational potential, with an effective Newton constant $G_{\rm eff}$ and post-Newtonian parameter $γ$ that recover General Relativity for heavy or weakly coupled scalars. These results show that the linear-$f(\hat{R})$ HMPST subclass provides a consistent and unified description of gravity across cosmological, astrophysical, and Solar System scales, offering a fertile framework for connecting modified gravity to observations and effective field-theoretic extensions.

Abstract: Motivated by recent images of black holes in M87 and our galaxy, efficient relativistic ray tracing was developed to simulate the snapshots of variable emissions around the black holes. Half a century ago, the appearance of a moving emission source was addressed by Terrell and Penrose, who independently found that the aberration effect induces a conformal transformation on the observer's celestial sphere. Consequently, a snapshot of a moving sphere should remain circular. In this study, we examine the Terrell-Penrose effect with our ray-tracing simulations for two contrasting cases: i) static emission sources in the view of a moving observer, ii) and moving emission sources in the view of a static observer. In flat spacetime, it was believed that the images of the emission sources in these two cases are equivalent due to the relativity of motion. Our simulation demonstrates that although both cases remain apparent shape of the sphere, the apparent distortions of the images are different, and case ii) violates conformality on the observer's celestial sphere. Furthermore, we extended similar situations to a black hole spacetime. For case i), it is found that the conformal transformation induced by the aberration effect also holds in black hole spacetime, and is not restricted to observers in geodesic motion. For case ii), we study the slow-light effect on the moving sources, and show that the gravity introduces additional influence on the snapshots of a moving source.

Abstract: We investigate the imaging and polarization properties of Kerr-MOG black holes surrounded by geometrically thick accretion flows. The MOG parameter $α$ introduces deviations from the Kerr metric, providing a means to test modified gravity in the strong field regime. Two representative accretion models are considered: the phenomenological radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and the analytical ballistic approximation accretion flow (BAAF). Using general relativistic radiative transfer, we compute synchrotron emission and polarization maps under different spins, MOG parameters, inclinations, and observing frequencies. In both models, the photon ring and central dark region expand with increasing $α$, whereas frame dragging produces pronounced brightness asymmetry. The BAAF model predicts a narrower bright ring and distinct polarization morphology near the event horizon. By introducing the net polarization angle $χ_{\text{net}}$ and the second Fourier mode $\angleβ_2$, we quantify inclination- and frame-dragging-induced polarization features. Our results reveal that both $α$ and spin significantly influence the near-horizon polarization patterns, suggesting that high-resolution polarimetric imaging could serve as a promising probe of modified gravity in the strong field regime.

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole within the framework of noncommutative geometry. We derive and analyze the black hole's thermodynamic functions, showing that they depend critically on the noncommutativity parameter denoted as Θ, while still satisfying the first law of thermodynamics. Stability analysis reveals that the noncommutative Schwarzschild-AdS black hole undergoes a phase transition at a critical point. Moreover, the thermodynamic behavior closely resembles that of a van der Waals fluid, with the noncommutativity introducing a correction term to the black hole's surface temperature. Our results indicate that the noncommutativity parameter Θ is of the order of the Planck scale and functions as a novel thermodynamic variable within the system.

Abstract: We address the equilibrium configurations and stability properties of anisotropic compact stars whose interior is described by a modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) equation of state in the framework of the regularized four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) theory. Applying a quasi-local prescription for the pressure anisotropy, we derive the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations and integrate them numerically over a large parameter space in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $α$ and the degree of anisotropy $β$. We provide mass-radius sequences, mass-compactness, energy density, and pressure profiles, and perform a full stability analysis based on the turning-point criterion, the radial adiabatic index $γ_r$, and the radial and transverse sound speeds $v_r^2$ and $v_t^2$. Our results show that positive $α$ and positive anisotropy $(β> 0)$ systematically increase the maximum mass and radius, enabling then configurations that exceed $2\,M_\odot$ while still obeying causality and the modified Buchdahl bound in 4DEGB gravity. A comparison with the latest astrophysical constraints (NICER, GW170817, GW190814, and massive-pulsar measurements) identifies regions of the $(α,β)$ parameter space that are observationally allowable. In conclusion, anisotropic dark-energy stars in 4DEGB gravity provide viable, observationally testable ultra-compact alternatives to normal neutron stars and black holes, and also potentially open rich avenues for further multi-messenger searches for higher-curvature effects.

Method: 研究者利用双光锥的柯西框架，并结合边界平均曲率条件（由S-T Yau提出）进行分析。

Result: 首次展示了满足特定条件的视界可以在动力学过程中形成，尽管初始条件中没有视界。

Conclusion: 这是研究视界形成动态过程的第一步，后续计划将构建具体的柯西数据。

Abstract: We prove that an apparent horizon can form as a result of Einsteinian evolution in pure vacuum spacetime starting from regular initial data free of apparent horizons due to pure boundary effects. We adapt a Cauchy-double-null framework and use the boundary generalized mean curvature condition for the existence of an interior apparent horizon imposed by the author S-T Yau in \cite{yau}. In particular, we prove that the condition of \cite{yau} can be met dynamically starting from a configuration that does not verify the same through a focusing mechanism. This is the first part of a two-part sequence, and in the sequel, we will focus on explicitly constructing the Cauchy data.

TL;DR: 研究了二次引力中带有宇宙常数的静力对称球状黑洞的渐近性质。发现当宇宙常数足够大时，生成的黑洞具有三种自由参数：地平层半径、Λ和 Bach 参数 b。对于较小的 |Λ| 值，需要通过精细调整 Bach 参数来恢复 (A)dS 渐近性质，形成两个不同的两参数家族。当带有电荷时，渐近性质相似，作为额外的自由参数加入电荷。两种精细调整的三参数家族与 Reissner-Nordström 黑洞不同。

Result: 作者发现当宇宙常数足够大时，黑洞性能是普遍的 (A)dS 渐近；当较小时，需要精细调整 Bach 参数以恢复 (A)dS 渐近，形成两个不同的两参数家族。当带有电荷时，渐近行为相似但多了一个自由参数。

Conclusion: 该论文为二次引力中 (A)dS 黑洞的构造提供了完整分类，扩展了经典 Schwarzschild 和 Reissner-Nordström 解。

Abstract: In this paper, we study asymptotic properties of static spherically symmetric black holes in quadratic gravity with a cosmological constant $Λ$. We find that for sufficiently large values of $|Λ|$ these black holes are generically asymptotically (A)dS and form a three-parameter family of black holes, with free parameters being the horizon radius, $Λ$, and Bach parameter $b$. For smaller values of $|Λ|$, fine-tuning of the Bach parameter is necessary to recover asymptotically (A)dS behaviour, resulting in two distinct two-parameter families of spherically symmetric black holes with (A)dS asymptotics. One family is the (A)dS-Schwarzschild solution, the other is a fine-tuned asymtotically (A)dS-Schwarzschild-Bach solution. We also generalise the above solutions to electrically charged black holes, obtaining qualitatively similar asymptotic behaviour. This adds the electric charge as an additional free parameter of these black holes. Both fine-tuned three-parameter families are distinct from Reissner-Nordström black holes.

TL;DR: 研究者使用氧化钛晶体作为模型系统，发现材料中的无序和未控制的应变抑制了热 hall 效应，高热导率的晶体显示出明显的热 hall 角，而无序晶体几乎不显示该效应。退火这些无序晶体部分恢复了热 hall 效应，而横向热导率几乎不受影响。关键发现是热 hall 效应的幅度并非由声波平均自由程决定，并且金属和绝缘端点测量结果相同，排除了旁路信号。这项工作通过揭示热 hall 效应作为晶格固有性质及其对无序的敏感性，为理论场景设定了很多限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解绝缘体中的 phonon 热 hall 效应及其微观机制对材料科学和相关领域很重要。

Method: 使用 SrTiO3 晶体作为模型系统，通过测量不同处理后的晶体的热 hall 角和热导率来研究材料中的无序和应变对热 hall 效应的影响。

Result: 高热导率晶体的热 hall 角显著，而无序晶体几乎没有该效应；退火后部分恢复热 hall 效应，而横向热导率不受影响；热 hall 效应的幅度不直接与声波平均自由程相关；金属与绝缘端点测量结果相同，排除旁路信号。

Conclusion:  phonon 热 hall 效应是晶体结构的固有属性，对无序高度敏感，并不能简单通过声波平均自由程解释。热 hall 效应的产生与材料处理和接触方式无关。

Abstract: The phonon thermal Hall effect (THE) is a ubiquitous yet poorly understood phenomenon in insulators. Its microscopic origin remains debated, partly due to significant sample-dependent variations that hint at uncontrolled experimental parameters. Using SrTiO$_3$ as a model system, we identify disorder and uncontrolled strain as suppressors of a thermal Hall signal. Crystals with high thermal conductivity exhibit a substantial thermal Hall angle $\nabla T_y / \nabla T_x$ (up to 0.3\% at 9 T), whereas the effect is virtually absent in disordered samples. Crucially, annealing (in air atmosphere) these disordered samples partially restores the THE (approximately 0.1\% at 9 T) with little effect on the longitudinal thermal conductivity. This decoupling reveals that the amplitude of THE is not simply set by the phonon mean free path. Furthermore, measurements performed with metallic and insulating contacts yield identical results on the same sample. This definitively rules out parasitic signals as the effect's origin. Our work, by establishing the phonon THE as an intrinsic property of the crystal lattice and extremely sensitive to disorder, sharply constrains theoretical scenarios.

Abstract: Kondo metals with geometric frustration offer fertile ground for exploring exotic states of matter with a field-induced fractional magnetization platform and nonsaturating magnetoresistance. Herein, a Ce3ScBi5 single crystal with anti-Hf5Sn3Cu hexagonal structure was successfully synthesized via the bismuth self-flux method, leading to the formation of cerium cations arranged in a frustrated structure within a distorted kagome lattice. Magnetic measurements exhibit two distinct antiferromagnetic transitions at 4.1 and 5.9 K. Specifically, the occurrence of multiple metamagnetic transitions between magnetization plateaus is evidenced upon applying magnetic fields perpendicular to the c axis. Transport measurements highlight remarkable Kondo-lattice characteristics and anisotropic magnetoresistance in Ce3ScBi5. The anomalous Hall contributions are observed at low temperatures under critical fields, suggesting Fermi surface reconstruction in a subset of the metamagnetic transitions. We have constructed a temperature-field phase diagram to provide comprehensive information on the complex magnetic structures arising from competitive interactions. Our work establishes Ce3ScBi5 and related materials as a unique platform for exploring low-dimensional quantum fluctuations in bulk crystals, and analyzes the critical role of geometric frustration in Kondo and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida physical frameworks.

Abstract: Low-dimensional physics provides profound insights into strongly correlated interactions, leading to enhanced quantum effects and the emergence of exotic quantum states. The Ln3ScBi5 family stands out as a chemically versatile kagome platform with mixed low-dimensional structural framework and tunable physical properties. Our research initiates with a comprehensive evaluation of the currently known Ln3ScBi5 (Ln = La-Nd, Sm) materials, providing a robust methodology for assessing their stability frontiers within this system. Focusing on Pr3ScBi5, we investigate the influence of the zigzag chains of quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) motifs and the distorted kagome layers of quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) networks in the mixed-dimensional structure on the intricate magnetic ground states and unique spin fluctuations. Our study reveals that the noncollinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) moments of Pr3+ ions are confined within the Q2D kagome planes, displaying minimal in-plane anisotropy. In contrast, a strong AFM coupling is observed within the Q1D zigzag chains, significantly constraining spin motion. Notably, the magnetic frustration is partially the consequence of coupling to conduction electrons via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) interaction, highlighting a promising framework for future investigations into mixed-dimensional frustration in Ln3ScBi5 systems.

Conclusion: 无限组件BF理论为连接强相关拓扑场论与非互作用非哈密尔顿物理提供了新的视角，并展示了零奇异模式在拓扑序相变动力学中的潜在重要性。

Abstract: Building on the recent study of Toeplitz braiding by Li et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The sign-problematic generalized Baxter-Wu (GBW) model with asymmetric complex couplings is mapped onto a one-dimensional quantum model. Utilizing the model's exactly known critical properties, we study the relation between the conventional and the modified average signs and the phase transitions in the GBW model. We find that the average sign develops a negative peak near the critical point, but it is not a unique indicator of phase transition, as similar features can appear in non-critical regions. While the average modified sign provides a viable probe for the phase transition, the practical effectiveness of this method is limited by the exponential scaling of computational cost with the system's volume. We propose that the universal properties of the original model can be investigated through simulating the related reference model, based on the universality assumption. Using finite-size scaling analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm the validity of this method, which thereby provides a novel framework for investigating phase transitions in systems plagued by the sign problem.

Abstract: We revisit gradient-based optimization for infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS), a tensor network ansatz for simulating many-body quantum systems. This approach is hindered by two major challenges: the high computational cost of evaluating energies and gradients, and an ill-conditioned optimization landscape that slows convergence. To reduce the number of optimization steps, we introduce an efficient preconditioner derived from the leading term of the metric tensor. We benchmark our method against standard optimization techniques on the Heisenberg and Kitaev models, demonstrating substantial improvements in overall computational efficiency. Our approach is broadly applicable across various contraction schemes, unit cell sizes, and Hamiltonians, highlighting the potential of preconditioned optimization to advance tensor network algorithms for strongly correlated systems.

*Aminul Hussain,Nisa Ara,Rudranil Basu,Sudeshna Sen*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper investigates the interplay between non-trivial band topology and strong electronic correlations in a two-leg ladder model with p-wave-like hybridization. The model hosts a symmetry-protected topological phase in the non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm, the quantum phase diagram is comprehensively mapped in the presence of repulsive inter-leg density-density interactions. The analysis reveals a dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase, with a non-trivial change in edge entanglement entropy and robustness of phase boundaries. The transition between different topological phases is significantly influenced by interactions, particularly the critical lines shifting as interaction strength increases. This work clarifies how interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a topological phase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of interactions on topological phases is crucial for advancing the field of condensed matter physics. This paper addresses this by studying a two-leg ladder model with p-wave-like hybridization and strong electronic correlations.

Method: The paper employs the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm to investigate the quantum phase diagram of the model under repulsive inter-leg density-density interactions. The analysis uses entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum.

Result: The study reveals a significant dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. The edge entanglement entropy shows a non-trivial change when interactions are included. The phase boundary separating a trivial insulator and a topological phase with winding number two remains robustly pinned at its non-interacting location, regardless of the interaction strength. However, the transition to a topological phase with winding number one is heavily renormalized, with the critical line shifting notably as interaction strength increases.

Conclusion: This work provides valuable insights into how interactions affect the stability and transitions of topological phases in condensed matter systems, particularly in two-leg ladder models with p-wave-like hybridization.

Abstract: The interplay between non-trivial band topology and strong electronic correlations is a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. We investigate this competition on a two-leg ladder model with a p-wave-like hybridisation between the legs. This model hosts a symmetry-protected topological phase in its non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix renormalisation group algorithm, we compute the comprehensive quantum phase diagram in the presence of a repulsive inter-leg density-density interaction. Our analysis, based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum, reveals a fascinating dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. We find a non-trivial change in the value of the edge entanglement entropy as we include interaction. Furthermore, we find that the phase boundary separating a trivial insulator phase and a topological one with winding number two remains robustly pinned at its non-interacting location, irrespective of the interaction strength. Variation of the effective conformal field theory's central charge near the critical line explains the robustness of the gap. In contrast, the transition to an insulating phase with winding number one is heavily renormalised, with the critical line shifting significantly as the interaction increases. By successfully mapping the phase diagram and identifying the distinct behaviours of the phase boundaries, our work clarifies how interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a topological phase.

Result: 通过这种方式，我们构建了一个与最成熟机器学习势模型相当的模型，并且能够准确预测矩。

Conclusion: 这种方法为可扩展的电子结构替代DFT提供了路径。

Abstract: The Hohenberg-Kohn (HK) theorem -- the bedrock of density functional theory (DFT) -- establishes a universal map from the external potential to the energy. It also relates the electron density and atomic forces to the variation of the energy with the external potential. But the HK map is rarely utilized in atomistics, wherein interatomic potentials are defined using the molecular or crystal structure rather than the external potential. As a break from this tradition, we present a field theoretic atomistics framework where the external potential assumes the central quantity. We machine learn the HK energy map while satisfying the thermodynamic limit. Further, we obtain both forces and electron density from the variation of the HK energy map, that are exact relations. Our models attain good accuracy across diverse benchmarks and compete with state-of-the-art machine learned interatomic potentials. Through electron density, we predict accurate dipole and quadrupole moments, otherwise nontrivial for interatomic potentials. Our formulation paves the way for a scalable electronic structure surrogate to DFT.

Abstract: We propose a generalisation of molecular density functional theory to describe inhomogeneous solvent mixture, with the objective of modelling electrolytic solutions. Two electrolytic models are presented, both within the HNC approximation. The first one is a two-components mixture representing a primitive-like model of sodium chloride, where the solvent is described as a dielectric continuum. This popular model has the advantage of simplicity, as the ions densities solely depend on spatial coordinates. Additionally, we develop a realistic three-components electrolyte model, in which water solvent is described by a third density field that depends on both spatial and orientational coordinates. The proposed methodology and its tridimensional implementation (3 spatial coordinates and 3 Euler angles) are validated by comparing the solvation properties of a sodium cation with the predictions of integral equation theory solved in 1D (1 intermolecular distance and 5 Euler angles), showing near-perfect agreement. This methodology enables the study of solvation properties of solutes of arbitrary shapes in electrolytic solutions, as demonstrated with the prototypical N-methylacetamide molecule immersed in both electrolytic solution models.

Abstract: The integration of diamond with $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ presents a promising pathway to enhance thermal management in high-power electronic devices, where the inherently low thermal conductivity of $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ can lead to localized self-heating and elevated junction temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable, low-damage method to integrate high-quality polycrystalline diamond films on (010) $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD), enabled by dielectric interlayers and polymer-assisted electrostatic nanodiamond seeding. A systematic investigation of processing conditions was conducted to assess their effects on film morphology, grain evolution, sp3-phase purity, and optical characteristics. Diamond films grown at 800 degC exhibit grain sizes up to 126.6 nm, RMS roughness of 16.3 nm, and a sharp diamond Raman peak at around 1332 cm-1 with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 34.98 cm-1. The corresponding sp$^3$-phase purity exceeds 97.5 percent, with an optical bandgap up to 5.13 eV. Deposition time variation from 10 to 60 minutes at 800 degC results in thicknesses from 53 nm to 315 nm and corresponding grain coarsening. Interlayer comparison reveals that SiO2 yields slightly larger grains and higher purity than SiNx under identical conditions. Notably, films with more than 96 percent sp$^3$ content were achieved at temperatures as low as 480 degC, confirming the compatibility of this approach with reduced thermal budgets. These results provide a robust framework for scalable $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond integration in thermally resilient high power and RF device technologies.

Motivation: Understanding how strain modifies carrier transport in TMDs is essential for advancing the field of low-dimensional semiconductors and developing more efficient electronic devices.

Method: A multiscale full-band transport framework was used, incorporating intrinsic phonon, extrinsic impurity, and dielectric scattering to model strain effects.

Result: The results show that tuning rates exceed those observed in silicon, and the model aligns with experimental measurements across various practical configurations.

Conclusion: Strain engineering in TMDs offers a robust method for improving device reliability and performance in applications such as FETs.

Abstract: Strain fundamentally alters carrier transport in semiconductors by modifying their band structure and scattering pathways. In transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), an emerging class of 2D semiconductors, we show that mobility modulation under biaxial strain is dictated by changes in inter-valley scattering rather than effective mass renormalization as in bulk silicon. Using a multiscale full-band transport framework that incorporates both intrinsic phonon, extrinsic impurity, and dielectric scattering, we find that tensile strain enhances n-type mobility through K-Q valley separation, while compressive strain improves p-type mobility via Γ-K decoupling. The tuning rates calculated from our full-band model far exceed those achieved by strain engineering in silicon. Both relaxed and strain-modulated carrier mobilities align quantitatively with experimentally verified measurements and are valid across a wide range of practical FET configurations. The enhancement remains robust across variations in temperature, carrier density, impurity level, and dielectric environment. Our results highlight the pivotal role of strain in improving the reliability and performance of 2D TMD-based electronics.

Abstract: Molecular room temperature masers have emerged as promising sources of coherent microwaves, but systematic comparisons of organic gain media under uniform conditions remain limited. This paper presents a characterization of two systems, pentacene doped para terphenyl (Pc:PTP, 1.45 GHz) and 6,13 diazapentacene doped para terphenyl (DAP:PTP, 1.478 GHz), examined at four concentrations, including a new 0.05 percent DAP:PTP sample. By evaluating L band masing media under identical conditions, optimal doping levels and gain materials for high power operation are identified. The optimized system produced room temperature continuous wave masing with a peak output of 2.34 mW (+3.69 dBm), marking the first milliwatt level emission from an organic maser. Spectral coherence times of 465 ns and coherence lengths up to 150 m were obtained. Coupling to a high Q cavity mode enables collective spin photon interactions, with Rabi oscillations revealing coherent ensemble dynamics. Frequency domain analysis shows normal mode splitting of 1.37 MHz for Pc:PTP and 2.14 MHz for DAP:PTP, confirming strong coupling. Cavity QED analysis yields cooperativities C* = 304-803 for Pc:PTP and 405-1071 for DAP:PTP, among the highest for organic systems. Quantitative metrics of signal to noise ratio, spectral coherence distance, and throughput demonstrate the potential of these masers for radar, secure communication, and quantum interface technologies.

Abstract: Atmospheric conditions such as fog, humidity, and scattering by foliage routinely degrade optical free-space (FS) links, motivating alternatives that are robust in adverse conditions. Coherent microwave sources offer a compelling alternative for quantum-secure communication, yet their propagation outside enclosed resonators has remained untested. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature FS transmission of maser signals generated using organic L-band (1-2 GHz) gain media, pentacene doped p-terphenyl (Pc: PTP), and Diazapentacene-doped p-terphenyl (DAP:PTP). Spectral and temporal coherence is preserved over distances up to 25 cm, approximately one wavelength at the masing frequency. Tests included polarisation misalignment, high-humidity conditions, and partial occlusion by foliage to emulate realistic FS reception scenarios. Strong spin-photon coupling was maintained, as confirmed by persistent rabi oscillations and normal-mode splitting. An instantaneous peak output of 4.29 mW (+6.32 dBm) from a 0.01% DAP:PTP gain medium. with a pulse duration of ~4 μs, marks a performance benchmark for directly coupled masers. These findings demonstrate a proof-of-concept for masers as viable platforms for short-range, interference-resilient coherent microwave links, with future relevance to quantum sensing and secure communication technologies.

Abstract: Super-resolution imaging refers to imaging techniques that surpass the Rayleigh resolution limit. One standard way to achieve super-resolution is by structuring the phase of the field illuminating the object. Although super-resolution techniques are already employed in commercial imaging devices, intense research efforts continue to enhance the resolution even further. In this work, we show that if the field illuminating the object is structured in the azimuthal coordinate--such as a field carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM)--the azimuthal features of the object can be imaged with enhanced imaging resolution. We experimentally demonstrate it with two objects, namely, an azimuthal double-slit and a Siemens star. We find that for a given azimuthal feature, there is an optimum OAM mode index of the illumination that gives the best imaging resolution. Super-resolution imaging of azimuthal feature can have important implications, especially for some biological objects that are known to have predominantly azimuthal features.
