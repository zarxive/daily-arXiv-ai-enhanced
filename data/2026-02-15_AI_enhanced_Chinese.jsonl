At present, there is strong interest in materials with strongly coupled structural and electronic phase transitions, which hold promise for energy-efficient technologies. Utilizing a structural phase transition and controlling its plasticity naturally leads to built-in memory, a key feature for emulating neurons and synapses in neuromorphic technologies. Here, $\\textit{operando}$ Bragg X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy is used to study the evolution of the nano-domain distribution at the micron-scale in neuromorphic devices made from the archetypal Mott insulator vanadium dioxide. It is found that after electrical switching, slow nano-domain reconfiguration occurs on timescales of thousands of seconds and that the domains undergo a jamming transition, offering control over switching stochasticity at the micron scale. More precisely, repetitive above-threshold currents plastically drive the system into a jammed/glassy state where switching becomes deterministic, while sub-threshold currents erase the short-term memory contained in the nano-domain distribution, recovering stochastic switching, thus offering a path for in-device learning. The results illustrate the importance of studying the nanoscale physics associated with phase transitions in strongly correlated materials, even for macroscopic devices, and offer guidance for future device operation schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we propose van der Waals heterostructures of stripe antiferromagnets (sAFMs) as an ideal platform for electrically controllable $p$-wave magnetism. In the sAFM/metal/sAFM structure, the leading RKKY-type exchange interaction is canceled due to the symmetry of the stacking pattern. This exposes a higher-order biquadratic interaction as a dominant contribution that drives a filling-controlled transition from a collinear phase to an orthogonal $p$-wave configuration. The resulting $p$-wave phase exhibits a gate-tunable Edelstein response, which originates from magnetic symmetry breaking rather than conventional relativistic spin-momentum locking and remains robust even under substantial spin-orbit coupling.

Noise from both high-frequency sources and low-frequency 60 Hz AC power equipment can contaminate the data. To suppress noise across these ranges especially 60 Hz and its harmonics, which overlap with beam loss signal frequencies advanced digital processing beyond standard filtering is required. Several real-time functional blocks were simulated and tested on an FPGA: (1) a dual time-constant discharging integrator filter, (2) a de-ripple baseline extraction and storage block, and (3) a fast-recovery discharging integrator. The nonlinear IIR integrator filter removes high-frequency noise and feeds into the baseline extractor. Upon detecting abrupt beam loss, it switches to a longer time constant to prevent baseline distortion. The de-ripple block calculates a valid baseline by averaging over multiple 60 Hz periods, storing results in a 4096-word FPGA RAM. This baseline is subtracted from raw data before integration by the fast-recovery block, which resets quickly after use.

A central challenge in the field is to identify physical phenomena that require a quantum rather than a classical treatment of electrodynamics. In this work, we use our recently developed mean-field quantum (mfq) and full-quantum (fq) real-time nuclear--electronic orbital (RT-NEO) time-dependent density functional theory methods to simulate polaritonic dynamics for a molecule under vibrational strong coupling when a quantized cavity mode is initialized in a Fock state rather than a coherent state. Our previous work showed that a coherent state initial condition for the cavity mode leads to polariton formation for both the mfq-RT-NEO and fq-RT-NEO methods. Herein, we show that the mfq-RT-NEO method, which does not allow light--matter entanglement, does not predict polariton formation for a Fock state initial condition. Similar to the mfq-RT-NEO method, the fq-RT-NEO method does not predict oscillations of the cavity mode coordinate and molecular dipole operator expectation values for a Fock state initial condition. However, the fq-RT-NEO method does predict oscillations of the expectation values of even powers of these operators as well as light--matter entanglement, implicating polariton formation with a Fock state initial condition. All these observations can be explained with model systems. These results suggest that using a quantized cavity mode initial condition that does not have a direct analogy to an initial condition in classical electrodynamics can lead to physical phenomena that can only be described by a quantum treatment of the cavity mode.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Conventional models distinguish between trion-related A-type blinking and defect-assisted BC-type blinking, both expected to degrade single-photon purity in a dark state. Here, time-resolved spectroscopy on individual PQDs reveals a qualitatively different regime in which low emitting dark states exhibit higher single-photon purity than bright states. For those PQDs state-resolved $g^{(2)}(\u03c4)$ analysis shows that the exciton photoluminescence quantum yield decreases by a factor of $\\sim 8$, while the biexciton one is suppressed by a factor of $\\sim 10$. This leads to a moderate improvement of single-photon purity with $g^{(2)}_0$ decreased from 0.155 to 0.120. In contrast, PQDs with fluorescence lifetime--intensity distribution patterns characteristic for A-type blinking, display the expected increase of $g^{(2)}_0$ in charged, trion-dominated states. To explain the observed improvement of single-photon purity of low-emitting dark states, we propose a self-trapped-exciton (STE) mechanism that selectively blocks biexciton formation by diverting hot excitons into long-lived, weakly emissive STE configurations. This STE-mediated blinking channel explains why certain low-emitting states improve, rather than degrade, single-photon purity and suggests a lattice-driven route to perovskite quantum emitters with intrinsically suppressed multiphoton events.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91d1\u5c5e\u5364\u5316\u7269PerPixelovskite\u91cf\u5b50 dots\uff08PQDs\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u95ea\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u53d1\u5149\u6697\u6001\u76f8\u6bd4\u4eae\u6001\u5728\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u7eaf\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6709\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u88ab\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b50\uff08STE\uff09\u673a\u5236\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u70ed\u6fc0\u53d1\u5f15\u5bfc\u5230\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u3001\u5f31\u53d1\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u88ab\u6355\u83b7\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6291\u5236\u53cc\u95ea\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u7eaf\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u662f\u5206\u6e05\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u95ea\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50 dots\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u7ea7\u6570\u7eaf\u5316\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u8f90\u5c04\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u7eaf\u5ea6\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u70b9\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50 dots\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u65f6 resolved \u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a PQD \u4e2a\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86 state-resolved $g^{(2)}(\u03c4)$ \u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5149\u6548\u5e94\u91cf\u5b50\u4ea7\u7387\u548c\u53cc\u95ea\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f4e\u53d1\u6697\u6001\u901a\u8fc7 STE \u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u7eaf\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e A \u7c7b\u53cc\u95ea\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u543b\u5408\u3002\u6570\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e5f\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u53cc\u95ea\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50 dots\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u81ea\u88ab\u6355\u83b7\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b50\u662f\u4f4e\u53d1\u6697\u6001\u63d0\u9ad8\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u7eaf\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53cc\u95ea\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50 dots\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u5149\u5b50\u7eaf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Conventional quantum oscillation techniques, typically used for this purpose, are inapplicable in this high-temperature regime due to thermal and disorder-induced smearing of Landau levels. We propose Sondheimer oscillations (SO), semiclassical oscillations of in-plane magnetoresistivity in thin films, as a robust alternative probe of FS reconstruction. SO arise from the commensuration between the cyclotron radius and film thickness, do not rely on Landau quantization, and remain observable at moderate fields and elevated temperatures where quantum oscillations are suppressed. Their frequencies depend solely on the FS parameters (e.g., curvature), and not on specific details of scattering mechanisms. SO are also sensitive to the coherence of inter-layer tunneling, allow contributions from individual FS pockets to be distinguished in the frequency domain, and naturally include the Yamaji angle effect (if present in the system) as a prominent feature in the frequency spectrum. We compute SO spectra as a function of the magnetic field orientation for three representative scenarios: (i) an unreconstructed large FS, (ii) a spin density wave reconstructed FS with volume $p/4$, and (iii) a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL$^*$) with pocket volume $p/8$ (here $p$ is the hole doping). We show that the SO spectrum offers a wealth of universal features that could be used to differentiate between these scenarios. In particular, we highlight a FS geometry-dependent phase shift between oscillations in longitudinal and transverse conductivities, characterize how the FS curvature can be extracted from SO if the film orientation is perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$-axis, and analyze the evolution of the SO spectrum with doping.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

One of the main consequences of intrabeam scattering is a change in the emittances of a bunch: in some circumstances (in particular, in hadron storage rings operating above transition), the transverse and longitudinal emittances may grow over time without limit. This may restrict the performance of machines for which maintaining low beam emittance is an important requirement. In this note, we describe some of the models used to analyse the effects of intrabeam scattering, and present in particular the Piwinski formulae for the emittance growth rates. We compare the predicted changes in emittance with measurements in a number of machines operating in different parameter regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For a given gauge group, such theories are expected to flow to an interacting conformal fixed point over a range of fermion or scalar flavours, known as the `conformal window.' Their nature is important for understanding critical phases and phase transitions beyond the Landau paradigm like the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), yet remains challenging for conventional non-perturbative approaches. In this work, we study a family of fuzzy-sphere models corresponding to non-linear sigma models with $\\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ global symmetry extended to the strongly-coupled region. These theories are expected have an infra-red fixed point described by $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in three space-time dimensions with $N$ flavours of fermions. They can be viewed as a generalisation of the $\\mathrm{SO}(5)$ DQCP, corresponding to $N=2$. We investigate them using quantum Monte Carlo for $N$ up to $16$. We find evidence that for $N\\geq4$ the phase diagram contains a critical phase that appears to be absent for $N=2$. Within this phase, we measure the two-point correlation function and the excitation spectrum, which exhibit emergent conformal symmetry. We also extract the scaling dimension $\u0394_\u03c6$ of a leading operator and find consistency with large-$N$ expectations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We develop a broad framework for accounting for and reducing this variance and prove that stratified sampling -- under ideal proportional allocation -- results in an unbiased estimator with a variance that is never worse than na\u00efve sampling (with equality only in degenerate cases).\n  Furthermore, we provide a classical dynamic programme to enable stratification on arbitrary product-form QPDs.

E", "summary": "Reaction-diffusion equations describe various spatially extended processes that unfold as traveling fronts moving at constant velocity. We introduce and solve analytically a model that, besides such fronts, supports solutions advancing as the square root of time. These sublinear fronts preserve an invariant shape, with an effective diffusion constant that diverges at the transition to linear spreading.

Furthermore, their small pixel size and large active area endow them with excellent coverage and resolution for both real-space and reciprocal space imaging. Here, we demonstrate that HPCDs are also well-suited for laboratory-based nanoscale x-ray tomography (nano-xCT). We perform nano-xCT on an integrated circuit fabricated at the 130-nm node and produce a 3D reconstruction with 40 times more photons collected 20 times faster than in this group's previous work, for an overall speedup of 800$\\times$. We review the technical considerations of using an HPCD for tabletop tomography. We quantify our reconstruction image quality using well-established metrics, including the modulation transfer function (MTF), Fourier shell correlation (FSC), and contrast-to-noise (CNR), to validate our choice of experimental parameters that provide sufficient resolution and imaging speed.

By leveraging the coupling between guided-mode resonance and Fabry-Perot modes, mediated by the phase-transition dynamics of the embedded PCM, the resonance Q factor can be actively tuned. This allows the system to switch from a perfect dark state, governed by the physics of bound states in the continuum, to a critically coupled resonance with a finite Q factor.

Our results indicate that the event horizon radius is sensitive to the inner slope parameter $a$; specifically, beyond a critical threshold, the horizon vanishes, leading to the formation of naked singularities. We find that the DM environment induces curvature singularities in the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars, which are absent in the vacuum BTZ case. Furthermore, an analysis of the effective energy-momentum tensor shows that while the null, weak, and strong energy conditions are strictly satisfied, the dominant energy condition is violated in the BTZ scenario due to the high tangential pressure gradient. We also observe that DM modifies the Hawking temperature and free energy without compromising local or global stability. Notably, the DM distribution transforms the originally constant-curvature BTZ spacetime into a singular one, suggesting that a inherent stiffness of the DM profile is a determinant factor in the causal structure of these solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a$(3+1)$\u7ef4\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f26\u548cbtz\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728dekel-zhao\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u955c\u9762\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u3002\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e86\u91cc\u5947\u548c\u51ef\u6c0f\u6807\u91cf\u7684\u5947\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u5728\u771f\u7a7abtz\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u6211\u4eecevaluate\u4e86\u5e94\u529b\u80fd\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0null, weak, \u548cstrong energy conditions\u90fd\u88ab\u4e25\u683c\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46dominant energy\u6761\u4ef6\u5728btz\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7684\u5207\u5411\u538b\u529b\u68af\u5ea6\u3002\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u8c03\u6574\u4e86 Hawking \u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u7834\u574f\u5c40\u57df\u6216\u5168\u5c40\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u4f7f\u539f\u672c\u5e38\u66f2\u7387\u7684btz\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u5947\u5f02\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\uff0c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u521a\u6027\u662f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u5947\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3$(3+1)$\u7ef4\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f26\u548cbtz\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728dekel-zhao\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u5947\u70b9\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "result": "DM\u73af\u5883\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u91cc\u5947\u548c\u51ef\u6c0f\u6807\u91cf\u7684\u5947\u70b9\uff0cbtz\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0b\u7684dominant energy\u6761\u4ef6\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u8c03\u6574\u4e86 Hawking \u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u7834\u574f\u5c40\u57df\u6216\u5168\u5c40\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0cdm\u5206\u5e03\u4f7f\u539f\u672c\u5e38\u66f2\u7387\u7684btz\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u5947\u5f02\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\uff0c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u521a\u6027\u662f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5bf9$(3+1)$\u7ef4\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f26\u548cbtz\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5947\u70b9\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u6ee1\u8db3\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5bf9 black hole \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

In this work, we explore the vibrational-state-dependent behavior of the ion-molecule reaction between O2+ in distinct vibrational states and two isomers of C3H4, allene (H2C3H2) and propyne (H3C3H). While most products are formed regardless of the vibrational state of O2+, the branching ratios are influenced by vibrational excitation, and a new product, C2O+, appears exclusively in the excited-state reactions. This selective formation of C2O+ demonstrates that vibrational excitation can effectively activate a reaction pathway, providing direct evidence of quantum-state control in reactivity.

Periodic driving provides a viable route to circumvent this no-go constraint. Here, we propose a scheme to realize and control unpaired Weyl points using ultracold atoms in a three-dimensional (3D) optical Raman lattice under continuous periodic driving. By engineering distinct relative symmetries between the lattice and multiple Raman potentials, the configuration generates an effective 3D spin-orbit coupling and yields a tunable topological-insulator phase. Through adiabatic periodic modulation of this system, we show that eight Weyl points emerge in the quasienergy spectrum of the low-energy sector, whose net chirality can be precisely tuned. A nonzero total chirality directly corresponds to the formation of unpaired Weyl points. Furthermore, by implementing a synthetic magnetic field via laser-assisted tunneling in this setup, we demonstrate that the chirality imbalance drives a quantized charge current in the weak-field regime, providing a direct signature of the CME. We verify that the adiabatic condition of the driving protocol, as well as the proposed experimental preparation and detection techniques, are within reach of current ultracold-atom experiments.

We find in addition to the known $J = 0$ trion the existence of a bound state with orbital angular momentum $J = 1$. The results for $J = 0$ are benchmarked against existing calculations from the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM) and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Furthermore, we analyze the trion internal structure and geometry through their probability density distributions, accounting for the effects of different material shows that GEM -- widely used in studies of strongly interacting few-body systems -- is well adapted to allow comprehensive and computationally efficient investigations of trions and potentially other weakly bound few-body states in layered materials. In addition, we systematically exploit the effect of strain and dieletric environment in the $J = 1$ trion predictions, illustrated for the MoS$_2$ monolayer example.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fc7\u6e21\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e8c\u6742\u73af\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff08TMDCs\uff09\u5355\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u4e09\u5b50\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u9ad8\u65af\u5c55\u5f00\u6cd5\uff08GEM\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u5f0f\u4e3aMX\u2082\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3a2H\u76f8\u7684\u5355\u5c42TMDCs\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b50\u548c\u4e09\u5b50\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5176\u675f\u7f1a\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u9664\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5J=0\u7684\u4e09\u5b50\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cfJ=1\u7684\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684Stochastic Variational Method\uff08SVM\uff09\u548cQuantum Monte Carlo\uff08QMC\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9J=0\u7684\u4e09\u5b50\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6807\u6dee\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e09\u5b50\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6750\u6599\u5bf9GEM\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e94\u53d8\u548c\u4ecb\u7535\u73af\u5883\u5bf9J=1\u4e09\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5Molybdenum\u4e8c\u5316\u5408\u6210\u5c42\u4e3a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bf4\u660e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e09\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b50\u548c\u4e09\u5b50\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6027\u8d28\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u6750\u6599\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u9ad8\u65af\u5c55\u5f00\u6cd5\uff08GEM\uff09\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u5c42TMDCs\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u5b50\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4f34\u968f\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b50\u548c\u4e09\u5b50\u7684\u675f\u7f1a\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e09\u5b50\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9664\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5J=0\u7684\u4e09\u5b50\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cfJ=1\u7684\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684SVM\u548cQMC\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9J=0\u7684\u4e09\u5b50\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6807\u6dee\u5316\u3002\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e09\u5b50\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u53d7\u5230\u6750\u6599\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e94\u53d8\u548c\u4ecb\u7535\u73af\u5883\u5bf9J=1\u4e09\u5b50\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5Molybdenum\u4e8c\u5316\u5408\u6210\u5c42\u4e3a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bf4\u660e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u5b50\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5f31\u675f\u7f1a\u7684\u4e09\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u5c42\u72b6\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

A stratified symmetry operator is a symmetry operator that factorizes into mutually independent subsystem symmetry operators; its stratified anomaly is defined as the collection of anomalies associated with these subsystem operators. We develop a cellular chain complex formalism for stratified anomalies of internal symmetries and show that, in the presence of crystalline symmetries, they give rise to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) constraints. This includes LSM anomalies and SPT-LSM theorems. We apply this framework to modulated $G$ symmetries, which are symmetries whose total symmetry group is ${G_\\mathrm{tot} = G \\rtimes G_\\mathrm{s}}$, with $G_\\mathrm{s}$ the crystalline symmetry group. Notably, a nonzero stratified anomaly within a fundamental domain of $G_\\mathrm{s}$ (e.g., a unit cell) does not always imply an LSM anomaly for modulated symmetries. Instead, the existence of an LSM anomaly also depends on how $G_\\mathrm{s}$ acts on $G$. When $G_\\mathrm{s}$ is the lattice translation group, we find an explicit criterion for when a stratified anomaly causes an LSM anomaly, and classify LSM anomalies using homology groups of $G_\\mathrm{s}$-invariant cellular chains.

The extraordinary properties at room temperature of the spin system in diamond have made it one of the most prominent quantum platforms for the development of commercial quantum sensors. In particular, the sensitivity of the electronic spin in NV centers has made diamond-based magnetic sensors of special interest for their potential application in medical, industrial or navigation solutions. However, the use of these sensors for universal vector magnetometry was constrained by the need for previous knowledge on the field being measured to fully exploit their benefits. In this work, we show a method to perform unconditional vector magnetometry without the need of external information on the magnetic field, based only on the spatial arrangement of the diamond and the microwave antenna combination. While previous NV-based vector magnetometry methods require partial knowledge of the magnetic field (e.g. a calibrated bias field), we exploit the possibilities of selecting particular directions of the spins in the diamond with elliptically polarized microwave fields. We prove that our method allows to estimate both magnitude and direction of external magnetic fields without further assumptions or constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Furthermore, he showed the proposal is inherently robust to local perturbations (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arxiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:1001.0344, arXiv:1001.4363) when anyons are created as quasiparticle excitations of a topologically ordered lattice model prepared at zero temperature. Over the decades following this proposal there have been considerable technological developments towards the construction of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Rather than maintaining some target ground state at zero temperature, a modern approach is to actively correct the errors a target state experiences, where we use noisy quantum circuit elements to identify and subsequently correct for deviations from the ideal state. We present an error-correction scheme that enables us to carry out robust universal quantum computation by braiding anyons. We show that our scheme can be carried out on a suitably large device with an arbitrarily small failure rate assuming circuit elements are below some threshold level of local noise. The error-corrected scheme we have developed therefore enables us to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation using modern quantum hardware that is now under development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7 braiding anyons \u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6545\u969c\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u9650\u4f4e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e Kitaev \u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u4ee3\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bb9\u9519\u6027\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e anyons \u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d89\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u7684 braiding \u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5904\u7406\u786c\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7ebf\u8def\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4f4e\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e2a\u9608\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u5c0f\u7684\u6545\u969c\u53d1\u751f\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5176\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

We first systematically investigate the effect of widefield optogenetic stimulation frequency on evoked neuronal activity, to identify a test-stimulus that reliably probes network responses without inducing activity modulation. By analyzing spike-rate dynamics during repeated stimulation, we characterize frequency-dependent response adaptation consistent with Channelrhodopsin-2 photocycle kinetics. Based on these results, an optimized low-frequency test-stimulus is selected and combined with a spatially confined tetanic optogenetic stimulation to induce LTP. Network responses are quantified using post-stimulus time histograms and a normalized efficacy metric, enabling electrode-wise and network-level analysis of plasticity. Main results. Low-frequency optical stimulation (<= 0.2 Hz) preserves stable evoked responses, whereas higher frequencies induce a pronounced sigmoid-like decay in firing rate. Following tetanic stimulation, a subset of electrodes exhibits robust and long-lasting potentiation, persisting for several hours. Significance. This work provides a systematic methodology for studying activity-dependent plasticity in optogenetically driven neuronal networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

When coupled with organic scintillators(EJ200 or EJ276),the SG101 EJ200 system achieves a figure of merit (FOM) of 3.81 for thermal neutron/gamma separation, while the SG101 EJ276 configuration resolves three distinct particle populations gamma rays, fast neutrons, and thermal neutrons with FOM values of 3.46 and2.21, respectively. Correlation analysis reveals that the number of fast thermal neutron coincidence events significantly exceeds the accidental background, and the count of gamma fast thermal neutron triple-coincidence events is also far higher than the expected accidental rate, confirming significant physical correlations for both event types within a 100 us time window.

However, they face two critical challenges: a difficulty in achieving high frequency resolution over a wideband analysis bandwidth, and a reliance on large-bandwidth-and-high-sampling-rate oscilloscopes to capture the resulting ultra-narrow pulses. We introduce a dynamic dispersion accumulation technique to overcome these limitations. By circulating the optical signal in fiber loops containing a dispersion-compensating fiber, we achieve a high accumulated dispersion of -215700 ps/nm. This high dispersion relaxes the required chirp rate of the chirped optical signal, enabling two distinct advantages: When the analysis bandwidth is fixed, a lower chirp rate enables a longer temporal period, yielding a record-high frequency resolution of 27.9 MHz; When the temporal period is fixed, a lower chirp rate enables a smaller bandwidth, generating a wider pulse and thus relaxing pulse sampling requirements at the expense of analysis bandwidth. This sacrifice in analysis bandwidth can be compensated by a duty-cycle-enabling technique, which holds the potential to extend the analysis bandwidth beyond 100 GHz. This work breaks the performance and hardware limitations in dispersion-based systems, paving the way for high frequency resolution, wideband microwave measurement systems that are both real-time and cost-effective.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Our procedure -- which extends the work of Murata-Reall-Tanahashi to include charged scalar dynamics -- involves the fine-tuned scattering of wave packets within an initially super-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime. The resulting extremal solution develops an event horizon along which the energy density diverges and the charge density approaches a constant (i.e., the horizon forms with \"hair\"). We investigate this behavior from the perspective of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse, giving evidence that dynamical extremal black holes act as universal threshold solutions modulo this family-dependent hair. As in the linear instability of fixed extremal backgrounds, the scalar field decays outside the dynamical extremal horizon.

Existing descriptions treat quantum dots as effective two-level systems comprised of an exciton and a biexciton, attributing gain thresholds to biexciton Auger recombination. This assumption is inconsistent with state-resolved optical pumping experiments and basic spectroscopic constraints. Here we present a microscopic theory of optical gain explicitly anchored in the Einstein relations governing absorption and stimulated emission. Within this framework, gain is determined by a spectral balance between stimulated emission from single excitons and excited-state absorption into biexcitonic manifolds, rather than by biexciton lifetimes. Using a spin-boson description of excitons coupled to a lattice bath, we show that gain thresholds and effective gain cross sections are controlled by the interplay of biexciton stabilization and exciton-lattice dressing.

We revisit this problem with physically motivated deformations -- including generalized local interactions, higher Landau level bands, restoration of spin, and explicit breaking of spatial symmetries -- paying particular attention to the competition between CDWs and superconductivity. Our main findings are: (1) Generic local interactions can stabilize a nematic CDW in which integer quantum Hall layers spontaneously 'tilt', yielding unconventional Hall response. (2) We numerically establish that the non-Fermi liquid appears stable to perturbations that preserve effective dipole conservation symmetries that emerge within a Landau level band. (3) Upon explicitly breaking translation symmetry, attraction catalyzes a novel layered superconductor that hosts Weyl nodes, superconducts within each layer, and insulates transverse to the layers.

It influences light absorption and emission, affecting energy conversion limits and efficiency. As a result, quantum coherence is being harnessed to boost performance in quantum heat engines, photocells, and photosynthetic-inspired platforms. Of particular interest in this context is the generation of Fano coherences, i.e., the formation of quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes characterizing an incoherent process. We aim to formalize mathematically the possibility of achieving steady-state Fano coherence in a V-type three-level quantum system using polarized incoherent radiation, without requiring the energy difference between the excited levels to tend to zero. We perform this analysis by deriving the Bloch-Redfield equation from first-principles by quantizing the incoherent radiation. The resulting reduced dynamics of the system are analysed, so as to determine the lifetime of Fano coherence and identify the conditions under which it becomes stationary. We characterise distinct dynamical regimes, ranging from weak to strong pumping, in which steady-state Fano coherence emerges, and we quantitatively determine its magnitude. For each regime, we analyse the generation of Fano coherence as a function of both the intensity of the incoherent pumping and the energy splitting between the excited levels. We also assess how obtaining Fano coherence is modified by symmetric or asymmetric decay rates. These findings indicate that a three-level quantum system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust resource for coherence-assisted energy conversion and storage.

While significant progress has been made with silicon (Si) and silicon nitride ($Si_3N_4$) platforms, they are often constrained by two-photon absorption (TPA) or moderate nonlinear coefficients, necessitating a trade-off between energy efficiency and bandwidth. Tantalum pentoxide ($Ta_2O_5$), possessing both high nonlinearity and a wide bandgap, emerges as a promising candidate; however, current implementations remain challenged by high pump energy consumption. Here, we report a low-loss $Ta_2O_5$ integrated waveguide fabricated via the Damascene process. It enables the generation of a two-octave-spanning spectrum with a low pulse energy of only 92.9 pJ (60 fs, 1550 nm). Notably, the corresponding peak power is a mere 1.36 kW, which is nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of state-of-the-art comparable broadband sources. Furthermore, at the maximum pump energy, our spectrum exhibits an ultrabroad coverage from 450 nm to 3400 nm, spanning nearly three octaves.

The Lagrangian contains functional forms of the bulk while the boundary terms do not contribute to the dynamics. The advantage of the proposition is that the stellar structure equations are up to order two thus the theory is not haunted by ghosts. We obtain explicitly the defining equations for the thermodynamical variables and the geometry for the pure quadratic case since the linear case amounts to general relativity. In trying to establish the vacuum geometry associated with the theory it turns out that two possible metrics emerge through the vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor. Next we analyse the isotropy equation and make the observation that it is autonomous. It is rare that this happens in astrophysical modelling. This behaviour prompted the use of dynamical systems to understand the stability properties of fixed points or fixed manifolds. It was necessary to choose a gauge in order to split the autonomous equation into a system from which we could plot a phase portrait and deduce the stability of solution trajectories.

The correlation between the formation of electron-hole puddles in nearer to the charge neutrality point (CNP), and the role of disorder is fundamentally important for Dirac transport in graphene systems. Numerous studies on graphene further urge the necessity to find a better descriptor for disorder-charge puddles relation, which directly influences electrical conductivity. In principle, the external bias-driven energy level shift and its relevant density of states (DOS) provide information about the effect of total interactive potential on linear energy dispersion in terms of wavevector, but yet to be well-explored. With this ground, here we map the energy quantization for Dirac materials through the empirical relation of voltage-driven charge density in monolayer graphene, using the differential entropy (h)-ruled wavevector (k) mechanics. For this work, we propose the four postulates which are the key observable descriptions of earlier research reports, to study the precise electronic transport via an entropy-guided wavevector propagation approach, along with the Klein paradox, which pertains to the ultrafast dynamics in the Dirac or quasi-Dirac systems. The introduced h-ruled k and h-ruled N relations generalize the electron dynamics in both the unbounded and potentially bounded Dirac systems. Through the quantization mapping procedure under different voltage-driven potential (U=eV) boundary conditions, the observed energy shift from lower to excited quantum state obeys the relation of N(k)=N(U)^3; here, N(U) is the voltage-driven potential energy contribution factor for the quantum state existence.

Recent results have shown that quantum sensing protocols can exhibit superresolution, the ability to discriminate between spectral lines with arbitrarily small frequency separation. Here, we revisit this problem from the perspective of quantum control theory, utilizing the filter function formalism to derive general, analytic conditions on quantum control protocols for achieving superresolution. Building on these conditions, we develop an optimal control framework, the utility of which is demonstrated through numerical identification of superresolution control protocols in the presence of realistic, experimentally-relevant constraints.

In a symmetric configuration, we observe the emergence of diverse phase-matching pathways defined by the dispersive band structure. We develop an analytical model that captures the parametric gain of these interband processes and derive closed-form expressions for the dominant gain maxima; the analytical framework itself readily extends to more complex coupled networks. We further report an asymmetric design that co-engineers mode overlap and dispersion to operate on a compact 7-GHz spacing, free from mode competition.

In this study, we firstly propose a novel generalized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) for arbitrary multi-measurement in the many-body systems, and rigorously derive a significantly tighter bound compared to existing formulations. Specifically, we discuss the proposed EUR in the context of Schwarzschild black hole, where we demonstrate the superior tightness of our derived bound. The study further elucidates the dynamical evolution of multipartite quantum coherence and entanglement in the curved spacetime. A particularly noteworthy finding reveals the exact equivalence between entanglement and $l_1$-norm coherence for arbitrary $N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type (GHZ-type) states. Moreover, we find that quantum coherence is significantly diminished and the measurement uncertainty increases to a stable maximum with increasing Hawking temperature.

We present a protocol for dissipative ground state preparation that exploits this structure by treating the reaction path itself as a computational primitive. Our protocol uses an approach where a state prepared at a tractable geometry is propagated along a discretized reaction coordinate using Procrustes-aligned orbital rotations and stabilized by engineered dissipative cooling. We show that for reaction paths satisfying a localized Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) drift condition in the strongly correlated regime, the algorithm prepares ground states of chemical systems with $N_o$ orbitals to an energy error $\u03b5_E$ with a total gate complexity scaling as $\\widetilde{O}(N_o^{3}/\u03b5_E)$.

In addition to multiple competing electronic instabilities characterized by excitonic order parameters, our framework incorporates the long-range Coulomb energy associated with interlayer polarization. This long-range interaction plays a crucial role, as it significantly influences both the structure and the relative energies of the competing ordered states. We derive a set of self-consistency equations and solve them both numerically and analytically. Our findings reveal that, as the bias field is varied, the bilayer undergoes a cascade of first-order transitions between several ordered insulating phases for which order-parameter structures are explicitly identified.

The significant MCE is observed far above long-range ordering, even in the paramagnetic region, which is attributed to the change in magnetic entropy due to short-range spin correlation arising from (low-dimensional) magnetic frustration. Such a spin-chain incipient MCE above long-range ordering is rarely reported. Interestingly, multiple magnetocaloric switching from conventional to inverse MCE (and vice versa) are observed below long-range magnetic ordering, as a function of temperature and magnetic field, for the R = Nd, Dy, and Er members. However, such MCE switching is absent in the Gd member, which is an S-state atom (orbital moment L = 0). Our systematic investigation of this series demonstrates that the interplay between crystal-electric field (CEF), strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rare earth anisotropy of R-ions play an important role in spin reorientation, leading to multiple MCE switching due to intriguing changes in magnetic and lattice entropy. The maximum change of entropy for Er, Gd, Dy and Nd is 7.8, 6.8, 4.0 and 1.0 J Kg-1 K-1 respectively.

We demonstrate that, in the continuum limit, the discrete evolution on the Krylov chain transforms into the dynamics of a continuous field, which is isomorphic to the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field in the AdS$_2$ throat. This correspondence identifies the linear growth rate of Lanczos coefficients with the Hawking temperature, $\u03b1=\u03c0T$, thereby recovering the saturation of the maximal chaos bound. Notably, the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, a fundamental stability criterion in AdS gravity, emerges as a necessary consistency requirement for the dual description of Krylov subspace dynamics.

Neutral-atom arrays have both been coupled to Rydberg states to enable high-fidelity quantum gates in universal processing architectures, and to optical cavities to realize interfaces to photons. However, combining these two capabilities and coupling atom arrays to highly excited Rydberg states in the mode of an optical cavity has been an outstanding challenge. Here we present a novel cavity-coupled Rydberg array that achieves this long-standing goal. We prepare, detect, and control individual atoms in a scalable optical tweezer array, couple them strongly to the optical mode of a high-finesse optical cavity and excite them in a controlled way to Rydberg states. We show that strong coupling to an optical cavity - demonstrated via the dispersive shift of the resonance of the cavity in presence of the atoms - and strong Rydberg interactions - demonstrated via the collective enhancement of Rydberg coupling in the atomic array - can be achieved in our setup at the same spatial location.

We show that the bulk symbol hosts isolated band degeneracies acting as Berry--Chern monopoles, including a higher-order spin-1 degeneracy with topological charge $+2$ that generically splits into two spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ Weyl points under symmetry breaking. To characterize topology in this noncompact setting, we introduce a strip-gap Chern number associated with finite real-frequency strips of the bulk spectrum, extending band Chern topology to continuum systems. This invariant governs the spectral flow of interface modes induced by spatial variations of the magnetic field and establishes a bulk--interface correspondence at the level of phase-space symbols. By solving the interface eigenvalue problem, we demonstrate that the net spectral flow across the strip gap is determined by the enclosed monopole charge.

We show that the strong $d$-wave spin-momentum locking inherent to the altermagnetic band structure reconstructs the Fermi surface into spin-selective quasi-1D open sheets. This unique topology of Fermi surface drives an instability toward spin-resolved electronic charge density waves (CDWs), in which the ordering wave vectors for spin-up and spin-down electrons condense along two mutually orthogonal directions, forming spin-resolved stripe phases. As a consequence, this results in pronounced gap openings near the Fermi surface, and the superposition of these spin-resolved stripe orders leads to a checkerboard CDW in the charge channel and an antiphase spin-density-wave modulation in the spin channel. Upon increasing temperature, the density-wave order melts at $T_c$ due to thermal phase fluctuation while the gap opening persists, giving rise to a robust pseudogap regime, which eventually closes at a higher temperature $T_g$.

While these diagnostics have been proposed to distinguish quantum chaos from integrability, quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians are widely expected to exhibit trivial Lanczos structure. Here we demonstrate that Lanczos coefficients generated from local boundary operators provide a quantitative diagnostic of whether the lowest excitation gap is controlled by boundary-localized or bulk-extended modes in the long-range Kitaev chain, the model for topological superconductivity with algebraically decaying couplings. We introduce \\emph{Krylov staggering parameter}, defined as the logarithmic ratio of consecutive odd and even Lanczos coefficients, whose sign structure correlates robustly with the edge versus bulk character of the gap across the full phase diagram. This correlation arises from a bipartite Krylov structure induced by pairing, power-law couplings, and open boundaries.

First, compact transmittance expressions for different configurations are obtained using a generalized Fresnel coefficient method. These expressions are subsequently used to analyze various tunnelling outcomes. We show that two types of tunneling effects can be distinguished, depending on the kind of waves that are present in the core layer. When harmonic waves propagate in this layer, the transmittance formula and the phase condition for resonant tunneling are identical to that obtained in a Fabry-Perot etalon. However, in the case of evanescent or damped waves in the core layer, the new expression for transmittance provides another resonant condition related, this time, to the wave amplitude. For clarity, transparent materials are addressed first (including ideal metals), and the implications of absorption are studied later. Different angular-spectral maps are displayed to exemplify the main features of the tunneling effect in each analyzed configuration. To highlight, it is shown that tunnelling can occur in photonic systems with thicknesses up to several wavelengths.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8584\u800c\u900f\u660e\u7684\u4e09\u5c42\u5e73\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u539a\u900f\u660e\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5149\u96a7\u9053\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c10\u6ce2\u6ce2\u7684\u4e0e\u6cd5\u5e03\u91cc-\u73c0\u5c14\u5e72\u6d89\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5149\u900f\u8fc7\u7387\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u632f\u8361/\u8870\u51cf\u6ce2\u7684\u65b0\u7684\u5149\u900f\u8fc7\u7387\u53ca\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u8fd8\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u6750\u6599\u3001\u7406\u60f3\u91d1\u5c5e\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8c31\u6620\u5c04\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5149\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6750\u6599\u5438\u6536\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5149\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u51e0\u6ce2\u957f\u539a\u5ea6\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5149\u5b50\u96c6\u6210\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5148\u8fdb\u5149\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684\u8d39\u6d85\u5c14\u7cfb\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u900f\u8fc7\u7387\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c10\u6ce2\u6ce2\u548c\u632f\u8361/\u8870\u51cf\u6ce2\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5149\u96a7\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5149\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u6cd5\u5e03\u91cc-\u73c0\u5c14\u5e72\u6d89\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e0e\u632f\u8361/\u8870\u51cf\u6ce2\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u7279\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u900f\u660e\u6750\u6599\u548c\u7406\u60f3\u91d1\u5c5e\u7684\u5438\u6536\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5149\u96a7\u9053\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5149\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5149\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

As a result, we obtain that when antiferromagnetic Zeeman field is considered, a finite charge current emerges in both the real and imaginary parts of the current, which are in contrast to the ferromagnetic case where only the imaginary current exist.

Using the full quantum master equation and input-output formalism for two-level systems coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide and driven by a coherent field, we show that an engineered DMI enables strong nonreciprocity in an otherwise reciprocal system, with tunable behavior governed by driving strength, detunings, and phase of the DMI. Using it not only demonstrates nonreciprocal transmission but also demonstrates nonreciprocal quantum entanglement and photon bunching. The system can end up in a pure state as certain decohering channels do not participate. The pure state leads to power-independent perfect transparency. Conditions are derived and depend on the propagation phase, the relative detuning of the two qubits, and the exchange interaction. At these pure-state points, the steady-state entanglement is reciprocal and admits a closed-form expression; away from them, phase control generates strong entanglement nonreciprocity. The DMI also reshapes photon statistics, redistributing two-photon correlations and shifting superbunching from transmission (no DMI) to reflection at finite DMI. These results establish DMI as a versatile resource for engineering nonreciprocity, transparency, entanglement, and photon correlations in waveguide QED, enabling isolators, routers, and superbunching light sources without requiring chiral waveguides.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Such sensors can be spatially separated (gradiometry or gravitational-wave detection) or consist of different internal states (magnetometry or quantum clock interferometry), in which case a signal-amplitude modulation may serve as a signature of a differential phase. In this work, we introduce Phase Estimation from Amplitude Collapse (PEAC) by applying targeted fitting methods for different magnetically sensitive substates of an atom interferometer. We demonstrate that PEAC provides higher trueness (up to 80% bias reduction) than standard tools for perfectly correlated signals. At its working point near, but not exactly at phase settings resulting in vanishing amplitude, it achieves precision competitive with standard methods, contrasting prior claims of optimal operation at vanishing amplitude. PEAC presents a generally applicable complementary evaluation method for correlated interferometers without phase stability, increasing the overall accuracy and enabling applications beyond atom interferometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e45\u503c\u8870\u53d8\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08PEAC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u78c1\u654f\u611f\u4e9a\u6001\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u5b50\u6001\u65bd\u52a0\u7279\u5b9a\u62df\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f8\u5173\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u5728\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u662f\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u53d7\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PEAC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u539f\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u78c1\u654f\u611f\u4e9a\u6001\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u65bd\u52a0\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u62df\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5e45\u503c\u8870\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002PEAC\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8fdc\u79bb\u76f8\u4f4d\u6781\u503c\u70b9\u5904\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e45\u503c\u4e0e\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u771f\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "PEAC\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cotropic\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8680%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u4f4d\u6781\u503c\u70b9\u4e4b\u5916\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u524d\u4eba\u5173\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u64cd\u4f5c\u70b9\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u76f8\u4f4d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684PEAC\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cPEAC\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u539f\u5b50\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u3001\u5149\u5b50\u7b49\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u8fdb\u5c55\u5c06\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Here, we propose a new route to robust unidirectional emission based on the non-Hermitian hybridization of resonances localized in spatially separated layers of a hetero-bilayer photonic crystal. By tailoring the interlayer coupling, we engineer hybrid photonc bands that exhibit strong unidirectional radiation across a broad spectral and momentum range while maintaining theoretically high quality factors. This asymmetric emission is organized by a topological vortex in a pseudo-polarization field defined from the front/back intensity imbalance, which endows the directionality with robustness against perturbations. We further show that, by tuning the surrounding refractive index, this singularity can be displaced in parameter space, enabling reversible switching of the emission direction and a reconfigurable far-field response.

Here we develop two new methods to numerically obtain the $\\textit{exact parameters}$ by means of usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff computation, and find that the difference with the value of standard post-Newtonian parameters can be more than 80% in some situations. We also provide the connection with the Damour-Esposito Far\u00e8se non-pertubative parameter $\u03b1_{DEF}$. We then apply the methodology to the case of Entangled Relativity, and derive these exact parameters for the Sun and the Earth, as well as for neutron stars. We argue that current and foreseeable experiments are likely able to constrain the theory under the assumption that $\\mathcal{L}_m=-\u03c1$, where $\u03c1$ is the total energy density. If $\\mathcal{L}_m=T$ instead, as often advocated in the literature, then there is no deviation with respect to General Relativity and the prospects of testing Entangled Relativity become much more remote in time, as only compact objects with extreme electric or magnetic fields could lead to some deviation from General Relativity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728Brans-Dicke\u6807\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u538b\u529b\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u6846\u67b6\u5f15\u529b\u89e3\u4e2d\u7b49\u76f8\u5173\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u540e\u725b\u987f\u53c2\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8d85\u8fc780%\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u51faSun\u3001Earth\u548c\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u53c2\u6570\u5982\u03b1_{DEF}\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u80fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9Entangled Relativity\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5982\u592a\u9633\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u540e\u725b\u987f\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0eDamour-Esposito Far\u00e8se\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u03b1_{DEF}\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u540e\u725b\u987f\u53c2\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u523080%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u592a\u9633\u3001\u5730\u7403\u6216\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7b49\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aBrans-Dicke\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u7cbe\u786e\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5219\u4e0eGeneral Relativity\u76f8\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6709\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e5f\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Here, we investigate the structural properties of ultrathin (1 quintuple layer) Sb$_2$Te$_3$ grown on single-layer graphene and, motivated by the structural modulations observed at the TI surface, explore theoretically how such nanoscale corrugations may influence the electronic behavior of the system. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM), we observe a periodic rippling of the heterostructure with a wavelength of ~$\\sim8.7$ nm. Energetic analysis reveals that these ripples are not intrinsic but are driven by strain from the substrate during cooling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that while the ideal flat heterostructure exhibits a hybridization gap of $\\sim40$ meV, the ripple-induced structural modulation closes this gap, restoring a metallic state. This gapless phase is not a trivial metal. By combining an effective moir\u00e9 ladder model with spin-resolved DFT, we find that the proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling is redistributed across a dense manifold of minibands. The resulting ``Helical Metal'' has a complex spin-texture beyond a simple Rashba splitting. Remarkably, while the flat system is effectively spinless in this ultrathin limit due to hybridization, the ripples actively restore the spin polarization.

For an even number of particles, the spectra conform to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, as expected for a time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian.

We introduce a fully quantum Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for ILP that implements a coherent random walk over the discrete feasible region using only reversible quantum circuits, without quantum-RAM assumptions or classical pre/post-processing. Each walk step is a unitary update that prepares coherent candidate moves, evaluates the objective and constraints reversibly -- including a constraint-satisfaction counter to enforce feasibility -- and encodes Metropolis acceptance amplitudes via a low-overhead linearized rule. At the logical level, the construction uses $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log_2 N)$ qubits to represent $n$ integer variables over the interval $[-N,\\,N-1]$, and the Toffoli-equivalent cost per Metropolis step grows linearly with the total logical qubit count. Using explicit ripple-carry adder constructions, we support linear objectives and mixed equality/inequality constraints. Numerical circuit-level simulations on a broad ensemble of randomly generated instances validate the predicted linear resource scaling and exhibit progressive thermalization toward low-cost feasible solutions under the annealing schedule.

However, obtaining variable DC in the polymer, typically achieved by implementing a variable exposure dose, is held back due to the lack of software support for fabrication and measurement techniques for validation, adding up to a high barrier of entry.\n  This work presents two major breakthroughs in (3+1)D TPP: design freedom and variable-DC fabrication, that are provided by an open-source slicer, as well as calibration methodology for determination of the RI for any DC. Application examples include grayscale lithography, control over writing direction and trajectories, as well as bio-mimicking microphantoms with carefully engineered 3D RI. Results of the RI calibration demonstrate excellent repeatability, accuracy and stability of variable-DC structures. Supported by in-depth metrological analysis, the goal is to popularize variable DC printing within TPP community and to get more out of the existing TPP systems and workflows.

Several independent studies of the Hawking thermal distribution are shown here to lead to the same final result. This internal consistency is a direct consequence of general covariance, which is analogous to the situation in classical general relativity but highly nontrivial in the context of modified canonical gravity. Holonomy corrections to the evaporation rate enter through the greybody factor, slowing down the evaporation process when the holonomy modification function decreases monotonically.

The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\\text{UV}+h_c^\\text{IR}\\in\\frac12\\mathbb Z$.

So far, no one has discussed whether a protocol for a task in QIT is LU invariant. In [Phys. Rev.

We also indicate that the teleportation proposed in <cite>Nielsen</cite> is not LU invariant. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a state to be suitable for PTP, PSDC-2, and PSDC-3, respectively.

Here we demonstrate coherent perfect tunneling at an exceptional point in a passive one-dimensional waveguide cascade with three coupled interfaces. Using a waveguide-invariant scattering framework, we show that the suppression of a selected output channel originates from a directional scattering degeneracy rather than from resonance or absorption collapse. This exceptional-point condition emerges when interference between boundary-induced feedback loops promotes a simple zero of the scattering response to a second-order degeneracy. As a direct consequence, fixed coherent excitation produces a robust quartic leakage law within a transparency-dominated tunneling window. These results establish directional degeneracy as a general mechanism for loss-tolerant tunneling enabled by exceptional points across a broad class of wave systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u6709\u635f\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u88ab\u52a8\u4e00\u7ef4\u6ce2\u5bfc\u7ea7\u8054\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53d7\u63a7\u95e8\u53e3\u7a7f\u900f\uff0c\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u90fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u666e\u904d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5229\u7528\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4e0d\u53d8\u6563\u5c04\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u8026\u5408\u754c\u9762\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u73af\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u7a7f\u900f\u7a97\u53e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u56db\u6b21\u65b9\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7387\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u900f\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u7a7f\u900f\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u501f\u52a9\u5c16\u70b9\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u5e26\u635f\u7684\u901a\u9053\u7a7f\u900f\u3002", "motivation": "\u62d3\u5bbd\u7a33\u5065\u8d2f\u7a7f\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6ce2\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6709\u635f\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u7a81\u7834\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u8026\u5408\u754c\u9762\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u73af\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53d7\u63a7\u7a7f\u900f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53d7\u63a7\u7a7f\u900f\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u56db\u6b21\u65b9\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u5e7f\u9614\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u7a7f\u900f\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c16\u70b9\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u4e0d\u5e26\u635f\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u6ce2\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u4f4e\u635f\u8017\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002"}}

This effect$\\unicode{x2015}$Rabi oscillations induced by nonresonant geometric drive (RING)$\\unicode{x2015}$requires that the control field is elliptical, enclosing a nonzero area per cycle. We illustrate the effect with numerical simulations, and provide an analytical understanding via a simple effective Hamiltonian obtained from Floquet theory and perturbation theory. We show that RING enables coherent oscillations without relying on resonant energy exchange, allows for high-pass noise filtering, provides access to non-Abelian phases in finite magnetic fields.

Our index generalizes the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index of invertible symmetry operators represented by quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Assuming that all fusion channels of symmetry operators have the same index, we show that the fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators on a tensor product Hilbert space can agree, up to QCAs, only with those of weakly integral fusion categories. We also discuss an attempt to establish an index theory for non-invertible symmetries within the framework of tensor networks. To this end, we first propose a general class of matrix product operators (MPOs) that describe non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space. These MPOs, which we refer to as topological injective MPOs, include all invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and the Kramers-Wannier symmetries for finite abelian groups. For topological injective MPOs, we construct the defect Hilbert spaces and the corresponding sequential quantum circuit representations. We also show that all fusion channels of topological injective MPOs have the same index if there exist fusion and splitting tensors that satisfy appropriate conditions. The existence of such fusion and splitting tensors has not been proven in general, although we construct them explicitly for all examples of topological injective MPOs listed above.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e00\u7ef4\u548c\u96f6\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u975e\u53ef\u9006\u5bf9\u79f0\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u5728\u5c40\u57df\u6d77\u68ee\u4f2f\u683c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b64\u7c7b\u5bf9\u79f0\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8be5\u6307\u6570\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u9006\u5bf9\u79f0\u64cd\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u3002\u5047\u4f7f\u6240\u6709\u5bf9\u79f0\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u878d\u5408\u901a\u9053\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7684\u6709\u9650\u591a\u4e2a\u5bf9\u79f0\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u5f20\u91cf\u79efHilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u878d\u5408\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u548c\u4ec5\u76f8\u5dee\u91cf\u5b50\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u65f6\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u4e0e\u5f31\u6574\u6570\u878d\u5408\u8303\u7574\u76f8\u7b26\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5728\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5efa\u7acb\u975e\u53ef\u9006\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u63cf\u8ff0\u5c40\u57dfHilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u53ef\u9006\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u79ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\uff08MPOs\uff09\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\uff0c\u5373\u6240\u8c13\u62d3\u6251\u5bfc\u5165MPOs\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u9006\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u975e\u5f02\u5e38\u878d\u5408\u8303\u7574\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u9650\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u7fa4\u7684Kausers-Wagner\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u5bfc\u5165MPOs\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7f3a\u9677Hilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4e32\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u9002\u5f53\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u62d3\u6251\u5bfc\u5165MPOs\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u901a\u9053\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5f97\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5206\u88c2\u5f20\u91cf\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u7684undefined\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u975e\u53ef\u9006\u5bf9\u79f0\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u5176\u6307\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u662f\u503c\u5f97\u957f\u671f\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587 lavor \u5982\u4e0b:\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u975e\u53ef\u9006\u5bf9\u79f0\u64cd\u4f5c\u57281+1\u7ef4\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5c40\u57dfHilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5047\u5b9a\u6240\u6709\u878d\u5408\u901a\u9053\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u878d\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u5bfc\u5165MPOs\u7c7b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u53ef\u9006\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u975e\u5f02\u5e38\u878d\u5408\u8303\u7574\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7f3a\u9677Hilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4e32\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5206\u88c2\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u6709\u62d3\u6251\u5bfc\u5165MPOs\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u901a\u9053\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6307\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u62ec:\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u751f\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index;\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u53ca\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u7684\u878d\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef Hilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u5236\u4e8e\u5f31\u6574\u6570\u878d\u5408\u8303\u7574;\u6210\u529f\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u5bfc\u5165MPOs\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u76f8\u540c\u6307\u6570\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u975e\u53ef\u9006\u5bf9\u79f0\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u62d3\u6251\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u901a\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u5165\u624b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u975e\u53ef\u9006\u955c\u50cf\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We show that breaking time-reversal symmetry alone does not imply non-reciprocal transport or a non-Hermitian conductance matrix. Instead, non-Hermitian topology arises only when transport becomes directionally imbalanced. We identify two distinct mechanisms that generate such a response: spin-selective coupling at the contacts and an out-of-plane Zeeman field that unbalances the counter-propagating helical edge modes. We show, for unpolarized leads, that the spin polarization-dependent response to Zeeman fields, provides a transport-based probe of the intrinsic spin polarization of the helical edge states. Moreover, we demonstrate that non-Hermitian skin effect is more sensitive than conductance elements to detect the spin polarization of the edge states. Our results clarify the conditions required for non-Hermitian topology in quantum spin-Hall transport and establish non-Hermitian skin effect as a diagnostic tool for spin-selective coupling and edge-state polarization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ec5\u6253\u7834\u65f6\u81ea\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u4f20\u8f93\u6216\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u5bfc\u7535\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u4ec5\u5728\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u5931\u8861\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd9\u79cd\u54cd\u5e94\uff1a\u63a5\u89e6\u5904\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u4e8e\u5e73\u9762\u7684\u96f6\u0645\u062d\u573a\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u87ba\u65cb\u8fb9\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6781\u5316\u7684\u5f15\u7269\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u5bf9\u96f6\u8feb\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u8fb9\u6001\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u76ae\u5c42\u6548\u5e94\u6bd4\u7535\u5bfc\u8981\u7d20\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fb9\u6001\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u76ae\u5c42\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u4f5c\u81ea\u65cb\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u8fb9\u6001\u6781\u5316\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u65cb\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fb9\u6001\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u5668\u4ef6\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f2f\u5185\u7ef4-\u4f11\u683c-\u67e5\u8328\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u81ea\u65cb\u504f\u5411\u6027\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u96f6\u8feb\u573a\uff09\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "1. \u7834\u574f\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u79f0\u6027\u65e0\u6cd5\u5355\u72ec\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u4f20\u8f93\u6216\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u5bfc\u7535\u77e9\u9635\uff1b2. \u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u4ec5\u5728\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u5411\u5931\u8861\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\uff1b3. \u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u63a5\u89e6\u5904\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u96f6\u8feb\u573a\uff1b4. \u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6781\u5316\u7684\u5f15\u7269\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u5bf9\u96f6\u8feb\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b5. \u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u76ae\u5c42\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u6bd4\u7535\u5bfc\u8981\u7d20\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff1b6. \u7ed3\u679c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u76ae\u5c42\u6548\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u9009\u62e9\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u8fb9\u6001 Polarization \u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\uff0c\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5373\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4ea7\u751f\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u63a5\u89e6\u81ea\u65cb\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u96f6\u8feb\u573a\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u76ae\u5c42\u6548\u5e94\u6bd4\u7535\u5bfc\u8981\u7d20\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63a2\u6d4b\u8fb9\u6001\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u65cb\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

By combining longitudinal and transverse resistance measurements under uniaxial strain applied along the tetragonal $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions, we obtain the elastoresistive responses in the $A_{1g}$, $B_{1g}$, and $B_{2g}$ symmetry channels.

In conventional trapped-ion schemes, realizing a well-defined, coherent gate typically requires spectrally addressing a specific bus mode. As the ion number increases, the coupling to each individual motional mode becomes weaker, so gates on large ion strings mediated by a single mode are necessarily slow. Moreover, addressing a large number of modes demands complex driving schemes, and the fundamentally perturbative character of these approaches imposes constraints on achievable gate speed and fidelity.\n  Here, we introduce a scheme for entangling trapped-ion qubits using a time-dependent magnetic-field gradient, in which all axial motional modes participate in mediating the interaction and the gate construction is nonperturbative. The framework can be used to implement both multi-qubit gates and two-qubit gates between arbitrary pairs in a linear ion string. Through several explicit examples, we highlight the advantages over existing magnetic-gradient schemes and show how gates on multiple ion pairs can be carried out simultaneously.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

An important special case is the phase domain problem, where blocks of a crystal are displaced with sharp jumps at domain walls. The strong-phase, here defined as beyond $\\pm \u03c0/2$, generates split Bragg peaks and dense fringe structure for which classical iterative solvers often stagnate or return different solutions from different initialisations. Here, we introduce an unsupervised Fourier Vision Transformer (Fourier ViT) to solve this block-phase, multi-domain phase-retrieval problem directly from measured 2D Bragg diffraction intensities. Fourier ViT couples reciprocal-space information globally through multiscale Fourier token mixing, while shallow convolutional front and back-ends provide local filtering and reconstruction. We validate the approach on large-scale synthetic datasets of Voronoi multi-domain crystals with strong-phase contrast under realistic noise corruptions, and on experimental diffraction from a $\\mathrm{La}_{2-x}\\mathrm{Ca}_x\\mathrm{MnO}_4$ nanocrystal. Across the regimes considered, Fourier ViT achieves the lowest reciprocal-space mismatch ($\u03c7^2$) among the compared methods and preserves domain-resolved phase reconstructions for increasing numbers of domains. On experimental data, with the same real-space support, Fourier ViT matches the iterative benchmark $\u03c7^2$ while improving robustness to random initialisations, yielding a higher success rate of low-$\u03c7^2$ reconstructions than the complex convolutional neural network baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9 Transformer \u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a Fourier ViT\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5e03\u683c\u884d\u5c04\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u5757\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u591a\u57df\u76f8\u4f4d\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u50cf\u7d20\u6df7\u5408\u3001\u6d45\u5c42\u5377\u79ef\u524d\u5411\u548c\u540e\u5411\u7aef\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u5e26\u6709\u5f3a\u76f8\u4f4d\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684 Voronoi \u591a\u57df\u6676\u4f53\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c La\u2082\u208b\u2093Ca\u2093MnO\u2084 \u534a\u7403\u6676\u4f53\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cFourier ViT \u5728\u6240\u6709\u8003\u8651\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u57df\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u51c6\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f8\u4f4d\u91cd\u6784\u5728\u6676\u4f53\u5b66\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53\u6676\u4f53\u53d7\u5230\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f62\u53d8\u6216\u4f4d\u9519\u5e72\u6270\u65f6\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u4f4d\u533a\u57df\uff08\u8d85\u8fc7\u00b1\u03c0/2\uff09\u5e38\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u6216\u53d7\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u9886\u57df\u5f3a\u76f8\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a Fourier Vision Transformer \u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9 Transformer \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u5e03\u683c\u884d\u5c04\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u76f8\u4f4d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6b65\u9aa4\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u50cf\u7d20\u6df7\u5408\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u6d45\u5c42\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u7528\u4e8e\u524d\u5411\u548c\u540e\u5411\u7aef\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u4f4d\u91cd\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u57df\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u4e0e\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6676\u4f53\u548c\u5f3a\u76f8\u4f4d\u5e72\u6270\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u76f8\u4f4d\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u76f8\u4f4d\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f3a\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u591a\u57df\u76f8\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6676\u4f53\u76f8\u4f4d\u91cd\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The development of data analysis software infrastructure at the current stage is crucial. In this paper, we introduce \\texttt{pespace} which can be used for the full Bayesian parameter estimation of massive black hole binaries with detectors including LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. The core computations are implemented using the high-performance parallel programming framework \\texttt{taichi-lang} which enables automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration across different architectures. We also reimplement the waveform models \\texttt{PhenomXAS} and \\texttt{PhenomXHM} in the separate package \\texttt{tiwave} to integrate waveform generation within the \\texttt{taichi-lang} scope, making the entire computation accelerated and differentiable. To demonstrate the functionality of the tool, we use a typical signal from a massive black hole binary to perform the full Bayesian parameter estimation with the complete likelihood function for three scenarios: including a single detector using the waveform with only the dominant mode; a single detector using the waveform including higher modes; and a detector network with higher modes included. The results demonstrate that higher modes are essential in breaking degeneracies, and coincident observations by the detector network can significantly improve the measurement of source properties. Additionally, automatic differentiation provides an accurate way to obtain the Fisher matrix without manual fine-tuning of the finite difference step size. Using a subset of extrinsic parameters, we show that the approximated posteriors obtained by the Fisher matrix agree well with those derived from Bayesian parameter estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Space-borne gravitational wave detectors will enable milli-Hertz gravitational wave astronomy.

Realizing this requires low photon-loss rates and qubits with tunable electric dipole moments that couple strongly to the resonator's electric field while maintaining long coherence times. For spin qubits, spin-photon coupling is typically achieved via spin-charge hybridization. However, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: a large spin-charge admixture enhances the coupling strength, which boosts readout and resonator-mediated gate speeds, but exposes the qubit to increased decoherence, thereby increasing the threshold required for strong coupling and limiting the time available for accurate state measurement. This makes it essential to identify optimal operating points for each qubit platform. We address this for the donor-based flip-flop qubit, whose microwave-controllable electron-nuclear spin states make it suitable for coupling to microwave resonators. We demonstrate that, by choosing intermediate tunnel couplings that balance strong interaction with long qubit lifetimes, high-fidelity readout and strong coupling are simultaneously achievable.

This mechanism and phenomena are dubbed magnetic topological mechanics, or, magnetopological mechanics in short. Focusing on a two-dimensional kagom\u00e9 lattice spin model, we illustrate how strong spin-lattice coupling drives a spontaneous lattice distortion, resulting in the topological Maxwell lattice with the topological polarization and non-trivial phonon spectra. Moreover, the magnetic field, that directly changes the spin state, indirectly influences the lattice structure via the spin-lattice coupling, thereby providing a method to control the Maxwell lattice and the boundary modes.

We find that the inclusion of radial pressure significantly modifies both the orbital dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave waveforms.

We then present several realizations of quantum state engineering enabled by these recent advances and discuss open perspectives and remaining challenges in the field of integrated quantum photonics with AlGaAs.", "AI": {"tldr": "AlGaAs-based integrated photonics is rapidly advancing quantum optics research.", "motivation": "The increasing need for compact, scalable quantum optics solutions driving advancements in material platforms and hybridization techniques.", "method": "Focuses on AlGaAs properties, recent quantum light sources, photonic circuits, and state engineering.", "result": "Significant progress in on-chip detection, nonlinear optics, and integrated photonics.", "conclusion": "AlGaAs holds promise for future quantum optics applications, though challenges remain."}}

We develop a unified framework to study PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the classical contracting phase so that the results are insensitive to bounce details. We compute the curvature power spectrum for an extremely small dust equation of state using a stable semi-analytical (adiabatic) method, derive the Jeans length of the two-fluid system using dynamical-system analysis and the WKB approximation, and extend the three-zone model from the single- to the two-fluid case to model local collapse. We implement two collapse criteria to obtain the curvature perturbation threshold for PBH formation and estimate PBH mass fractions for benchmark masses spanning low-mass ($10^{-17} M_{\\odot}$) to supermassive ($10^{13} M_{\\odot}$) scales. The critical curvature threshold is extremely small and nearly mass-independent over a broad range $(\u03b6_c \\sim 10^{-21}$ for $10^{-14}$ to $10^{13} M_{\\odot})$, with deviations only near dust-radiation equality. Nevertheless, the square root of the curvature power spectrum at the relevant formation times is many orders of magnitude smaller, yielding vanishingly small PBH mass fractions across the benchmark masses. Compared with the pure-dust case, radiation pressure and the two-fluid collapse conditions significantly suppress PBH production, implying that substantial PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies would require additional mechanisms to amplify curvature perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u6790PBH\u6d53\u5ea6\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0$a$\u503c\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u663e\u8457\u7684PBH\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22PBH\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u5747\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bPBH\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5982$a$\u503c\u6307\u6570\u548c\u89c4\u6574\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5b87\u5b99\u6a21\u578b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684PBH\u5f62\u6210\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7814\u7a76PBH\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u51fa\u5176\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPBH\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

One possible approach to this problem is based on the Barrow--Tsallis entropy. This entropy accounts for both quantum gravitational effects and the nonextensive effects inherent in any long-range interaction. Using a general method we developed for finding the parameters of cosmological models, we discovered a relationship between the parameter describing the microscopic structure of quantum foam and the parameter associated with macroscopic nonextensive effects. We also used our method for finding the parameters of cosmological models to evaluate the feasibility of using fractional derivatives to describe the late evolution of the Universe. The resulting relationships are exact. Therefore, the uncertainty in the relationship between the model parameters depends only on the current uncertainty in the values of the cosmographic parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In particular, it is often unclear how collective enhancement, spontaneous emission, and vacuum fluctuations jointly give rise to both paired biphoton generation and unavoidable unpaired background within a single, self-consistent framework. Here we present a fully quantum microscopic theory within a unified Heisenberg--Langevin--Maxwell framework that explicitly incorporates dissipation and quantum noise, thereby revealing the microscopic origin of superradiant biphoton emission in atomic ensembles. The theory provides a consistent description of parametric gain and unpaired noise within the same open-quantum-system framework and applies to both Doppler-free cold atomic ensembles and Doppler-broadened warm vapors. In the high-optical-depth regime, the coupled propagation equations admit analytical solutions, under which the biphoton dynamics rigorously reduce to an effective collective two-level emission process. Within this limit, the biphoton correlation time and spectral properties are shown to obey closed-form scaling relations governed by optical depth and excited-state decoherence. Our results establish a unified microscopic picture of superradiant biphoton generation and clarify the fundamental role of vacuum fluctuations and dissipation in setting the brightness, pairing efficiency, and temporal structure of atomic biphoton sources, with direct relevance to quantum networking and atomic quantum interfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u673a\u7406\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u548c\u201c\u6696\u84b8\u6c14\u201d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u914d\u5bf9\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u7684\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u80cc\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u5b9e\u9a8c\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u6548\u5e94\uff0c recent\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u6e90\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728Heisenberg-Langevin-Maxwell\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5efa\u7acb\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u6563\u9038\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5149\u5bc6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u5149\u5bc6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7b80\u6d01\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u914d\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u6027\u8d28\u4e0e\u5149\u5bc6\u548c\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u6307\u51fa\u5149\u548c\u70ed\u7684\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u5bf9\u5149\u5b50\u4eae\u5ea6\u3001\u914d\u5bf9\u6548\u7387\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u539f\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u63a5\u53e3\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

The prevailing view, developed over decades, holds that this relaxation is rapidly filtered into a linear regime, establishing linear perturbation theory as the bedrock of black hole spectroscopy and a key pillar of gravitational-wave physics. Here we unveil a distinct nonlinear regime that transcends the traditional paradigm: before the familiar linear ringdown, an intrinsically nonlinear, long-lived bottleneck can dominate the evolution. This stage is controlled by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the remnant and delays the onset of linearity by a timescale obeying a universal power-law. The ghost imprints a distinctive quiescence-burst signature on the emitted radiation: a prolonged silence followed by a violent burst and a delayed ringdown. Rooted in the bifurcation topology, it extends naturally to neutron and boson stars, echoing a topological universality shared with diverse nonlinear systems in nature. Our results expose a missing nonlinear chapter in gravitational dynamics and identify ghost-induced quiescence-burst patterns as clear targets for future observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Newton's law fails in non-linear scenarios.

To address this, we propose a multiparty circular QBA protocol that adopts a semi-decentralized architecture, leveraging circular message gathering and quantum digital signatures to achieve quadratic communication complexity and enhanced fault tolerance. Our protocol is experimentally feasible, requiring only weak coherent states, and is compatible with existing star-shaped quantum networks. Simulations conducted on a global satellite-to-ground network demonstrate that the protocol sustains high consensus rates among multiple users, even when employing different key generation protocols under realistic conditions.

In particular, we identify two qualitatively different approaches to gauging qLDPC codes to obtain their non-Abelian counterparts. The first approach applies to codes that exhibit a generalized form of Poincar\u00e9 duality and leads to a qLDPC non-Abelian Clifford stabilizer code, whose stabilizers are reminiscent of the action of a Type-III twisted quantum double. Our second approach applies to general qLDPC codes, and uses a graph of ancilla qubits which may be tailored to properties of the input codes to gauge a single transversal gate. For both constructions, the resulting gauged codes are shown to have properties analogous to 2D non-Abelian topological order -- e.g. the analog of a single anyon on a torus.

Recent work has shown that surprisingly simple measurement protocols--comprising only single-qubit measurements--suffice to certify arbitrary $n$-qubit states [Huang, Preskill, Soleimanifar '25; Gupta, He, O'Donnell '25]. However, these certification protocols are not robust: rather than allowing constant $\u03b5_1$, they can only positively certify states within $\u03b5_1=O(1/n)$ trace distance of the target. In many experimental settings, the appropriate error tolerance is constant as the system size grows, so this lack of robustness renders existing tests inapplicable at scale, no matter how many times the test is repeated.\n  Here we present robust certification protocols based on few-qubit measurements that apply to all but a $O(2^{-n})$-fraction of pure target states. Our first protocol achieves constant robustness, i.e. $\u03b5_1=\u0398(1)$, using a single $O(\\log n)$-qubit measurement along with single-qubit measurements in the $Z$ or $X$ basis on the other qubits. As a corollary of its robustness, this protocol also achieves constant (in $n$) copy complexity, which is optimal. Our second protocol uses exclusively single-qubit measurements and is nearly robust: $\u03b5_1=\u03a9(1/\\log n)$. Our tests are based on a new uncertainty principle for conditional fidelities, which may be of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The aim is to determine which schemes can effectively recover specific properties of input quantum states, including both linear and nonlinear features, while also quantifying the resource requirements in terms of measurements and reservoir dimensionality. We compare standard three-layer QELM with a spatially multiplexed architecture composed of multiple independent three-layer units for linear (quantum) tasks, showing a linear reduction in resource requirements per unit. For nonlinear properties, the study examines the multiple-injection architecture and introduces a novel distributed design that incorporates entanglement between subsystems within a spatially multiplexed framework, evaluating its performance through the reconstruction of complex nonlinear quantities such as polynomial targets, R\u00e9nyi entropy, and entanglement measures.

Modelling and analysis of the performance of satellite entanglement pair distribution is important for the architecture and design of constellations and space systems. Entanglement-based quantum key distribution, in the absence of quantum repeaters, is especially prone to finite key effects due to low coincident count rates compared to trusted node single-path links. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive study of finite-key effects in the context of direct dual downlink quantum key distribution taking into account the characteristics of the overpass geometries. We develop a high-fidelity model of pair distribution from a low Earth orbit satellite that captures orbital dynamics, elevation-dependent loss, background noise, and extraneous detector effects. We integrate this with a rigorous finite-key security framework for the BBM92 protocol to optimise secret key length across different overpass geometries, orbital altitudes, and optical ground station (OGS) separations.

We consider an architecture with separate measurement and detection modules, and assume that the observables relevant to the detector are unknown to the measurement device. For this scenario, we introduce shadow-based sequential changepoint e-detection (eSCD), a novel protocol that combines a universal measurement strategy based on classical shadows with a nonparametric sequential test built on e-detectors. Classical shadows provide universality with respect to the detector's choice of observables, while the e-detector framework enables explicit control of the average run length (ARL) to false alarm. Under an ARL constraint, we establish finite-sample guarantees on the worst-case expected detection delay of eSCD.

Rev. A", "summary": "High-dimensional quantum systems leverage an expanded Hilbert space to enhance resilience against decoherence and noise. However, standard quantum teleportation is fundamentally limited by the quadratic growth of measurement complexity and high classical communication overhead, requiring the resolution of $d^2$ Bell states and $2\\log_2 d$ classical bits. In this study, we propose a resource-efficient high-dimensional coherence teleportation (REHDCT) protocol. By designing $d$ sets of specialized positive operator-valued measure (POVM) bases, our protocol achieves a 50\\% reduction in classical communication by utilizing one of the $d$ designed POVM sets, which effectively scales the measurement complexity from $O(d^2)$ to $O(d)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by utilizing initial phase engineering to align the target qudit with the measurement basis, theoretically perfect teleportation of quantum coherence can be achieved for arbitrary qudit states. A quantitative robustness analysis reveals that the protocol remains highly resilient to operational errors, maintaining an efficiency above 99.6\\% even under a 0.1 rad phase deviation for $d=16$. Our analysis under various noise models (amplitude damping, phase flip, depolarizing, and dit-flip) confirms that high-dimensional systems exhibit an expanding quantum advantage window as dimensionality increases. Notably, under dit-flip noise, perfect coherence teleportation can be restored through the optimal selection of the POVM basis. These findings establish REHDCT as a practical, hardware-friendly framework for resource-efficient quantum communication in future high-dimensional networks.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, despite promising proof-of-principle results, such methods suffer from high sensitivity to noise (including intrinsic sources such as sampling noise), making their utility for realistic industry-relevant problems an open question. To improve the potential applicability of such methods, we introduce a new variant of thresholding for noisy generalized eigenvalue problems that arise in quantum subspace diagonalization that has the potential to better control sensitivity to noise. Our approach leverages eigenvector-preserving transformations (rotations) of the generalized eigenvalue problem prior to thresholding. We study this effect in practical settings by applying this rotation thresholding scheme to an iterative quantum Krylov algorithm for several chemical systems, including the industry-relevant Fe(III)-NTA chelate complex. We develop a particular heuristic to select the rotation angle from noisy data and find for certain systems and noise regimes that the samples required to reach a target error for ground state estimation can be reduced by a factor of up to 100. Furthermore, with oracle access to the optimal transformation, more dramatic improvements are possible and we observe reductions in sample requirements by up to $10^4$, motivating the continued development of methods that can realize these improvements in practice.

Matrix Product States (MPS) admit more efficient constructions, particularly when accuracy is traded for circuit complexity. Existing approaches to MPS preparation mostly rely on heuristic circuits that are deterministic but quickly saturate in accuracy, or on variational optimization methods that reach high fidelities but scale poorly. This work introduces an end-to-end MPS preparation framework that combines the strengths of both strategies within a single pipeline. Heuristic staircase-like and brick wall disentangler circuits provide warm-start initializations for variational optimization, enabling high-fidelity state preparation for large systems.

The framework incorporates entanglement-based qubit reordering, reformulated as a quadratic assignment problem, and low-level optimizations that reduce depths by up to 50% and CNOT counts by 33%. We evaluate the full pipeline on datasets of varying complexity across systems of 19-50 qubits and identify trade-offs between fidelity, gate count, and circuit depth.

More specifically, instead of considering only the positive-operator valued measure (POVM) operators, we consider their associated L\u00fcders' instrument associated with them. We prove that, when the post-measurement quantum states are available, the task of discriminating two qubit projective measurements is equivalent to discriminating two copies of quantum states associated to each projector pair, extending previous results known for the case where probe states are separable. Then, we proceed by showing that the advantage of considering post-measurement states in measurement discrimination can be large. We formalise this claim by presenting a family of pairs of measurements where the ratio between the discrimination bias of the measurement discrimination task with and without post-measurement states can be arbitrarily large.

Therefore, standard fidelity witnesses developed for distinguishable particles (including qubits) do not apply directly, because they merely certify the closeness to some fixed target state.
