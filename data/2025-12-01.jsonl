Separate from other game-theoretic settings, parallel repetition for the Odd-Cycle game is related to the foam problem, which can be formulated through a minimization of the surface area. In comparison to previous works on minimizing the surface area, we quantify how properties of the marked giant connected component can be related to the maximum winning probability using Quantum strategies. Objects that we introduce to formulate such connections include the topological odd-blocker, previous examples of error bounds for other Quantum games that have been formulated by the author, pearls, consistent regions, and the cycle elimination problem."}

It was predicted some thirty years ago that a single photon traversing a beam splitter could violate a Bell inequality. Although initially debated, single-photon nonlocality was eventually demonstrated via homodyne measurements. Here, we present an alternate realisation that avoids the complexity of homodyne measurements and potential loopholes in their implementation. We violate a Bell inequality by performing joint measurements on two copies of the same single-photon entangled state, where one photon acts as a phase reference for the other, making it self-referential. We observe CHSH parameters of $2.71\\pm 0.09$ and $2.23\\pm 0.07$, depending on the joint measurements implemented. This offers a new perspective on single-photon nonlocality and a more accessible experimental route, potentially applicable to general mode-entangled states in diverse platforms."}

Coherent contributions to the pulse unitary that would traditionally be considered sources of error are treated as part of the gate definition, and compensated in software via single-qubit rotations. This approach enables rapid device-wide generation of high-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates, which are combined with standard calibrated gates to produce an expanded gate set. We show how these gates are directly usable as part of a quantum compiler, synthesizing generic two-qubit circuit blocks into minimal-duration sequences of the characterized gates interleaved with compensating single-qubit rotations. Benchmarking against circuits compiled using the default $CX$ gate alone on 127-qubit IBM hardware shows up to 7X improvement in success probability for Quantum Fourier Transform circuits up to 26 qubits, and up to 9X lower mean-square error in Trotter simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. Our hardware-agnostic characterization and compilation methodology makes it practical to scale up expressive gate sets on quantum computing architectures while minimizing the need for onerous fine-tuning of low-level control waveforms."}

As this platform allows for a precisely tunable anisotropy parameter, the model exhibits a rich landscape of phase transitions and critical phenomena, induced by the interplay of rotating-wave, counter-rotating-wave, and Ising interactions. We develop an improved quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the stochastic series expansion that explicitly tracks the Fock state of the quantum cavity. In the superradiant (SR) phase, this allows us to determine, through data collapse, the scaling laws of the photon number. We also demonstrate the vanishing of parity symmetry in finite-size simulations and show that the Rydberg blockade leads to a significant suppression of cavity occupation. Notably, stronger quantum fluctuations induced by the counter-rotating wave terms slightly favor the superradiant solid (SRS) phase over the Solid-1/2 state. Finally, we confirm that the SR phase transition and the transition from the Solid-1/2 to the SRS are second-order. In contrast, the transitions from the Solid-1/2 or SRS to the SR phase are both first-order for any value of the normalized anisotropy parameter."}

On-surface and molecular junction experiments have shown that tautomerism in single MFPs can be controlled by the magnitude of the current passing through them. Such conductance-based results confirm the potential for tautomeric switching but are not easily translated into device applications, where faster electric-field-gated switching is generally preferred. Previous work has focused on highly symmetric MFPs with four identical pyrrole rings, in which tautomers correspond to different H-N configurations of two protons. Here, we consider a synthesized metal-free benziporphyrin in which one pyrrole ring is replaced by a phenol moiety. This modification lowers the symmetry and increases the tautomer-dependence of the electronic state. The structural anisotropy of benziporphyrins also enhances their selective response to applied E-fields. Here, we use density functional theory and quantum electron-transport calculations to assess: (i) the statistical distribution of three distinct benziporphyrin tautomers under different applied E-fields, and (ii) the transport characteristics of each tautomer. We find that moderate E-fields can influence the tautomerism and that each tautomer exhibits distinct transport signatures, confirming that single metal-free benziporphyrins have potential to act as three-state molecular switches. By fusing two benziporphyrins, we show that the larger manifold of tautomeric states retains distinct transport signatures, opening the way to multistate molecular registers. Finally, we show that fused benziporphyrins can also act as molecular wires with enhanced conductance relative to a single unit."}

Established microwave time transfer techniques only offer nanosecond level time synchronization, whereas optical techniques have challenging pointing requirements and lack the capability of all-weather operation. In this paper, we explore optically derived millimeter-wave carriers as a time-frequency link for full utilization of the next generation of portable optical clocks. We introduce an architecture that synthesizes 90 GHz millimeter waves with a one second residual instability of 2x10^-15, averaging into the 10^-17 range. In addition, we demonstrate a first-of-its-kind 110 m phase-stabilized free-space frequency comparison link over a millimeter-wave band with a one second instability in the 10^-14 region. Technical and systematic uncertainties are investigated and characterized, providing a foundation for future time and frequency transfer experiments among distributed portable optical clocks."}

For example, a photoemission at a given nucleobase means that we both charge it and place an electron right next to a neighboring part of the genetic code. Inverse photoemission means that we trap a free electron (at some empty state or resonance), and instead emit a low-energy photon. This may reduce the damage if it happens at an already charged base, but it can cause extra damage if it arises somewhere else. Predicting the nature of sudden optically-driven excitations, termed quasi-particles (QPs), help us detail interactions and possibly control the damage that might follow. Also, these QPs contain information on the larger DNA assembly because they reflect the fingerprints of nucleobase polarity, the hydrogen bonding in Watson-Crick pairs, and the van der Waals (vdW) interactions in the Watson-Crick-pair stacking that makes up the genome. In this study, we utilize the recently developed (optimally tuned) range-separated hybrid vdW density functional, AHBR-mRSH* [JPCM 37, 211501 (2025)] to analyze the electron-attached and ionized QP states of these DNA components, with a particular focus on dipole- and multipole-trapped empty states (bound or resonances). We also evaluate critical properties such as dipole and quadrupole moments, QP HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, and transition-dipole moments. Finally, we classify the Watson-Crick stacked dimers based on their QP nature. This classification provides the foundation for proposing a model of DNA reactivity and photo-physical activity."}

The double-threshold voltage-current characteristics closely resemble those observed in the collective depinning of the vortex lattice in type-II superconductors. By adapting the model used for vortices to the case of an electron solid, good agreement with the experimental results is achieved, which supports a quantum electron solid forming in the low electron density state. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied, the double-threshold behavior occurs at voltages an order of magnitude lower and at significantly higher electron densities than the zero-field case. This indicates the stabilization of the quantum electron solid, aligning with theoretical predictions. Interestingly, the double-threshold voltage-current curves, indicative of electron solid formation at low densities, are not observed in the quantum Hall regime. This lack of observation does not confirm the existence of a quasi-particle quantum Hall Wigner solid and indicates that quasi-particles near integer filling do not form an independent subsystem."}

The spectrum of the associated scattering problem for a certain class of initial conditions, referred to as periodic single-lobe potentials, is numerically computed, and it is shown that the spectrum becomes confined to the real and imaginary axes or the spectral parameter in the semiclassical limit. A formal Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin expansion is computed for the scattering eigenfunctions, which allows one to obtain asymptotic expressions for the number, location and size of the spectral bands and gaps. The results of these calculations suggest that, in the semiclassical limit, all excitations in the spectrum become effective solitons.

To address this gap, we introduce QuantumChem-200K, a large-scale dataset of over 200,000 organic molecules annotated with eleven quantum-chemical properties, including two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections, TPA spectral ranges, singlet-triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) energies, toxicity and synthetic accessibility scores, hydrophilicity, solubility, boiling point, molecular weight, and aromaticity. These values are computed using a hybrid workflow that integrates density function theory (DFT), semi-empirical excited-state methods, atomistic quantum solvers, and neural-network predictors. Using QuantumChem-200K, we fine tune the open-source Qwen2.5-32B large language model to create a chemistry AI assistant capable of forward property prediction from SMILES. Benchmarking on 3000 unseen molecules from VQM24 and ZINC20 demonstrates that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy over GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B, and the base Qwen2.5-32B model, particularly for TPA and ISC predictions central to photoinitiator design.

Resistive bolometers are limited by electronic noise and the parasitic thermal load of wired readouts, while state-of-the-art nanomechanical resonators require vacuum packaging to maintain the mechanical $Q$ needed for sensitivity, preventing simultaneous fast and high-sensitivity operation. Here, we introduce and demonstrate an uncooled thermal detector that addresses these challenges via an all-optical transduction mechanism. The heterogeneously integrated pixel is engineered for minimal thermal mass, combining pyrolytic carbon absorbers for broadband LWIR absorption, hollow zirconia structures for ultra-low-conductance thermal isolation -- leaving gas-mediated convection as the dominant tunable pathway -- and a silicon photonic crystal cavity that serves as a high-$Q$ optical thermometer. Operating at ambient temperature and pressure, we measure a specific detectivity of $1.1\\times10^{7}$ Jones and a thermal time constant of $34~μ\\mathrm{s}$, corresponding to a speed that surpasses typical high-sensitivity uncooled technologies by an order of magnitude. While the demonstrated sensitivity is instrument-limited, our analysis shows that the device architecture itself supports a >25-fold performance enhancement toward its fundamental thermorefractive-noise-limited value ($3.1\\times10^{8}$ Jones).

To this end, we perform experiments to obtain morphological traits of xylem vessels under drought-stressed conditions, and develop a mathematical framework to model the underlying flow through the xylem, considering several features relevant to the plant system. Performing experiments using state of the art instruments, we measure the morphology of xylem vessels, physicochemical and mechanical properties of xylem walls under drought stressed conditions. Our experimental results unveil that drought reduces both xylem diameter and pit aperture size, implicating hydraulic adaptations of plants to drought stress. We find that the reduced cellulose content in drought stressed xylem vessels lowers the zeta potential and decreases elasticity of the vascular region. Additionally, drought stress alters metabolite activity, increases reactive oxygen species, reduces chlorophyll content, and limits the uptake of essential metallic nutrients. Besides, we perform three-dimensional numerical simulations to evaluate local flow field, mechanical stress, hydraulic conductivity, and radial transport efficiency of xylem vessels under drought stressed conditions. Simulated results reveal that under drought conditions, resistance to axial flow through xylem vessels increases significantly, which in turn, promotes radial transport of nutrients, allowing plants to survive even in drought stress. We show that the radial flow efficiency of xylem vessels becomes notably higher under drought stress than in well-watered control plants. Overall, results of this endeavor provide new insights into how geometric adaptations of xylem vessels modify flow behavior under water deficient conditions, enhancing the plants ability to survive environmental stress."}

This difficulty arises from unavoidable atomic-scale disorder at the interface, caused by alloy randomness, which suppresses valley splitting and, more critically, induces large variations. Here, we demonstrate that CMOS-compatible uniaxial strain can substantially enhance valley splitting, rendering it immune to interface disorder. Atomistic pseudopotential calculations show that uniaxial strain linearly restores the valley splitting suppressed by interfacial disorder, with a large enhancement rate, while keeping disorder-induced variations within a narrow distribution. We reveal that uniaxial strain introduces a new coupling channel between bulk valleys in adjacent Brillouin zones through a small momentum transfer, which markedly reduces the susceptibility of valley splitting to interfacial disorder. These findings establish a viable route to improve gate uniformity in silicon-based spin qubits, paving the way for scalable quantum processors."}

Starting from a canonical Lagrangian for radial metric functions and the curvature scalar $R$, we derive the associated Hamiltonian and show that the Legendre map is regular whenever both the first derivative of $f(R)$ with respect to $R$ and the second derivative with respect to $R$ is non-zero. Within Noether's approach (variational and Lie-derivative forms), we obtain general, canonical, and internal symmetry classes and identify explicit generators; for the quadratic model $f(R)=R^{2}$ these include radial translations and scaling symmetries. We then formulate Mei symmetry conditions as invariance of the Euler--Lagrange equations under the first prolongation, which yields an overdetermined partial differential equation (PDE) system for the generator components. Solving this system for $f(R)=R^{2}$, we find eight independent Mei generators and construct the corresponding conserved currents, some without a direct Noether analog. The analysis demonstrates that Mei symmetries extend the standard Noether framework for higher-order Lagrangians and provide additional conserved quantities relevant to black-hole dynamics in modified gravity. We conclude with a comparison of the two symmetry schemes and outline applications to broader $f(R)$ models and to rotating spacetimes."}

We first extend the conjecture to set-ups where moduli are present and we demand that a particle, produced during the decay of an extremal black hole via the Schwinger effect, is repelled close to the horizon of the black hole. We interpret this condition as the universal criterion imposed by the WGC for any background. Interestingly, the constraint imposed by the WGC on the particle spectrum, before the stabilization of the moduli, is independent of the background, resulting in the same bound both in Minkowski and in AdS space. For the case of AdS space, after the stabilization of the moduli, the WGC in AdS space is reproduced due to the formation of a non-singular horizon of the extremal black hole. In that case, the particle spectrum must satisfy the stronger of the two WGC conditions obtained before and after moduli stabilization. Finally, we use these results to argue that a similar version of the tower WGC should also apply to an AdS background."}

ASTAROTH is a project aimed at developing the next generation of such detectors by reading out their scintillation light with SiPM matrices operated at cryogenic temperatures. This paper describes the innovative design of the ASTAROTH cryostat, consisting of a double-walled copper-steel cryogenic chamber that cools the detectors by means of a liquid argon bath. The detectors are thermalized in a helium atmosphere at a temperature tunable from 87 to 150 K. The design has been validated in terms of heat transfer efficiency and mechanical stress, developing of a nonlinear multiphysics model. The mechanical properties of OFHC copper were experimentally evaluated on dedicated tensile samples. The simulation results show that the structural integrity is guaranteed. At the highest operating temperature, the region with the steepest temperature gradient exhibits stresses that slightly exceed the yield strength of copper (localized strain-hardened condition). Following construction, the cryostat was commissioned and has been in regular operation for over 30 cooling cycles, with no signs of degradation. The temperature can be tuned across the full target range and remains stable within 0.1 K. These results demonstrate that this is a viable design for next-generation dark matter detectors, as well as for a variety of applications requiring uniform and tunable gas-conducted cooling of instrumentation."}

Here we experimentally demonstrate this connection in a two-dimensional degenerate gas of neutral $^{6}$Li atoms using single-atom-resolved imaging. By measuring three- and four-point connected density correlations in real space, we directly extract topological invariants of the underlying Fermi sea, including the Euler characteristic.

The wavefunction of the collision complex is expanded in adiabatic basis states obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for the adiabatic Hamiltonian (the total Hamiltonian of the collision complex minus the radial kinetic energy) on a grid of atom-molecule distances $R$. The resulting coupled-channel equations are solved using the diabatic-by-sector method. We show that the adiabatic approach provides accurate cross sections for cold and ultracold Mg ($^1$S) + NH ($^3Σ^-$) collisions in a magnetic field with ~2 times fewer channels than the standard diabatic basis. We further develop an efficient $R$-dependent basis truncation protocol (RBT), in which the elements of the log-derivative matrix are sampled and discarded as it is propagated from small to large $R$. While RBT can be applied in both the adiabatic and diabatic bases, we show that the adiabatic basis can be reduced to just the open channels at long range, leading to an overall computational gain of ~15-30 for the propagation part of the calculation. The gain is particularly significant in situations where substantial errors in the calculated cross sections ($<$50\\%) can be tolerated or long-range interactions are involved, making the adiabatic basis formulation a promising approach to strongly anisotropic collisions and chemical reactions in the presence of an external magnetic field."}

Utilizing distributed cores, each hosting logical data qubits and logical ancillas connected via classical and quantum communication channels, offers a promising alternative. However, building such a system for logical qubits requires additional optimizations, such as minimizing the amount of state transfer between cores for inter-core two-qubit gates and optimizing the routing of magic states distilled in a magic state factory. In this work, we investigate such a system and its statistics in terms of classical and quantum resources. First, we restrict our quantum gate set to a universal gate set consisting of CNOT, H, T, S, and Pauli gates. We then developed a framework that can take any quantum circuit, transpile it to our gate set using Qiskit, and then partition the qubits using the KaHIP graph partitioner to balanced partitions. Afterwards, we built an algorithm to map these graphs onto the 2D mesh of quantum cores by converting the problem into a Quadratic Assignment Problem with Fixed Assignment (QAPFA) to minimize the routing of leftover two-qubit gates between cores and the total travel of magic states from the magic state factory. Following this stage, the gates are scheduled using an algorithm that takes care of the timing of the gate set. As a final stage, our framework reports detailed statistics such as the number of classical communications, the number of EPR pairs and magic states consumed, and timing overheads for pre- and post- processing for inter-core state transfers. These results help to quantify both classical and quantum resources that are used in distributed logical quantum computing architectures."}

In particular, even a small amount of distortion of the lattice potential can localise otherwise-delocalised quantum states in low-dimensional electron systems, dramatically influencing their thermodynamic properties and charge-transport behaviour. Study of such electron localisation induced by an aperiodic lattice potential remains exceptionally challenging in solid-state systems, since extrinsic disorders can trivially trap electrons in potential minima near disorders, obscuring the underlying quantum-mechanical origin of localisation phenomena. Van der Waals heterostructures can provide an alternative route for explorations of the phenomena via the emergence of superlattice potentials generated by rotating and stacking individual layers. Here, we report strong signatures of electron localisation in helical trilayer graphene, where the interplay of two moiré patterns gives rise to a moiré-of-moiré superlattice with distinct regions of moiré-periodic and moiré-aperiodic potentials. Remarkably, our measurements reveal the presence of double moiré-induced bands and high-order Brown-Zak oscillations, which are direct reflections of the periodic region with two constituent moiré patterns, and a superimposed anomalous hysteretic signal attributable to the aperiodic region. The data strongly suggest that electron wave functions are partially localised driven by the loss of a periodic lattice potential. Our work provides insight into the effects of spatially inhomogeneous lattice potentials on the low-dimensional electronic states and introduces a promising approach to control electron localisation for practical applications in solid-state devices."}

Models of such binaries also serve as useful tools for understanding the dynamics of compact binary systems and the gravitational waves they emit. Using an eccentric Ori-Thorne procedure developed in previous work, we build worldlines that describe the full inspiral and plunge of a small body on an initially eccentric orbit of a Kerr black hole. We now calculate the gravitational waves associated with these trajectories using a code that solves the Teukolsky equation in the time domain. The final cycles of these waveforms, the ringdown, contains a superposition of Kerr quasinormal modes followed by a power-law tail. In this paper, we study how a binary's eccentricity and orbital anomaly angle affect the excitation of both quasinormal modes and late-time tails. We find that the relative excitation of quasinormal modes varies in an important and interesting way with these parameters. For some anomaly angles, the relative excitations of quasinormal modes are essentially indistinguishable from those excited in quasi-circular coalescences. Consistent with other recent studies, we find that eccentricity tends to amplify the late-time power-law tail, though the amount of this amplification varies significantly with orbital anomaly. We thus find that eccentricity has an important impact on the late-time coalescence waveform, but the interplay of eccentricity and orbit anomaly complicates this impact."}

In particular, non-invertible symmetry structures in $D>2$ correspond to the choice of a subtheory of a unique parent one, where the symmetry is a compact group. We present a theorem that generalizes this result to higher form symmetries. We first re-formulate the DHR theorem in terms of Haag duality violations (HDV) for regions with non-trivial homotopy group $π_0$ in the finite index case. In this light, the theorem states that the category associated with such HDV is the dual of a group, and it can be extended to spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios. Then, after eliminating $π_0$ sectors via DHR reconstruction, we show that the HDV corresponding to regions with non-trivial $π_i$, $0<i<D-2$, are associated with abelian groups. Physically, the result shows that generalized order/disorder parameters in $D>2$ are labeled by such groups, in agreement with the case of confinement order parameters in Yang-Mills theories (Wilson and 't Hooft loops). For the special case of $D=4n$ and loops of dimension $k=2 n-1$, the group is further required to have a Hermitian character table. This does not rule out the possibility of an extra $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ factor that is not achievable by Lagrangian gauge models. In the way we find a new proof of the group-like origin of internal symmetries, and analyze the sectors for more general regions, e.g., direct sums, knots, and links. In particular, we find that generalized knot order parameters are classified by the unknot order parameters, and the commutator of knot non-local operators is determined by the linking number."}

Our broadly applicable approach has only two requirements for a candidate qudit: (1) control of the phase-parity and (2) modulation of the amplitude of a field coupling a ground state to an excited manifold which produces a photon during relaxation. We detail how to find optimal excitation pulse shapes, both numerically and experimentally, by employing variational algorithms to feedback on atomic populations.

Theoretical studies suggest that their non-classical correlations enable time-resolved spectroscopy with monochromatic pumping and can selectively isolate specific Liouville pathways in nonlinear optical signals. In an earlier study, we proposed a fluorescence detection scheme that could, in principle, be implemented using existing single-photon detectors [Y. Fujihashi et al., arXiv:2502.02073 (2025)]. In that design, the time origin was defined by detecting the arrival of the pulsed laser used to pump the nonlinear crystal for spontaneous parametric down-conversion, a requirement that made the overall experiment cumbersome. This study theoretically examines an alternative protocol that defines the reference time based on the arrival of idler photons. We demonstrate that this idler-referenced scheme functions effectively when the entangled photons exhibit either negative or negligible frequency correlations. Eliminating the pump-timing channel simplifies the optical layout and lowers the experimental barrier to realizing time-resolved two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy with entangled photons. Although the photons may exhibit frequency correlations in isolation, their frequency-time degrees of freedom can behave as effectively uncorrelated when considered over the full measurement timescale. Therefore, fully exploiting non-classical correlations requires an entangled photon source whose temporal characteristics are carefully matched to the overall timescale of the experiment."}

Here, we employ photocurrent spectroscopy of individual defects to measure the wavelength dependence of their excitation and ionization cross-sections. We reveal that V1 and V2 exhibit similar ionization cross-sections that increase toward shorter wavelengths, while carbon vacancies dominate the more steeply increasing background photocurrent. These results indicate that V2 and its surrounding environment appear more robust than V1 under resonant excitation. We also identify wavelength regimes that optimize defect-origin photocurrent for photoelectrical spin readout relative to background contributions, which differ between single-defect and ensemble measurements.

We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes. These modes form disconnected, block-diagonal subspaces of maximally mixed states, which consist of many-body spin states sharing the same symmetry. A key result is the identification of the underlying symmetry in the HSF, where conserved quantities in each subspace are defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator.

However, achieving tunable nonlinearity at terahertz (THz) frequencies faces significant challenges due to the lack of materials that combine high nonlinear responses with strong sensitivity to external stimuli in this spectral regime. Here, we show giant modulation of THz nonlinearity by optically tailoring the valley degree of freedom in semiconductor-based metasurfaces. Mediated by the resonant behaviors of metasurfaces, photoexcited electrons transition into different valleys in the conduction band in response to the driving THz field, with the transition rate controlled by light intensity. Since THz nonlinearities vary significantly with electron dynamics in different valleys, various nonlinear effects-such as nonlinear transmission and generation-can be efficiently enhanced and modulated within a single metasurface using weak optical pumping. With optical energy as low as a few picojoules, we achieve on-off switching of THz third harmonic generation with a modulation depth exceeding 20000%, along with effective tunability of its nonperturbative behaviors.

We postulate features of the map from entanglement wedges to algebras that provide a natural algebraic interpretation for some of the basic mathematical properties of the set of entanglement wedges. Quantitatively, we suggest a possible generalization of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula that associates the gravitational entropy of a generalized entanglement wedge with an entropic quantity for the associated algebra. Through this assignment, inclusion monotonicity and strong-subadditivity properties shown by BP for generalized entanglement wedges would follow from various inequalities satisfied by algebraic entropies. We include a detailed appendix reviewing relevant algebraic background, including a discussion of algebraic entropies and their inequalities."}

An additional mirror reflector, together with the mirror surface of the sample, forms a double mirror located between the pole pieces of a powerful laboratory electromagnet. The presence of an additional mirror leads to mixing of the amplitude ($ΔR/R$) and phase ($Δφ$) RMCD-components in the amplitudes of the signals at the first and second harmonics of the phase modulation. It is shown that the RMCD spectroscopy technique using a simplified scheme and an additional mirror requires the synchronous measurement of three electrical signals proportional to the amplitudes of the corresponding terms in the expression for the total intensity of monochromatic radiation detected by the photodetector: a constant signal $V_{dc}$ and high-frequency amplitudes $V_f$ and $V_{2f}$ at phase modulation frequencies $f$ and $2f$. The ratios $V_f/V_{dc}$ and $V_2f/Vdc$ determine a system of linear equations for $ΔR/R$ and $Δφ$ with known ellipsometric parameters $\\tanΨ$ and $Δ$ of the additional mirror, which are found either from additional measurements using an ellipsometer or directly (in sity) using the RMCD spectrometer itself."}

It is found that the emergence of multiple long-lived metastable states is fundamentally tied to HSF of the driven-dephasing Rydberg atom system. We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes. These modes form disconnected, block-diagonal subspaces of maximally mixed states, which consist of many-body spin states sharing the same symmetry. A key result is the identification of the underlying symmetry in the HSF, where conserved quantities in each subspace are defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator. Moreover, we show explicitly that the number of the fragmented Hilbert space grows exponentially with the chain length, following a modified Fibonacci sequence. Our work provides insights into many-body dynamics under dynamical constraints and opens avenues for controlling and manipulating HSF in Rydberg atom systems."}

Here we combine classical and quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics simulations to resolve the interfacial organisation of aqueous LiCl from dilute to water-in-salt (WiS) (1--$20~\\mathrm{mol~kg^{-1}}$) concentrations at graphitic electrodes, and compare with electrochemical differential-capacitance measurements from which the potential of zero charge (PZC) is obtained. We uncover a concentration-driven restructuring of the EDL: below $6~\\mathrm{mol~kg^{-1}}$, solvated Li$^+$ dominates the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), but at higher concentrations co-adsorption of Cl$^-$ through solvent-separated ion pairs enforces a near 1:1 Li:Cl ratio at the interface. This transition expands the effective EDL thickness, redistributes the interfacial potential drop, and drives a decrease in the PZC, matching the trend inferred from differential-capacitance measurements on electrolyte-graphite interfaces. Capacitance calculations reveal that while both EDL and quantum contributions vary strongly with concentration, their opposing trends make the total capacitance appear nearly constant for pristine few-layer graphite; for electrodes with smaller quantum capacitance, however, the concentration dependence of the EDL capacitance would be directly reflected in the total capacitance. Solvent-separated ion pairing is identified as the key driver of anomalous EDL behaviour in LiCl WiS electrolytes, establishing design considerations for tuning interfacial capacitance and stability in next-generation aqueous energy-storage systems."}

In this work, we demonstrate a compact and polarization-invariant photonic metasurface, fabricated from hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) and based on radial bound states in the continuum (BIC), which are formed by radially distributed pairs of structurally asymmetric resonators. The metasurface employs multiple symmetry-breaking perturbations to support high quality-(Q-)factor resonances within a footprint smaller than 8 x 8 $μm^2$ - one-sixth of the area of previous approaches. Compared to established hBN metasurface designs, the radial geometry furthermore achieves significantly higher Q-factors with a reduced footprint. By integrating the hBN photonic structure with a WS$_2$ monolayer, we observe enhanced photoluminescence when its resonance is spectrally aligned with the exciton resonance, accompanied by signatures of discrete momentum-space patterns that identify the orbital-angular-momentum-carrying ring eigenmodes. These features persist over a wide range of excitation powers and show minimal linewidth broadening, indicating robust and spatially modulated exciton-photon coupling.

We use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to explore the phase diagram of the prototypical kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a function of doping. We intentionally suppress the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions selectively introduced at two distinct lattice sites, and investigate the resulting system.

We derive multiple inequalities involving entanglement wedge cross sections (EWCS) and show that monotonicity holds for both measured and unmeasured parties in $J_W$ and for the unmeasured party in $D_W$. Unlike their original counterparts, we find that $J_W$ is monogamous for both parties and obeys one-way strong superadditivity, whereas $D_W$ is polygamous for the unmeasured party in pure tripartite states. These results highlight distinctive features of holographic states and support a conjectured duality between $J_W$ and distillable entanglement. Motivated by the relation between EWCS and reflected entropy, we introduce boundary analogues $J_R$ and $D_R$, which serve as computable proxies for classical and quantum correlations without optimization.

Deterministic thermostats and velocity-rescale dynamics closely reproduce NVE reference data over all observables. In contrast, strongly coupled stochastic thermostats (tau less 1 ps) systematically distort dynamical properties.

Beyond convolution acceleration, the kernel's complex nature facilitates the photonic simulation of both irreversible diffusion and reversible unitary quantum dynamics under classical incoherent excitation.

On the $L_y=3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with increasing doping level. In addition to the charge density wave (CDW) states at lower doping, we find an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase by melting the holon Wigner crystal at $δ\\approx 0.15$, which is characterized by suppression of charge density oscillation and power-law decay of various correlation functions. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, the bond-dimension extrapolated correlation functions also support such a Fermi-liquid-like state, suggesting its stability with increasing system size. In a narrow doping range near $δ= 1/3$ on the $L_y = 3$ cylinder, we find a state with an exponential decay of single-particle correlation but the other correlation functions preserving the features in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, which may be a precursor of a superconducting state. Nevertheless, this peculiar state near $δ= 1/3$ disappears on the $L_y = 4$ cylinder, implying a possible lattice size dependence.

Surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy addresses the sensitivity limitations by leveraging resonant photonic structures, in particular, plasmonic and frequency-selective dielectric metasurfaces. However, current implementations of SEIRA approach mainly rely on complex instruments and scanning components such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and tunable external cavity quantum cascade lasers (EC QCLs). Here, we present a compact and high-throughput imaging-based SEIRA platform that combines broadband gradient metasurfaces with a radiofrequency-modulated QCL that generates remarkably broad instantaneous emission spectrum (250 cm$^{-1}$) covering absorption bands of multiple distinct molecular vibrational modes. By matching the resonance spectrum of the compact (1 mm$^2$) broadband gradient metasurface with the laser emission projected on its surface through a dispersive element, we ensure that every QCL spectral component is uniquely addressed for an efficient targeted enhancement of the electromagnetic field. This enables us to use a low-cost and room-temperature mid-IR camera, acquiring in a single frame the enhanced absorption signatures of analytes deposited on the metasurface as a barcode image, thus reducing the acquisition time by up to 3 orders of magnitude compared to the FTIR and EC QCL based measurements.

While the Néel states in bipartite crystals are usually antiferromagnetism (AFM), we find it common that those in bipartite QCs can also be AM or ferromagnetism (FM). Based on symmetry analysis, combined with our comprehensive PQMC results, we propose a general criterion for determining the magnetism classes of the Néel states in a bipartite QC: According to whether the two sublattices are related by the inversion, the other point-group operation, or no operation about the unique symmetry center in the QC, the corresponding Néel state is AFM, AM or FM, respectively.

To unlock the full potential of these systems, the engineering of flexible coupling between multiple magnon modes is essential. Here, we propose a method to realize switchable dissipative Ising coupling in magnon systems, leveraging the three-body coupling among photon, phonon, and magnon. This type of dissipative coupling is a critical component for constructing Ising machines designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. By dynamically tuning the phase of a nonlinear mechanical pump, we demonstrate the realization of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic dissipative interactions. The validity of the scheme is confirmed by numerical simulations, which also demonstrate its robustness against a strong uncontrollable part of dissipation. Our work provides a versatile tool that can facilitate the implementation of magnon-based quantum computing and the exploration of many-body magnon physics."}

Soon published in Physical Reveiw B", "summary": "Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) typically emerge in topological flat bands and are regarded as lattice analogs of fractional quantum Hall states. Conventionally, the flat-band wavefunctions that support FCIs are expected to mimic the lowest Landau level, a condition that can be quantified by the quantum-geometric indicators. In realistic systems, however, FCIs often compete with lattice symmetry-breaking orders, especially when the hosting flat bands not ideal. In this work, we propose stabilizing FCIs by exploiting the intrinsic incommensurability of alternating twisted trilayer graphene, which naturally suppresses competing charge-density-wave (CDW) phase while FCIs are less effected. Within an adiabatic approximation at the supermoiré scale, the effect of incommensuration on local physics can be quantified as phase shifts of interlayer coupling. Using exact diagonalization, we compute ground states in different local patches and uncover a strikingly counterintuitive result: the FCI gap increases as the quantum-geometric indicators worsen. Within certain parameter ranges, we further identify mixed phases where FCIs coexist with CDWs, but with CDWs confined only to patches of weak incommensurability. Finally, we provide experimental protocols and discuss how incommensuration enrich the system's topology and quantum geometry. Not only do our results establish incommensuration as a robust stabilizer of FCIs, but also provide a general paradigm for exploring strong-correlation physics in incommensurate systems."}

However, the interfacial phenomena governing performance in these systems remain poorly unified. The solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), a nanoscale film formed by electrolyte decomposition, is well studied in batteries but its counterpart in supercapacitors has received limited systematic investigation despite growing experimental evidence. This review argues that SEI formation is a universal electrochemical process that occurs whenever electrode potentials drive electron transfer into electrolyte orbitals beyond their stability limits, independent of whether charge storage is Faradaic or non-Faradaic. Differences between battery SEIs and supercapacitor interphases arise mainly from operating conditions, not fundamental chemistry. Engineered interphases created through electrolyte additives, protective coatings, or surface functionalization suppress leakage currents, improve capacitance retention, and enable stable high-voltage operation. By identifying shared mechanisms and establishing transferable design rules, this unified framework provides a foundation for predictive interphase engineering that supports long-lived, high-performance energy-storage technologies."}

The coupling between the two resonators enables efficient broadband absorption within a deep-subwavelength range exceeding 15 times the structural thickness. Numerical simulations, theoretical analysis, and experimental measurements demonstrate that highly efficient (greater than 80 percent) low-frequency broadband absorption is achieved in the range of 198-315 Hz, as well as a 58 percent fractional bandwidth spanning 183-334 Hz. Furthermore, with the outer dimension fixed, adjusting the parameters of the internal resonators enables flexible tuning of the absorption band across a broad frequency range. This work presents a powerful design methodology that eliminates the need for traditional complex spatially arranged multi-resonator assemblies.

The MCE data exhibit pronounced and unconventional hysteresis loops, in which the sample temperature increases during both the up-sweep and down-sweep of the field. In Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, the MCE further displays a striking plateau as a function of time, followed by a rapid temperature rise that begins at the maximum applied field, across pulses with differing peak-field strengths. Our magnetization measurements reveal an inferred temperature of the magnetic subsystem that differs significantly from the directly measured sample temperature and exhibits opposite hysteresis: the temperature is higher on the up-sweep than the down-sweep, unlike the direct measurements. These observations indicate a breakdown of thermal equilibrium between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom on the timescale of the pulse ($\\sim 10^{-1}$s). We interpret the results using a phenomenological model involving two thermally coupled subsystems - the magnetic ions and phonons, and a thermal reservoir, which accounts well for the behavior of Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$.

Then we construct the corresponding RG equation that sums up the leading logarithmic contributions in all orders of perturbation theory. Numerical analysis of these equations in the asymptotic regime $s\\sim t\\sim u \\sim E^2 \\to \\infty$ is performed for two cases: the unit and the V-A operator in the fermion current.

Therefore, in the latter case, radiative corrections restores unitarity, which is violated at the tree level. We compare the obtained behaviour of the amplitude with one in the theory with the intermediate gauge bosons and found an overlap between them."}

Despite the significance of silicon vacancies (V1/V2) in silicon carbide (4H-SiC) for both applications, their ionization behavior has remained unclear because their lack of optical blinking prevents conventional charge-state analysis. Here, we employ photocurrent spectroscopy of individual defects to measure the wavelength dependence of their excitation and ionization cross-sections. We reveal that V1 and V2 exhibit similar ionization cross-sections that increase toward shorter wavelengths, while carbon vacancies dominate the more steeply increasing background photocurrent. These results indicate that V2 and its surrounding environment appear more robust than V1 under resonant excitation. We also identify wavelength regimes that optimize defect-origin photocurrent for photoelectrical spin readout relative to background contributions, which differ between single-defect and ensemble measurements.

The M2 brane has an effective tension T$_2= \\frac{2}{ π} N$ so that the large tension expansion corresponds to the $1/N$ expansion. The value of the defect conformal anomaly coefficient in $SU(N)$ (2,0) theory was previously argued to be b$=12N- 9 - 3N^{-1}$. Semiclassically quantizing M2 brane it was found in arXiv:2004.04562 that the first two terms in b are indeed reproduced by the classical and 1-loop corrections to the M2 free energy. Here we address the question if the 2-loop term in the M2 brane free energy reproduces the $N^{-1}$ term in b. Despite the general non-renormalizability of the standard BST supermembrane brane action we find that, remarkably, the 2-loop correction to the free energy of the AdS$_3$ M2 brane in AdS$_7\\times S^4$ is UV finite (modulo power divergences that can be removed by an analytic regularization). Moreover, the 2-loop correction vanishes in the dimensional and $ζ$-function regularizations. This result appears to be in disagreement with the non-vanishing of the coefficient of the $N^{-1}$ term in the expected expression for the anomaly coefficient b. We discuss possible resolutions of this puzzle, including the one that the M2 brane probe computation may be capturing the surface defect anomaly in the $U(N)$ rather than the $SU(N)$ boundary 6d CFT."}

In Wald's classic analysis (Wald 1974), which was based on the assumption of vanishing injection energy, the black hole was predicted to acquire a universal \"saturation charge\" $Q_{\\mathrm{w}}=2B_{0}J$. However, the physical mechanism that sets the saturation charge must ultimately be governed by the competition between the absorption rates of positively and negatively charged particles. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the problem in the framework of a simple accretion model, where two dilute, equivalent fluxes of charged particles of opposite signs are injected from infinity along the magnetic field lines. The problem then reduces to that of individual particle motion in the electromagnetic field of the magnetized Kerr black hole. Using a combination of numerical and analytical tools, we determine the domains of absorption and establish both lower and upper bounds on the corresponding absorption cross sections. At $Q=Q_\\mathrm{w}$ these bounds reveal a systematic difference between the two charge signs. In particular, for sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the lower bound on the absorption cross section for the \"attracted\" charge exceeds the upper bound for the \"repelled\" one. This charge accretion imbalance (which we find to become extreme at the limit of large $B_{0}$) indicates a persistent net charge accretion at $Q=Q_{\\mathrm{w}}$, implying that the actual saturation charge must differ from Wald's charge $Q_{\\mathrm{w}}$."}

Instead of invoking a stochastic wavefunction collapse, the measurement process is modeled as a bidirectional informational update between a forward-evolving state and a backward-propagating effect, governed by a completely positive generator and its adjoint. Within this operator-based formalism, pre- and post-selected statistics are treated on an equal footing, yielding a unified description of both. The proposed scheme rigorously preserves complete positivity, normalization, and the no-signalling principle, and it is shown to satisfy Spohn's inequality for the associated quantum Markov semigroup, thereby ensuring non-negative entropy production within this setting. The framework admits a direct experimental interpretation across a range of scenarios, including weak measurements, EPR-Bell tests, homodyne detection, and photon counting. Furthermore, in the classical limit, the bidirectional update is demonstrated to reduce to the well-established Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother used in classical estimation theory. These results support the view that the apparent temporal asymmetry of quantum measurement arises not from fundamental dynamical irreversibility, but from informational conditioning, specifically, the one-sided way in which measurement outcomes are incorporated into our description. In this sense, the arrow of time in measurement theory may be understood as an arrow of information."}

We then describe how such a structure can be implemented in a way that is independent from the details of the quantum fluctuations of spacetime via a bi-tensorial quantum metric $q_{αβ}(x, x')$ that yields a finite geodesic distance in the coincidence limit $x\\rightarrow x'$. Finally, we discuss how the entropy encoded by these microscopic degrees of freedom can give rise to the field equations for gravity through a thermodynamic variational principle."}

This paper investigates how flat-space analyticity is imprinted on the de Sitter S-matrix. We derive a relation between flat-space amplitude and de Sitter S-matrix on a specific limit called the Hubble flat-space limit. Specifically, we show that the relation holds for tree-level amplitude exchanging a massive scalar field with any local derivative interactions. Finally, we argue that the flat-space limit is more compatible with the description of effective field theory, as the total energy dependence of de Sitter S-matrix becomes trivial, allowing the Mandelstam variable to be identified as the unique energy scale, just as in flat space."}

We analyze the role of non-conserved energy-momentum tensor equations and investigate their influence on particle production within an irreversible thermodynamic framework. By introducing a novel Lagrangian, we derive modified field equations and establish their relationship with matter production, both with and without entropy generation. Our analysis focuses on ideal fluid models and extends to spatially flat LFRW cosmologies, providing key equations that govern energy density, pressure, and curvature dynamics. Furthermore, we propose a bouncing cosmological model, in which the universe undergoes cycles of contraction and expansion, avoiding the singularity associated with the Big Bang. Our results indicate that this bouncing scenario is feasible within the Rastall-like gravity framework, supported by particle production processes and stability conditions. The violation of energy conditions near the bounce point further confirms the consistency of this alternative cosmological model. The present work is focused on the theoretical foundations and internal consistency of the model; possible observational implications will be addressed in future investigations. We conclude that the proposed theory offers a coherent phenomenological approach to matter production and provides new insights into non-standard cosmological evolution."}

Within the LPA, we show that nonlocality modifies phase-transition patterns and can induce symmetry breaking. Extending the LPA beyond polynomial truncations, we examine the convexity property of the effective potential as $k\\rightarrow 0$ and find that the flow becomes singular for $λ^{2}>0$ before reaching the deep infrared. In the LPA$'$ framework, we find that the infrared-stable fixed point is the nonlocal Gaussian fixed point.

With appropriate scaling choices, we show that the infrared behaviour remains unchanged up to $σ=d/2$ and follows Sak's prediction up to $σ=2$.

The white shark optimizer has excellent global search capabilities. However, its calculation is cumbersome, programming complex and inefficient. In order to improve the computational efficiency of the white shark optimizer, it is improved by using the Tent map, introducing the dynamic nonlinear time factor, setting the automatic termination condition and adding the three-step search method. The improved white shark optimizer is applied to the integer-pixel displacement search. In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of sub-pixel displacement calculation, an improved surface fitting method is proposed by combining bicubic interpolation, improved white shark optimizer and surface fitting method.

The performance of the improved white shark optimizer and the improved surface fitting method is tested by simulated speckle pattern. Test results revealed that the computational efficiency of the improved white shark optimizer is comparable to that of the particle swarm optimization, and the search success rate is as high as 100%. The calculation accuracy of the improved surface fitting method is comparable to that of the Newton-Raphson algorithm, but the computational efficiency is much higher than that of the Newton-Raphson algorithm.

Graph states are used in many applications, such as measurement-based quantum computation, as multipartite entangled resources. It is thus crucial to understand when two such states have the same entanglement, i.e. when they can be transformed into each other using only local operations. In this case, we say that the graph states are LU-equivalent (local unitary). If the local operations are restricted to the so-called Clifford group, we say that the graph states are LC-equivalent (local Clifford). Interestingly, a simple graph rule called local complementation fully captures LC-equivalence, in the sense that two graph states are LC-equivalent if and only if the underlying graphs are related by a sequence of local complementations. While it was once conjectured that two LU-equivalent graph states are always LC-equivalent, counterexamples do exist and local complementation fails to fully capture the entanglement of graph states. We introduce in this thesis a generalization of local complementation that does fully capture LU-equivalence. Using this characterization, we prove the existence of an infinite strict hierarchy of local equivalences between LC- and LU-equivalence. This also leads to the design of a quasi-polynomial algorithm for deciding whether two graph states are LU-equivalent, and to a proof that two LU-equivalent graph states are LC-equivalent if they are defined on at most 19 qubits. Furthermore, we study graph states that are universal in the sense that any smaller graph state, defined on any small enough set of qubits, can be induced using only local operations. We provide bounds and an optimal, probabilistic construction."}

The polymer CDFT ideal chain term is the Legendre conjugate of the single chain generating functional built from standard SCFT propagators, so the Legendre transform converts the iSAFT CDFT Euler Lagrange equations into SCFT fixed point relations. Within this Functional Field Theory, Wertheim TPT1 association free energy can be incorporated into the excess functional, with the mass action variables providing additive SCFT fields yet leaving the propagators unchanged. Linearization about the MF solution produces a reversible mapping for fluctuation corrections, suggesting a universal response that couples the single chain correlation kernel to the iSAFT direct correlation operator, allowing the inclusion of short range structure and association cooperatively beyond mean field. Long range interactions map similarly, showing how functional derivatives can yield SCFT field contributions, while second derivatives yield the long range blocks of the iSAFT correlation operator, providing a unified treatment of polymers. Mathematically, this framework aims to clarify that SCFT and polymer DFT solvers share similar diffusion based propagators, and how iSAFT hard sphere, attraction, and association modules contribute additional field and hessian terms. Specifically, this work provides a Legendre duality proof that places SAFT CDFTs and SCFT on the same MF foundation, and a reversible theoretical framework that transfers iSAFT correlation information into SCFT, enabling modular, quantitative modeling of associating, structured polymer systems."}

Traditionally, parameters such as the cosmological constant or the coefficients of higher-derivative terms are regarded as immutable features of the theory and therefore excluded from the thermodynamic phase space. In our recent work, we developed a fully general framework that promotes every such coupling to a dynamical, freely varying parameter of black hole solutions. This is accomplished by introducing, for each coupling, an auxiliary scalar and gauge field, through which the coupling appears as a conserved charge associated with the global sector of an emergent gauge symmetry. The corresponding conjugate variables naturally arise as electric potentials evaluated at the black hole horizon. As a result, the first law and the Smarr relation acquire additional, systematically determined contributions, yielding a consistent and universal extension of black hole thermodynamics. We illustrate the validity of this construction by revisiting several black hole examples in the literature where the Smarr formula remains inconsistent even after treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable. Our analysis shows that only by including all dimensionful couplings in this generalized manner can one obtain an internally consistent Smarr relation, thereby providing the foundation for a truly universal formulation of black hole thermodynamics."}

While skyrmions have been extensively studied, the stabilization mechanisms and phase behavior of three-dimensional hopfions remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the formation, stability, and interactions of hopfions in thin chiral magnetic films with surface anchoring, using three-dimensional micromagnetic simulations within a material-independent framework applicable to both magnetic and liquid crystalline systems. We identify four distinct types of isolated hopfions, generated by rotating bimeron and finger-like solitons around a central axis. The metastability regions of these precursor textures closely follow the boundaries of modulated finger phases, enabling their size to be continuously tuned through anisotropydriven inflation and collapse. Remarkably, we demonstrate that hopfions near their inflation threshold possess energies comparable with the homogeneous state, allowing them to enclose regions of modulated phases or other solitons, forming higher-order, bag-like domains. In contrast, periodic hopfion lattices remain intrinsically unstable under confinement, spontaneously relaxing into finger phases. These findings establish general principles for stabilizing, tuning, and assembling three-dimensional topological solitons in confined chiral systems, suggesting experimentally accessible routes for texture engineering in liquid crystals via electric-field control."}

Conventional on-chip comb generation typically relies on nonlinear resonators supporting a series of equidistant, low-loss resonances driven by a strong monochromatic signal, resulting in fixed comb spacing defined by the resonator's free spectral range (FSR). Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism for ultrabroadband MFC generation using a highly nonlinear miniaturized magnonic resonator. The small resonator volume, combined with a slow-wave transducer, yields high intra-resonator power density, driving the system deep into the bistable regime where parametric excitation of propagating spin waves facilitates comb formation. Our approach yields more than 350 comb lines spanning a 450 MHz bandwidth, with spacing continuously tunable via a two-tone external drive, representing an order-of-magnitude enhancement over prior reports while operating at relatively low power. The platform is ultra-compact (4-6 orders of magnitude smaller in size than conventional YIG sphere resonators), fully scalable, and highly tunable, enabling precise control of comb properties through magnetic bias and pump manipulation. These results establish a new paradigm for frequency comb technology, unlocking transformative opportunities in microwave signal processing, neuromorphic computing, and precision sensing."}

They also provide key insights into some qualitative aspects of the problem. In spite of this, there remain blind spots that hinder the understanding of the mechanisms underlying some observed phenomena, in particular concerning simplicity and universality in BH spacetimes. Adopting an 'asymptotic reasoning' approach, by filtering non-essential degrees of freedom, can potentially unveil universality patterns by identifying key underlying structural stability mechanisms. We first illustrate such an asymptotic approach by focusing on a BH quasinormal (QNM) Weyl's law, that accounts for the universal asymptotics of the QNM \"counting function\". This permits to identify light-trapping and the (local) redshift effect as the underlying mechanisms, also offering a bridge to the universal patterns found in BH QNM spectral instability. As a by-product, Weyl's law universality formally opens an observational access to spacetime (effective) dimensionality. More heuristically, we sketch a program recently put forward to apply such 'asymptotic reasoning' to address the observed simplicity and universality patterns in binary BH merger dynamics. This program is built as a hierarchy of asymptotic models, potentially making contact with integrability theory in gravity, namely through the background sector in a \"wave-mean flow\" approach to BH binary dynamics."}

While these definitions are equivalent in Minkowski spacetime, they differ significantly in de Sitter. We demonstrate this by computing them both explicitly at one-loop order in perturbation theory. It is well known that the perturbative expansion of the standard effective potential fails converge for light fields. In contrast, the constraint effective potential does not suffer from this infrared problem, and it can therefore be computed using perturbation theory. We discuss the physical interpretation of the two effective potentials. In particular, we provide evidence supporting an earlier conjecture that the constraint effective potential is the correct one to use in the stochastic Starobinsky-Yokoyama theory."}

The NW cross-section is then reduced by isotropic etching to obtain very small QDs, with a maximum observed charging energy > 30 meV. Using low-temperature electrical characterization and finite-element method simulations, we study how charging energies and the onset of electron filling scale with QD diameter. For extremely small diameters, we identify a regime where stray capacitances become non-negligible, limiting further increase in charging energy by diameter reduction alone. This approach to increasing confinement is particularly relevant for understanding the strong spin-orbit interaction observed in crystal-phase QDs, possibly linked to polarization charges at the WZ/ZB interfaces. Small diameter QDs allow considerably weaker interfering electric fields when studied, but the QDs cannot be realized with epitaxial growth alone due to a loss of crystal phase control."}

However, realistic experimental setups render the associated Bogoliubov integrals analytically intractable. To address this challenge, we introduce the Inertial Replacement Method (IRM), a hybrid analytic-numerical framework for computing Bogoliubov coefficients for general moving-mirror trajectories. The IRM replaces the asymptotically inertial portions of a trajectory with analytic inertial extensions, so that numerical evaluation is required only for the finite accelerating segment. We derive perturbative error bounds for both perfectly and imperfectly reflecting mirrors, providing controlled accuracy estimates and guiding the choice of segmentation thresholds. The method is validated against analytically solvable trajectories and then applied to a fully numerical, PIC-based Chen-Mourou plasma-mirror trajectory relevant to the planned AnaBHEL experiment. A key physical insight emerging from this analysis is that the radiation spectrum is determined almost entirely by the finite accelerating region, with negligible sensitivity to the far-past and far-future inertial motion. These results establish the IRM as a reliable and broadly applicable computational tool for modeling particle creation in realistic analog-gravity systems such as AnaBHEL."}

We develop an improved quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the stochastic series expansion that explicitly tracks the Fock state of the quantum cavity. In the superradiant (SR) phase, this allows us to determine, through data collapse, the scaling laws of the photon number.

To bridge this crucial gap, this work presents the first systematic analysis of strong-field, wave-optical GW lensing by a Kerr black hole (BH), extending recent results for non-rotating lenses obtained in Chan et al. to the astrophysically more relevant case of spinning lens. Using the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalism, we compute the strong-field scattering factor (SFSF) and show that the the spin produces characteristic modifications to the lensed waveform, and high-frequency incident radiation is not strongly absorbed by the BH lens, contrary to earlier claims in Chan et al. We further derive an explicit expression for the observed waveform for the general source-lens-observer configuration, showcasing the distortions produced by the scattering and quantifying their departure from the Schwarzschild case. Specializing to on-axis scattering, a mismatch analysis for a \\texttt{GW150914}-like source lensed by a Kerr BH of mass $M=10^2M_\\odot$ situated $100GM/c^2$ away from the source reveals percentage-level deviations from the direct (unscattered) wave at scattering angles near $30^\\circ$, across a range of lens spin values. The mismatch exhibits a sharp decrease at larger scattering angles. For a fixed scattering angle, however, the mismatch shows only a weak dependence on the BH spin in the case of on-axis scattering, which may improve for more general off-axis considerations. The framework developed here offers a unified treatment of strong-field GW scattering in Kerr spacetime and provides tools for interpreting future high-precision observations of compact-object lenses in the wave-optics regime."}

Conventionally, the flat-band wavefunctions that support FCIs are expected to mimic the lowest Landau level, a condition that can be quantified by the quantum-geometric indicators. In realistic systems, however, FCIs often compete with lattice symmetry-breaking orders, especially when the hosting flat bands not ideal. In this work, we propose stabilizing FCIs by exploiting the intrinsic incommensurability of alternating twisted trilayer graphene, which naturally suppresses competing charge-density-wave (CDW) phase while FCIs are less effected. Within an adiabatic approximation at the supermoiré scale, the effect of incommensuration on local physics can be quantified as phase shifts of interlayer coupling. Using exact diagonalization, we compute ground states in different local patches and uncover a strikingly counterintuitive result: the FCI gap increases as the quantum-geometric indicators worsen. Within certain parameter ranges, we further identify mixed phases where FCIs coexist with CDWs, but with CDWs confined only to patches of weak incommensurability. Finally, we provide experimental protocols and discuss how incommensuration enrich the system's topology and quantum geometry. Not only do our results establish incommensuration as a robust stabilizer of FCIs, but also provide a general paradigm for exploring strong-correlation physics in incommensurate systems."}

However, collective effects in different contexts -- absorption, emission, and transfer -- have often been defined disparately, especially across different communities, leading to results that are not immediately transferable between different contexts. Here, we describe all three types of collective effects using a common Dicke framework that resolves the apparent discrepancies between different approaches.

In contrast to two-dimensional skyrmions, which are typically limited to small topological invariants, i.e., skyrmion numbers, hopfions can, in principle, be stabilized with arbitrary Hopf numbers. However, the nonequilibrium dynamics, especially interconversion between different Hopf numbers, remain poorly understood. Here, we theoretically investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of hopfions with various Hopf numbers by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin-orbit torque (SOT). For $H=1$, we show that SOT induces both translational and precessional motion, with dynamics sensitive to the initial orientation. For $H=2$, we find that intermediate SOT strengths can forcibly split the hopfion into two $H = 1$ hopfions. This behavior is explained by an effective tension picture, derived from the dynamics observed in the $H=1$ case. By comparing the splitting dynamics across different $H$, we identify a hierarchical structure governing SOT-driven behavior and use it to predict the dynamics of hopfions with general $H$. Furthermore, we show that by appropriately scheduling the time dependence of the SOT, it is possible to repeatedly induce both splitting and recombination of hopfions. These results demonstrate the controllability of hopfion topology via SOT and suggest a pathway toward multilevel spintronic devices based on topology switching."}

The results show that the LV parameter l strongly affects the inner shadow, brightness asymmetry, and polarization properties of the thin disk. The decrease of l leads to a more elliptical and untilted inner shadow, while increasing l produces a pronounced leftward D-shaped structure of the critical curve. In addition, the variation of l alters the distribution of polarized intensity and polarization direction, especially near the critical curve. Moreover, it also shows that a positive l enhances the black hole's angular velocity, while a negative one suppresses it, indicating that the sign of l determines the trend direction of the LV effect. These findings suggest that future high-resolution EHT observations combining the thin-disk images and polarization patterns could provide valuable tests of the LV effect."}

The two tools for solving the inverse problem of the nanodiamond properties reconstruction using a known Raman spectrum are provided. The first one utilizes a dense neural network trained on a vast array of synthetic Raman spectra. The second approach is based on the stochastic Metropolis algorithm, which updates the ensemble parameters by small quantities, tending to the state with minimal error. Both methods are available thanks to the computationally instant elasticity theory-like model for optical phonon modes in diamond nanocrystals that accurately reproduces the results of the atomistic approaches. Using experimental Raman spectra for nanodiamonds prepared by various techniques, we tested our tools and observed a faithful agreement with the data as well as between the two methods. The open and documented software is accessible online (nanoraman.pythonanywhere.com) and as a Python module (github.com/KoniakhinSV/Nanoparticle_Raman)."}

The global structure of some regular black holes, e.g. Hayward black hole, features an event horizon and a Cauchy horizon, raising fundamental questions about the latter's stability. In this work, we investigate collapse of a scalar field in Hayward spacetime. Under weak scalar perturbations, the inner horizon maintains a stable finite radius. In the circumstance of a strong scalar field, the inner horizon shrinks to zero volume, accompanied by the formation of a spacelike singularity. The Hayward geometry is effectively converted into a Schwarzschild-like geometry. Furthermore, the strength of the scalar field governs the contraction dynamics of the inner horizon. As the parameter $p$ of the initial profile for the scalar field approaches the critical threshold ${p_*}$, the radius of the inner horizon ${r_{-}}$ exhibits a universal scaling behavior: ${r_{-}}\\propto{|p - {p_*}|^γ}$, with a critical exponent $γ\\approx 0.5$."}

Resistive bolometers are limited by electronic noise and the parasitic thermal load of wired readouts, while state-of-the-art nanomechanical resonators require vacuum packaging to maintain the mechanical $Q$ needed for sensitivity, preventing simultaneous fast and high-sensitivity operation. Here, we introduce and demonstrate an uncooled thermal detector that addresses these challenges via an all-optical transduction mechanism. The heterogeneously integrated pixel is engineered for minimal thermal mass, combining pyrolytic carbon absorbers for broadband LWIR absorption, hollow zirconia structures for ultra-low-conductance thermal isolation -- leaving gas-mediated convection as the dominant tunable pathway -- and a silicon photonic crystal cavity that serves as a high-$Q$ optical thermometer. Operating at ambient temperature and pressure, we measure a specific detectivity of $1.1\\times10^{7}$ Jones and a thermal time constant of $34~μ\\mathrm{s}$, corresponding to a speed that surpasses typical high-sensitivity uncooled technologies by an order of magnitude. While the demonstrated sensitivity is instrument-limited, our analysis shows that the device architecture itself supports a >25-fold performance enhancement toward its fundamental thermorefractive-noise-limited value ($3.1\\times10^{8}$ Jones). Crucially, because the optical readout is pressure-insensitive, the operating point can be tuned along the speed-sensitivity trade-off. We expect this architecture to provide a general route toward scalable, high-performance thermal imaging systems."}

This decomposition reveals a significant degradation mechanism: under specific free operations, quantum coherence degrades into classical noise. Consequently, even when the total resource quantity is conserved, its quality decreases. This is quantified by the resource purity metric, $η$. Our theory provides greater detail than conventional approaches that rely solely on monotonicity. It also establishes a new framework for understanding quantum resource dynamics. We validate the theory through numerical experiments on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), demonstrating its utility in diagnosing and explaining the barren plateau phenomenon (BPP). The proposed framework establishes a new paradigm for managing resource quality, complementing traditional resource quantification.

This relationship is exploited through a purely physical-space approach based around energy estimates, in which the dynamical wave operator is treated as a Schwarzschild wave operator with an inhomogeneous term. Going from almost-sharp decay to global asymptotics is achieved by exploiting this relation for the difference between the solution and a carefully chosen global tail function.\n  We further apply our method to several examples of nonlinear wave equations and comment on its robustness to more general settings, such as dynamical spacetimes converging to sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes and higher-dimensional wave operators with even or odd spacetime dimensions."}

In contrast to two-dimensional skyrmions, which are typically limited to small topological invariants, i.e., skyrmion numbers, hopfions can, in principle, be stabilized with arbitrary Hopf numbers. However, the nonequilibrium dynamics, especially interconversion between different Hopf numbers, remain poorly understood. Here, we theoretically investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of hopfions with various Hopf numbers by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin-orbit torque (SOT). For $H=1$, we show that SOT induces both translational and precessional motion, with dynamics sensitive to the initial orientation. For $H=2$, we find that intermediate SOT strengths can forcibly split the hopfion into two $H = 1$ hopfions. This behavior is explained by an effective tension picture, derived from the dynamics observed in the $H=1$ case. By comparing the splitting dynamics across different $H$, we identify a hierarchical structure governing SOT-driven behavior and use it to predict the dynamics of hopfions with general $H$. Furthermore, we show that by appropriately scheduling the time dependence of the SOT, it is possible to repeatedly induce both splitting and recombination of hopfions. These results demonstrate the controllability of hopfion topology via SOT and suggest a pathway toward multilevel spintronic devices based on topology switching."}

However, qubits typically have multilevel structures making them prone to unwanted transitions from fast gates. This leakage out of the computational subspace is especially detrimental to algorithms as it has been observed to cause long-lived errors, such as in quantum error correction. This forces a choice between either achieving fast gates or having low leakage. Previous works focus on suppressing leakage by mitigating the first to second excited state transition, overlooking multi-photon transitions, and achieving faster gates with further reductions in leakage has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate single qubit gates with a total leakage error consistently below $2.0\\times10^{-5}$, and obtain fidelities above $99.98\\%$ for pulse durations down to 6.8 ns for both $X$ and $X/2$ gates. This is achieved by removing direct transitions beyond nearest-neighbor levels using a double recursive implementation of the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) method, which we name the R2D method. Moreover, we find that at such short gate durations and strong driving strengths the main error source is from these higher order transitions. This is all shown in the widely-used superconducting transmon qubit, which has a weakly anharmonic level structure and suffers from higher order transitions significantly. We also introduce an approach for amplifying leakage error that can precisely quantify leakage rates below $10^{-6}$. The presented approach can be readily applied to other qubit types as well."}

The topology enforces a background of fermion correlations that amounts to a condensate wall localized in the Klein Bottle. The wall acts as an order parameter for the broken symmetries.

There is a stronger version, known as supercatalysis, in which the borrowed catalyst is returned in an enhanced form, i.e. more entangled. However, this phenomenon has remained little explored. In this work we introduce the supercatalytic entanglement gain as a figure of merit taking values in [0,1] that quantifies the performance of the protocol (with 0 corresponding to the standard case of catalysis and 1 representing the maximal possible gain) and we study in which cases it can be greater than zero and which strategies can maximize it. While it turns out that every catalytic transformation can be implemented in a supercatalytic fashion with entanglement gain equal to 1 if the state that is borrowed is chosen appropriately, other choices can make the gain strictly less than 1 and even 0. In fact, we prove that a large class of catalytic transformations are not fully supercatalyzable, i.e. there is at least one choice of catalyst for which the entanglement gain vanishes. On the other hand, the construction that shows that supercatalysis is always possible with maximal gain uses artificially highly entangled catalysts. For this reason, we also study minimal supercatalysis, where the entanglement content of the borrowed state is constrained in a precise and natural way. While we consider a scenario where we prove it is impossible to have entanglement gain equal to 1 in this case, we show that there exist minimal supercatalytic transformations with gain as close to 1 as desired. We also explore several examples and observe that, although choosing a catalyst with the least possible entanglement is often an optimal strategy for minimal supercatalysis, this is not necessarily always the case."}

Interestingly, as a direct consequence of non-alignment of the electromagnetic field and contrary to the Plebański--Demiański class (where the field is aligned), such a symmetry no longer generates the full \"tower of symmetries\".

The deep relationship between the circuit LZT and its quantum counterpart can be established through a linearization and block-diagonalization process. Our proposal provides a general method for simulating time-dependent quantum models using time-varying electric circuits, which has been lacking in previous studies, and paves the way for studying more complicated LZT and other dynamical phenomena in circuits and other classical systems."}

Within Noether's approach (variational and Lie-derivative forms), we obtain general, canonical, and internal symmetry classes and identify explicit generators; for the quadratic model $f(R)=R^{2}$ these include radial translations and scaling symmetries. We then formulate Mei symmetry conditions as invariance of the Euler--Lagrange equations under the first prolongation, which yields an overdetermined partial differential equation (PDE) system for the generator components. Solving this system for $f(R)=R^{2}$, we find eight independent Mei generators and construct the corresponding conserved currents, some without a direct Noether analog. The analysis demonstrates that Mei symmetries extend the standard Noether framework for higher-order Lagrangians and provide additional conserved quantities relevant to black-hole dynamics in modified gravity. We conclude with a comparison of the two symmetry schemes and outline applications to broader $f(R)$ models and to rotating spacetimes."}

We present results of the Lindblad equation in the presence and absence of Kac rescaling of the coupling constant. Our results show that for a linear coupling and a harmonic model of the environment, often used in modeling of a quantum interferometer coupled with an environment, the Heisenberg-limited sensitivity may be restored after the Kac rescaling.

This procedure preserves the flux configuration while converting semi-detangled geometries into ABF lattices with nontrivial hopping structure. The resulting flat bands admit compact localized states (CLSs) whose support includes both the flux-threaded plaquettes and auxiliary sites introduced by the unitary transformations.

We postulate features of the map from entanglement wedges to algebras that provide a natural algebraic interpretation for some of the basic mathematical properties of the set of entanglement wedges. Quantitatively, we suggest a possible generalization of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula that associates the gravitational entropy of a generalized entanglement wedge with an entropic quantity for the associated algebra.

Here, we identify the conditions under which a metallic sample exhibits a genuine Drude response and when finite-size and environmental effects must be considered. We further introduce and characterize an additional regime, the Phantom-Drude response, which mimics Drude behavior but instead originates from the superposition of multiple finite-momentum plasmonic resonances. If unrecognized, this regime can lead to misinterpretation of intrinsic material properties. We systematically show how the Phantom-Drude response can emerge and demonstrate its sensitivity to sample dimensions, transmission line geometry, material shape, and gate properties, providing practical guidelines to avoid this regime in future on-chip THz measurements."}

In this letter, we propose an efficient dynamical scheme to discern such long-lived excitations. Employing a Floquet-Lindblad framework, we explore how periodic driving reshapes the key features of a paradigmatic topological model, namely a Creutz ladder. Our results bear testimony to a drive-induced unipolar-bipolar transition in the Liouvillian skin effect, which gets dynamically manifested as a chiral-helical damping crossover. Such a transition effectively rescales the bulk localization length, giving rise to a polarization drift that we identify as a new invariant for efficient diagnosis of the nontrivial phases. As the transition becomes more gradual via tuning drive-rescaled parameters, we uncover signatures of a scale-free localization where skin and extended modes co-exist with distinct decay rates. The emergent hierarchy of the decay rates yields two disparate timescales: a chiral wavefront that rapidly empties the bulk followed by a long-lived regime dominated by robust edge modes. Overall, our results provide convincing evidence that periodic driving serves as a powerful handle to manipulate dissipative topological phases and dynamically isolate the boundary modes."}

In the bulk, we demonstrate the presence of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant and a non-zero mirror Chern number, making $α$-Sn one of the rare cases where dual topology can be observed. We calculate the topological phase diagram of multi-layer $α$-Sn as a function of strain and number of layers. We find that a non-trivial quantum spin Hall state appears only for compressive strain above five layers of thickness. Quite surprisingly, both in the trivial and non-trivial phases, we find a plethora of edge-states with energies inside the bulk gap of the system. Some of these states are localized at the side surfaces of the slab, some of them prefer top/bottom surfaces and some are localized in the hinges. We trace the microscopic origin of these states back to a minimal model that supports chiral symmetry and multiple one-dimensional winding numbers that take different values in different directions in the Brillouin zone."}

While the analytic structure of the flat-space S-matrix is well understood, extending this framework to de Sitter space is challenging, as the expanding background complicates the definition of asymptotic states and breaks time-translation symmetry. This paper investigates how flat-space analyticity is imprinted on the de Sitter S-matrix. We derive a relation between flat-space amplitude and de Sitter S-matrix on a specific limit called the Hubble flat-space limit. Specifically, we show that the relation holds for tree-level amplitude exchanging a massive scalar field with any local derivative interactions. Finally, we argue that the flat-space limit is more compatible with the description of effective field theory, as the total energy dependence of de Sitter S-matrix becomes trivial, allowing the Mandelstam variable to be identified as the unique energy scale, just as in flat space."}

This approach enables observation of quantum effects in spectral regimes where conventional single-photon sources and detectors are unavailable or require cryogenic conditions. By constructing a high-fidelity approximation of a single-photon state with phase-averaged coherent states, we observe the normalized second-order intensity correlation dips significantly below the classical limit of 0.5. The method allows for tunable noise suppression via optimization of the state representation. Our results establish the feasibility of using conditionally prepared classical states to simulate quantum interference phenomena in the radio-frequency domain.

Here, we identify the conditions under which a metallic sample exhibits a genuine Drude response and when finite-size and environmental effects must be considered. We further introduce and characterize an additional regime, the Phantom-Drude response, which mimics Drude behavior but instead originates from the superposition of multiple finite-momentum plasmonic resonances.

We systematically show how the Phantom-Drude response can emerge and demonstrate its sensitivity to sample dimensions, transmission line geometry, material shape, and gate properties, providing practical guidelines to avoid this regime in future on-chip THz measurements."}

These models generalize the $π$-flux square lattice, the prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, and include both separable and nonseparable models with extended and diagonal hopping. For separable systems, the product of subsystem chiral winding numbers correctly predicts the number of zero-energy corner states. However, this invariant fails in nonseparable models, motivating the development of new momentum-space diagnostics. We introduce gauge-independent mirror-filtered winding numbers for Wannier Hamiltonians, constructed by projecting mirror eigenstates onto the occupied subspace. Furthermore, by adapting periodicized Wilson lines from chiral Floquet theory to the case with momentum-dependent chiral operator, we define new invariants associated directly with Wannier gaps. These invariants provide a detailed characterization of Wannier band topology. Beyond symmetric models, we show that certain patterns of mirror-symmetry breaking induce selective boundary gap closings confined to a single boundary orientation while the bulk and other boundaries remain gapped. This mechanism extends to three dimensions, yielding hinge- and corner-selective transitions. Our results clarify the interplay between chiral symmetry, mirror symmetry, and Wilson loops in higher-order topological phases and point to open challenges in formulating momentum-space invariants for general nonseparable models."}

It is well known that the perturbative expansion of the standard effective potential fails converge for light fields. In contrast, the constraint effective potential does not suffer from this infrared problem, and it can therefore be computed using perturbation theory. We discuss the physical interpretation of the two effective potentials. In particular, we provide evidence supporting an earlier conjecture that the constraint effective potential is the correct one to use in the stochastic Starobinsky-Yokoyama theory."}

Here we address this gap, with a focus on minimal optimal measurements, which admit no nontrivial coarse graining that is still optimal. We show that there exists either a unique minimal optimal measurement or infinitely many inequivalent choices. Moreover, the first case holds if and only if the two density operators satisfy a weak commutativity condition.

On-surface and molecular junction experiments have shown that tautomerism in single MFPs can be controlled by the magnitude of the current passing through them. Such conductance-based results confirm the potential for tautomeric switching but are not easily translated into device applications, where faster electric-field-gated switching is generally preferred. Previous work has focused on highly symmetric MFPs with four identical pyrrole rings, in which tautomers correspond to different H-N configurations of two protons. Here, we consider a synthesized metal-free benziporphyrin in which one pyrrole ring is replaced by a phenol moiety. This modification lowers the symmetry and increases the tautomer-dependence of the electronic state. The structural anisotropy of benziporphyrins also enhances their selective response to applied E-fields. Here, we use density functional theory and quantum electron-transport calculations to assess: (i) the statistical distribution of three distinct benziporphyrin tautomers under different applied E-fields, and (ii) the transport characteristics of each tautomer. We find that moderate E-fields can influence the tautomerism and that each tautomer exhibits distinct transport signatures, confirming that single metal-free benziporphyrins have potential to act as three-state molecular switches. By fusing two benziporphyrins, we show that the larger manifold of tautomeric states retains distinct transport signatures, opening the way to multistate molecular registers. Finally, we show that fused benziporphyrins can also act as molecular wires with enhanced conductance relative to a single unit."}

Traditionally, parameters such as the cosmological constant or the coefficients of higher-derivative terms are regarded as immutable features of the theory and therefore excluded from the thermodynamic phase space. In our recent work, we developed a fully general framework that promotes every such coupling to a dynamical, freely varying parameter of black hole solutions. This is accomplished by introducing, for each coupling, an auxiliary scalar and gauge field, through which the coupling appears as a conserved charge associated with the global sector of an emergent gauge symmetry. The corresponding conjugate variables naturally arise as electric potentials evaluated at the black hole horizon. As a result, the first law and the Smarr relation acquire additional, systematically determined contributions, yielding a consistent and universal extension of black hole thermodynamics. We illustrate the validity of this construction by revisiting several black hole examples in the literature where the Smarr formula remains inconsistent even after treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable. Our analysis shows that only by including all dimensionful couplings in this generalized manner can one obtain an internally consistent Smarr relation, thereby providing the foundation for a truly universal formulation of black hole thermodynamics."}

We derive the effective field theory in terms of slowly varying fields and obtain the replica-diagonal saddle point, which we show to describe the average state. We then go beyond saddle point and derive the effective field theory describing the replica off-diagonal sector, which takes the form of a Non-Linear Sigma Model. The symmetry class is either DIII or D, depending on the parameters of the Ising chain, except at a special symmetric point, where we recover the results for free fermions.

Here we introduce an efficient estimation protocol by virtue of common randomized measurements (CRM) integrated with shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, which only requires $1/ε$ circuits. Moreover, in many scenarios of practical interest, in the presence of depolarizing or Pauli noise for example, our protocol only requires a constant number of circuits, irrespective of the infidelity $ε$ and the qubit number. For large and intermediate quantum systems, quite often one circuit is already sufficient. In the course of study, we clarify the performance of CRM shadow estimation based on the Clifford group and 4-designs and highlight its advantages over standard and thrifty shadow estimation."}

We find that the late-time signal contains a distinct train of echoes whose amplitude depends on the angular momentum number $l$. We show that higher $l$ modes produce significantly stronger echoes, as the corresponding potential barriers are taller and more reflective, which results in more efficient trapping of the wave within the wormhole throat."}

However, qubits typically have multilevel structures making them prone to unwanted transitions from fast gates. This leakage out of the computational subspace is especially detrimental to algorithms as it has been observed to cause long-lived errors, such as in quantum error correction. This forces a choice between either achieving fast gates or having low leakage. Previous works focus on suppressing leakage by mitigating the first to second excited state transition, overlooking multi-photon transitions, and achieving faster gates with further reductions in leakage has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate single qubit gates with a total leakage error consistently below $2.0\\times10^{-5}$, and obtain fidelities above $99.98\\%$ for pulse durations down to 6.8 ns for both $X$ and $X/2$ gates. This is achieved by removing direct transitions beyond nearest-neighbor levels using a double recursive implementation of the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) method, which we name the R2D method. Moreover, we find that at such short gate durations and strong driving strengths the main error source is from these higher order transitions. This is all shown in the widely-used superconducting transmon qubit, which has a weakly anharmonic level structure and suffers from higher order transitions significantly. We also introduce an approach for amplifying leakage error that can precisely quantify leakage rates below $10^{-6}$. The presented approach can be readily applied to other qubit types as well."}

In this work, we demonstrate a compact and polarization-invariant photonic metasurface, fabricated from hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) and based on radial bound states in the continuum (BIC), which are formed by radially distributed pairs of structurally asymmetric resonators. The metasurface employs multiple symmetry-breaking perturbations to support high quality-(Q-)factor resonances within a footprint smaller than 8 x 8 $μm^2$ - one-sixth of the area of previous approaches. Compared to established hBN metasurface designs, the radial geometry furthermore achieves significantly higher Q-factors with a reduced footprint. By integrating the hBN photonic structure with a WS$_2$ monolayer, we observe enhanced photoluminescence when its resonance is spectrally aligned with the exciton resonance, accompanied by signatures of discrete momentum-space patterns that identify the orbital-angular-momentum-carrying ring eigenmodes. These features persist over a wide range of excitation powers and show minimal linewidth broadening, indicating robust and spatially modulated exciton-photon coupling.

The IRM replaces the asymptotically inertial portions of a trajectory with analytic inertial extensions, so that numerical evaluation is required only for the finite accelerating segment. We derive perturbative error bounds for both perfectly and imperfectly reflecting mirrors, providing controlled accuracy estimates and guiding the choice of segmentation thresholds. The method is validated against analytically solvable trajectories and then applied to a fully numerical, PIC-based Chen-Mourou plasma-mirror trajectory relevant to the planned AnaBHEL experiment. A key physical insight emerging from this analysis is that the radiation spectrum is determined almost entirely by the finite accelerating region, with negligible sensitivity to the far-past and far-future inertial motion. These results establish the IRM as a reliable and broadly applicable computational tool for modeling particle creation in realistic analog-gravity systems such as AnaBHEL."}

We analyze how fluctuations in qubit frequency, drive amplitude, and coherence affect gate performance over time. The robust pulses suppress coherent errors from drive amplitude drifts over 15 times more than a Gaussian pulse with derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG) corrections.

We propose a general, polynomial-scaling and optimal strategy, based on Lie-Algebraic basic properties, to overcome this bottleneck. It allows for the efficient construction of these generators, also known as Minimal Complete Pools (MCPs), for a target Lie Algebra. As an immediate application, efficiently constructing user-defined MCPs that respect fermionic algebra is crucial in the context of adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver for quantum chemistry. Thus, we introduce MB-ADAPT-VQE, which incorporates optimally constructed MCPs into batched ADAPT-VQE to reduce quantum resources and improve convergence under strong correlation. These MCPs also unlock fixed-ansatz methods based on a Lie-algebraic structure such as the gradient-free NI-DUCC-VQE, enabling simulations surpassing prior MCP limits.

In case of the Compton scattering of both photons the phenomenon of quantum entanglement leads to a measurable increase in the azimuthal correlations of scattered photons, as opposed to a classical description treating the two scattering events as independent. The probability of the scattering of the system of the entangled photons is described by the Pryce-Ward cross section dependent on a difference of the azimuthal scattering angles in the fixed coordinate frame, while the independent scattering of single photons is described by the Klein-Nishina cross section dependent on the azimuthal angle relative to each photon's initial polarization. Since the singlet state of orthogonal polarizations is rotationally invariant, it does not carry any physical information on the initial polarizations of the single annihilation photons. In such bipartite state the angular origin for the Klein-Nishina cross section is undefined, making the Pryce-Ward and Klein-Nishina descriptions mutually exclusive. However, semi-classical simulations of the joint Compton scattering of entangled photons - implementing the Pryce-Ward cross section, but still treating the two photons as separate entities - can reconcile the Pryce-Ward correlations with the Klein-Nishina statistics for single photons by implementing a modified version of a scattering cross section presented in this work."}

Quantum granules are modeled as effects on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, so granular memberships are given by Born probabilities. This operator theoretic viewpoint provides a common language for sharp (projective) and soft (nonprojective) granules and embeds granulation directly into the standard formalism of quantum information theory. We establish foundational results for effect based quantum granules, including normalization and monotonicity properties, the emergence of Boolean islands from commuting families, granular refinement under Luders updates, and the evolution of granules under quantum channels via the adjoint channel in the Heisenberg picture. We connect QGC with quantum detection and estimation theory by interpreting the effect operators realizing Helstrom minimum error measurement for binary state discrimination as Helstrom type decision granules, i.e., soft quantum counterparts of Bayes optimal decision regions. Building on these results, we introduce Quantum Granular Decision Systems (QGDS) with three reference architectures that specify how quantum granules can be defined, learned, and integrated with classical components while remaining compatible with near term quantum hardware. Case studies on qubit granulation, two qubit parity effects, and Helstrom style soft decisions illustrate how QGC reproduces fuzzy like graded memberships and smooth decision boundaries while exploiting noncommutativity, contextuality, and entanglement.

In particular, they showed how the classical decodability of Reed-Solomon codes can be leveraged to solve the Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI) problem quantumly. This approach was further improved by Chailloux and Tillich using stronger soft decoders, though their analysis was restricted to a specific setting of OPI. In this work, we reconcile these two approaches. We build on a recent formulation of the reduction by Chailloux and Hermouet in the lattice-based setting, which we rewrite in the language of codes. With this reduction, we show that the results of Jordan et al. can be recovered under Bernoulli noise models, simplifying the analysis. This characterization then allows us to integrate the stronger soft decoders of Chailloux and Tillich into the OPI framework, yielding improved algorithms."}

Here we report the first cQED implementation, where the qubit remains a regular transmon at about 5 GHz frequency, but the cavity's fundamental mode raises to 21 GHz. We demonstrate that (i) the dispersive shift remains in the conventional MHz range despite the large qubit-cavity detuning, (ii) the quantum efficiency of the qubit readout reaches 8%, (iii) the qubit's energy relaxation quality factor exceeds $10^7$, (iv) the qubit coherence time reproducibly exceeds $100~μ\\rm{s}$ and can reach above $300~μ\\rm{s}$ with a single echoing $π$-pulse correction.

In the single-mode regime, the external drive parameters-the detuning and Rabi frequency-precisely tune the positions and number of reflection peaks, allowing dynamic spectral engineering. In the multi-mode regime, quantum interference between modes governs the scattering dynamics. When the input photon is prepared in a specific coherent superposition, multi-mode effects restore single-mode-like behavior, enabling Fano-mediated complete reflection. Conversely, a single-mode input prevents complete reflection even at the Fano resonance, while EIT-driven transmission persists. These results demonstrate a versatile toolbox for photonic quantum control in multi-mode waveguides, paving the way for applications such as broadband dual-frequency filters and multi-mode spectrometers."}

However, under such device-constrained execution conditions, the scalability of learning is severely limited by barren plateaus, where gradients collapse to zero and training stalls. This poses a practical challenge to delivering VQA-enabled intelligence on QIoT endpoints, which often have few qubits, constrained shot budgets, and strict latency requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach for escaping barren plateaus by including negative learning rates into the optimization process in QIoT devices. Our method introduces controlled instability into model training by switching between positive and negative learning phases, allowing recovery of significant gradients and exploring flatter areas in the loss landscape. We theoretically evaluate the effect of negative learning on gradient variance and propose conditions under which it helps escape from barren zones. The experimental findings on typical VQA benchmarks show consistent improvements in both convergence and simulation results over traditional optimizers. By escaping barren plateaus, our approach leads to a novel pathway for robust optimization in quantum-classical hybrid models."}

Our results reveal that wave-particle duality in induced coherence is not limited by interferometer geometry but by measurement optimality in zero-error discrimination on the idler, with experimentally testable consequences predicting distinguishability beyond that inferred from visibility alone.

However, recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing. Here, we find experimental evidence that the actual QPG rates in strongly driven SCQs are remarkably lower than expected. We apply intense drive fields through readout resonators, reaching effective qubit drive amplitudes up to 300 GHz. The nonlinear response of the resonators enables quantification of the energy loss from SCQs into their environments, including the contribution from QPG. Even when conservatively attributing all measured dissipation to QPG, the observed energy dissipation rates are far lower than expected from the ideal QPG model. Meanwhile, calculations incorporating high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) near 17-20 GHz in the QPG conductance can explain the experiments. These HFCs yield QPG rates a few orders of magnitude smaller than those without HFCs, providing evidence that the QPG rates are lower than predicted by the ideal model. Our findings prevent overestimation of drive-induced QPG and provide crucial guidance for operating superconducting quantum processors. Identifying the microscopic origin of the discrepancy opens new material and device opportunities to further mitigate QPG."}

What remains secret is the choice of parameter $θ$ that selects a specific entanglement functional $E_θ$ and the corresponding foliation into constant-entanglement hypersurfaces. In this setting, classical messages are encoded not only in the sequence of states but also in the pattern of upward, downward, or tangential steps with respect to the hidden foliation.

This finding implies that, counterintuitively, slower quenches lead to faster charging. Such a quench suppresses coherent energy oscillations between the battery and the charger, allowing an unbounded increase in power. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of charger dissipation, which imposes a finite limit on the maximum power.

We formally prove this isomorphism and show that for physical Hamiltonians with bounded locality and interaction degree, the resulting graph has a bounded degree, reducing the computational problem of finding the automorphism group to polynomial time. The algorithm's validity is empirically confirmed on various physical models with known symmetries. We further show that the problem of deciding whether two Hamiltonians are permutation-equivalent is polynomial-time reducible to the graph isomorphism problem using our graph representation.

Nonstabilizerness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, and efficient SRE estimations are highly beneficial in practical applications. We address the nonstabilizerness estimation problem through three supervised learning formulations starting from easier classification tasks to the more challenging regression task. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN manages to capture meaningful features from the graph-based circuit representation, resulting in robust generalization performances achieved across diverse scenarios. In classification tasks, the GNN is trained on product states and generalizes on circuits evolved under Clifford operations, entangled states, and circuits with higher number of qubits. In the regression task, the GNN significantly improves the SRE estimation on out-of-distribution circuits with higher number of qubits and gate counts compared to previous work, for both random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the transverse-field Ising model. Moreover, the graph representation of quantum circuits naturally integrates hardware-specific information. Simulations on noisy quantum hardware highlight the potential of the proposed GNN to predict the SRE measured on quantum devices."}

Employing a purification-based approach, we prove that mixed-state saturation occurs precisely when three structural criteria are fulfilled: the state's support is confined to the sum of two energy eigenspaces (the ground level and a single excited level); each eigenvector of the state with nonzero weight is a fixed superposition of one ground- and one excited-state energy eigenvector (determined by the minimizer of the objective function identified by Giovannetti et al.) and all such eigenvectors evolve in mutually orthogonal two-dimensional subspaces. These requirements impose a strict rank bound, ruling out saturation by any faithful state. For qubit systems, we derive a purity-resolved and tight Margolus-Levitin bound that reduces to the pure-state result in the limit of unit purity. Through a time-reversal argument, we further extend the dual Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit to mixed states and establish the corresponding saturation conditions."}

This can be achieved with optical resonators that increase the local density of states, thereby enhancing the radiative decay of emitters on a specific transition. However, small mode volumes and high quality factors are required in this approach, which restricts the multiplexing capacity and necessitates precise tuning of the resonator frequency. Here, we demonstrate an alternative method that avoids these bottlenecks for up-scaling. Instead of strongly enhancing the emission on a selected transition, we suppress all other radiative decay channels by tailoring the photonic bandgap of a W1 silicon photonic crystal waveguide. In such a device, we can spectrally resolve and individually address tens of erbium dopants. We find that their emission is channeled to the desired transition, ensuring efficient collection. At the same time, their lifetimes are preserved or even extended compared to the bulk in a broad spectral range. Furthermore, the extended mode volume facilitates a low dopant concentration and thus a large spatial separation between the emitters, avoiding unwanted interactions that would limit their coherence. The demonstrated approach of inhibiting unwanted spontaneous emission can be combined with Purcell enhancement and applied to other leading spin-qubit platforms. It thus opens intriguing perspectives for photonic quantum technologies."}

This formalism utilizes cubature formulas from multivariate approximation theory, which connect the continuous geometry of the phase space to discrete, weighted point sets, ensuring the conditions for error correction are met. We demonstrate that this framework provides a unifying perspective, revealing that well-established codes, such as cat codes and the recently proposed quantum spherical codes (QSCs), are specific instances of QCCs corresponding to uniform weights on a single energy shell. The QCC formalism unlocks a vast new design space, encompassing non-uniform superpositions and multi-shell configurations. We leverage this framework to discover several new families of codes derived from Euclidean designs, allowing for greater geometric separation between logical states, which correlates with improved performance under photon loss.

Establishing rigorous uncertainty bounds is essential for elevating such devices from qualitative demonstrations to quantitative scientific tools. Here we introduce a general framework for bounded-error quantum simulation, which provides predictions for many-body observables with experimentally quantifiable uncertainties. The approach combines Hamiltonian and Lindbladian Learning--a statistically rigorous inference of the coherent and dissipative generators governing the dynamics--with the propagation of their uncertainties into the simulated observables, yielding confidence bounds directly derived from experimental data. We demonstrate this framework on trapped-ion quantum simulators implementing long-range Ising interactions with up to 51 ions, and validate it where classical comparison is possible. We analyze error bounds on two levels. First, we learn an open-system model from experimental data collected in an initial time window of quench dynamics, simulate the corresponding master equation, and quantitatively verify consistency between theoretical predictions and measured dynamics at long times. Second, we establish error bounds directly from experimental measurements alone, without relying on classical simulation--crucial for entering regimes of quantum advantage. The learned models reproduce the experimental evolution within the predicted bounds, demonstrating quantitative reliability and internal consistency. Bounded-error quantum simulation provides a scalable foundation for trusted analog quantum computation, bridging the gap between experimental platforms and predictive many-body physics.

We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes. These modes form disconnected, block-diagonal subspaces of maximally mixed states, which consist of many-body spin states sharing the same symmetry. A key result is the identification of the underlying symmetry in the HSF, where conserved quantities in each subspace are defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator. Moreover, we show explicitly that the number of the fragmented Hilbert space grows exponentially with the chain length, following a modified Fibonacci sequence. Our work provides insights into many-body dynamics under dynamical constraints and opens avenues for controlling and manipulating HSF in Rydberg atom systems."}

Pronounced temporal correlations of such output fields benefit the sensitivity of measurement protocols, which we show theoretically by employing a boundary time crystal as a light source. The fundamental bound on the precision of such estimation shows scaling with system size that surpasses the Heisenberg limit and obeys the standard quantum limit in the measurement time. This scaling can be partially harnessed by a protocol, in which the phase shifted light field is guided into an auxiliary replica system, which serves as a detector that is sensitive to non-trivial temporal correlations of the light."}

In this work, we introduce COMPAS, an architecture that realizes multivariate trace estimation across a multi-party network of interconnected modular and distributed QPUs by leveraging pre-shared entangled Bell pairs as resources. COMPAS adds only a constant depth overhead and consumes Bell pairs at a rate linear in circuit width, making it suitable for near-term hardware. Unlike other schemes, which must choose between asymptotic optimality in circuit depth or GHZ width, COMPAS achieves both at once. Additionally, we analyze network-level errors and simulate the effects of circuit-level noise on the architecture."}

Near-maximal entanglement arises in systems exhibiting thermalization or pre-thermalization, where the system converges to a steady state with a fixed energy density. Classical simulation of the time dependence of such wave functions requires exponential resources. However, typical computations aim to estimate expectation values of local operators and correlation functions to some expected precision. For thermalizing systems at sufficiently high energy densities, such computations do not require storing the full wave function. Nonetheless, constructing classical algorithms for intermediate energy densities has remained a challenge. In this paper, we propose a heuristic approach to accelerate the convergence of Matrix Product State (MPS) simulations of expectation values applicable in a broad range of energy densities. We estimate the desired observables by rescaling the MPS results at low bond dimensions with a factor that depends only on the fidelity of the MPS wave function. Using this technique, we simulated the dynamics of the two-dimensional Transverse-Field Ising Model (TFIM) on a $7\\times8$ grid with periodic boundary conditions, using a maximum bond dimension of $χ= 4096$ on a single A100 GPU.

In this paper we introduce an approach to accurately compute the energy variance of an iPEPS, enabling systematic extrapolations of the ground-state energy to the exact zero-variance limit. It is based on the contraction of a large cell of tensors using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTRMG) method, to evaluate the correlator between pairs of local Hamiltonian terms. We show that the accuracy of this approach is substantially higher than that of previous methods, and we demonstrate the usefulness of variance extrapolation for the Heisenberg model, for a free fermionic model, and for the Shastry-Sutherland model. Finally, we apply the approach to compute $\\langle \\langle \\mathcal{L}^\\dagger \\mathcal{L} \\rangle \\rangle$ for an open quantum system described by the Liouvillian $\\mathcal{L}$, in order to assess the quality of the steady-state solution and to locate first-order phase transitions, using the dissipative quantum Ising model as an example."}

Among them, polarization-entangled photon pairs play an important role due to their straightforward state manipulation and direct use in quantum key distribution, teleportation, and network protocols. However, realizing compact, efficient, and scalable polarization-entangled sources that meet the requirements of practical deployment remains a major challenge. Here, we present a simple yet high-performance on-chip polarization-entangled photon-pair source on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). Our device employs dual quasi-phase matching (D-QPM) that sequentially supports type-0 and type-I spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a single nanophotonic waveguide, eliminating the need for interferometers, polarization rotators, or other complex circuits. The source directly produces high-fidelity Bell states with broad bandwidth, high brightness, and low noise. Using this integrated platform, we realize wavelength-multiplexed entanglement distribution in a four-user quantum network deployed over metropolitan fiber links up to 50 km. These results establish a robust and scalable pathway toward practical quantum communication systems and multi-user quantum mesh networks based on integrated photonics."}

Compared to superconducting platforms, spin qubits can operate at higher temperatures from tens of millikelvin up to a few kelvin. However, recent experiments show a non-trivial and often non-monotonic dependence of the spin qubit frequency on the temperature, featuring a region of decreased sensitivity to temperature fluctuations. In this work, we aim to gain insight into the physics behind such temperature shifts in the low-temperature limit. Investigating the spin qubits' interaction with phonon modes of the host material, we can explain some of the key features of the observed behavior and estimate the temperature sweet spot for the qubit frequency shift."}

In this letter, we propose an efficient dynamical scheme to discern such long-lived excitations. Employing a Floquet-Lindblad framework, we explore how periodic driving reshapes the key features of a paradigmatic topological model, namely a Creutz ladder. Our results bear testimony to a drive-induced unipolar-bipolar transition in the Liouvillian skin effect, which gets dynamically manifested as a chiral-helical damping crossover. Such a transition effectively rescales the bulk localization length, giving rise to a polarization drift that we identify as a new invariant for efficient diagnosis of the nontrivial phases. As the transition becomes more gradual via tuning drive-rescaled parameters, we uncover signatures of a scale-free localization where skin and extended modes co-exist with distinct decay rates. The emergent hierarchy of the decay rates yields two disparate timescales: a chiral wavefront that rapidly empties the bulk followed by a long-lived regime dominated by robust edge modes. Overall, our results provide convincing evidence that periodic driving serves as a powerful handle to manipulate dissipative topological phases and dynamically isolate the boundary modes."}

Importantly, the underlying physics processes determining device performance are today fully understood, and dedicated engineering projects are currently advancing these sources towards real-world quantum technology applications. We review the performance of deterministic single-photon sources based on quantum dots in photonic crystal waveguides, the approach with the highest performance specs since it intrinsically combines suppression of leaky modes and Purcell enhancement to slow-light waveguide mode.

The apparatus comprises four stages, each designed in-house. An oven heated to $\\sim 500^\\circ$C generates an atomic beam that is collimated by a capillary stack. The beam is sent into a passive, permanent-magnet-based Zeeman slower that reduces the atomic velocity to $30$ m/s. The slow atoms are captured in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and cooled to $1.0(3)$ mK with a trapping time of $16(2)$ ms. Ground-state atoms in the cold gas are excited to high Rydberg states via resonant excitation through the intermediate $4s4p\\, ^1P_1$ and $4s4d\\, ^1D_2$ states. The MOT is operated at the center of an electrode stack, which serves to apply continuous and pulsed electric fields and field-ionize the Rydberg atoms for detection. We benchmark our MOT against previous implementations and find its performance consistent with state-of-the-art results in terms of temperature and trapping lifetime. Finally, we demonstrate Rydberg spectroscopy of calcium, confirming the system's suitability for ultracold Rydberg physics experiments."}

Recent theory predicts that for non-interacting fermions, the Euler characteristic of a $D$-dimensional Fermi sea -- the topological invariant that describes its shape -- is encoded in its ($D$+1)-point density correlations. Here we experimentally demonstrate this connection in a two-dimensional degenerate gas of neutral $^{6}$Li atoms using single-atom-resolved imaging. By measuring three- and four-point connected density correlations in real space, we directly extract topological invariants of the underlying Fermi sea, including the Euler characteristic. Our results are in remarkable agreement with ideal-gas predictions, despite the presence of sizeable interactions, and establish a new pathway for probing many-body topology through correlation measurements."}

We adopt standard momentum-space techniques to show how multipartite entanglement arises for inflationary perturbation modes, focusing on the dynamics of the comoving curvature perturbation. In particular, we quantify entanglement generation via the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, which introduces a geometric interpretation of quantum correlations in terms of the Fubini-Study metric. In the continuum limit, we show that the Entanglement Distance arising from displacement transformations is proportional to the total number of excitations in the quantum state for cubic perturbations, thus providing an upper bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy of any reduced state compatible with such excitations. Within the interaction picture, we further observe that the quantum correlations arising from cubic gravitational interactions are typically much larger than the standard squeezing contribution, in agreement with previous studies focusing on von Neumann entropy generation across the Hubble horizon. We further show how the inflationary parameters affect the total amount of such correlations, highlighting in particular their dependence on the inflationary energy scales and the number of e-foldings during slow-roll."}

We describe a method to generate photons of any temporal waveform from emitters of any lifetime. Our broadly applicable approach has only two requirements for a candidate qudit: (1) control of the phase-parity and (2) modulation of the amplitude of a field coupling a ground state to an excited manifold which produces a photon during relaxation. We detail how to find optimal excitation pulse shapes, both numerically and experimentally, by employing variational algorithms to feedback on atomic populations. Additionally, we develop Quantum Monte Carlo based tools to determine emission statistics and establish techniques for optimal post-selection to ensure maximum fidelity of photon generation protocols. We situate our work in the context of other prior research on bespoke single photon sources and networking including post-emission pulse shaping, temporal gating and cavity-based methods. In comparison, our free-space process has greater flexibility in producing any waveform, requires less infrastructure and can be readily applied across a wide domain of emitters of any frequency or lifetime.
