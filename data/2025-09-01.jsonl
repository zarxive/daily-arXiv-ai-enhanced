We argue that this model can be relevant to\nrealistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main\neffect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly\nattractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The\nnature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum\ngeometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is\nso. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes,\nwhose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap\nbetween the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular\nmomentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different\ntopology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the\nattractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational\nupper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds.

In this\npaper, we investigate how two aspects of these systems' formation histories\nshape the dark-matter distribution: accretion onto the primary and prior merger\nevents. We model accretion by introducing a minimum allowed angular momentum of\ndark-matter particles, which removes such particles that would have been\naccreted by the primary. When simulating an inspiral within such a\ndistribution, we find a smaller dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal from\na vacuum binary as compared to an inspiral without such a cutoff, particularly\nfor more extreme mass-ratios. We also simulate an inspiral which takes place\nwithin a dark-matter distribution that remains after a prior merger. We find\nthat the decrease in dephasing from vacuum binaries when compared to the prior\ninspiral is most significant for less extreme mass-ratios.

Efficient representations of the\nmany-electron states of chemical systems are therefore also being inspired by\nmachine learning principles to provide an alternative to established\napproaches. In this chapter, we review recent progress in this endeavor for\nquantum chemical problems represented in second quantization, and the\nparticular challenges present in this field.

Any molecule can be considered a bipartite system in\nterms of electronic and nuclear halfspaces. Accordingly, the Schmidt\ndecomposition theorem can be applied to each molecular ansatz to find a much\nshorter representation in terms of Schmidt basis and to estimate the\nentanglement content through the calculation of von Neumann entropies. Although\nhere we justify that the ground BO vibronic state of any molecule may be\nregarded as an almost separable and non-entangled state, this property worsens\nwith the vibrational excitation, which increases the entanglement\nmonotonically. The interlace between electronic and nuclear wave functions for\neach vibronic state becomes even more critical for those electronic excited\nstates whose electronic wave functions change drastically with the molecular\ngeometry.

A very common way to deal with the complexity of the QMP is to\npartition the sequence of gates into a sequence of gate groups (or layers).\nHowever, this imposes a couple of important restrictions: (1) SWAP gates can\nonly be added between pairs of consecutive groups, and (2) all the gates\nbelonging to a certain group have to be executed (in parallel) in the same time\nslot.
