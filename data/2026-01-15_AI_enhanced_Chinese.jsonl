Regenerative vertebrates such as Danio rerio often exhibit faster immune resolution and debris clearance than mammals, yet the molecular determinants underlying these differences remain incompletely understood. TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk) and their ligands Gas6 and Protein S are central regulators of phagocytosis and immune resolution in the nervous system, but whether intrinsic structural properties of these receptor-ligand complexes contribute to regenerative efficiency has not been systematically explored.\n  Here, we present a comparative in silico analysis of TAM receptors and ligands from zebrafish, human, and mouse, integrating sequence evolution, high-confidence structural modeling, interface characterization, and electrostatic analysis. Despite substantial sequence divergence, ligand-binding domains display strong structural conservation, supporting a conserved global mode of TAM-ligand engagement. At the interface level, zebrafish complexes show enhanced electrostatic contributions and increased salt-bridge density, particularly in the Tyro3-Protein S interaction. Residue-level electrostatic analysis reveals clustered interface hotspots that are spatially conserved across species despite evolutionary rewiring of individual contacts.\n  Together, these results suggest that TAM receptor-ligand interfaces are evolutionarily tuned through subtle electrostatic and geometric optimization rather than large-scale structural changes, providing a conserved yet adaptable framework for species-specific modulation of phagocytic signaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Our experimental setup, involving tension along the fiber direction, activated volumetric, tensile, and shear mechanisms due to the tendon's complex geometry. We implemented an approach to model inference that we refer to as variational system identification (VSI) to solve the weak form of the stress equilibrium equation using these full volume displacements. Three constitutive models were used for parameter inference: a neo-Hookean model, a modified Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden (HGO) model with higher-order terms in the first and second invariants, and a reduced polynomial model consisting of terms based on the first, second, and fiber-related invariants. Inferred parameters were further refined using an adjoint-based partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization framework. Our results show that the modified HGO model captures the tendon's deformation mechanisms with reasonable accuracy, while the neo-Hookean model fails to reproduce key internal features, particularly the shear behavior in the injured tendon. Surprisingly, the simplified polynomial model performed comparably to the modified HGO formulation using only three terms. These findings suggest that while current constitutive models do not fully replicate the complex internal mechanics of the tendon, they are capable of capturing key trends in both intact and damaged tissue, using a homogeneous modeling approach.

In contrast to monoatomic lattices with a single frequency-wavenumber pair, polyatomic lattices support multiple frequencies for each wavenumber. To date, experimental observations are limited to topologically trivial monoatomic phononic systems. Here, we utilize analytical, numerical, and experimental methods to examine topologically non-trivial phononic lattices subject to temporal interfaces. In particular, we realize phononic lattices demonstrating single-frequency shift (i.e., mode conservation) and multi-frequency splitting (i.e., mode conversion) following a temporal interface. Accordingly, we generalize temporal analogues of Snell's law and Fresnel equations. Moreover, we utilize Bloch mode overlaps to obtain a phononic time lens and a classical analogue of dynamic quantum phase transitions for phonons. Such overlap determines the probability of mode conversion or conservation after a temporal interface and, more importantly, can carry hidden topological characteristics. Our methodology paves the way for the use of temporal interfaces in probing phonon band topology and the realization of advanced acoustic devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These background metrics generalize the Kaluza ansatz. They encode 4D massive gauge fields and Higgs-like scalars, alongside the usual 4D metric and massless gauge fields. We show that the dimensional reduction of the Dirac equation on these backgrounds naturally violates CP symmetry in four dimensions. This provides a new geometric path to constructing models with intrinsic CP violation. In this framework, massive gauge fields can break CP for three different reasons: $i)$ a misalignment between the mass eigenspinors and the spinors in the representation basis; $ii)$ a new non-minimal term coupling 4D fermions to massive gauge fields; $iii)$ the presence of a non-abelian Pauli term. All this derives from the higher-dimensional Dirac equation. Technically, the paper uses the language of spin geometry and Riemannian submersions.

In this proof-of-concept case, the morphology of the signal allowed us to impose the appropriate modifications on the signal so that we finally show how to get very close to the characteristics of the SSB and thus achieve our goal to get as close as possible to the ideal behavior of a Memristor that yields deep memory.

By combining time--frequency analysis of HHG spectra obtained from full time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation (TDSE) simulations with classical three-step-model (TSM) trajectories, we extract an effective tunneling delay associated with electron motion through the laser-suppressed Coulomb barrier. The analysis is carried out for Hydrogen, Helium, and Argon atoms over a range of laser wavelengths and peak intensities within the tunneling regime.

While the twisted DW generates an effective gauge field for spin waves, leading to a deflection of their trajectories, our main focus is on a distinct effect that arises when a hard-axis anisotropy is present in addition to the easy-axis anisotropy. In this case, the translational symmetry of the spin-wave Hamiltonian along the DW is broken, resulting in a periodic modulation of the Hamiltonian. This periodicity leads to the formation of multiple diffracted spin wave modes on both sides of the DW, engendering a DW-induced magnonic diffraction pattern.

Moir\u00e9 lattices (MLs), with multiple flat bands, offer an appropriate platform for creating such solitons. We explore the formation mechanism and stability of GSs in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the combined action of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an ML potential. We identify five Wannier-type GS families bifurcating from the lowest five energy bands in the spectrum induced by the ML with sufficiently large period and depth. These fundamental GSs serve as basic elements for constructing more complex Wannier-type GS states. Reducing the lattice period and depth triggers a transition from the Wannier-type GSs to ones of the Bloch type, the latter exhibiting higher norm thresholds and pronounced spatial broadening near edges of the energy bands. In addition to tuning the lattice-potential parameters, adjusting the SOC strength can also modulate the flatness of energy bands and enhance the localization of gap solitons, enabling reversible transitions between the GSs of the Wannier and Bloch types. Distinctive properties of GSs in the quasiperiodic ML are uncovered too.

To exploit the full information content of electromagnetic waves, more advanced elements are required. This has driven the development of multifunctional components, which for example, simultaneously detect and emit intensity or extract intensity and spectral information. However, no pixel exists that both senses and generates optical wavefronts with full control over amplitude, phase, and polarisation, limiting reciprocal control and feedback of sophisticated light fields. Here we present a route to such pixels by demonstrating a versatile platform of miniaturised diffractive elements based on Fourier optics. We exploit plasmonic surface waves, which propagate coherently and efficiently across metallic surfaces. When these plasmons are launched towards wavy microstructures designed with simple Fourier analysis, arbitrary and background-free optical wavefronts are generated. Conversely, incoming light can be sensed and its amplitude, phase, and polarisation fully characterised. By combining or superposing several such components, we create multifunctional 'Fourier pixels' that provide compact and accurate control over the optical field. Our approach, which could also use photonic waveguide modes, establishes a scalable, universal architecture for vectorially programmable pixels with applications in adaptive optics, holographic displays, optical communication, and quantum-information processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5149\u5b66\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5149\u5b66\u6ce2\u524d\u7684\u632f\u5e45\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u6781\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u51c6\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u50cf\u7d20\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f sensing \u5149\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5 generate \u5149\u6ce2\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u5b57\u76f8\u673a\u548c\u663e\u793a\u8bbe\u5907\u5bf9\u50cf\u7d20\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6 sensing \u548c generate \u5149\u6ce2\u7684\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5149\u5b66\u548c plasmonic \u8868\u9762\u6ce2\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1miniaturised \u5206\u6563\u5143\u4ef6\uff0c\u5229\u7528coherent \u5206\u5e03\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u7279\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6ce2\u524d\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd miniaturised \u5dee\u5206\u5143\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u548c sensing \u5e45\u5ea6\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u6781\u5316\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u5149\u6ce2\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6ce2\u524d\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5e26\u6709\u5168\u63a7\u5149\u5b66\u6ce2\u524d\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u5b66\u3001\u76f8\u5e72\u663e\u793a\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Current wavefront shaping technologies face a fundamental dichotomy: spatial light modulators (SLMs) offer high pixel count but suffer from low refresh rates, while acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) provide moderate speed with restricted optical beam geometries. Though recent advances in photonic integrated circuits achieve fast switching, there is currently no tool that provides MHz-rate, continuous motion, and arbitrarily reconfigurable control over a set of diffraction-limited spots. Here we introduce a new class of spatial light modulator that provides both 2D pixel geometry and high speed. The device operates by encoding spatial information in frequency bins via a broadband optical phase modulator, and decoding them via a first-of-its-kind, high-resolution 2D spectrometer. The spectrometer, based on the architecture which we call the Re-Imaging Phased Array (RIPA), achieves its sensitivity through long path-lengths, enabled by intra-spectrometer re-imaging lens-guides. We demonstrate site-resolved optical pulsing with a 44(1)~ns rise time, corresponding to frame rates exceeding 10 million frames per second, as well as arbitrary, reconfigurable 2D addressing and multi-site operations, including asynchronous, independent beam motion, splitting, and recombination. Leveraging these tools opens new horizons in rapid optical manipulation of matter across science, from fast, scalable control that approaches the inertial and radiation limits of atoms in quantum processors, to dynamically programmable, microsecond-resolved illumination in microscopy and neuro-biological imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In the former case, we find that small deformations generically lead to big-bang and big-crunch singularities, near which the spacetime becomes highly anisotropic. We argue that string theory likely resolves these singularities. In the latter case, general solutions have the property that the radius of the three-sphere goes to infinity at a finite time, but there are no solutions in which it collapses to zero.

Previous work has already demonstrated that fs-lasers are uniquely suited for the fabrication of piezoelectric actuators based on PMN-PT, which are required for multiaxial strain-tuning of quantum dots (QDs) to enable, e.g. the generation of highly entangled photon pairs. Building on these foundations, the present work advances actuator performance and capabilities by introducing a local thinning strategy. This approach allows the realization of smaller devices, which in turn enables lower operating voltages, while simultaneously offering the possibility of integrating multiple quantum light sources on a single chip. The article provides a detailed description of the full fabrication chain, entirely based on fs-laser processing steps, from substrate thinning to metal layer structuring and final device definition. A particular focus is placed on the final cutting process, where the implementation of a third-harmonic ultraviolet (UV) fs-laser wavelength significantly improves edge quality and shape definition compared to the second harmonic (SH) wavelength used in previous work. The device fabricated through the combination of local thinning and UV-based cutting promises not only to enhance the efficiency of strain transfer but also to ensure the mechanical stability required for practical applications.

We reveal that: (i) the PL originates from genuinely hybridized direct-indirect excitonic eigenstates, rather than nominally mixed species with fixed dominant character; (ii) the direct exciton converts into the indirect one via a previously unrecognized two-step pathway -- exchange-interaction-driven exciton transfer followed by a spin flip; and (iii) a higher-energy indirect exciton, absent from prior studies, acts as a crucial intermediate mediating this conversion. Beyond explaining experiment, our theory predicts a striking strain-driven \"sinusoidal'' valley response, furnishing a continuously tunable valley dial that far exceeds binary control schemes.

Yet these systems are typically designed as static, hand-tuned menus of selection criteria grounded in prior knowledge and simulation. In this work, we further explore the concept of a self-driving trigger, an autonomous data-filtering framework that reallocates resources and adjusts thresholds dynamically in real-time to optimize signal efficiency, rate stability, and computational cost as instrumentation and environmental conditions evolve. We introduce a benchmark ecosystem to emulate realistic collider scenarios and demonstrate real-time optimization of a menu including canonical energy sum triggers as well as modern anomaly-detection algorithms that target non-standard event topologies using machine learning. Using simulated data streams and publicly available collision data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, we demonstrate the capability to dynamically and automatically optimize trigger performance under specific cost objectives without manual retuning.

A well-known example is the breakdown of continuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance, whose typical realization is the Efimov effect of three-body problems. Here we discuss yet another discrete symmetry to which continuous scale invariance can be broken: discrete phase invariance. We first revisit the one-body problem on the half line in the presence of an inverse-square potential -- the simplest example of nontrivial scale-invariant quantum mechanics -- and show that continuous scale invariance can be broken to discrete phase invariance in a small window of coupling constant. We also show that discrete phase invariance manifests itself as circularly distributed simple poles on Riemann sheets of the S-matrix. We then present three examples of few-body problems that exhibit discrete phase invariance.

However, conventional optical fiber sensors are often limited by strong parameter cross sensitivity, poor discrimination capability, and increased system complexity when multiple sensing units are required. In this work, a compact multi-parameter optical fiber sensing platform is proposed based on a cascaded single-mode fiber, multimode fiber, and long-period fiber grating structure, combined with a wavelength-based spectral demodulation strategy. Within the cascaded configuration, multiple characteristic spectral troughs arising from distinct physical mechanisms coexist in a single transmission spectrum. Interference-induced troughs are generated by the multimode fiber section, while a resonance-induced trough is introduced by the long-period fiber grating. Although none of these troughs responds exclusively to a single parameter, each exhibits simultaneous and linearly independent responses to temperature, axial strain, and refractive index with distinct sensitivity magnitudes and trends. Consequently, each trough can be described by a unique sensitivity vector, enabling robust multi-parameter discrimination through multi-wavelength spectral demodulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u5149\u7ea4\u4f20\u611f\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u7528\u5355\u6a21\u5149\u7ea4\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u5149\u7ea4\u548c\u957f\u5468\u671f\u5149\u7ea4\u6805\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce2\u957f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7684\u8c31\u53bb\u6a21\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u9879\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u73b0\u4ee3\u5de5\u7a0b\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u6280\u672f\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5171\u7528\u5149\u7ea4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8c31\u53bb\u6a21\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5149\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u8870\u51cf lee\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u8f74\u5411\u5e94\u53d8\u548c\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u5149\u7ea4\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5e72\u6270 lee \u548c\u957f\u5468\u671f\u5149\u7ea4\u6805\u683c\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u632f\u8361 lee\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5206\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u8f74\u5411\u5e94\u53d8\u548c\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce2\u957f\u9009\u62e9\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u5149\u7ea4\u4f20\u611f\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u591a\u9879\u53c2\u6570\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7cbe\u5bc6\u76d1\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Ring-contact (ring-and-groove) designs address scalability by shaping the electric field to preserve low-capacitance readout, but their nonplanar topology motivates a lithium-contact process that is compatible with conformal deposition and robust high-voltage operation. As a process demonstration toward future ring-contact prototypes, we fabricate and characterize a hybrid-contact planar HPGe device, KL01. Here, ``hybrid'' denotes an $n^{+}$ contact formed by an in-house lithium-suspension paint followed by controlled thermal diffusion, combined with an AJA-developed a-Ge/Al $p^{+}$ contact and a-Ge sidewall passivation.

Compared with the higher-order topological type-I hyperbolic lattices, we discover two unique topological phenomena that stem from the nontrivial geometrical topology of the type-II hyperbolic lattice. First, topological edge and corner states exist on both inner and outer boundaries of the type-II hyperbolic lattice and exhibit higher degeneracy than those in the type-I hyperbolic lattice with only an outer boundary. Second, the degeneracy of type-II hyperbolic corner states can be arbitrarily tuned by changing the characteristic (or inner) radius, in contrast to its type-I counterpart, which is determined by the number of sides of the tessellated polygons.

In this work, we present a method to use Rydberg atoms to nondestructively measure the internal state of a molecular qubit. We achieve this via microwave dressing of both molecules and Rydberg atoms, allowing us to tune the interactions so that there are minimal Rydberg-Rydberg interactions and many measurements can take place simultaneously. We consider two experimentally-motivated examples of detecting $^{23}$Na$^{133}$Cs and $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs with $^{133}$Cs atoms. Finally, we discuss several strategies for mitigating various sources of crosstalk.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes a way to measure the internal states of molecular qubits using Rydberg atoms without destroying the qubit state.", "motivation": "The motivation behind this work is addressing the challenge of nondestructive measurement in quantum systems, particularly in bialkali molecule platforms.", "method": "The method involves using microwave dressing of both molecules and Rydberg atoms to tune interactions, allowing simultaneous measurements with minimal Rydberg-Rydberg interactions.", "result": "The method successfully considers two experimentally-motivated examples of detecting specific NaCs and RbCs systems with Cs atoms.

In particular, we focus on 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU$ quiver gauge theories with hypermultiplets in the bifundamental and fundamental representations. In the overall-free limit, we compute the large-$N$ Hagedorn temperature $T_H$, which governs the stringy exponential growth of the density of states at high energies. We argue that this quantity determines the type of stringy ultraviolet completion in the bulk: it captures the type of string theory in which the bulk physics is embedded while remaining insensitive to detailed geometric data. For linear quivers, we find that $T_H$ depends only on the quiver length, which is tied to the number of NS5-branes in the underlying brane construction and, in turn, to the string theory in which the bulk is embedded. For holographic quivers, where we impose that the two central charges $a$ and $c$ coincide in the large-$N$ limit, we show that $T_H$ coincides with that of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, which befits the 10d Type IIB description of their gravitational duals. We also analyze the exponential rate $\u03b1$, which controls how the leading tower of higher-spin currents becomes conserved in these limits, as suggested by the CFT Distance Conjecture. In the large-$N$ regime, we derive sharp bounds on the minimal rate, $1/\\sqrt{2}\\le \u03b1_{\\min}\\le \\sqrt{2/3}$, attained in the overall-free limit. Moreover, we prove that the universal lower bound $\u03b1\\ge 1/\\sqrt{2}$ holds, including at finite $N$.

The magnetic analog of such dynamical stabilization corresponds to saturation of the magnetization against an external field. Here we report dynamical stabilization of the magnetization in thin film bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet by spin current injection from an adjacent Pt layer. Magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements demonstrate magnetization reversal against magnetic fields up to 3000 times larger than the film's coercivity once the spin injection surpasses a critical threshold associated with negative damping. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that this process is mediated by the excitation of a large population of incoherent magnons with non-zero wave vector, leading to a transient shortening and subsequent stabilization of the inverted magnetization. The elementary excitations of the high-energy inverted magnetization state are shown to be antimagnons, quasi-particles carrying opposite energy and spin relative to magnons. Our results further reveal how the system's size and minimization of nonlinear magnon scattering processes play a key role in dynamical stabilization, opening new avenues for magnetic state control beyond conventional magnetization switching. Dissipation-driven phase transitions in large-area magnetic systems provide a solid-state platform to study magnonic analogs of relativistic phenomena, such as Klein tunneling and black holes, as well as spin-wave amplification and lasing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In the present work, we show that analytical results can be extended to the more involved Frenkel case as well. Hence, by analytically solving the difference equation describing Frenkel excitons in electric fields, we derive close-form expressions for resonances providing Stark shifts and ionization rates.

Phys. Soc.

The multiple-$Q$ spin textures are characterized by a superposition of symmetry-unrelated ordering wave vectors in the same direction with distinct periodicities rather than rotationally symmetry-related ones. Motivated by recent experimental observations of broken helix magnetic structures in EuIn$_2$As$_2$, we focus on the microscopic interaction conditions in stabilizing such multiple-$Q$ states.We employ two effective spin models: One is the momentum-space-based model, and the other is the real-space-based model, both of which include bilinear and biquadratic easy-plane anisotropic interactions. By analyzing their ground state via simulated annealing, we find that a superposition of a spiral and a staggered modulation yields a robust double-$Q$ magnetic structure. Moreover, we demonstrate that the obtained double-$Q$ spin configuration exhibits an antisymmetric spin-split band structure even without the relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and further reveals asymmetric band modulations when the magnetic field is applied along the out-of-plane direction.

However, prior work has mostly focused on spatial topological states at the single outer edge of type-I hyperbolic lattices. The dynamic transfer of hyperbolic topological states across multiple edges, as well as the emergence of spatiotemporal topological phenomena, remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish both spatial and spatiotemporal topologies in a newly discovered type-II hyperbolic lattice possessing outer and inner edges. Using electric circuits, we experimentally realize a type-II hyperbolic Chern insulator and directly observe degenerate chiral edge states of opposite chirality at its outer and inner edges. Furthermore, by coupling these counter-propagating chiral edge states, we demonstrate an anti-time-parity phase transition, enabling dynamic transfer between them in arbitrary proportions. Finally, we propose a novel paradigm for constructing a (2+1)-dimensional hyperbolic space-time crystal, which hosts an intertwined topology of spatial Chern and temporal winding numbers, resulting in a unique space-time topological string state. Our work expands the frontier of hyperbolic topological physics, paving the way for the spatiotemporal dynamic manipulation of hyperbolic topological states.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Existing methods like purification and minimally entangled typical thermal states offer partial solutions but struggle with scalability and accuracy in low-temperature regime. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach based on generating-function matrix product states (GFMPS). By directly computing a large set of Bloch-type excited states, we construct Gibbs states that moderate the area-law constraint, enabling accurate and efficient approximation of low-temperature thermal behavior.

In the dark, the intrinsic magnetism of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is shown to yield a stronger anisotropic RKKY spin model compared to nonmagnetic topological insulators, providing a clear signature for differentiating these systems. Furthermore, key band properties -- such as energy gap, band degeneracy/splitting, and topological deformations of the Fermi surface -- imprint distinct signatures on the RKKY interaction, enabling clear discrimination between even- and odd-septuple-layer (SL) films. This discrimination manifests in multiple ways: through the Fermi-energy dependence or spatial oscillations of the interaction for impurities on the same surface, or via the presence versus absence of spin-frustrated terms for those on different surfaces. Under off-resonant circularly polarized light, we track photoinduced topological phase transitions and identify two characteristic signatures at the phase boundary: a sign reversal in spin-frustrated terms and a dip in collinear RKKY components. These serve as fingerprints for circular-polarization-chirality-dependent topological transitions in even- and odd-SL films, respectively. Overall, this work establishes RKKY interactions as a sensitive magnetic probe for revealing both distinctive band properties and light-driven phase transitions in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films, thereby complementing conventional electrical measurements while providing new insights into the influence of intrinsic magnetism on the surface-state band structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86MnBi\u2082Te\u2084\u8584\u819c\u5728\u6697\u5149\u548c\u5149\u7167\u4e0b\u7684RKKY\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5f02\u8d28\u78c1\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027RKKY\u81ea\u65cb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u9699\u3001\u80fd\u5e26\u5206\u88c2\u548c\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u53d8\u5f62\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u5076\u6570-\u548c\u5947\u6570-\u4e03\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5728\u504f\u632f\u5149\u4e0b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5149\u81f4\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u65cb\u963b\u788d\u9879\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5171\u7ebfRKKY\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u51cf\u5e45\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5076\u6570-\u548c\u5947\u6570-\u4e03\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684MnBi\u2082Te\u2084\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u7ebf\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176RKKY\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u8868\u9762\u80fd\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5149\u81f4\u76f8\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u6790MnBi\u2082Te\u2084\u8584\u819c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "RKKY\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u9762\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u65cb\u963b\u788d\u9879\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5171\u7ebfRKKY\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u51cf\u5e45\u73b0\u8c61\u53ef\u5206\u522b\u8bc6\u522b\u5076\u6570-\u548c\u5947\u6570-\u4e03\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "RKKY\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76MnBi\u2082Te\u2084\u8584\u819c\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u78c1\u6027\u548c\u5149\u81f4\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u53d8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u7535\u5b66\u6d4b\u91cf\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5185\u78c1\u6027\u5bf9\u65b9\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Each PDU is a compact module, approximately 5x5x12 cm^3 in size, including four custom ASICs connected to 256 SiPMs and an FPGA-based readout card (RDO) responsible for data acquisition and control. Considering the moderately harsh radiation environment expected in the dRICH detector, this study reports on proton irradiation tests performed on key components of the RDO card to assess their tolerance to cumulative Total Ionizing Dose (TID) and Single Event Effects (SEE). All tested components demonstrated radiation tolerance beyond the TID levels expected for the dRICH environment, with the exception of the ATtiny417 microcontroller, which showed destructive failure.

Deviations from $\u03c1_{\\rm FL}=\u03c1_0+AT^2$ in bad and strange metals are commonly ascribed to a breakdown of Landau's quasiparticle (QP) concept. Yet, it remains unclear what mechanism drives the temperature dependence of $\u03c1(T)$ beyond $\u03c1_{\\rm FL}$. Here, we examine the bad metal upon approaching the Mott metal-insulator transition via chemical pressure in $\u03ba$-[(BEDT-STF)$_x$(BEDT-TTF)$_{1-x}$]$\\rm _2 Cu_2 (CN)_3$. Through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transport experiments on the same single crystals, we directly link the onset of deviations from Korringa law $(T_1T)^{-1} = \\mathrm{const.}$ with the rise of $\u03c1(T)$ beyond $\u03c1_{\\rm FL}$. From the NMR relaxation rate, we can identify the gradual crossover between the QP-dominated regime at low $T$ to predominant local moments at higher $T$. By comparing our experimental findings with dynamical mean-field theory calculations, which accurately reproduce the transport data, we reveal how this crossover is reflected in $T$-dependent changes of the QP spectrum. Near the Mott insulator, where $d\u03c1/dT<0$ at high $T$, an Einstein-relation analysis shows that bad-metal behavior with $d\u03c1/dT>0$ is driven by the temperature dependence of the electronic compressibility rather than the diffusion constant.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bad metals exhibit altered thermal conductivity from the expected Fermi-liquid behavior, possibly due to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, as revealed by linking the temperature dependence of resistivity to magnetic ordering through NMR and mean-field theory analysis.", "motivation": "Understanding the mechanisms behind non-Fermi-liquid behavior in bad metals, particularly the role of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, is crucial for advancing our knowledge of unconventional electronic states and metal-insulator transitions.", "method": "The study combines experimental techniques like NMR and transport measurements with theoretical modeling using dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the crossover from quasiparticle-dominated to magnetic-ordered regimes at higher temperatures.", "result": "The experimental findings, including deviations from the Korringa law and temperature-dependent resistivity, are successfully captured by dynamical mean-field theory. The analysis highlights that the positive slope in resistivity ($d\rho/dT > 0$) near the Mott insulator is primarily due to temperature-dependent electronic compressibility rather than diffusion.", "conclusion": "This work provides a detailed understanding of the transition from Fermi-liquid to bad-metal behavior in $\nu$-based compounds, emphasizing the importance of electronic compressibility in determining the temperature dependence of resistivity."}}

The behavior of finite-size systems is traditionally understood to be governed by fundamental oscillatory modes arising from bulk physics and boundary conditions. A paradigmatic example is the particle-in-a-box model introduced with the advent of quantum mechanics, in which confinement leads to discrete resonances and quantized energy levels. Such quantization underpins phenomena including semiconductor quantum dots, where electronic waves are confined in all three spatial dimensions, producing standing-wave modes analogous to the vibrational states of a guitar string. These modes are characterized by integer quantum numbers corresponding to the number of envelope oscillations fitting within the cavity. Recently, counter-intuitive modes have been observed in finite systems with Dirac dispersion, including states that do not oscillate spatially, yet a general theoretical framework for modes in such cavities has been lacking. Here, we discover the phenomenon of arbitrary fractional quantization in wave physics and show that, in finite-size boxes with linear dispersion, the quantum number need not be an integer but can take any real value, including zero. Using Bloch theory in a Dirac-cone photonic crystal with a controllable fractional number of unit cells at its boundaries, we demonstrate continuous control of the cavity-mode envelope wavenumber. We introduce a unified nomenclature for these unconventional modes and derive their corresponding wavefunctions. These counter-intuitive states in open Dirac potentials challenge conventional notions of quantization and open new avenues across wave physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The integration of these color center ensembles into a planar silicon carbide waveguide enables efficient excitation of a large ensemble and simplifies fluorescence extraction compared to standard confocal methods. We report continuous-wave (CW) optically detected magnetic resonance measurements, complemented by Rabi, Ramsey, and Hahn-echo sequences, which demonstrate coherent capabilities of the large embedded ensemble of V2 centers.

Collectively, these advancements simplify the quantum sensor architecture, enhance sensitivity, and streamline optical excitation and collection, thereby paving the way for the development of next-generation SiC-quantum sensing technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6709\u76844H-SiC\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u82af\u7247\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6676\u5757\u52a0\u5de5\u4f18\u5316\u4e86V2\u7845\u7a7a\u4f4d\u8272\u5fc3\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5236\u4f5c\u5de5\u827a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u8272\u5fc3\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002\u8272\u5fc3\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u5e73\u9762\u56db\u9762\u4f53SiC\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6fc0\u53d1\u5927\u96c6\u5408\u548c\u5149\u81f4\u53d1\u5c04\u66f4\u52a0\u65b9\u4fbf\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5171\u805a\u7126\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u62a5\u9053\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2\uff08CW\uff09\u5149\u81f4\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u914d\u5408Rabi\u3001Ramsey\u548cHahn-echo\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u7fa4\u4f53\u8272\u5fc3\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8be5\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4e3a2-3\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u5171\u805a\u7126\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u81f4\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5149\u6fc0\u53d1\u548c\u6536\u96c6\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee34H-SiC\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u4e86\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5e73\u8861\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u5236\u9020\u590d\u6742\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e9f\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e4H-SiC\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u82af\u7247\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5206\u6676\u5757\u5de5\u827a\u4f18\u5316V2\u7845\u7a7a\u4f4d\u8272\u5fc3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u9762\u56db\u9762\u4f53SiC\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4f53\u96c6\u6210\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8272\u5fc3\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u548c\u5149\u81f4\u53d1\u5c04\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86CW\u5149\u81f4\u63a2\u6d4b\u3001Rabi\u3001Ramsey\u548cHahn-echo\u5e8f\u5217\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8272\u5fc3\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u6839\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8be5\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u82af\u7247\u5728\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5149\u81f4\u566a\u58f0\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5176\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5171\u805a\u7126\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f4e\u4e862-3\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002\u8be5\u82af\u7247\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u6676\u5757\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e4H-SiC\u7684\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u82af\u7247\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u5236\u9020\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We analyze whether the expanding branch of the solutions can describe a late-time cosmic acceleration, using a combined statistical analysis of BAO, CMB, cosmic chronometer and Pantheon+SHOES supernova datasets. A crucial outcome of this exercise is the analytical emergence of a smooth phantom divide crossing in the dark energy equation of state, achieved without introducing any pathological instabilities.

The sensor operates in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime, where the hyperfine and Zeeman interactions decouple, and utilizes counter-propagating pump-probe configuration in Faraday geometry to resolve isolated, Doppler-free Zeeman transitions. To interpret the resulting spectra in this strongly field-dependent regime, we developed a comprehensive multilevel optical Bloch-equation model solved explicitly in the uncoupled $\\ket{m_I, m_J}$ basis, capturing state mixing and nonlinear saturation dynamics. This model reproduces measured spectra at sub-Doppler resolution and is consistent with analytical expectations for power broadening and thermal Doppler scaling. Magnetic field estimation is performed using a physics-constrained optimization routine that infers the magnetic field by minimizing the residual between experimentally extracted line centers and calculated transition frequencies from the field-dependent Hamiltonian.

P concentration is determined by Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Sample resistivity ($\u03c1$), carrier concentration ($n_e$), and mobility ($\u03bc_e$) are extracted by combining sheet resistance and Hall measurements in van der Pauw configuration. When $H_{SOI}$ = 30 nm, transport properties at room temperature are fully compatible with those of a similarly doped bulk Si. Progressive 2D confinement by reduction of $H_{SOI}$ below 30 nm results in a reduction of the carrier concentration and a concomitant degradation of $\u03bc_e$.

The effectiveness of this approach was verified by electron-paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements, which allowed the assessment of the quality of the RTO-SiO$_2$/Si interface and the correlation with observed electrical properties.

A central open problem is whether an obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits exists. Despite several efforts having been made toward this goal, prior works have succeeded only in obfuscating quantum circuits that implement either pseudo-deterministic functions or unitary transformations. Although unitary transformations already include a broad class of quantum computation, many important quantum tasks, such as state preparation and quantum error-correction, go beyond unitaries and fall within general completely positive trace-preserving maps.\n  In this work, we construct the first quantum ideal obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits that support quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model assuming post-quantum one-way functions, thereby resolving an open problem posed in Bartusek et al. (STOC 2023), Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024), and Huang and Tang (FOCS 2025). At the core of our construction lies a novel primitive that we introduce, called the subspace-preserving strong pseudorandom unitary (spsPRU). An spsPRU is a family of efficient unitaries that fix every vector in a given linear subspace $S$, while acting as a Haar random unitary on the orthogonal complement $S^\\perp$ under both forward and inverse oracle queries. Furthermore, by instantiating the classical oracle model with the ideal obfuscation scheme for classical circuits proposed by Jain et al. (CRYPTO 2023) and later enhanced by Bartusek et al.

Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \\textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed.

Inclusion of the cubic Lovelock term removes this ghost instability; however, the resulting Minkowski vacuum is generically only metastable, being accompanied by energetically favored Anti-de Sitter vacua. While such metastability cannot be avoided for spherical internal spaces, we identify an infinite class of higher-rank symmetric spaces where the true vacuum can be pushed to infinity in moduli space, thereby realizing genuinely stable and ghost-free Minkowski vacua at the level of the four-dimensional effective theory.

The angular tidal force is predominantly compressive, $l$ shaping the effective geometry, and $\u03b3$ acting as a damping factor. In the phantom sector ($\u03b1=-1$), tidal forces and geodesic deviation diverge, indicating a tidal instability, with $l$ and $\u03b3$ affecting only the magnitude of the response.

However, the fundamental mechanistic principles that govern their dynamics and relaxation remain elusive. In this work, we provide the microscopic mechanistic understanding of the exciton-polariton relaxation process that follows from an excitation in the upper polariton. Using both mixed quantum-classical simulations and analytical analysis, we reveal that phonon-induced upper-to-lower polariton relaxation proceeds via two steps: the first step is a vertical inter-band transition from the upper to the lower polariton, which is followed by a second step that is a phonon-induced Fr\u00f6hlich scattering within the lower polariton. We find that in materials of finite thickness (which include filled cavities), phonon-induced polaritonic intraband Fr\u00f6hlich scattering is significantly suppressed. We show that the microscopic origin of this suppression is phonon-fluctuations synchronization (or self-averaging) due to the polaritonic spatial delocalization in the quantization direction. Finally, we show that the same phonon fluctuation-synchronization effect plays a central role across polaritonic relaxation pathways, and we derive simple analytical expressions that relate a material's finite thickness to the corresponding relaxation rate constants.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In contrast to standard Nielsen circuits, non-invertible circuits lead to an optimisation problem that is no longer governed by geodesics on a continuous group manifold but instead reduces to a discrete shortest-path problem on the fusion graph of superselection sectors.

To obtain benchmark results and to analyze the ringdown dynamics from generic perturbations, we further employ a 2+1-dimensional numerical time-evolution framework. This approach enables a systematic quantification of theoretical uncertainties across multiple angular harmonics, a broad range of spin parameters, and progressively stronger deviations from the Kerr geometry. We then confront these modeling errors with simple projections of statistical uncertainties in quasinormal mode frequencies as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby exploring the domain of validity of approximate methods for prospective high-precision black-hole spectroscopy. We also report that near-horizon deformations can affect prograde and retrograde modes differently and provide a geometrical explanation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u79d1\u897f\u65b9\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5916\u7684\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86eikonal\u548cpost-Kerr\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u7ed3\u54082+1\u7ef4\u6570\u503c\u6f14\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5728\u5916\u5ef6\uff0c\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6027 spectroscopy\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u79bb\u5e93\u5c14\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Work by Jacobson, Fischler and Susskind, and particularly Bousso suggested that, in the quantum theory of gravity, this subsystem should have a density matrix of finite entropy. These authors formalized older intuitive arguments based on black hole physics. Although mathematically, Type II von Neumann algebras admit finite entropy density matrices, the black hole arguments suggest that the number of physical states in these subsystems is finite. The conjecture that de Sitter (dS) space has a finite number of physical states was first made by Fischler and one of the present authors. Leutheusser and Liu showed that, in the $N = \\infty$ limit, causal diamonds with finite area in AdS radius units had Type $III_1$ von Neumann sub-algebras of the full operator algebra. They claimed that this was true for finite values of the UV cutoff, and that the algebra was the algebra of bulk local fields in the diamond. We will argue that the second part of this conjecture is incorrect and that the bulk field algebra emerges only in a double scaled limit, where the boundary UV cutoff is taken to infinity as $N$ is taken to infinity. There is never a bulk field theory description that resolves distances smaller than the AdS radius.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u56e0\u679c\u4f53\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u71b5\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u5728 AdS/CFT \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u53d1\u73b0 AdS \u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4f53\u901a\u5e38\u5177\u6709 III\u2081 \u578b\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u6709\u9650\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u4ee3\u6570 III\u221e \u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u7ec4\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5f97\u5230 bulk \u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u89e3\u51b3 AdS \u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u8ba8\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7406\u89e3AdS\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4f53\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u6570\u7c7b\u578b\uff08III\u2081 vs III\u221e\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u71b5\u5bc6\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AdS\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4f53\u9644\u8fd1\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728AdS\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754cCFT\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86 III\u2081 \u4ee3\u6570\u662fAdS\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u4f53\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0cIII\u221e \u4ee3\u6570\u4ec5\u5f53\u56e0\u679c\u4f53\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u5c0f\u65f6\u624d\u51fa\u73b0\u3002 bulk \u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u6781\u9650\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3AdS\u4e2d\u7684\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3AdS/CFT\u731c\u60f3\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u6570\u5bf9\u71b5\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c bulk \u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Reliable inference of the source properties is crucial for accurate interpretation of its astrophysical implications. However, characterization of GW231123 is challenging: only few signal cycles are observed and different signal models result in systematically different parameters. We investigate whether the interpretation of GW231123 is robust against model systematics and Gaussian detector noise. We show that the model systematics observed in GW231123 can be reproduced for a simulated signal based on the numerical-relativity surrogate model NRSur7dq4. Simulating data using the maximum-likelihood NRSur7dq4 waveform for GW231123 and no noise realization, we closely recover the systematics observed for the real signal. We then explore how the headline properties of GW231123 are impacted by Gaussian detector noise. Using the NRSur7dq4 maximum-likelihood waveform and different noise realizations, we consistently find support for large masses, high spin magnitudes (median $\u03c7_1\\geq 0.7$), and high spin precession (median $\u03c7_\\mathrm{p}\\geq 0.68$). The spin in the direction of the angular momentum ($\u03c7_\\mathrm{eff}$) fluctuates more. Finally, again comparing to simulated signals, we show that any differences in the GW231123 inference based on each separate detector are not statistically significant. These results show that the properties of GW231123, and most importantly the high mass and high spin magnitudes inferred by NRSur7dq4, are robust.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Specifically, (1) it supports partitioning across any number of nodes $t$ within the range $2 \\leq t \\leq n$; (2) the maximum qubit count required for any single node is expressed as $\\max \\left(n_0,n_1,\\dots,n_{t-1} \\right) $, where $n_j$ represents the number of qubits at the $j$-th node, with $\\sum_{j=0}^{t-1} n_j =n$; (3) it can realize exact amplitude amplification for multiple targets of a quantum state with arbitrary amplitude distributions; (4) we verify the effectiveness of DEQAAA by resolving a specific exact amplitude amplification task involving two targets (8 and 14 in decimal) via MindSpore Quantum, a quantum simulation software, with tests conducted on 4-qubit, 6-qubit, 8-qubit and 10-qubit systems. Notably, through the decomposition of $C^{n-1}PS$ gates, DEQAAA demonstrates remarkable advantages in both quantum gate count and circuit depth as the qubit number scales, thereby boosting its noise resilience.

Since the qubit lattice algorithm (QLA) is almost fully unitary, one finds excellent conservation of electromagnetic energy. Various Gaussian envelope pulses are considered in regimes where the incident angle is below that needed for total internal reflection. While the reflected pulse retains its overall Gaussian shape, the transmitted pulse exhibits a combination of a Gaussian envelope along with Huygen-like emitted wave fronts from the collision point of the initial pulse with the infinite dielectric interface.

For ions with a $\u039b$ level structure, driven by Raman lasers, we identify an ion-number-dependent crossover between weak and strong coupling where both the cooling rate and final temperature are simultaneously optimized. We obtain simple analytic results in both extremes: In the weak coupling limit, we show a Lorentzian spin-absorption spectrum determines the cooling rate and final occupation of the motional state, which are both independent of the number of ions. We also highlight the benefit of including an additional spin dependent force in this case. In the strong coupling regime, our theory reveals the role of collective dynamics arising from phonon exchange between dark and bright states, allowing us to explain the enhancement of the cooling rate with increasing ion number. Our analytic results agree closely with exact numerical simulations and provide experimentally accessible guidelines for optimizing cooling in large ion crystals, a key step toward scalable,

Using numerical simulations, we analyze representative GHPS states and show that the GHPS spherical coordinates govern the amplitude ratio and relative phase between the pole bases.

A key obstacle to its broader use is that existing convergence guarantees typically rely on analytical conditions that are either overly restrictive or difficult to verify for concrete problems. We address this issue by introducing an a posteriori certification viewpoint: instead of requiring fully a priori verifiable assumptions, we provide convergence and error guarantees that can be validated directly from the iterates produced by the algorithm. Specifically, we prove a generalized global convergence theorem showing that, under convexity and a substantially weaker numerically verifiable condition, the QAB iteration converges to the global minimizer. This theorem yields a practical certification procedure: by checking explicit inequalities along the computed trajectory, one can certify global optimality and bound the suboptimality of the obtained value. As an application, we develop a certified iterative scheme for computing the quantum relative entropy of channels, a fundamental measure of distinguishability in quantum dynamics. This quantity is notoriously challenging to evaluate numerically: gradient-based methods are impeded by the complexity of matrix functions such as square roots and logarithms, while recent semidefinite programming approaches can become computationally and memory intensive at high precision. Our method avoids these bottlenecks by combining the QAB iteration with a posteriori certification, yielding an efficient and scalable algorithm.

We construct a loopholes-closed game with capital processes that test (i) convergence of empirical conditional frequencies to the CHSH correlations and (ii) the absence of systematic correlations between measurement settings and Nature's hidden-variable assignments, and prove that Nature cannot satisfy both simultaneously: at least one capital process must diverge.

A key idea of NBQC is to let computational data continuously move throughout the network while maintaining the connectivity to other nodes. We numerically show that, for practical benchmark tasks, our method achieves shorter execution times than circuit-based strategies and more node-efficient constructions than measurement-based quantum computing. Also, if we are allowed to specialize the network to the structure of quantum programs, such as peak access frequencies, the number of nodes can be significantly reduced. Thus, our methods provide a foundation in designing DFTQC architecture exploiting the redundancy of many small fault-tolerant nodes.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a network-based approach for distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing (NBQC) to utilize many small-scale quantum nodes instead of relying on a single large-scale system.

Specialization of the network to quantum program characteristics can further reduce the number of nodes required.", "motivation": "The motivation behind this research is to overcome the challenges of constructing large-scale quantum computers by utilizing distributed systems. Given that large-scale nodes are difficult to build and that most quantum nodes can only store a small number of logical qubits, the proposed NBQC approach aims to provide a scalable and efficient solution.", "method": "The authors introduce a network-based architecture for quantum computation, where computational data is continuously moved through the network.

Of particular interest to areas such as quantum simulation and linear-system solvers are sparse quantum states, which contain only a small number $s$ of non-zero computational basis states compared to a generic state. In this work, we present an approach that prepares $s$-sparse states on $n$ qubits, reducing the number of Toffoli gates required compared to prior art. We work in the established framework of first preparing a dense state on a $\\lceil{\\log(s)}\\rceil$-qubit sub-register, and then mapping this state to the target state via an isometry, with the latter step dominating the cost of the full algorithm. The speed-up is achieved by designing an efficient algorithm for finding and implementing the isometry. The worst-case Toffoli cost of our isometry circuit, which may be viewed as a batched version of an approach by Malvetti et al., is essentially $2s$ for sufficiently large values of $n$, yielding roughly a $\\log(s)/2$ improvement factor over the state-of-the-art. In numerical benchmarks on randomly chosen states, the cost is closer to $s$. With the improved isometry circuit, we examine the dense-state preparation step and present ways to optimize the joint cost of both steps, particularly in the case of target states with purely real coefficients, by outsourcing some sub-tasks from the dense-state preparation to the isometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces an optimized quantum circuit for preparing sparse quantum states, which are essential in quantum algorithms like quantum simulations and linear system solvers.

For the unapodized configuration, we observe a monotonic increase in spectral purity with gain, whereas the apodized configuration exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence, initially decreasing and then recovering at higher gain. By combining Schmidt-mode analysis with a group-velocity-based interpretation, we explain why different dispersion conditions exhibit distinct gain-dependent behavior, specifically that rapid purification occurs when the pump group velocity lies between those of the signal and idler.

We investigate the dissipative generation of a complex entanglement structure as in a cluster state through engineered Markovian dynamics in the spin systems coupled via Ising interactions. Using the Lindblad master equation, we design a projection based dissipative channel that drives the system toward a unique pure steady state corresponding to the desired cluster state. This is done by removing the contribution of the orthogonal states. By explicitly constructing the Liouvillian superoperator in the full $2^N$-dimensional Hilbert space, we compute the steady-state density matrix, the Liouvillian spectral gap, entanglement witness and the fidelity with respect to the ideal cluster state. The results demonstrate that the cluster state emerges as the steady state when the engineered Liouvillian dissipation dominates over the local Ising interaction between spins. Moreover, we find that the fidelity and Liouvillian spectral gap is relatively insensitive to the system size once the saturation dissipation has been achieved that scales linearly with the qubit number.

However, the practical application of these systems is hindered by electronic spin decoherence, driven by interactions with nuclear spins in the molecule and the surrounding environment at low temperatures. Predicting dephasing dynamics remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of the spin bath. In this work, we develop a non-Markovian time-convolutionless master equation to treat an electronic spin coupled to a nuclear-spin bath. By relating ab initio electronic structure parameters directly to the decoherence dynamics, we provide a framework that accounts for pure dephasing in the low-temperature limit. We apply this method to a series of molecular qubit candidates and demonstrate good agreement with experimental relaxation trends.

We report the experimental generation of large-amplitude squeezed coherent-state superpositions (squeezed cat states) on free-space optical pulses, reaching an amplitude of $\u03b1= 2.47$, which, to our knowledge, exceeds all previously reported values. Our protocol relies on the controlled mixing of the Fock states $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$ through a tunable beam splitter, followed by heralding via homodyne detection. The resulting state displays three well-resolved negative regions in its Wigner function and achieves a fidelity of $0.53$ with the target state $\\propto \\hat{S}(z)(|\u03b1\\rangle - |-\u03b1\\rangle)$, with $\u03b1= 2.47$ and squeezing parameter $z = 0.56$. These results constitute a significant milestone for temporal breeding protocols and for the iterative generation of optical GKP states, opening new perspectives for scalable and fault-tolerant photonic quantum architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6210\u529f\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u751f\u6210\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u4e2d\u5927\u632f\u5e45\u7684\u53d7\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u675f\u7f1a\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6001\u53e0\u52a0\uff08\u79f0\u4e3a\u53d7\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\uff09\uff0c\u632f\u5e45\u03b1=2.47\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u5148\u524d\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u503c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u534a\u6ce2\u7247\u5c06\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u6210|1\u3009\u548c|2\u3009\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u8f74\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c heralding\u3002\u751f\u6210\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5728Wigner\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8d1f\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6001\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e3aS(z)(|\u03b1\u3009-|-\u03b1\u3009)\u7684 fidelity\u4e3a0.53\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u03b1=2.47\uff0c\u534a\u6ce2\u7247\u53c2\u6570z=0.56\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5e95\u6001\uff08GKP\uff09\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u6001\uff0c\u5982 coherent \u72b6\u6001\u548c squeezed \u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5bb9\u6613\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u5149\u8109\u51b2\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53d7\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u534a\u6ce2\u7247\u5c06\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u79bb\u6210|1\u3009\u548c|2\u3009\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53d7\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u8f74\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c heralding\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53d7\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Wigner\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6001\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u7684 fidelity 0.53\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53d7\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u5177\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8d1f\u533a\u57df\u5728Wigner\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5176\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6001\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u6001\u7684 fidelity \u8fbe\u5230\u4e860.53\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u6210\u679c\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u9ad8\u632f\u5e45\u7684\u53d7\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8d1f\u533a\u57df\u5728Wigner\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5e95\u6001\uff08GKP\uff09\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

For all quantum graphs $G$ and $H$ in $\\mathsf{qGph}$, we then construct a quantum graph $[G,H]$ of homomorphisms from $G$ to $H$, making $\\mathsf{qGph}$ a closed symmetric monoidal category. We prove that for all finite graphs $G$ and $H$, the quantum graph $[G,H]$ is nonempty iff the $(G,H)$-homomorphism game has a winning quantum strategy, directly generalizing the classical case.\n  The finite quantum graphs in $\\mathsf{qGph}$ are tracial, real, and self-adjoint, and the morphisms between them are CP morphisms that are adjoint to a unital $*$-homomorphism. We show that Weaver's two notions of a CP morphism coincide in this context. We also show that every finite reflexive quantum graph is the confusability quantum graph of a quantum channel, answering a question of Daws.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
