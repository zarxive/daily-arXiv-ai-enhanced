One such compound is EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$, which has recently garnered interest due to its strong interplay between the Eu magnetism and charge carriers. However the topology of the electronic band structure, which depends on the ground state magnetic configuration of the europium sublattice, has not been determined. Based on our \\textit{ab-initio} calculations, we find that an in-plane and out-of-plane \\textit{A}-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order generates a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal respectively, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM) order stabilizes a Weyl semimetal. Our resonant x-ray elastic scattering measurements of single-crystal thin film EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ reveal both a sharp magnetic peak at $\\textit{\\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,\\frac{1}{2})$ and broad $\\textit{\\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,1)$ below $T_{\\mathrm{N}}=12.9$\\,K, which is associated with an \\textit{A}-type AFM and FM order, respectively. Our measurements indicate that the FM and AFM layers are spatially separated along the crystal $c$ axis, with the former limited to the top three atomic layers. We propose that EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ behaves as a Weyl semimetal in the surface FM layers, and as a topological crystalline insulator in the lower AFM layers."}

While the Kondo effect has traditionally been understood to suppress magnetism through the formation of local singlets, recent studies suggest that Kondo interactions may enhance magnetic order under certain conditions. However, these scenarios often rely on complex electronic structures, including orbital and charge degrees of freedom, making the essential mechanisms difficult to isolate. Here we report the realization of a spin-(1/2,1) Kondo necklace model in a Ni-based complex-a minimal spin-only analog of the Kondo lattice that isolates quantum spin correlations by eliminating charge degrees of freedom. Thermodynamic measurements identify a magnetic phase transition and a field-induced quantum phase transition. Perturbative analysis reveals that the Kondo coupling mediates effective antiferromagnetic interactions between the spin-1 sites, stabilizing the Néel order across the entire chain. Our results establish a universal boundary in Kondo physics, where coupling to spin-1/2 moments yields singlets, but to spin-1 and higher stabilizes magnetic order."}

However, the broader adoption of QTF-AFM has been constrained by the difficulty of attaching a cantilever tip to a quartz tuning fork (QTF) with the positional and angular precision required for repeatable and reproducible probe fabrication. For stable operation, the tip must be placed precisely at the midline of a single tine, aligned parallel to the prong axis, and rigidly secured. Even slight lateral offsets or angular deviations disrupt the intrinsic antisymmetric flexural mode, induce torsional coupling, and ultimately lead to systematic image distortions and reduced measurement integrity. In this work, we present a comprehensive, semi-automated QTF-tip fabrication system that integrates precision alignment, real-time frequency-sweep monitoring, and controlled Q-factor tuning within a single workflow. Experimental characterization demonstrates consistent probe preparation across multiple trials, preservation of sharp and well-defined resonance responses with deliberately adjustable damping, and high-fidelity, high-resolution imaging in practical scanning tests. This integrated approach provides a reproducible framework to QTF-based probe fabrication, lowering the technical barrier to QTF-AFM implementation and broadening its applicability across diverse sample types and operating environments."}

However, the two challenges, low SOT efficiency and the need for in plane symmetry breaking field for perpendicular magnetization switching, greatly limit its practical implementation. In this work, the enhanced SOT efficiency of Platinum (Pt) SOT layer and field free perpendicular magnetization switching are achieved by integrating thin Ruthenium Oxide (RuO2) layer in our material stack. The optimal RuO2 thickness (0.5 nm) enhances 5.2 times Damping Like (DL) SOT efficiency compared with pure SOT layer (Pt), as determined by hysteresis loop shift measurements, with a relatively low resistivity (90 micro-Ohm-cm). Moreover, we achieve 3 times reduction of critical magnetization switching current density compared to reference sample. Our experimental findings also demonstrate Rashba-induced substantial field-free magnetization switching in the presence of an emergent built-in interfacial field. Notably, reliable multi resistance synaptic states are achieved by tailoring the synergistic effects of enhanced SOT and interfacial magnetism. The functionality of synaptic states has been further evaluated by implementing an artificial neural network and achieved image recognition accuracies of approximately 95% and 87% on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively.

This phenomenon is known as rate-induced tipping and has been reported in a variety of systems, from simple ordinary differential equations and maps to mathematical models in climate sciences and ecology. In most examples, the transition happens at a critical rate of parameter change, a rate-induced tipping point, and is associated with a simple unstable orbit (edge state). In this work, we show how this simple picture changes when non-attracting fractal sets exist in the autonomous system, a ubiquitous situation in non-linear dynamics. We show that these fractals in phase space induce fractals in parameter space, which control the rates and parameter changes that result in tipping. We explain how such rate-induced fractals appear and how the fractal dimensions of the different sets are related to each other. We illustrate our general theory in three paradigmatic systems: a piecewise linear one-dimensional map, the two-dimensional Hénon map, and a forced pendulum."}

The formulation is based on the fractional order Lord Shulman generalized thermoelasticity theory, which provides an enhanced description of coupled thermo electro mechanical wave behaviour. Rotational effects are incorporated into the constitutive relations and equations of motion for both media, while the lower half space is assumed to be subjected to initial stress. Closed form solutions for reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained, together with associated energy partition factors, allowing a comprehensive assessment of interface wave characteristics. Numerical simulations carried out using MATLAB demonstrate that the reflection and transmission responses are strongly influenced by initial stress, fractional order parameter, and thermal relaxation time. The calculated energy ratios of scattered waves satisfy the energy conservation condition, confirming the mathematical consistency of the formulation. The findings of this study are relevant to the design and analysis of smart sensors, rotating and aerospace structures, vibration control systems, and energy harvesting devices employing functionally graded thermo piezoelectric materials under fractional order effects."}

Consequently, huge progress has been made toward the design of dual-function nanoplatforms that integrate heating and thermometry capabilities at the nanoscale. However, in most cases, dual nanoheater nanothermometer platforms rely either on specifically engineered materials or on complex readout schemes, which limits translational potential due to complex implementation procedures. To overcome these challenges, we present a methodology for directly extracting temperature information based on dynamical magnetization measurements of cobalt ferrite magnetic nanoflowers. We demonstrate that these nanocrystals monitor temperature changes through variations in their magnetization cycles measured under alternating magnetic fields. Importantly, this thermometric functionality is preserved after surface functionalization and under chemical variations in the nanoparticle environment. Interestingly, we show that we can simultaneously generate heat and report temperature changes within the same agent. This is thanks to the photothermal conversion of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles subjected to near infrared irradiation and the tight reported relationship between magnetization dynamics and Brownian relaxation. Together, these results establish cobalt ferrite magnetic nanoparticles as a label-free platform for simultaneous heat generation and intrinsic temperature readout, enabling real-time nanoscale thermal control."}

We show it is possible to suppress differential light shifts across all magnetic sublevels of the $5s5p$ $\\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$ state by using two carefully chosen wavelengths (with comparable tensor light shift magnitude and opposite sign) at an appropriate intensity ratio, thus suppressing light-shift induced dephasing, enabling scalar magic conditions between the ground state and $5s5p$ $\\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$, and tensor magic conditions for qudits encoded within it. Furthermore, this technique enables robust operation at the tensor magic angle 54.7$^\\circ$ with linear trap polarization via reduced sensitivity to uncertainty in experimental parameters.

The resulting function space includes multiple polylogarithms as well as iterated integrals with a K3 period, which generate a spurious velocity divergence at $v/c=\\sqrt{8}/3$. This divergence is present in the potential region and must be cancelled by conservative memory contributions from radiative regions. We find that the standard use of Feynman propagators to access the conservative sector fails to ensure this cancellation. We propose a conservative propagator prescription which realises both cancellations leading to a physically sensible answer.

Such an experiment could test whether gravitational acceleration depends on electric charge, probing physics in genuinely new parameter space.

In this work, we study logical T-gate magic-state preparation in GKP-encoded photonic qubits using a repeat-until-success injection protocol combined with outer surface-code protection. We develop an architecture-level modeling framework based on a lightweight density-matrix simulator implemented with standard numerical linear algebra. Finite squeezing is mapped to effective logical dephasing, depolarizing noise is included at the logical level, and photon loss is treated as a heralded erasure process. This approach avoids explicit continuous-variable wavefunction simulation, hardware-specific photonic models, and quantum software frameworks, enabling transparent and computationally efficient exploration of architectural trade-offs. We perform systematic parameter sweeps over squeezing values from 8 to 16 dB, baseline loss probabilities between 0.01 and 0.03, and surface-code distances d = 1, 3, 5, and 7. Across this regime, we evaluate repeat-until-success probability, average injection overhead, and logical magic-state fidelity. We find that success probabilities exceed 0.94 across all studied parameters, with an average overhead close to unity. After outer-code protection, logical fidelities reach approximately 0.77 to 0.80 and show weak sensitivity to moderate photon loss but a strong dependence on squeezing. Phase-boundary analysis identifies minimum squeezing requirements needed to simultaneously achieve high success probability and logical fidelity.

While Bayesian studies of NS observations are well established in General Relativity and curvature based modified gravity theories, such analyses in $f(Q)$ gravity remain largely unexplored. We perform a Bayesian inference analysis by confronting theoretical NS mass-radius predictions with NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0437+4715, and PSR J0614+3329. The dense matter equation of state is fixed to DDME2 in order to isolate the effects of modified gravity on NS structure.

These uncertainty scores drive an active learning strategy that prioritizes the most informative simulations during training. Applied to the task of predicting band gap sizes in two-dimensional, two-tone photonic crystals, our approach achieves up to a 2.6x reduction in required training data compared to a random sampling baseline while maintaining predictive accuracy. The efficiency gains arise from concentrating computational resources on high uncertainty regions of the design space rather than sampling uniformly. Given the substantial cost of full band structure simulations, especially in three dimensions, this data efficiency enables rapid and scalable surrogate modeling. Our results suggest that analytic LL-BNN based active learning can substantially accelerate topological optimization and inverse design workflows for photonic crystals, and more broadly, offers a general framework for data efficient regression across scientific machine learning domains."}

Here, we accelerate the convergence of DMFT by initializing its self-consistent cycle with solutions from computationally cheaper and more approximate methods. We compare the initialization with the non-interacting solution to a range of quantum embedding compatible approaches: Hartree-Fock, the Hubbard-I approximation, rotationally invariant slave bosons (RISB), and its ghost extension (g-RISB). We find that these initializations can reduce the number of DMFT iterations by up to an order of magnitude, with g-RISB providing the most effective and reliable benefits. In most regimes, initializing with g-RISB and performing a single DMFT iteration suffices to recover the full dynamical structure. The improvement in convergence is controlled by the initial solution's accuracy in the low-energy part of the self-energy, on the scale of the non-interacting bandwidth. This strategy is especially effective at the Mott insulator-metal transition, where an initialization from the non-interacting limit can lead to a breakdown of DMFT due to the sign problem. Our results establish the usage of accurate yet cheaper quantum embedding methods as a powerful means to substantially reduce the computational cost of DMFT, particularly in regimes where convergence is slow or prone to failure."}

Savin"], "title": "Multistability of graphene nanobubbles", "comment": "13 pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Using the example of Ar, Kr, and Xe atoms, it is shown that graphene nanobubbles on flat substrates are multistable systems. A nanobubble can have many stable stationary states, each characterized by the number of layers, $l$, within the cluster of internal atoms. The layers are circular in shape, concentrically stacked on top of each other, forming an $l$-stepped pyramid with a flat top. The covering of this pyramid with a graphene sheet is achieved through its local stretching. The valence bonds of the sheet stretch only over the group of internal atoms; outside the coverage zone, the sheet remains undeformed and lies flush against the substrate. The maximum possible number of layers, $l_m$, increases monotonically with the number of atoms $N$ ($l_m=6$ for $N=4000$). The graphene sheet, interacting with the substrate, compresses the internal atom cluster against it, generating an internal pressure of $P\\sim 1$ GPa. Numerical simulations of thermal vibrations reveal that among all $l$-layer configurations of a nanobubble, there is always one \"ground\"\\ state. Upon heating, this ground state smoothly transitions into a layerless liquid state. All other stationary states transform into this ground state once a certain temperature is reached (for $N=4000$, the ground state corresponds to state with $l=4$). The coexistence of several stable states with different numbers of layers at low temperatures leads to the absence of a universal shape for the nanobubbles. In this scenario, the height-to-radius ratio, $H/R$, can vary from 0 to 0.24, depending on the number of layers."}

However, the broader adoption of QTF-AFM has been constrained by the difficulty of attaching a cantilever tip to a quartz tuning fork (QTF) with the positional and angular precision required for repeatable and reproducible probe fabrication. For stable operation, the tip must be placed precisely at the midline of a single tine, aligned parallel to the prong axis, and rigidly secured. Even slight lateral offsets or angular deviations disrupt the intrinsic antisymmetric flexural mode, induce torsional coupling, and ultimately lead to systematic image distortions and reduced measurement integrity. In this work, we present a comprehensive, semi-automated QTF-tip fabrication system that integrates precision alignment, real-time frequency-sweep monitoring, and controlled Q-factor tuning within a single workflow. Experimental characterization demonstrates consistent probe preparation across multiple trials, preservation of sharp and well-defined resonance responses with deliberately adjustable damping, and high-fidelity, high-resolution imaging in practical scanning tests. This integrated approach provides a reproducible framework to QTF-based probe fabrication, lowering the technical barrier to QTF-AFM implementation and broadening its applicability across diverse sample types and operating environments."}

Although recent machine-learning models achieve near chemical accuracy in the prediction of TS structures and the associated reaction barriers for small organic reactions, their ability to generalize beyond the training domain remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce targeted benchmarks to probe chemical and structural novelty in generative TS prediction. Building on Transition1x, a large-scale dataset of reactions involving small organic molecules, we construct curated extensions incorporating controlled elemental substitutions and diverse transition-metal complexes (TMC). These benchmarks reveal fundamental limitations of generative models in the generalization to previously unseen elements. As a result, they produce unphysical geometries and large energetic errors, even for reactions structurally similar to well-predicted organic systems. To address this challenge, we introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on equilibrium conformers that exposes generative TS models to novel chemical environments prior to targeted fine-tuning. Across the newly proposed benchmarks, self-supervised pretraining substantially improves TS prediction for previously unseen systems, lowering the median RMSD of TS geometries on T1x-TMC reactions from 0.39 to 0.19 $\\mathring{A}$ and reducing fine-tuning data requirements by up to 75%, enabling reliable performance even in low-data regimes. Overall, the integration of generative TS models with self-supervised pseudo-reaction pretraining provides an efficient, scalable, and chemically robust framework for elucidating TSs well beyond the small organic molecule domain, establishing a foundation for investigating complex and catalytically relevant reaction landscapes."}

In the presence of population inversion, this driven coherence sets the phase and temporal onset of the amplified field, while gain remains governed by conventional inner-shell lasing mechanisms. We refer to this operating regime as a resonant x-ray difference-frequency laser (re-XDFL). The analysis demonstrates that difference-frequency-driven coherence provides a physically consistent route to controlled inner-shell x-ray laser emission beyond purely ASE-initiated operation."}

By examining two experimentally relevant parameter regions, we analyze density profiles, radii, peak densities, and excitation spectra to distinguish quantum phases and to depict phase diagrams in the space of asymmetric interaction ratio and total atom number. We carefully study the frequencies of both well-known dipole and breathing modes and less-explored spin dipole and spin breathing modes. The breathing mode frequency decreases monotonically with interaction ratio, approaching asymptotically the result of a conventional weakly interacting Bose gas. It varies non-monotonically with total atom number, peaking at a critical point that highlights the crucial role of quantum fluctuations. In contrast, spin modes display distinct temporal spin density distributions and reveal in-phase and out-of-phase relative dynamics between components. Their frequencies depend instead monotonically on the interaction ratio and atom number. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of asymmetric quantum droplets and link to experimentally accessible regimes in ultracold $^{39}$K atomic gases."}

Despite its importance, reflectance values for detector materials in the VUV region remain poorly characterized, with literature values showing significant variation depending on surface termination and finish. We present an angular-resolved reflectance measurement system developed at IFIC that operates in a gaseous argon atmosphere, enabling realistic measurements of detector materials under controlled conditions. The setup couples a deuterium lamp to a monochromator and employs a motorized PMT rotating around the sample to measure reflected light distributions across a wide angular range. We have characterized two key DUNE materials -- aluminum field cage profiles and stainless steel cryostat membranes -- in both the UV-VIS (300-500 nm) and VUV (128-200 nm) ranges. In the UV-VIS region, we confirm literature values of approximately 60% reflectance for aluminum and 40% for stainless steel. Preliminary VUV measurements at 45° angle of incidence yield reflectance values of 10-15% for both materials, significantly lower than their UV-VIS counterparts. The reflected light distributions exhibit a mixed character between specular and diffuse reflection. These results have direct implications for detector simulations and light yield predictions in next-generation experiments."}

In this work, we derive and analytically solve the low-energy Kondo theories for SVAIM at half-filling, with especial focus on the two anti-Hund's regimes: the impurity is either dominated by a valley doublet, or a trivial singlet. In the doublet regime, we reveal that a novel pair Kondo scattering $λ_x$ is required to flip the valley doublet, which involves a quartic operator of bath electrons. Our renormalization group (RG) calculation based on the Coulomb gas analog shows $λ_x$ drives a phase transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. One side of the transition is an anisotropic doublet phase, characterized by non-universal phase shifts of bath electrons and non-analytic impurity susceptibilities, while the other is a Fermi liquid formed by pair-Kondo resonance. The finite-size many-body spectrum, thermodynamic quantities, and correlation functions for both phases are analytically solved. Remarkably, the solution in the pair-Kondo Fermi liquid is achieved via the constructive approach of bosonization-refermionization along a solvable fixed line, where the many-body interaction $λ_x$ is mapped into a pseudo-fermion bilinear in a rigorous manner. Finally, we also apply the RG analysis to the singlet regime, and identify a second-order phase transition between the Kondo Fermi liquid and a local singlet phase."}

These uncertainty scores drive an active learning strategy that prioritizes the most informative simulations during training. Applied to the task of predicting band gap sizes in two-dimensional, two-tone photonic crystals, our approach achieves up to a 2.6x reduction in required training data compared to a random sampling baseline while maintaining predictive accuracy. The efficiency gains arise from concentrating computational resources on high uncertainty regions of the design space rather than sampling uniformly. Given the substantial cost of full band structure simulations, especially in three dimensions, this data efficiency enables rapid and scalable surrogate modeling. Our results suggest that analytic LL-BNN based active learning can substantially accelerate topological optimization and inverse design workflows for photonic crystals, and more broadly, offers a general framework for data efficient regression across scientific machine learning domains."}

The main challenge is that it uses a discrete variable representation to discretize the molecular configuration space, and thus requires a tremendous number of quantum chemistry calculations to construct the electronic overlap matrix. Moreover, the expansion coefficients scale exponentially with molecular size for direct-product basis sets. We address these challenges by first introducing a coarse-grained local diabatic ansatz, followed by a tensor network representation of the expansion coefficients and the molecular time-evolution operator. With a full 24-dimensional demonstration using the pyrazine molecule, we show that such developments provide a highly accurate and computationally tractable method for high-dimensional, fully quantum, strongly coupled electron-nuclear dynamics from first principles."}

We have used the multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock formalism to obtain correlated wavefunctions ab initio and compute all single and double shake processes in the electron capture decay of atomic $^7$Be. The simulations can explain some but not all of the observed spectral features, likely because the wave functions are modified by the Ta sensor material that the $^7$Be is embedded into.

When energy-momentum is identified through local translations rather than constant ones, a unique, symmetric, and gauge-invariant energy-momentum tensor emerges that satisfies a genuine off shell Noether identity without invoking the equations of motion. For the free electromagnetic field, this tensor coincides with the familiar Belinfante-Rosenfeld and Bessel-Hagen expressions, but arises here directly from spacetime-dependent translation symmetry rather than from improvement procedures or compensating gauge transformations. In interacting classical electrodynamics, comprising a point charge coupled to the electromagnetic field, diffeomorphism invariance yields well-defined energy-momentum tensors for the field and the particle, while the interaction term itself generates no independent local energy-momentum tensor. Its role is instead entirely encoded in the coupled equations of motion governing energy-momentum exchange, thereby resolving ambiguities in energy-momentum localization present in canonical and improvement-based approaches."}

Here we directly observe the energy excitation spectra of emergent CFTs at quantum phase transitions -- recovering universal energy ratios characteristic of the underlying field theories. Specifically, we develop and implement a modulation technique to resolve a Rydberg chain's finite-size spectra, variably tuned to quantum phase transitions described by either Ising or tricritical Ising CFTs. We also employ local control to distinguish parities of excitations under reflection and, in the tricritical Ising chain, to induce transitions between distinct CFT spectra associated with changing boundary conditions. By utilizing a variant of the modulation technique, we furthermore study the dynamical structure factor of the critical system, which is closely related to the correlation of an underlying Ising conformal field. Our work not only probes the emergence of CFT features in a quantum simulator, but also provides a technique for diagnosing a priori unknown universality classes in future experiments."}

Here we employ state-of-the-art finite-temperature and ground-state tensor network approaches to systematically explore the superconducting (SC) phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model subjected to Zeeman fields. We find that zero-momentum $d$-wave superconductivity persists until the spin gap closes, coexisting with charge density waves. A novel $d$-wave FFLO phase emerges under a higher Zeeman field even above the Pauli limit, concomitant with a field-enhanced spin density waves. We identify these phases, characterized by the simultaneous presence of pairing condensate and density wave orders, as charge-2e supersolids.

The corresponding ``no-go'' radius grows as a certain power of the magnetic field. Residual current and potential exhibit spiraling patterns inside the no-go region. Outside of it, they acquire corrections inversely proportional to the distance, which is known as the Landauer resistivity dipole. The Landauer dipole is rotated by the angle $π(1 - 1 / β)$ with respect to the direction of the average electric field. We also consider the effect of electron viscosity and show that the variation of the no-go radius with magnetic field becomes more rapid if viscosity is large enough. In that regime the size of the Landauer dipole is set by the Gurzhi length, which is much larger than the no-go radius, which is in turn much larger than the geometric size of the depletion.

Theoretical models suggest that the Moon could act as a resonant detector, but the unknown influence of its rugged surface and heterogeneous interior has cast doubt on this prospect. Here, we resolve this long-standing uncertainty by constructing the first high-resolution, structurally realistic model of the lunar GW response. We achieve this by combining high-fidelity spectral-element simulations with the analytical power of normal-mode perturbation theory, thereby resolving topographical effects down to $3.7$ km grid spacing while maintaining the capacity to discern global free-oscillation patterns. This dual-methodology approach not only recovers the expected predominant quadrupole ($l=2$) oscillation mode, but also exposes a systematic signal amplification of $(10-20)\\%$ in thick-crust regions. This enhancement is traced by our normal-mode analysis to a mode-coupling process, in which the original quadrupolar oscillation induced by the passing GWs distributes energy into a series of higher-order modes, the hybridized eigenmodes of the laterally heterogeneous Moon. Near certain eigen-frequencies and at specific locations, we observe up to tenfold amplification, highlighting the power of numerical simulations in resolving these structurally fine-tuned features.

Within a variational framework, we show that, for weak constant gain, the adiabatic compression dynamics can be mapped onto the motion of an effective particle in a slowly deformed potential, providing an intuitive physical picture. To overcome the long propagation distance required by conventional adiabatic condition, we exploit shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) based on inverse engineering and derive analytical gain-loss profiles, with appropriate boundary conditions that realize a prescribed fast compression over a shorter propagation distance.

Bromide co-adsorbates play a decisive role by guiding molecular alignment, inducing surface atom displacements, and enabling transient adsorption geometries that activate otherwise Raman-inactive vibrational modes. In the absence of bromide, distinct excitation pathways emerge, reflecting competition between optomechanical coupling and charge-transfer processes associated with molecular polarization along the optical field or orientation relative to the metal surface.

However, the broader adoption of QTF-AFM has been constrained by the difficulty of attaching a cantilever tip to a quartz tuning fork (QTF) with the positional and angular precision required for repeatable and reproducible probe fabrication. For stable operation, the tip must be placed precisely at the midline of a single tine, aligned parallel to the prong axis, and rigidly secured. Even slight lateral offsets or angular deviations disrupt the intrinsic antisymmetric flexural mode, induce torsional coupling, and ultimately lead to systematic image distortions and reduced measurement integrity. In this work, we present a comprehensive, semi-automated QTF-tip fabrication system that integrates precision alignment, real-time frequency-sweep monitoring, and controlled Q-factor tuning within a single workflow. Experimental characterization demonstrates consistent probe preparation across multiple trials, preservation of sharp and well-defined resonance responses with deliberately adjustable damping, and high-fidelity, high-resolution imaging in practical scanning tests.

An analytic scaling solution for quantum gravity admits no free parameter for the mass term of the Higgs boson. If the largest intrinsic mass scale generated by the renormalisation flow away from the fixed point is sufficiently below the Fermi scale, the couplings of the scale invariant standard model are determined by the scaling solution. For a given short distance model remaining valid to infinitely small distances the ratio Fermi scale over Planck mass can be predicted. With reasonable assumptions for an ultraviolet fixed point a numerical solution finds a tiny value for the ratio between the Fermi and Planck scales, very close to a second order quantum electroweak phase transition.

In addition, upconverting near-infrared and visible light to ultra-violet is crucial for applications such as solar-to-fuel conversion or environmental remediation. However, upconversion luminescence is limited by the low absorption cross-sections of lanthanides. In this work, we engineered Bloch modes in a photonic crystal to assist a multi-wavelength upconversion mechanism and demonstrated a 28-fold enhancement of ultra-violet upconversion luminescence of Yb3+-Tm3+ doped thin films. Materials were selected and optimized to design nanostructures without parasitic absorption losses.

This positions molecular electronics as a potentially disruptive quantum technology, but serious technological challenges have prevented it from being included in technical road maps. The main obstacle is that conventional, mass scalable nanodevice technologies utilize resists and solvents that can degrade molecules.

Relaxing the nondegeneracy condition i.e. considering a presymplectic form instead, extends the construction to non-topological models. The gauge-invariant action functional of (presymplectic) AKSZ sigma model is written in terms of space-time differential forms and can be seen as a covariant multidimensional analogue of the usual 1st order Hamiltonian action. In this work, we show that the AKSZ construction has a natural generalisation where the target space $Q$-manifold is equipped with a form of arbitrary degree $Ω$ (possibly inhomogeneous) which is $(\\mathrm{d}+L_Q)$-closed. This data defines a higher-derivative generalisation of the AKSZ action which is still invariant under the natural gauge transformations determined by $Q$ and which is efficiently formulated in terms of a version of Chern-Weil map introduced by Kotov and Strobl. It turns out that a variety of interesting gauge theories, including higher-dimensional Chern-Simons theory, MacDowell-Mansouri-Stelle-West action and self-dual gravity as well as its higher spin extension, can be concisely reformulated as such multisymplectic AKSZ models. We also present a version of the construction in the setup of PDE geometry and demonstrate that the counterpart of the multisymplectic AKSZ action is precisely the standard multisymplectic formulation, where the Chern-Weil map corresponds to the usual pullback map."}

By mapping the plateau evolution versus THz strength, we show that even weak THz fields can extend the cutoff, producing a pronounced ``fish-fin'' structure whose prominent rays saturate near $I_p + 8 U_p$. We trace this extension to long electron excursions spanning several optical cycles before recombination, and provide a fully consistent explanation using both classical analysis and Bohmian trajectories flow. Our findings reveal that this cutoff-extension mechanism is remarkably robust, persisting across different atomic species and remaining insensitive to variations in the driving parameters. These results demonstrate that cutoff control is achievable with laboratory-scale THz fields, offering practical guidelines for engineering coherent high-energy HHG, and providing a robust pathway for tracking ultrafast electron motion in real time."}

For fields along both in-plane high-symmetry directions we observe that the spin excitation spectrum at and above a magnetic field of 8~T is gapped. Excitation modes then sharpen for increasing field but are consistently broader than experimental resolution even at 13.5~T. The out-of-plane dispersion diminishes in the 7-10~T regime, signifying enhanced two-dimensional behavior as the in-plane liquid correlations are established. In this regime, excitations are very broad and largely flat for all accessible energy-momenta, which is kinematically at odds with a magnon-decay picture. By contrast, a continuum of fractionalized excitations naturally yields a broad continuum response, which crucially may be accompanied by sharper modes of bound states of fractionalized excitations.

At the same time, challenges remain in stabilizing, controlling, and integrating such textures into functional architectures, while novel phenomena such as antiskyrmions, higher-order skyrmions, hopfions, and antiferromagnetic textures arise. The 2026 Skyrmionics Roadmap represents a collective effort of many authors, providing a comprehensive perspective on the current state-of-the-art and the outlook for the coming years. In 33 focused sections, each co-authored by two researchers, we chart progress in theory and modeling, material systems, skyrmion dynamics, and skyrmion technologies. By offering a consolidated vision, this Roadmap aims to guide both fundamental research and application-driven efforts, accelerating the transition of skyrmionics from conceptual breakthroughs toward practical technologies."}

For example, CFTs govern emergent universal properties of systems tuned to quantum phase transitions, including their entanglement, correlations, and low-energy excitation spectra. Much of the rich structure predicted by CFTs nevertheless remains unobserved in experiment. Here we directly observe the energy excitation spectra of emergent CFTs at quantum phase transitions -- recovering universal energy ratios characteristic of the underlying field theories. Specifically, we develop and implement a modulation technique to resolve a Rydberg chain's finite-size spectra, variably tuned to quantum phase transitions described by either Ising or tricritical Ising CFTs. We also employ local control to distinguish parities of excitations under reflection and, in the tricritical Ising chain, to induce transitions between distinct CFT spectra associated with changing boundary conditions. By utilizing a variant of the modulation technique, we furthermore study the dynamical structure factor of the critical system, which is closely related to the correlation of an underlying Ising conformal field. Our work not only probes the emergence of CFT features in a quantum simulator, but also provides a technique for diagnosing a priori unknown universality classes in future experiments."}

For massive $\\text{Tr} Φ^3$ with a uniform mass, the zeros and their factorisation patterns are inherited after a massive shift of planar variables, and an analogous statement holds for Kaluza-Klein reductions where the relevant non-planar variables are modified by conserved mode numbers. For the non-linear sigma model (NLSM), a naive pion mass term generically spoils hidden zeros, while a spurion induced potential restores them. This allows factorisation near zeros, including odd point channels described by an appropriately mass deformed NLSM + $φ^3$ theory, and leads to a hidden zero based on-shell recursion for massive NLSM amplitudes. For spin-one, a simple massive Yang-Mills theory fails to exhibit hidden zeros, while spontaneously broken gauge theories preserve them."}

In particular, quantum thermodynamical protocols for cooling can be significantly affected, potentially altering both their performance and efficiency. Analytically characterizing the impact of such errors becomes increasingly challenging as the system size grows, particularly in deep quantum circuits where noise can accumulate in complex ways. To address this, we introduce a general framework for approximating the cumulative effect of gate-dependent noise using a global depolarizing channel. We specify the regime in which this approximation provides a reliable description of the noisy dynamics. Applying our framework to the thermodynamical two-sort algorithmic cooling (TSAC) protocol, we analytically derive its asymptotic cooling limit in the presence of noise. Using the cooling limit, the optimal cooling performance is achieved by a finite number of qubits--distinguished from the conventional noiseless TSAC protocol by an infinite number of qubits--and fundamental bounds on the achievable ground-state population are derived. This approach opens new avenues for exploring noisy quantum thermodynamical processes."}

Using the semi-tetrad covariant formalism, we derive the dynamics of the collapsing fluid, including a master equation for the evolution of the Weyl curvature, to examine the role of viscosity. The analysis of null geodesic geometry uncovers a novel curvature-balance mechanism between Ricci (matter) and Weyl (free gravitational field) curvature on the apparent horizon; this balance determines the causal nature of the horizon and thereby governs the visibility of the singularity. We then derive necessary and sufficient covariant conditions for the central singularity to be locally naked.

However, the realization of flat-band BICs remains elusive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate polaritonic high-order BICs on a wide-angle flat band utilizing a subwavelength metasurface made of a vdW magnet CrSBr. The large oscillator strength of direct excitons in CrSBr enables near ultrastrong coupling with BICs, leading to strongly suppressed polaritonic angular dispersions. Remarkably, second-order polaritonic BICs become flat-band across a wide angular range, with corresponding Q factors exceeding 1500. Additionally, we find that these polaritonic BICs vanish in the transverse magnetic configuration, while leading to fascinating surface hyperbolic exciton-polaritons within the Reststrahlen band.

However, the broader adoption of QTF-AFM has been constrained by the difficulty of attaching a cantilever tip to a quartz tuning fork (QTF) with the positional and angular precision required for repeatable and reproducible probe fabrication. For stable operation, the tip must be placed precisely at the midline of a single tine, aligned parallel to the prong axis, and rigidly secured. Even slight lateral offsets or angular deviations disrupt the intrinsic antisymmetric flexural mode, induce torsional coupling, and ultimately lead to systematic image distortions and reduced measurement integrity. In this work, we present a comprehensive, semi-automated QTF-tip fabrication system that integrates precision alignment, real-time frequency-sweep monitoring, and controlled Q-factor tuning within a single workflow. Experimental characterization demonstrates consistent probe preparation across multiple trials, preservation of sharp and well-defined resonance responses with deliberately adjustable damping, and high-fidelity, high-resolution imaging in practical scanning tests. This integrated approach provides a reproducible framework to QTF-based probe fabrication, lowering the technical barrier to QTF-AFM implementation and broadening its applicability across diverse sample types and operating environments."}

The dipole antenna lobes simultaneously serve as two gate electrodes, concentrate the impinging THz field, and efficiently launch acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs), which drive a strong photo-thermoelectric (PTE) signal. Between 6 and 90 K, the photovoltage exhibits pronounced peaks, modulating the PTE response by up to 40\\%, that we attribute to AGPs forming a Fabry Pérot THz cavity in the full or half graphene channel. Combined full wave and transport thermal simulations accurately reproduce the gate controlled plasmon wavelength, spatial absorption profile, and the resulting nonuniform electron heating responsible for the PTE response. The lateral and vertical maximum confinement factors of the AGP wavelength relative to the incident wavelength are 165 and 4000, respectively, for frequencies from 1.83 to 2.52 THz. These results demonstrate that wafer scalable CVD graphene, without hBN encapsulation, can host coherent AGP resonances and exhibit an efficient polaritonic enhanced photoresponse under appropriate gating, antenna coupling, and AGP cavity design, opening a route to scalable, polarization and frequency selective, liquid nitrogen cooled, and low power consumption THz detection platforms based on plasmon thermoelectric transduction."}

We determine the quasinormal modes in the bulk by solving the double-trace matching conditions of the system and bath. The lowest imaginary part of the modes defines a Liouvillian gap, and following earlier work in spin chains we introduce the dimensionless ratio crelax as a measure of interface-induced suppression of relaxation.

Inspired by analogous concepts in quantum state discrimination, we introduce the unambiguous randomness of a quantum state and measurement, and, relaxing the assumption of perfect accuracy, randomness with a fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes. We solve these problems for any state and projective measurement in dimension two, as well as for an isotropically noisy state measured in an unbiased basis of any dimension. In the latter case, we find that, given a fixed amount of total noise, an eavesdropper correlated only to the noisy state is always outperformed by an eavesdropper with joint correlations to both a noisy state and a noisy measurement. In fact, we identify a critical error parameter beyond which the joint eavesdropper achieves perfect guessing probability, ruling out any possibility of private randomness."}

Although full-wave numerical techniques such as the boundary element method (BEM) or the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) provide high accuracy, their computational cost often hinders rapid parametric studies. Here it is presented an ultrafast method that avoids solving large eigenproblems. Instead, only the dipolar component of the induced surface charge density \\((σ_{dipolar})\\) is retained through a expansion into Cartesion dipole basis, yielding a compact $3\\times3$ geometric formulation that avoids full boundary-integral solves. The spectral response is obtained in a similar way, by projecting the Neumann--Poincaré surface operator onto the dipole subspace and evaluating a Rayleigh quotient, giving geometry-only eigenvalues again without an $N\\times N$ eigenproblem. A major advantage of this method is that all geometry-dependent quantities are computed once per nanoparticle, while material dispersion and environmental changes enter only through simple algebraic expressions for the polarizability, enabling rapid evaluation across wavelengths. Retardation effects are incorporated through the modified long-wavelength approximation (MLWA), extending accuracy into the weakly retarded regime. The resulting framework provides a valuable tool for fast modelling and optimization of plasmonic nanoparticles at a significant lesser computational cost than BEM, DDA, and other standard tools."}

Using a material system designed to generate SOTs in response to electrical currents, we find that the current required to switch the magnetization of isolated nanomagnets varies non-monotonically as the angle between the nanomagnet long axis and the current increases. In small artificial spin ice systems, we observe similar angular dependence of the switching current, which can be used to control the magnetization orientation of specific subsets of nanomagnets. These experimental results are supported by micromagnetic modeling, which illustrates how the various current induced torques can be exploited to control magnetization switching in nanomagnetic systems.

In a previous paper we showed that, for an interacting scalar field theory in 1+1-dimensions, this formalism allows to capture numerically some crucial real-time features inaccessible to any Euclidean approach to lattice field theory. Yet, the new approach was plagued by two main limitations: an ill-defined non-interacting limit and the absence of a direct formal correspondence between its correlation functions and those generated by the Feynman path integral approach. In this paper, we introduce the new \\emph{\"constrained symplectic quantization\"} approach, for which the perfect equivalence with the Feynman path integral is proved and which is perfectly well defined for the free theory. This new approach is characterized by the analytical continuation of all fields and of the action from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$ and the presence of some constraints which guarantee the stability of the generalized Hamiltonian dynamics and the convergence of the corresponding generalized microcanonical partition function, hence the name of the theory. We show the application of this formalism to the quantum harmonic oscillator on a Minkowskian-time lattice, finding perfect agreement between one- and two-point numerical correlators and the exact quantum-mechanical results. We observe genuine real-time features such as the oscillatory propagator and the discrete excited-state energy spectrum. Our results provide strong numerical evidence that constrained symplectic quantization can sample real-time quantum-mechanical observables, offering a concrete route to overcome the limitations of Euclidean-time importance sampling."}

Standard formulations of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) impose such multi-channel constraints using penalty terms, so most of the explored Hilbert space corresponds to invalid assignments. We propose a subspace-confined QAOA tailored to CBRS multi-channel allocation, in which each node-wise channel register is initialized in a Generalized Dicke state and evolved under an intra-register XY mixer. This ansatz confines the dynamics to a tensor product of Johnson graphs that exactly encode per-node Hamming-weight constraints. For an 8-node CBRS interference graph with 24 qubits, the effective search space is reduced from the full Hilbert space of size $2^{24}$ to 2916 feasible configurations. Within this subspace, the algorithm converges rapidly to low-conflict assignments without large penalty coefficients. Simulations on instances with up to eight nodes show that the proposed ansatz achieves near-optimal conflict levels and consistently outperforms standard penalty-based QAOA and a greedy classical heuristic in terms of feasibility. Noise simulations with depolarizing channels further indicate that the constraint-preserving structure maintains a high feasibility ratio in NISQ-relevant error regimes."}

We then show that the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole can be consistently embedded in this framework via a localized free scalar field, providing a simple yet nontrivial example of a braneworld compact object. Finally, we derive two novel black string solutions sourced by a localized nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) theory with Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{F}) = -β\\sqrt{\\mathcal{F}}$, corresponding to purely magnetic and dyonic configurations. The purely magnetic solution reproduces the classical Letelier string cloud on the brane, while the dyonic solution generalizes it to include electric charge, closely paralleling the Letelier-Alencar construction.

However, the broader adoption of QTF-AFM has been constrained by the difficulty of attaching a cantilever tip to a quartz tuning fork (QTF) with the positional and angular precision required for repeatable and reproducible probe fabrication. For stable operation, the tip must be placed precisely at the midline of a single tine, aligned parallel to the prong axis, and rigidly secured. Even slight lateral offsets or angular deviations disrupt the intrinsic antisymmetric flexural mode, induce torsional coupling, and ultimately lead to systematic image distortions and reduced measurement integrity. In this work, we present a comprehensive, semi-automated QTF-tip fabrication system that integrates precision alignment, real-time frequency-sweep monitoring, and controlled Q-factor tuning within a single workflow. Experimental characterization demonstrates consistent probe preparation across multiple trials, preservation of sharp and well-defined resonance responses with deliberately adjustable damping, and high-fidelity, high-resolution imaging in practical scanning tests. This integrated approach provides a reproducible framework to QTF-based probe fabrication, lowering the technical barrier to QTF-AFM implementation and broadening its applicability across diverse sample types and operating environments."}

The resulting function space includes multiple polylogarithms as well as iterated integrals with a K3 period, which generate a spurious velocity divergence at $v/c=\\sqrt{8}/3$. This divergence is present in the potential region and must be cancelled by conservative memory contributions from radiative regions. We find that the standard use of Feynman propagators to access the conservative sector fails to ensure this cancellation. We propose a conservative propagator prescription which realises both cancellations leading to a physically sensible answer.

Van der Waals (vdW) metasurfaces have recently emerged as promising candidates for sustaining BICs and hybridizing with material transitions. However, the realization of flat-band BICs remains elusive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate polaritonic high-order BICs on a wide-angle flat band utilizing a subwavelength metasurface made of a vdW magnet CrSBr. The large oscillator strength of direct excitons in CrSBr enables near ultrastrong coupling with BICs, leading to strongly suppressed polaritonic angular dispersions. Remarkably, second-order polaritonic BICs become flat-band across a wide angular range, with corresponding Q factors exceeding 1500. Additionally, we find that these polaritonic BICs vanish in the transverse magnetic configuration, while leading to fascinating surface hyperbolic exciton-polaritons within the Reststrahlen band. Our findings underscore CrSBr as an exceptional platform for exploring flat-band photonics and polaritonics, paving the new avenue for advances in next-generation optical and quantum technologies."}

We find that a matrix product state representation with a bond dimension of 4 is sufficient to give a highly accurate approximation for all dimensions tested, up to $2^{24}$. This matrix product state can be efficiently prepared using a sequence of simple three-qubit operations. When the dimension is a power of 2, the phase estimation can be performed with only three qubits for the control register, making it suitable for early-generation fault-tolerant quantum computers with a limited number of logical qubits."}

Existing training approaches largely rely on gradient-based procedural optimization, which often suffers from slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and instability near sharp minima. In this work, we propose an alternative inverse-probability algebraic learning framework for QNNs. Instead of updating parameters through incremental gradient descent, our method treats learning as a local inverse problem in probability space, directly mapping discrepancies between predicted and target Born-rule probabilities to parameter corrections via a pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian. This algebraic update is covariant, does not require learning-rate tuning, and enables rapid movement toward the vicinity of a loss minimum in a single step. We systematically compare the proposed method with gradient descent and Adam optimization in both regression and classification tasks using a teacher-student QNN benchmark. Our results show that algebraic learning converges significantly faster, escapes loss plateaus, and achieves lower final errors. Under finite-shot sampling, the method exhibits near-optimal error scaling, while remaining robust against intrinsic hardware noise such as dephasing. These findings suggest that inverse-probability algebraic learning offers a principled and practical alternative to procedural optimization for QNN training, particularly in resource-constrained near-term quantum devices."}

However, barren plateaus and ill-conditioned optimization landscapes remain among the primary obstacles faced by VQAs, often leading to unstable convergence and high sensitivity to initialization. Motivated by this challenge, we investigate whether a purely classical remedy, standard L2 squared-norm regularization, can systematically stabilize hybrid quantum-classical optimization. Specifically, we augment the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) objective with a quadratic penalty proportional to the squared norm of the parameters, without modifying the quantum circuit or measurement process. Across all tested Hamiltonians, H2, LiH, and the Random Field Ising Model (RFIM), we observe improved performance over a broad window of the regularization strength. Our large-scale numerical results demonstrate that classical regularization provides a robust, system-independent mechanism for mitigating VQE instability, enhancing the reliability and reproducibility of variational quantum optimization without altering the underlying quantum circuit."}

The performance of quantum algorithms is often measured by their query complexity, which quantifies the number of oracle calls required to access the input. The main parameters determining the complexity of QLS solvers are the condition number $κ$ and sparsity $s$ of the linear system, and the target error $ε$. To date, the best known query-complexity lower bound is $Ω(κ\\log(1/ε))$, which establishes the optimality of the most recent QLS solvers. The original proof of this lower bound is attributed to Harrow and Kothari, but their result is unpublished. Furthermore, when discussing a more general lower bound including the sparsity $s$ of the linear system, it has become folklore that it should read as $Ω( κ\\sqrt{s}\\log(1/ε))$. In this work, we establish the rigorous lower bound capturing the sparsity dependence of QLS. We prove the lower bound of $Ω(κ\\sqrt{s})$ for any quantum algorithm that solves QLS with constant error.

Although our implementation uses classical light, it reproduces the statistics predicted for the simplest scenario. Since the states and measurements of this scenario underpin computational advantages in tasks such as two-bit quantum random access codes -- among the simplest communication primitives enabling semi-device-independent certification of nonclassicality -- our implementation is directly relevant for such applications."}

Leveraging the new opportunities offered by dual-species systems, such as species-alternated driving, our construction exploits simple Floquet protocols on static atom arrangements, and benefits of generalized blockade regimes (different inter- and intra-species interactions). We focus on discrete dynamical models that are special examples of Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA), and explicitly consider a number of relevant examples, including the kicked-Ising model, the Floquet Kitaev honeycomb model, and the digitization of generic translation-invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians (e.g., for Trotterized evolution). As an application, we study chaotic features of discretized many-body dynamics that can be detected by leveraging only demonstrated capabilities of globally-driven experiments, and benchmark their ability to discriminate chaotic evolution."}

Here, we present two recalibration techniques for efficient generation of high quality entanglement using a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN)-based spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) source with minimum intervention. The first is a heuristic algorithm (HA) which mimics the manual alignment process in a laboratory. The second is based on reinforcement learning (RL). Our simulation demonstrates superior performance of RL with AUC=0.9119 compared to HA's 0.7042 in the modified ROC analysis (60 min threshold). RL achieves perfect alignment in 10 min as opposed to HA's 30 min. Both the methods operate within feasible satellite constraints, offering scalable automation for complex quantum communication scenarios."}

L. White"], "title": "Formalising an operational continuum limit of quantum combs", "comment": "28 pages + 13 page Appendix, 1 figure. Comments welcome!", "summary": "Quantum combs are powerful conceptual tools for capturing multi-time processes in quantum information theory, constituting the most general quantum mechanical process. But, despite their causal nature, they lack a meaningful physical connection to time -- and are, by and large, arguably incompatible with it without extra structure. The subclass of quantum combs which assumes an underlying process is described by the so-called process tensor framework, which has been successfully used to study and characterise non-Markovian open quantum systems. But, although process tensors are motivated by an underlying dynamics, it is not a priori clear how to connect to a continuous process tensor object mathematically -- leaving an uncomfortable conceptual gap. In this work, we take a decisive step toward remedying this situation. We introduce a fully continuous process tensor framework by showing how the discrete multi-partite Choi state becomes a field-theoretic state in bosonic Fock space, which is intrinsically and rigorously defined in the continuum. With this equipped, we lay out the core structural elements of this framework and its properties. This translation allows for an information-theoretic treatment of multi-time correlations in the continuum via the analysis of their continuous matrix product state representatives. Our work closes a gap in the quantum information literature, and opens up the opportunity for the application of many-body physics insights to our understanding of quantum stochastic processes in the continuum."}

This work was motivated by an experimental desire to determine the Zeeman splitting of an electron spin on a quantum dot (a spin qubit), and in a related work we show that this splitting energy can be found by measuring the charge occupancy of the dot while sweeping the frequency of the driving field \\ arXiv:2503.17481. Here we cover the full derivation of the equation and give the jump operators. These jump operators are potentially useful for describing the stochastic behavior of more complex systems with coherent driving of a spin capable of tunneling on or off of a device, such as in electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy. The jump operators have the interesting feature of combining jumps of electrons onto and off of the device."}

Current magic trapping techniques are insufficient to engineer magic trapping conditions for qudits encoded in hyperfine states with $J \\neq 0$, compromising qudit coherence.

We show it is possible to suppress differential light shifts across all magnetic sublevels of the $5s5p$ $\\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$ state by using two carefully chosen wavelengths (with comparable tensor light shift magnitude and opposite sign) at an appropriate intensity ratio, thus suppressing light-shift induced dephasing, enabling scalar magic conditions between the ground state and $5s5p$ $\\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$, and tensor magic conditions for qudits encoded within it. Furthermore, this technique enables robust operation at the tensor magic angle 54.7$^\\circ$ with linear trap polarization via reduced sensitivity to uncertainty in experimental parameters. We expect this technique to enable new loading protocols, enhance cooling efficiency, and enhance nuclear spins' coherence times, thus facilitating qudit-based quantum computing in ${}^{87}$Sr in the $5s5p$ $\\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$ manifold."}

We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride."}

In these new variables, the Hamiltonian constraint reduces to a quadratic function with no potential term. Its quantum realization leads to a Wheeler-DeWitt equation reminiscent of the massless Klein-Gordon case. As an illustrative example, we consider the action of a tachyonic field and investigate the conditions under which a phantom crossing can occur as a quantum tunneling effect.

Although terahertz (THz) assistance offers a promising route, cutoff extension at weak, laboratory-accessible THz strengths remain poorly understood. In this report, we comprehensively investigate THz-assisted high-order harmonic generation (HHG) using time-dependent Schrödinger equation simulations supported by classical trajectory analysis and Bohmian-based quantum dynamics. By mapping the plateau evolution versus THz strength, we show that even weak THz fields can extend the cutoff, producing a pronounced ``fish-fin'' structure whose prominent rays saturate near $I_p + 8 U_p$. We trace this extension to long electron excursions spanning several optical cycles before recombination, and provide a fully consistent explanation using both classical analysis and Bohmian trajectories flow. Our findings reveal that this cutoff-extension mechanism is remarkably robust, persisting across different atomic species and remaining insensitive to variations in the driving parameters. These results demonstrate that cutoff control is achievable with laboratory-scale THz fields, offering practical guidelines for engineering coherent high-energy HHG, and providing a robust pathway for tracking ultrafast electron motion in real time."}
