However, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood,\nand a significant gap persists between experimental observations and\ntheoretical descriptions. This challenge arises from the intrinsically\nmulti-scale nature of the problem, where non-perturbative feedback occurs\nacross different spatial and temporal scales. Collective coupling between a\nmacroscopic ensemble of molecules and a photonic environment, such as\nFabry-Perot cavity, can strongly influence the microscopic properties of\nindividual molecules, while microscopic details of the ensemble in turn affect\nthe macroscopic coupling. To address this complexity, we present an efficient\ncomputational framework that combines density-functional tight binding (DFTB)\nwith finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations for Maxwell's equations\n(DFTB+Maxwell). This approach allows for a self-consistent treatment of both\nthe cavity and microscopic details of the molecular ensemble. We demonstrate\nthe potential for this method by tackling several open questions. First, we\ncalculate non-perturbatively two-dimensional spectroscopic observable that\ndirectly connect to well-established experimental protocols. Second, we provide\nlocal, molecule-resolved information within collectively coupled ensembles,\nwhich is difficult to obtain experimentally. Third, we show how cavity designs\ncan be optimized to target specific microscopic applications.

Comments and suggestions are most\n  welcome, email ID-saran@phas.ubc.ca", "summary": "In this article, we propose the realization of conformal manifolds, which are\nsmooth manifolds of scale-conformal invariant interacting Hamiltonians in\ntwo-dimensional quantum many-body systems. Such phenomena can occur in various\ninteracting systems, including topological surfaces or 2D bulks. Building on\nprevious observations, we demonstrate that a conformal manifold can emerge as\nan exact solution when the number of fermion colors, \\(N_c\\), becomes infinite.\nWe identify distinct exact marginal deformation operators uniquely associated\nwith the conformal manifolds. By considering \\(N_c\\) as finite but large, we\nshow that quantum fluctuations induce a fermion field renormalization that\nresults in mildly infrared relevant or irrelevant renormalization-group (RG)\nflow within a conformal manifold, producing standard isolated infrared stable\nWilson-Fisher fixed points. These can be grouped with ultraviolet stable fixed\npoints into a discrete manifold due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an\nemergent \\(SO(\\mathcal{N})\\) dynamical symmetry in the RG flow as \\(N_c\n\\rightarrow \\infty\\). Additionally, we find a correlation between the direction\nof the RG flow within the manifold and an increase in EPR-like entanglement\nentropy. The infrared-stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points, induced by quantum\nfluctuations, are linked to theories on the conformal manifold where\ninteraction operators are maximally entangled in flavor space.

In this paper we explore LTB\nwormholes and discuss their possible observable appearance studying in detail\nthe effects of gravitational lensing by such objects. For this aim, we study\nphoton motion in wormhole space-time inscribed in a closed Friedmann dustfilled\nuniverse and find the wormhole shadow as it could be seen by a distant\nobserver. Since the LTB wormhole is a dynamic object, we analyze the dependence\nof its shadow size on the observation time and on the initial size of the\nwormhole region. We reveal that the angular size of the shadow exhibits a\nnon-monotonic dependence on the observation time. At early times, the shadow\nsize decreases as photons with smaller angular momentum gradually reach the\nobserver. At later times, the expansion of the Friedmann Universe becomes a\ndominant factor that leads to an increase in the shadow size.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Although Hamiltonian\nlearning has been extensively investigated, two issues recur in much of the\nexisting literature: the absence of matching lower bounds and the use of\nmathematically convenient but physically opaque error measures.\n  We address both challenges by introducing two physically motivated distances\nbetween Hamiltonians and designing a nearly optimal algorithm with respect to\none of these metrics. The first, time-constrained distance, quantifies\ndistinguishability through dynamical evolution up to a bounded time. The\nsecond, temperature-constrained distance, captures distinguishability through\nthermal states at bounded inverse temperatures.\n  We show that $s$-sparse Hamiltonians with bounded operator norm can be\nlearned in both distances with $O(s \\log(1/\\epsilon))$ experiments and\n$O(s^2/\\epsilon)$ evolution time. For the time-constrained distance, we further\nestablish lower bounds of $\\Omega((s/n)\\log(1/\\epsilon) + s)$ experiments and\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{s}/\\epsilon)$ evolution time, demonstrating near-optimality in\nthe number of experiments.\n  As an intermediate result, we obtain an algorithm that learns every Pauli\ncoefficient of $s$-sparse Hamiltonians up to error $\\epsilon$ in\n$O(s\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ experiments and $O(s/\\epsilon)$ evolution time,\nimproving upon several recent results.\n  The source of this improvement is a new isolation technique, inspired by the\nValiant-Vazirani theorem (STOC'85), which shows that NP is as easy as detecting\nunique solutions. This isolation technique allows us to query the time\nevolution of a single Pauli coefficient of a sparse Hamiltonian--even when the\nPauli support of the Hamiltonian is unknown--ultimately enabling us to recover\nthe Pauli support itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff08$s$-\u7a00\u758f\uff09\u5728Pauli\u57fa\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "Hamiltonian \u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0b\u754c\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u663e\u5f0f\u9519\u8bef\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5177\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u8ddd\u79bb\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u8fd1\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5355Pauli\u7cfb\u6570\u5206\u79bb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7075\u611f\u6765\u6e90\u4e8eValiant-Vazirani\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u5355\u72ec\u5206\u79bb\u7279\u5b9a\u7684Pauli\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5f53Hamiltonian\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u8303\u6570\u6709\u754c\u65f6\uff0c$s$-\u7a00\u758f\u7684Hamiltonian\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728$O(s \thinspace \text{log}(1/\thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace))$\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c$O(s^2 / \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace)$\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u5b8c\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u66f4\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86$\thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace$\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fd8\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728$O(s \thinspace \text{log}(1/\thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace))$\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c$O(s / \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace)$\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2aPauli\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u8fd1\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758fHamiltonian\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8fd1\u4f18\u6027\u3002"}}

We address this problem from a theoretical perspective by\nstudying the graphic parity network synthesis problem. A graphic parity network\nfor a graph $G$ is a quantum circuit composed solely of CNOT gates where each\nedge of $G$ is represented in the circuit, and the final state of the wires\nmatches the original input. We aim to synthesize graphic parity networks with\nthe minimum number of gates, specifically for quantum algorithms addressing\ncombinatorial optimization problems with Ising formulations. We demonstrate\nthat a graphic parity network for a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$\nedges requires at least $m+n-1$ gates. This lower bound can be improved to\n$m+\\Omega(m) = m+\\Omega(n^{1.5})$ when the shortest cycle in the graph has a\nlength of at least five. We complement this result with a simple randomized\nalgorithm that synthesizes a graphic parity network with expected $m +\nO(n^{1.5}\\sqrt{\\log n})$ gates.

In\nthis work we show that the additive complexity of $O(T + \\log(1/\\epsilon))$ is\nreachable for the simulation of a large class of Lindbladian by constructing a\nnovel quantum algorithm based on quantum trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fLindblad master\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u65b0\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e00\u7c7bLindbladian\u7684\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5176\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e3a$O(T + \\\nlog(1/\\\\epsilon))$\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

As unitary discrimination depends on both the choice of probing\nstates and the measurements on the evolved states, we classify LOCC and global\ndistinguishability into two categories: adaptive strategies, where probing\nstates are chosen based on measurement outcomes from other subsystems, and\nrestricted strategies, where probing states remain fixed. Our findings uncover\nthree surprising features in the bipartite setting and establish new structural\nlimits for unitary discrimination: (i) Certain pairs of unitaries are globally\ndistinguishable with restricted strategies but indistinguishable under LOCC,\neven with adaptive strategies. (ii) There exist sets of four unitaries that are\ndistinguishable via LOCC, yet remain globally indistinguishable with restricted\nstrategies.
