Result: 该方法可将绝对电四极矩的不确定性减少一个数量级，特别是在单日测量中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该研究为核结构研究和量子化学计算提供了精确的参考数据。

Abstract: We present a novel method for accurately measuring the absolute electric quadrupole moments of light transition elements $(23 \leq Z \leq 30 )$. Our approach is based on performing precision muonic x-ray spectroscopy of the $2s-2p$ manifold, which is also referred to as the Lamb shift. These transitions are too weak to be detected with dispersive methods and too overlapping to be resolved by solid-state detectors. Here, we propose the use of cryogenic microcalorimeters, which possess high efficiency and excellent energy resolution in the relevant energy regime, coupled with state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by performing extensive calculations and realistic simulations. In this way, we establish that the uncertainty in the absolute moment, which is transferred to the quadrupole moments of all isotopes in the chain, could be reduced by up to an order of magnitude within a day of measurement. These precise reference quadrupole moments serve as valuable inputs for nuclear structure studies and for benchmarking state-of-the-art quantum chemistry calculations in open-shell elements.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Circular Rydberg states offer advantages for quantum information and quantum simulation platforms due to their long lifetimes and strong dipole-dipole interactions. Unfortunately, current techniques for the production of these states remain technically challenging. Here we investigate the ability of twisted electron collisions to produce circular Rydberg states. Twisted electrons carry quantized orbital angular momentum that can be transferred to the electronic state of the atom, potentially providing an efficient means to generate circular Rydberg states. Using a fully quantum mechanical framework, we compute total excitation cross sections for circular Rydberg states of hydrogen, rubidium, and cesium targets using Bessel electron beams. Our models account for the full Bessel-beam structure of the incident electron and incorporate macroscopic target effects to model experimentally-relevant conditions. Our results show that twisted electrons with large opening angles produce significant enhancements in the excitation probability relative to plane-wave electrons, particularly for large opening angles and low energies. We trace this enhancement to contributions from projectiles with large values of orbital angular momentum. These findings demonstrate that twisted-electron excitation may provide a feasible and potentially advantageous pathway for generating circular Rydberg states.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the ground-state Hanle effect in alkali-metal vapor irradiating by a resonant elliptically polarized light wave. The magneto-optical resonances are observed as a change in the ellipticity parameter of the light wave polarization when scanning the transverse magnetic field near zero. We use a miniature ($\approx\,$$0.125$ cm$^3$) glass cesium vapor cell heated to a relatively low temperature of $\approx\,$$85^\circ$C. Under the current experimental conditions, the sensitivity of magnetic field measurements is limited by a technical noise, reaching $180$ fT/$\surd$Hz in a $200$ Hz bandwidth. The ultimate photon-shot-noise-limited sensitivity of the method is estimated to be $\approx\,$$5$ fT/$\surd$Hz. The proposed scheme is promising for the development of a zero-field atomic magnetometer with reduced heat dissipation of the sensor head and relaxed requirements for magnetic shielding compared to counterparts operating in the spin-exchange relaxation-free regime. These features are of particular value for biomedical applications.

Abstract: The electronic structure of the ICl+ molecular ion is investigated by using high-level multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method. To improve computational accuracy, Davidson corrections, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and core-valence electron correlations effects are incorporated into the calculations. The potential energy curves (PECs) of 21 electronic states associated with the two lowest dissociation limits are obtained. The dipole moments (DMs) of the 21 electronic states of ICl+ are systematically studied, and the variations of DMs of the identical symmetry state in the avoided crossing regions are elucidated by analyzing the dominant electronic configuration. With the help of the calculated SOC matrix element, the interaction between crossing states can be elucidated. Spin-orbit coupling matrix elements involving the several states are calculated. By analyzing potential energy curves of these states and the nearby electronic states, the possible predissociation channels are provided. Based on the computed PECs, the spectroscopic constants of bound states are determined. The comparison of the spectroscopic constants including and excluding SOC effect indicates that the SOC effect has an obvious correction to the spectroscopic properties of low-lying states. Finally, the transition properties between excited states and the ground state are studied. Based on the computed transition dipole moments and Franck-Condon Factors, radiative lifetimes for the low-lying vibrational levels of excited states are evaluated.

Abstract: We report the first observation of free-electron angular momentum wave packets generated by atomic multiphoton ionization with bichromatic three-dimensional (3D) polarization-tailored ultrashort laser fields. These fields, created by the non-collinear superposition of two polarization-shaped pulses of different colors from a supercontinuum polarization pulse shaper, provide electric-field components along all spatial directions. The resulting photoelectron momentum distributions, recorded via velocity map imaging, demonstrate full 3D coherent control of electronic superposition states extending beyond the constraints of planar polarization fields by unlocking all dipole selection rules $Δm = 0,\pm1$. As an application, 3D pump-probe fields are used to image previously unobserved photoelectron wave packets mapping spin-orbit dynamics of the potassium $3d$ fine structure doublet. Our shaper-based approach establishes a route to fully controllable 3D light fields for chiral-sensitive light-matter interactions and ultrafast spectroscopy.

TL;DR: The Lu-Yb charge-radius difference is an extreme anomaly, challenging current nuclear physics theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding nuclear charge radius differences, especially the Lu inversion, is crucial for comprehending nuclear structure.

Method: High-precision extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy with Na-like and Mg-like ions, supported by relativistic atomic structure calculations.

Result: The calculated charge radius difference between Lu and Yb is 2.9 fm, much larger than predicted by nuclear density functional theory (DFT).

Conclusion: Current nuclear theories fail to explain the observed anomaly, suggesting unaccounted structural effects that must be explored.

Abstract: The nuclear charge radius is a fundamental observable that encodes key aspects of nuclear structure, deformation, and pairing. Isotonic (constant neutron number) systematics in the deformed rare-earth region have long suggested that odd-$Z$ nuclei are more compact than their even-$Z$ neighbors - except for Lu, whose recommended radius appeared anomalously large relative to Yb and Hf. We report a high-precision determination of the natural-abundance-averaged Lu-Yb charge-radius difference using extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy of highly charged Na-like and Mg-like ions, supported by high-accuracy relativistic atomic-structure calculations - a recently introduced method with the unique ability to measure inter-element charge radius differences. Combined with muonic-atom and optical isotope-shift data, our result resolves the longstanding Lu inversion anomaly and reestablishes a pronounced odd-even staggering along the $N=94$ isotonic chain. The magnitude of this staggering is unexpectedly large, far exceeding that observed in semi-magic nuclei and in deformed isotopic sequences. State-of-the-art nuclear density functional theory calculations, including quantified uncertainties, fail to reproduce this enhancement, possibly indicating missing structural effects in current models. Our work demonstrates the power of highly charged ions for precise, element-crossing charge-radius measurements and provides stringent new constraints for future theoretical and experimental studies of nuclear-size systematics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of ultrafast optical detection, which is crucial for quantum science, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast spectroscopy. The limitation of existing methods, such as up-conversion and optical Kerr gating (OKG), in providing ultrafast signal detection, prompted the search for a new material platform.

Method: The researchers utilized the third-order nonlinearity in graphene and thin graphite films. They operated at a repetition rate of 1 GHz, achieving 141 fs temporal resolution with sub-nanojoule pulses.

Result: The graphene and graphite-based system demonstrated exceptional performance, including a large nonlinear refractive index, reduced thickness requirements, and compatibility with microscopy and optical integration. This material platform shows great potential for nano-optical and on-chip ultrafast Kerr gating applications.

Conclusion: This breakthrough material platform significantly advances ultrafast signal processing in quantum science and optoelectronics, offering a compact and efficient solution for future applications.

Abstract: The ability to address sub-picosecond events of weak optical signals is essential for progress in quantum science, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast spectroscopy. While up-conversion and optical Kerr gating (OKG) offer femtosecond resolution, they are generally limited to ensemble measurements, making ultrafast detection in nano-optics challenging. OKG, with its broadband response and high throughput without phase-matching, is especially promising when used at high repetition rates under focused illumination.
  Here, we demonstrate an ultrafast detection scheme using the third-order nonlinearity of graphene and thin graphite films, operating at 1 GHz with sub-nanojoule pulses and achieving 141 fs temporal resolution. Their exceptionally large nonlinear refractive index, orders of magnitude higher than conventional Kerr media, enhances detection efficiency at smaller thicknesses, enables sub-picosecond response, and supports broadband operation. Their atomic-scale thickness minimizes dispersion and simplifies integration with microscopy platforms, optical fibers, and nanophotonic circuits, making them a compact, practical material platform for nano-optical and on-chip ultrafast Kerr gating.

Abstract: Production and manipulation of orbital angular momentum (OAM) of coherent soft x-ray beams is demonstrated utilizing consecutive diffractive optics. OAM addition is observed upon passing the beam through consecutive fork gratings. The OAM of the beam was found to be decoupled from its spin angular momentum (SAM). Practical implementation of angular momentum control by consecutive devices in the x-ray regime opens new experimental opportunities, such as direct measurement of OAM beams without resorting to phase sensitive techniques, including holography. OAM analyzers utilizing fork gratings can be used to characterize the beams produced by synchrotron and free electron lasers sources; they can also be used in scattering experiments.

Abstract: Natural hyperbolic materials have attracted significant interest in the field of photonics due to their unique optical properties. Based on the initial successful explorations on layered crystalline materials, hyperbolic dispersion was associated with extreme structural anisotropy, despite the rarity of natural materials exhibiting this property. Here we show that non cubic electrides are generally promising natural hyperbolic materials owing to charge localization in interstitial sites. This includes elemental and binary electrides, as well as some two-dimensional materials that show prominent in-plane hyperbolic dispersion. They exhibit low plasma frequencies and a broad hyperbolic window spanning the infrared to the ultraviolet. In semiconductor electrides, anisotropic interband transitions provide an additional mechanism for hyperbolic behaviour. These findings remove the previously held prerequisite of structural anisotropy for natural hyperbolic materials, and open up new opportunities, which might change the current strategy for searching and design photonic materials.

Conclusion: This work presents an innovative approach to optimizing optical kernels by incorporating structural nonlinearity, achieving the goal of low-power, high-performance computing in photonic systems.

Abstract: Optical kernel machines offer high throughput and low latency. A nonlinear optical kernel can handle complex nonlinear data, but power consumption is typically high with the conventional nonlinear optical approach. To overcome this issue, we present an optical kernel with structural nonlinearity that can be continuously tuned at low power. It is implemented in a linear optical scattering cavity with a reconfigurable micro-mirror array. By tuning the degree of nonlinearity with multiple scattering, we vary the kernel sensitivity and information capacity. We further optimize the kernel nonlinearity to best approximate the parity functions from first order to fifth order for binary inputs. Our scheme offers potential applicability across photonic platforms, providing programmable kernels with high performance and low power consumption.

Abstract: Light carrying transverse orbital angular momentum (T-OAM) in the form of spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) is opening new degrees of freedom for structured light manipulation. Such spatiotemporal wavepackets hold significant potential for optical trapping, analog optical computing, studying photonic symmetry and topology, among others. Up to now, synthesizing of such vortices is limited in one dimension, either in temporal or spatial domain. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a two-dimensional flexible mesh of spatiotemporal optical vortices (M-STOV) with programmable intensity nulls, and analyze their diffraction patterns for detection. Furthermore, we extend the spectral range of M-STOV via second-harmonic generation while examining the transfer of OAM in this nonlinear process. This study establishes a foundational framework for designing higher dimensional spatiotemporal vortex fields and promises a high-capacity information carrier based on ST optical vortices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of reconfigurable photonic devices is crucial for advancing technologies like quantum simulation, neuromorphic computing, and large-scale photonic processors. Current challenges include creating compact, efficient, and scalable platforms. Using optical phase-change materials, particularly antimony tri-selenide, offers a solution to these challenges by enabling non-volatile, reversible tuning of optical properties compatible with CMOS technologies.

Conclusion: This breakthrough opens a new pathway toward developing large-scale, compact, and reconfigurable photonic devices for advanced optical technologies, significantly reducing the required area for matrix operations compared to current methods.

Abstract: Reconfigurable photonic devices are rapidly emerging as a cornerstone of next generation optical technologies, with wide ranging applications in quantum simulation, neuromorphic computing, and large-scale photonic processors. A central challenge in this field is identifying an optimal platform to enable compact, efficient, and scalable reconfigurability. Optical phase-change materials (PCMs) offer a compelling solution by enabling non-volatile, reversible tuning of optical properties, compatible with a wide range of device platforms and current CMOS technologies. In particular, antimony tri-selenide ($\text{Sb}_{2}\text{Se}_{3}$) stands out for its ultra low-loss characteristics at telecommunication wavelengths and its reversible switching. In this work, we present an experimental platform capable of encoding multi-port operations onto the transmission matrix of a compact multimode interferometer architecture on standard 220~nm silicon photonics using \textit{in-silico} designed digital patterns. The multi-port devices are clad with a thin film of $\text{Sb}_{2}\text{Se}_{3}$, which can be optically addressed using direct laser writing to provide local perturbations to the refractive index. A range of multi-port geometries from 2$\times$2 up to 5$\times$5 couplers are demonstrated, achieving simultaneous control of up to 25 matrix elements with programming accuracy of 90% relative to simulated patterns. Patterned devices remain stable with consistent optical performance across the C-band wavelengths. Our work establishes a pathway towards the development of large scale PCM-based reconfigurable multi-port devices which will allow implementing matrix operations on three orders of magnitude smaller areas than interferometer meshes.

Abstract: Until recently, attosecond optical spectroscopy and quantum optics evolved along non-overlapping directions. In attosecond science, attosecond pulses have been regarded as classical waves, applied to probe electron dynamics on their natural time scale. Here, we transfer fundamental concepts of quantum optics into attosecond physics, enabling control of both the properties of the XUV attosecond pulses and the quantum fluctuations of matter on attosecond time scales. By combining bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) with a strong laser field to drive high-harmonic generation, we transfer the quantum properties of the BSV onto the resulting XUV attosecond pulses. Applying advanced attosecond interferometry, we reconstruct the quantum state of the XUV high harmonics and their associated attosecond pulses with attosecond precision. Finally, we resolve the squeezing of the electron's wavepacket during one of the most fundamental strong-field phenomena - field induced tunneling.

Abstract: We consider interface modes in block disordered subwavelength resonator chains in one dimension. Based on the capacitance operator formulation, which provides a first-order approximation of the spectral properties of dimer-type block resonator systems in the subwavelength regime, we show that a two-fold topological characterization of a block disordered resonator chain is available if it is of dominated type. The topological index used for the characterization is a generalization of the Zak phase associated with one-dimensional chiral-symmetric Hamiltonians. As a manifestation of the bulk-edge correspondence principle, we prove that a localized interface mode occurs whenever the system consists of two semi-infinite chains with different topological characters. We also illustrate our results from a dynamic perspective, which provides an explicit geometric picture of the interface modes, and finally present a variety of numerical results to complement the theoretical results.

*Hai-Xiao Wang,Li Liang,Shuai Shao,Shiwei Tang,Junhui Hu,Yin Poo,Jian-Hua Jiang*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This abstract discusses the role of trivial cladding in photonic topological phases, specifically for kagome photonic crystals with m{C}_6 and m{C}_3 symmetries. The study shows that trivial cladding can host topologically distinct phases and demonstrate geometry-induced band inversions, which are crucial for understanding and controlling topological boundary states. Experimental evidence is provided for corner states in a finite hexagonal supercell, suggesting practical applications in rainbow trapping and other photonic devices. The work offers a framework for designing photonic topological phases with tailored trivial claddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of trivial cladding in topological photonic materials is crucial for advancing the field of topological photonics. This work bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations, providing insights into how trivial cladding can be manipulated to control topological boundary states and enable new functionalities in photonic devices.

Method: The researchers considered two types of kagome photonic crystals based on m{C}_6 and m{C}_3 symmetries. They tuned the geometric parameters of the trivial cladding to demonstrate the effects of band inversions and phase transitions. Their model predictions were corroborated by experimental results showing corner states and their dependence on the trivial cladding.

Result: The work reveals that trivial cladding in kagome photonic crystals can realize different topological phases, including the quantum spin Hall phase and act as trivial cladding. The geometry-induced band inversions were experimentally observed, leading to the appearance and disappearance of corner states. This provides a foundational understanding of how trivial cladding can be used to manipulate topological boundary states and opens possibilities for novel photonic applications such as rainbow trapping.

Conclusion: This study emphasizes the significant role of trivial cladding in the emergence of topological boundary states. By tuning the trivial cladding's geometric parameters, researchers can induce band-inversion phenomena and control the topological phases of kagome photonic crystals. The experimental evidence of corner states and their dependence on trivial cladding paves the way for further research into higher-order topological photons and their applications in advanced photonic devices.

Abstract: Crystalline symmetry offers a powerful tool to realize photonic topological phases, in which additional trivial claddings are typically required to confine topological boundary states. However, the utility of the trivial cladding in manipulating topological waves is often overlooked. Here, we demonstrate two topologically distinct kagome photonic crystals (KPCs) based on different crystalline symmetries: \mathbit{C}_\mathbf{6}- symmetric KPCs exhibit a quantum spin Hall phase, while \mathbit{C}_\mathbf{3}-symmetric KPCs serve as trivial cladding. By tuning the geometric parameter of the trivial cladding, we observe that a pair of topological interface states featured with pseudospin-momentum locking undergoes a phase transition, accompanied by the appearance and disappearance of corner states in a finite hexagonal supercell. Such a geometry-induced band inversion is characterized by a sign change in the Dirac mass of the topological interface states and holds potential for applications such as rainbow trapping. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the corner states, which is a hallmark of higher-order topology, also depend critically on the trivial cladding. Our work highlights the crucial role of trivial claddings on the formation of topological boundary states, and offers a novel approach for their manipulation.

Abstract: Optical computing represents a groundbreaking technology that leverages the unique properties of photons, with innate parallelism standing as its most compelling advantage. Parallel optical computing like cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) based offers powerful computational capabilities but also introduces new challenges, particularly concerning dispersion due to the introduction of new frequencies. In this work, we extend existing theories of cascaded MZI systems to develop a generalized model tailored for wavelength-multiplexed parallel optical computing. Our comprehensive model incorporates component dispersion characteristics into a wavelength-dependent transfer matrix framework and is experimentally validated. We propose a computationally efficient compensation strategy that reduces global dispersion error within a 40 nm range from 0.22 to 0.039 using edge-spectrum calibration. This work establishes a fundamental framework for dispersion-aware model and error correction in MZI-based parallel optical computing chips, advancing the reliability of multi-wavelength photonic processors.

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) are transforming artificial intelligence by enabling generalizable, data-efficient solutions across different domains for a broad range of applications. However, the lack of large and diverse datasets limits the development of FM in nanophotonics. This work presents MOCLIP (Metasurface Optics Contrastive Learning Pretrained), a nanophotonic foundation model that integrates metasurface geometry and spectra within a shared latent space.

Abstract: Multimode fiber~(MMF) imaging using deep learning has high potential to produce compact, minimally invasive endoscopic systems. Nevertheless, it relies on large, diverse real-world medical data, whose availability is limited by privacy concerns and practical challenges. Although data augmentation has been extensively studied in various other deep learning tasks, it has not been systematically explored for MMF imaging. This work provides the first in-depth experimental and computational study on the efficacy and limitations of augmentation techniques in this field. We demonstrate that standard image transformations and conditional generative adversarial-based synthetic speckle generation fail to improve, or even deteriorate, reconstruction quality, as they neglect the complex modal interference and dispersion that results in speckle formation. To address this, we introduce a physical data augmentation method in which only organ images are digitally transformed, while their corresponding speckles are experimentally acquired via fiber. This approach preserves the physics of light-fiber interaction and enhances the reconstruction structural similarity index measure~(SSIM) by up to 17\%, forming a viable system for reliable MMF imaging under limited data conditions.

Abstract: A novel, to the best of our knowledge, ultralow-temperature luminescence thermometry strategy is proposed, based on a measurement of relative intensities of hyperfine components in the spectra of Ho$^{3+}$ ions doped into a crystal. A $^{7}$LiYF$_4$:Ho$^{3+}$ crystal is chosen as an example. First, we show that temperatures in the range 10-35 K can be measured using the Boltzmann behavior of the populations of crystal-field levels separated by an energy interval of 23 cm$^{-1}$. Then we select the 6089 cm$^{-1}$ line of the holmium $^5I_5 \rightarrow ^5I_7$ transition, which has a well-resolved hyperfine structure and falls within the transparency window of optical fibers (telecommunication S band), to demonstrate the possibility of measuring temperatures below 3 K. The temperature $T$ is determined by a least-squares fit to the measured intensities of all eight hyperfine components using the dependence $I(ν) = I_1 \exp(-bν)$, where $I_1$ and $b = aν+ \fracν{kT}$ are fitting parameters and a accounts for intensity variations due to mixing of wave functions of different crystal-field levels by the hyperfine interaction. In this method, the absolute and relative thermal sensitivities grow at $T$ approaching zero as $\frac{1}{T^2}$.and $\frac{1}{T}$, respectively. We theoretically considered the intensity distributions within hyperfine manifolds and compared the results with experimental data. Application of the method to experimentally measured relative intensities of hyperfine components of the 6089 cm$^{-1}$ PL line yielded $T = 3.7 \pm 0.2$ K. For a temperature of 1 K, an order of magnitude better accuracy is expected.

Motivation: This paper is likely motivated by the desire to harness topological protection for robust information transport, which is a key interest in condensed matter physics and photonic devices.

Method: The method involves theoretical modeling of 1D and 2D SSH chains, followed by experimental verification using split-ring resonators with controllable hopping strengths and pulse excitations to measure group delay.

Result: The experiment successfully observed fast transport times, independent of system size in 1D, and up to a chain length of 20.

Conclusion: Experimental evidence supports the use of SSH topology for protecting and accelerating information transport via edge states, providing guidance for photonic topological device applications.

Abstract: In order to transport information with topological protection, we explore experimentally the fast transport time using edge states in one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains. The transport time is investigated in both one- and two-dimensional models with topological non-trivial band structures. The fast transport is inherited with the wavefunction localization, giving a stronger effective coupling strength between the mode and the measurement leads. Also the transport time in one-dimension is independent of the system size. To verify the asertion, we implement a chain of split-ring resonators and their complementary ones with controllable hopping strengths. By performing the measurements on the group delay of non-trivially topological edge states with pulse excitations, the transport time between two edge states is directly observed with the chain length up to $20$. Along the route to harness topology to protect optical information, our experimental demonstrations provide a crucial guideline for utilizing photonic topological devices.

Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, the theoretical study of wave propagation in time varying materials is of current interest. Although significant in nearly all such experiments, material dispersion is commonly neglected in theoretical studies. Yet, as we show here, understanding the precise microscopic model for the material dispersion is crucial for predicting experimental outcomes. Here we study the temporal scattering coefficients of four different time-varying Drude-Lorentz models, exploring how an incident continuous wave splits into forward and backward waves due to an abrupt change in plasma frequency. The differences in the predicted scattering are unique to time-varying media, and arise from the exact way in which the time variation appears in the various model parameters. We verify our results using a custom finite difference time domain algorithm, concluding with a discussion of the limitations that arise from using these models with an abrupt change in plasma frequency.

As already known, the universe seen as an extended object embedded within a higher dimensional space time, modifies the dynamical background equations, which in turn results in correction contributions to the entropy and temperature of the apparent horizon. Additionally, we investigate the possibility that the apparent horizon and the bulk remain in thermal equilibrium across various matter contents, demonstrating that such properties are highly sensitive to the equation-of-state parameter.

Abstract: This work, which accompanies [1], is about constructing smooth solutions in type II and eleven dimensional supergravity which describe supersymmetry preserving RG flows from four-dimensional SCFTs in the UV to three-dimensional SQFTs in the IR, through holography. We show that all the different UV fixed points flow to theories which confine external quarks and have a mass gap. We proceed by presenting extended calculations of a plethora of observables and analyse the dual field theories in great detail. This includes a boundary analysis and application of holographic renormalization methods in the simplest case of the type IIB solution. Many of the observables computed here have a universal behaviour: they factorize into two parts, one of which includes information about the UV SCFTs, and the other describing the dynamics of the RG flow, which is the same regardless of the UV fixed point.

Abstract: Inspired by non-commutative geometry in string theory, we propose extended derivatives in black hole physics by incorporating a real antisymmetric tensor of rank 2 carrying similarities of certain stringy fields. Using gauge theory formulation of gravity via de Sitter group theory, we first find the associated black hole solutions by solving the Einstein field equations. Then, we study the thermodynamic properties by approaching the stability analysis, the criticality, and the phase transitions. Concretely, we investigate the P-V criticality behavior of the obtained solution. We compute and examine the Gibbs free energy revealing comparable attitudes with the Van der Waals phase transitions. Combining such results, we provide constraints on the deformed parameter B and the charge Q with the help of CUDA numerical methods exploited in machine learning computations. Precisely, we show that there are suitable ranges for such parameters where the obtained black holes behave like the Van der Waals fluid systems.

The exterior of the black hole is a self-dual solution with a photon ring. It develops an infinite near-horizon throat described by the Eguchi-Hanson instanton. An exact version of the so-called Love symmetry controls perturbations on the throat. Furthermore, the normalizable spectrum of this black hole provides quasinormal modes in Lorentzian signature.

We further derive the Euclidean attractor equations and evaluate the Wald entropy for the fully BPS AdS_2 x S^2 background. For half-BPS stationary configurations, we obtain the generalized stabilization equations expressing all fields in terms of harmonic functions on three-dimensional flat base space, extending the Lorentzian analysis of Cardoso et al.(arXiv:hep-th/0009234) to the Euclidean signature. Our results provide a framework for studying supersymmetric saddles and computing the gravitational indices entirely within Euclidean higher-derivative supergravity, without recourse to analytic continuation.

Abstract: We obtain localized field configurations with finite energy in a ($2+1$)-dimensional model with Maxwell and Chern-Simons gauge terms coupled to a massive complex scalar field. These non-topological solitons are characterized by the $U(1)$ frequency and a winding number. Thus, the solutions possess Noether charge and non-trivial angular momentum, which is not quantized in contrast to the topological case. We study the solitons and their integral characteristics numerically and demonstrate that they are kinematically stable. The obtained solutions allow for the thin-wall approximation in some region of frequencies. For each winding number, the Noether charge has a lower bound that coincides with an isolated point, where the non-relativistic conformal symmetry seems to be restored.

Abstract: We present an analytical study of the interior structure of hairy rotating black holes in three-dimensional Einstein gravity, minimally coupled to a complex scalar field with a sup-exponential potential. The interior dynamics of these black holes are characterized by an infinite sequence of Kasner epochs, separated by inversion and transitions, each of which admits an analytical description. We derive an explicit analytical expression for this infinite sequence of epochs. At late interior times, the geometry evolves into a curvature singularity, despite the local resemblance of each Kasner epoch to a regular Milne universe on a circle. These results reveal an interior structure richer and more complex than that of its 4D static black hole counterparts.

Abstract: We study the quantum aspects of the conformal gravity in four dimensions, specifically addressing a known discrepancy in beta functions between general quadratic curvature theories and conformal gravity, which corresponds to two scalar degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that this mismatch is resolved by carefully introducing gauge-fixing and ghost terms via the BRST symmetry, which effectively adds the two scalar modes. Drawing lessons from two-dimensional quantum gravity and Liouville theory, we proceed to integrate the four-dimensional trace anomaly to derive a consistent Liouville action, which is given by a free-field action for the conformal mode with a consistent conformal anomaly. Finally we give the condition that the BRST transformation is anomaly free.

Abstract: We develop a four-dimensional hyperunified gauge framework in which local Lorentz symmetry and internal gauge interactions are embedded into a special noncompact $\mathrm{SL}(2N,\mathbb{C})$ group acting on spinors. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields whose contracted invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $\mathrm{SL}(2N, \mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(N)$, lifting all noncompact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector, while an Einstein--Cartan linear curvature term is shown to arise radiatively from fermion loops. Below the breaking scale only the neutral tetrad (graviton) and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ vector fields remain massless, whereas axial-vector and tensor fields of the entire gauge multiplet acquire heavy masses. Applying the same $\mathrm{SL}(2N,\mathbb{C})$ symmetry to underlying preons in fundamental spin-$\tfrac12$ representations, rather than directly to quarks and leptons, together with the anomaly matching for the preon chiral symmetry, singles out $N=8$. The chain $\mathrm{SL}(16,\mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(8)$ then naturally yields three composite quark--lepton families, while filtering out extraneous heavy states.

Abstract: We obtain and solve the canonical differential equations for the three-loop banana integrals in dimensional regularisation when three of the four masses are equal. The K3 surface associated with the maximal cuts factorises into a product of two elliptic curves. This allows us to express the differential forms in the canonical differential equations in terms of meromorphic modular forms. We present a rigorous proof that these differential forms only have simple poles and that they define independent cohomology classes. We also present explicit results for all master integrals in terms of iterated integrals of meromorphic modular forms (and integrals thereof). This is the first time that it was possible to express the results of a Feynman integral associated with a K3 geometry and depending on two dimensionless ratios in terms of functions that have previously been studied in the literature.

Abstract: It has been shown by Yu.~Yaremko [Elect. J. Theor. Phys. {\bf 9}, 153 (2012)] within the classial electrodynamics that the hypothetical massless charged particle must generate an infinitely strong radiation reaction, thus not an external force can accelerate this particle. Here the version the Staruszkiewicz model is presented to describe the relativistic system of two massless charged particles interacting as follows: the retarded field of the first particle acts on the second particle, the advanced field of the second particle acts on the first particle, and a radiation reaction is neglected. The model is formulated within the Hamiltonian formalism with constraints. The system is invariant with respect to 15-parametric conformal group. The corresponding conserved canonical generators and the relativistic Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector provide a superintegrability of the system. The trajectory of the unbounded relative motion is represented by the hyperbolic conic section, similarly to the case of the non-relativistic Kepler problem. Surprisingly, however, the particle world lines appears the isotropic rectilinear rays, i.e., the particles behave as if non-interacting or neutral electrically. This result agrees with the aforementioned Yaremko's work, despite that the radiation reaction in the Staruszkiewicz model is abandoned.

Abstract: Massive bosonic fields can trigger superradiant instabilities in rotating astrophysical black holes leading to gaps in their mass-spin distribution. For spin-2 fields, the instability timescale is orders of magnitude shorter than for any other superradiant mode, thereby yielding much stronger constraints. We consider a tower of ultra-light spin-2 fields arising from a warped compactification of a single extra dimension and translate superradiant constraints on their masses into constraints on the warping. As a concrete scenario we consider the 2-brane Randall-Sundrum model and find constraints on the size of the extra dimension and the curvature of $AdS_5$. We discuss the implications of these bounds for strongly warped throats and D-brane uplifts commonly used in attempts to realise metastable de Sitter vacua in string theory.

### [39] [Iterative improvement of free energy landscape reconstructions with optimal protocols derived from differentiable simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17831)
*Oliver Cheng,Zosia Adamska,Michael P. Brenner,Megan C. Engel*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: An iterative algorithm for optimizing free energy landscape reconstructions using experimental or simulated data, which adaptively derives control protocols without prior knowledge of the landscape, resulting in reduced variance and bias compared to naive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the kinetics and properties of biomolecules at atomic resolution requires accurate reconstruction of their free energy landscapes. Traditional approaches often rely on prior knowledge of the landscape, which can limit their effectiveness. This paper introduces an alternative iterative algorithm that optimizes control protocols in real-time, enabling more accurate and efficient free energy landscape reconstructions.

Method: The algorithm involves iterative updates of control protocols based on experimental or simulated trajectory data. It uses low-dimensional differentiable Brownian dynamics simulations and automatic differentiation to derive optimal protocols in each iteration.

Result: The method successfully recovers known benchmarks and performs well in far-from-equilibrium regimes for various types of energy landscapes, outperforming naive linear protocols by reducing both variance and bias in the reconstructions.

Conclusion: This approach provides a powerful new tool for accurately reconstructing free energy landscapes without requiring prior knowledge of their structure, opening up new possibilities for studying biomolecular processes at atomic resolution.

Abstract: Free energy landscapes encode the kinetics, intermediates, and transition states that govern molecular processes and are thus a key target of single biomolecule research. Typical approaches to deriving optimal, error-minimizing, non-equilibrium driving protocols for estimating these landscapes require a priori knowledge of the landscape. Here, we present an alternative: an iterative algorithm for optimizing full free energy landscape reconstructions which can be used alongside experiments on unknown landscapes. Our approach (i) takes experimental or simulated trajectory data; (ii) reconstructs an `approximate' energy landscape; (iii) derives optimal control protocols from low-dimensional differentiable Brownian dynamics simulations on the candidate landscape using automatic differentiation; (iv) re-runs the experiment or simulation using the updated protocol; and (v) iterates until convergence. Using this approach, we recover known benchmarks from the literature and probe far-from-equilibrium regimes for symmetric, asymmetric, and triple-well energy landscapes under both 1- and 2-dimensional control. Our control protocols -- derived with no a priori knowledge of the energy landscape -- yield substantially reduced variance and bias in free energy landscape reconstructions compared to naive linear protocols.

Abstract: Valley topology has emerged as a key concept for realizing new classes of quantum states. Here, we investigate Floquet-engineered topological phase transitions in anisotropic 1T'-WSe2 and its Janus derivative WSeTe monolayers, which exhibit valley-degenerate and valley-polarized characteristics, respectively. In 1T'-WSe2, a single topological-phase-transition (TPT) occurs from the quantum-spin-Hall state (QSH) to the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state, involving one spin channel at both valleys simultaneously. In contrast, Janus WSeTe undergoes a two-stage Floquet-driven TPT that occurs within a single valley and sequentially involves two spin components. The intermediate phase manifests as a valley-polarized QAH (vp-QAH) state with a finite valley Chern number, while the final phase evolves into a high-Chern-number QAH state with distinct valley gaps. Furthermore, an in-plane anisotropic response of the TPTs is predicted under oblique light incidence, reflecting the intrinsic low-symmetry nature of the lattice. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of Floquet-engineered valley-based topological properties and offer guidance for designing light-controllable valleytronic and topological devices.

Abstract: Under certain conditions, applying a sequence of voltage pulses of alternating polarities across a resistive switching memory device induces a finite number of fixed-point attractors, known as dynamical attractors. Remarkably, dynamical attractors can be used to program analog values into the device state without supervision. Because different pulse sequences can produce the same trajectory solution for the state in the phase space, there is strong potential for optimization, particularly in regard to the energy cost of the programming phase, which this study addresses. Without loss of generality, the proposed theory-based energy minimization strategy is applied to the voltage threshold adaptive memristor model, known for its predictive capability and adaptability to fit a large number of resistance switching memory devices. The optimization design crafts ad-hoc pulse sequences, that minimize the energy required to program the device into a desired dynamical attractor state. The theoretical approach is also extended to cover situations, where a fast programming scheme should be adopted to serve time-critical electronics applications.

Abstract: Electric-field control of spin states offers a promising route to ultra-low-power, ultra-fast magnetization switching in spintronic devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Recent progress in modulating spin-orbit interactions at the interfaces between 3d transition-metal ferromagnets and dielectric layers has underscored the role of atomic-scale heavy-metal doping in optimizing device performance. Here, we experimentally demonstrate highly energy-efficient, voltage-driven magnetization switching in MTJs exhibiting large tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR), enabled by a remote doping technique that precisely controls the iridium (Ir) concentration near the MgO-CoFeB interface in the free layer. Our devices achieve a switching energy of only 3.5 fJ per bit for nanoscale MTJs operating in the sub-nanosecond regime, while maintaining a TMR ratio up to 160 percent after 400 C post-annealing. These findings establish a viable pathway toward scalable, ultra-low-power nonvolatile memory, positioning voltage-driven MTJs as strong contenders for next-generation magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) and other emerging spintronic applications.

Abstract: A new mechanism for charge carrier scattering in transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers is proposed on the basis of the theory of two-dimensional nonlocal screening developed for the dielectric function of thin-layer insulating materials (P. Cudazzo et al. PRB 84, 085406 (2011)). The expressions for the transport relaxation time and for the electron mobility are obtained for electrons scattering on Coulomb impurity centers in monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenide on various substrates. It is found that taking nonlocal screening into account increases the mobility of electrons by several times. Although the value of the mobility decreases with increasing temperature, the relative enhancement due to nonlocal screening grows 6-9 times at room temperature, in the case of SiO$_2$ substrate.

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the real-space Chern number in a supercell framework. In this framework, the overlap matrix between two corners of the Brillouin zone (BZ) is derived from diagonalizing the real-space Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions. The pass-ordered product of overlap matrices around the BZ boundary forms a Wilson loop, and defines the Chern number in real space. It is analytically shown that the real-space Chern number is quantized at integers for large enough systems and coincides with the Bott index used in the previous studies. The formulation is greatly simplified for the former so that it makes numerical computations more efficient. The real-space formula is used to numerically elucidate topological phases in a disordered Chern insulator. The Chern insulator is modeled by dimensional extension of the Rice-Mele (RM) model consisting of two sublattices, and is disordered by including a random onsite potential. As disorder strength increases, the nontrivial-to-trivial phase transition takes place for normal disorder with no sublattice polarization. By contrast, the phase diagram is almost unaffected by polarized disorder, indicating that nontrivial topology persists against disorder. These observations are supported by the linear conductance and the density of bulk states.

Abstract: Topological phases have been extensively studied primarily in crystalline systems with translational symmetry. Recent theoretical studies, however, have demonstrated the existence of topological phases in quasicrystals that are absent in crystals. Despite numerous experimental observations of topological phases in various crystalline systems, observing these phases without crystalline counterparts remains challenging due to very complex models. Here, we design a practically realizable tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping on the Ammann-Beenker quasicrystalline lattice. This model respects eight-fold rotational and chiral symmetries, resulting in a higher-order topological phase with eight zero-energy corner modes that have no crystalline counterparts. We experimentally explore the topological phase in an acoustic quasicrystal. Surprisingly, we also discover symmetry-protected zero-energy modes near the center of the quasicrystal in a topologically trivial phase, a phenomenon not seen in crystals. We further experimentally observe these modes in a topologically trivial acoustic quasicrystal. Our work represents the first experimental observation of topological phases in quasicrystals without crystalline counterparts, paving the way for the study of exotic topological physics in quasicrystals.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) nanochannels have emerged as a pivotal platform for exploring nanoscale hydrodynamics and electrokinetics. Conventional fabrication methods to make nanochannels often introduce polymer contamination and require lengthy processing, limiting device performance and scalability. Here we introduce the Mask & Stack method, employing silicon nitride stencil mask combined with dry transfer stacking to rapidly fabricate ultraclean vdW nanochannels within hours. This polymer-free approach preserves pristine interfaces, confirmed by atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, and yields nanochannel devices exhibiting reproducible ionic transport and long-term stability. The streamlined process is compatible with diverse 2D materials and promising for upscale production. Our method advances the fabrication of nanofluidic and 2D heterostructure devices, facilitating applications in quantum transport, photonics, energy harvesting, and sensing technologies requiring high-throughput, contamination-free heterostructure architectures.

Abstract: Floquet engineering severs as a forceful technique for uncovering high Chern numbers of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states with feasible tunability in high-order topologically insulating plumbene, which is readily accessible for experimental investigations. Under the irradiation of righthanded circularly polarized light, we predict a three-stage topological phase transition in plumbene, whether it is in a free-standing form or grown on h-BN. Initially, a metallic state evolves into a K(K')-valley-based QAH state with a Chern number of -8, which then decreases to -6 after the valley gap closes. Finally, a band inversion occurs at the $Γ$ point, resulting in a multichannel QAH state with C = -3. The trigonal warping model accounts for both K(K')-valley-based and $Γ$-pointbased QAH states. Additionally, growing plumbene on a non-van-der-Waals substrate eliminates the K(K')-valley-based topology, leaving only the $Γ$-point-based QAH state with C = +3. Our findings propose the tunability of various high Chern numbers derived from high-order topological insulators, aiming to advance the next-generation dissipationless electronic devices.

TL;DR: An improved high overtone bulk acoustic resonator (X HTBAR) is developed with planar excitation, eliminating bottom electrodes and increasing efficiency.

Motivation: Overtone bulk acoustic resonators are vital for microwave signal processing and quantum technologies, so finding ways to enhance their efficiency and scalability is crucial.

Method: The X HTBAR uses a 128-degree Y-cut LiNbO3 film on a silicon substrate with lateral electrodes, removing Bottom electrodes and confining the acoustic field between top electrodes for efficient mode excitation.

Result: The X HTBAR achieves over 99% energy transfer efficiency, Comb-like phonon spectra up to 1.8 GHz, and high-quality factor (10^3 to 10^5) with tunable mode volumes for reliable operation in quantum interconnects.

Conclusion: The X HTBAR provides a reliable, efficient, and scalable solution for large-scale quantum technologies, marking significant progress in phonon-based microwave photonic devices.

Abstract: High overtone bulk acoustic resonators are essential components in microwave signal processing and emerging quantum technologies; however, conventional designs suffer from limited impedance matching, spurious mode interference, and restricted scalability. Here we introduce a laterally excited high overtone thickness shear bulk acoustic resonator, abbreviated as X HTBAR, that overcomes these limitations through a fully planar excitation scheme. The X HTBAR employs a 3 micron thick 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3 piezoelectric film on a 500 micron high resistivity silicon substrate, enabling efficient excitation of thickness shear modes through lateral electrodes without the need for bottom electrodes and confining the acoustic field between the top electrodes. This configuration removes parasitic loss channels, increases energy transfer efficiency to greater than ninety nine percent, and provides a stable free spectral range of about 5.75 MHz with very small fluctuations. Experimental measurements show comb like phonon spectra spanning 0.1 to 1.8 GHz, high quality factors in the range of ten to the power of three to ten to the power of five, frequency quality products larger than ten to the power of thirteen at room temperature, and a low temperature coefficient of frequency. In addition, a gridded electrode design together with the intrinsic properties of 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3, including insensitivity to electrode spacing and a large electromechanical coupling coefficient, suppresses spurious modes and allows tunable mode volumes from 0.008 to 0.064 cubic millimeters. These combined features give X HTBAR devices excellent integration compatibility and strong immunity to electrode related perturbations, making them promising multimode phonon sources for large scale quantum interconnects and microwave photonic integrated circuits.

Abstract: Within a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture, we theoretically investigate the detection of a single propagating microwave photon traveling through a resonant microwave cavity dispersively interacting with a double quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a lead. Under suitable conditions, a single photon in the cavity can induce a measurable change in the electronic occupation of the charge states. We develop a quantum cascade approach that enables a time-resolved description of a single-photon wave packet impinging on the cavity. We make use of a simple model of charge detector to assess the efficiency of our photo-detection configuration as functions of key parameters such as coupling strength, tunneling rate, temperature, and photon resonance linewidth. We finally highlight a measurement-induced backaction effect on the cavity mode associated with the dispersive, non-absorptive detection process.

Abstract: We introduce a topologically distinct skyrmion, termed a spin-flux skyrmion, which shares the same real-space magnetization profile as a conventional skyrmion but differs fundamentally in its underlying topological structure. This distinction originates from the path traced by its rotation matrices within the doubly connected SO(3) group manifold, leading to a nontrivial spinor phase of $e^{iπ}$ upon encircling the texture. Using an explicit SU(2) gauge field formalism, we derive the emergent magnetic field components generated by both conventional and spin-flux skyrmions. While conventional skyrmions exhibit a dominant $σ_z$ component with weak dipolar $σ_x, σ_y$ contributions, spin-flux skyrmions possess an additional monopolar $σ_x$ component that yields a finite average emergent field for a finite density of skyrmions. This nontrivial component introduces a nontrivial term in the Hall conductivity, enabling a direct explanation of experimental Hall resistivity anomalies that cannot be accounted for by conventional skyrmions alone. Moreover, we show that this additional term couples to the in-plane spin polarization of conduction electrons, providing a further tunable handle to control the transverse Hall response.

Result: 与QUBO相比，HUBO在测试案例中显著减少了qubit数量，减少了CNOT门的数量至少89.6%。

Conclusion: HUBO方法为当前和短期Quantum计算机提供了更有效的组合优化解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum approaches to combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are often limited by the resource demands of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) encodings, which enlarge circuits through penalty terms and increase qubit and gate counts. We show that Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) enables a more resource-efficient formulation. Our method systematically constructs HUBO Hamiltonians and, compared to QUBO in benchmarks on Gate Assignment (GAP), Maximum k-Colorable Subgraph (MkCS), and Integer Programming (IP) problems, exponentially reduces qubit requirements and decreases CNOT gate counts by at least 89.6% after compilation to single- and two-qubit gates for all tested instances. These results highlight HUBO as a practical alternative for current and near-term devices. To promote adoption, we release an open-source Python library that automates HUBO model construction, broadening access to resource-efficient quantum optimization.

Abstract: In this paper, the approach for considering fast charged particles scattering on targets of complex structure, which contains some isolated substructures, was expanded to account quadratic potential terms. Based on this approach, the differential cross section for scattering on the set of parallel planes with uniformly distributed atoms in each plane was obtained. It was shown that for this case the differential scattering cross section splits into coherent and incohent cross sections in the eikonal approximation analogously with the Born approximation.

Abstract: Quantum phenomena such as entanglement provide powerful resources for enhancing classical sensing. Here, we theoretically show that collective entanglement of spin qubits, arising from a condensation of particle-hole pairs, can strongly amplify transitions between ground and excited spin states, potentially improving signal contrast in optically detected magnetic resonance. This collective state exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum batteries, especially their charging dynamics, is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, ensuring reliable and scalable quantum platforms.

Method: The researchers employed analytical techniques including the{kicked-Ising model}, Clifford quantum cellular automata, momentum-space Floquet analysis, and the Cayley-Hamilton theorem to characterize the QB.

Result: The study finds that the kicked-Ising QB achieves maximal charging, exhibits robustness against disorder, and provides an intensified protocol for faster energy injection. Low-frequency driving further enhances the charging process.

Conclusion: This QB model offers a versatile and reliable framework that can be applied across various quantum computing platforms, enhancing their scalability and performance despite disorder and boundary conditions.

Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs) have emerged as promising candidates capable of outperforming classical counterparts by utilizing entangled operators. Spin chains, in particular, exhibit unique {charging} properties across diverse settings. Here, we introduce the kicked-Ising model as a QB and analytically characterize its charging dynamics within the self-dual operator regime, valid for arbitrary system sizes and Floquet cycles. Using Clifford quantum cellular automata and momentum-space Floquet analysis with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we obtain exact expressions for energy injection, uncovering the influence of boundary conditions and spin-chain parity on charging performance. The kicked-Ising QB achieves maximal charging while exhibiting remarkable robustness against disorder. We further propose an intensified protocol within a fixed time window that enables faster and more efficient energy injection, while non-uniform kick schedules enhance experimental flexibility. Spin correlators analysis further shows that low-frequency driving boosts energy injection, highlighting a clear connection between charging, scrambling, and kick-induced delocalization. Our theoretical framework are supported by tensor-network simulations and finally verified on IBM quantum hardware. Accounting for platform-specific constraints, we demonstrate that the kicked-Ising QB offers a scalable, disorder-resilient protocol and testbed to assess quantum platforms.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Bell inequalities provide a fundamental tool for probing nonlocal correlations, yet their quantum bound, that is, the maximal value attainable through quantum strategies, is rarely accessible analytically. In this work, we introduce a general construction of Bell inequalities for which this bound can be computed exactly. Our framework generalizes both the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and Gisin's elegant inequalities, yielding Bell expressions maximally violated by any number of pairwise anticommuting Clifford observables together with the corresponding maximally entangled state. Under suitable assumptions, our inequalities also enable the device-independent certification of Majorana fermions, understood as multiqubit realizations of Clifford algebra generators. Importantly, we identify an additional equivalence that must be incorporated into the definition of self-testing beyond invariance under local isometries and transposition. This equivalence arises from partial transposition applied to the shared state and to the measurements, which in specific cases leaves all observed correlations unchanged.

Abstract: Using programmable analog quantum annealing processors, we implement a sampling-based magnetic hysteresis protocol to probe the counterintuitive notion of magnetic memory of antiferromagnets. A key component of this protocol responsible for the hysteresis is a transverse field, which enables state transitions, while the magnetic field sweep is done via a longitudinal control field. We present evidence of full saturation and reversal of the hysteresis curve, as well as emergent magnetic domain mediated by quantum fluctuations that give rise to the magnetic memory effect in antiferromagnets.

Abstract: Estimating vibrational entropy is a significant challenge in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics due to its reliance on quantum mechanical properties. This paper introduces a quantum algorithm designed to estimate vibrational entropy via energy derivatives. Our approach block encodes the exact expression for the second derivative of the energy and uses quantum linear systems algorithms to deal with the reciprocal powers of the gaps that appear in the expression. We further show that if prior knowledge about the values of the second derivative is used then our algorithm can $ε$-approximate the entropy using a number of queries that scales with the condition number $κ$, the temperature $T$, error tolerance $ε$ and an analogue of the partition function $\mathcal{Z}$, as $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{\mathcal{Z}κ^2 }{εT}\right)$. We show that if sufficient prior knowledge is given about the second derivative then the query scales quadratically better than these results. This shows that, under reasonable assumptions of the temperature and a quantum computer can be used to compute the vibrational contributions to the entropy faster than analogous classical algorithms would be capable of. Our findings highlight the potential of quantum algorithms to enhance the prediction of thermodynamic properties, paving the way for advancements in fields such as material science, molecular biology, and chemical engineering.

Abstract: We extend the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, which is well-studied in the qubit framework, to its qutrit counterpart (which we call qutrit HHL, as opposed to qubit HHL, which is HHL using qubits). We design the circuit for the algorithm and develop a program for its implementation. We test HHL with qutrits for simple matrices and verify the results against the expected outcomes. We apply the algorithm to quantum chemistry, and in particular, to the potential energy curve calculations of the model problem of the hydrogen molecule in the split valence basis. We compare the number of qudits and the number of gates required between qubit and qutrit HHL implementations. In general, we find that for a fixed precision, the qutrit HHL circuit requires fewer number of qudits and comparable number of two-qudit gates than its qubit counterpart.

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的拓扑指标，扩展了非-Hermitian 系统中的拓扑分类，并补救了 BBC 的失效。

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) fundamentally invalidates the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC), leading topological diagnostics into a crisis. While the non-Bloch polarization $P_β$ defined on the generalized Brillouin zone restores momentum-space topology, a direct, robust real-space bulk probe has remained elusive. We resolve this by establishing a universal correspondence between $P_β$ and the entanglement polarization $χ$ of the biorthogonal ground state. Introducing a quasi-reciprocal Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$ that removes the NHSE while preserving bulk topology, we rigorously prove the fundamental identity $P_β \equiv χ(\tilde{H})\pmod 1$ in the thermodynamic limit under the quasi-locality assumption. Crucially, we demonstrate that this equivalence transcends the locality constraints that limit traditional topological invariants. While the conventional Resta polarization fails when $\tilde{H}$ becomes non-local due to the divergence of position variance, we reveal that $χ(\tilde{H})$ remains robustly quantized, protected by the Fredholm index of Toeplitz operators. Our work thus identifies entanglement as the unique real-space diagnostic capable of capturing non-Bloch topology beyond the breakdown of locality, successfully restoring the BBC across diverse non-Hermitian systems such as line-gap, point-gap, and gapless phases, thereby unifying the geometric and entanglement paradigms in non-Hermitian physics.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了低T深度对直觉模糊方案的影响，并提出了新的理论方向。

Abstract: In 2021, Broadbent and Kazmi developed a gate-teleportation-based protocol for computational indistinguishability obfuscation of quantum circuits. This protocol is efficient for Clifford+T circuits with logarithmically many T-gates, where the limiting factor in the efficiency of the protocol is the difficulty, on input a quantum circuit $C$, of the classical task of producing a description of the unitary obtained by conjugating a Pauli $P$ (corresponding to a Bell-measurement outcome) by $C$, where this description only depends on the input-output functionality of $CPC^{\dagger}$. The task above, in turn, is at least as hard as the problem of determining whether two $n$-qubit quantum circuits are perfectly equivalent up to global phase. In 2009, Tanaka defined the corresponding decision problem Exact Non-Identity Check (ENIC) and showed that ENIC is NQP-complete in general. Motivated by this, we consider in this work what happens when we pass from low T-count to low T-depth. In particular, we show that, for Clifford+T circuits of T-depth $O(\log(n))$, deciding ENIC is NP-hard. This effectively rules out the possibility, for Clifford+T circuits of logarithmic T-depth, of either efficient ENIC or efficient gate-teleportation based computational indistinguishability obfuscation, unless P=NP.

Abstract: We investigate the fundamental limits of entanglement generation under bipartite Hamiltonian dynamics when only finite physical resources-specifically, bounded energy variance-are available. Using the relative entropy of entanglement, we derive a closed analytical expression for the instantaneous entanglement generation rate for arbitrary pure states and Hamiltonians expressed in the Schmidt basis. We find that constraints based solely on the mean energy of the Hamiltonian are insufficient to bound the entanglement generation rate, whereas imposing a variance constraint ensures a finite and well-defined maximum. We fully characterize the Hamiltonians that achieve this optimal rate, establishing a direct relation between their imaginary components in the Schmidt basis and the structure of the optimal initial states. For systems without ancillas, we obtain a closed-form expression for the maximal rate in terms of the surprisal variance of the Schmidt coefficients and identify the family of optimal states and Hamiltonians. We further extend our analysis to scenarios where Alice and Bob may employ local ancillary systems: using a matrix-analytic framework and a refined description of the Hamiltonians allowed by the physical constraints, we derive an explicit optimization formula and characterize the attainable enhancement in entanglement generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) is a well benchmarked dynamical method for simulating nonadiabatic systems. In particular, the literature shows that for the spin-Boson model Hamiltonian, FSSH with appropriate corrections usually captures the detailed balance well and obtains rate constants within a factor of 2 compared to numerically exact results. In this study, we show that in the deep inverted Marcus regime, the augmented-FSSH (AFSSH, one version that includes decoherence) yields reasonably accurate rate constants but incorrect thermal populations over a broad range of parameters. We present an analytical derivation to understand the AFSSH behavior, and therefore, show that AFSSH obtains correct rate constants owing to the resonance of the time derivative coupling with the exothermicity, but obtains an incorrect thermal population owing to the self-consistency issue. The presented derivation provides an analytical expression for the quantum correction factor for AFSSH simulations in the Marcus inverted regime.

Motivation: Cryptography, particularly anamorphic encryption, gains relevance with quantum computing advancements.

Method: Theoretical analysis and mathematical proofs are employed to define and construct encryption schemes.

Result: A secure quantum anamorphic secret-sharing scheme is presented with applications in multi-party communication.

Conclusion: This research expands anamorphic encryption into the quantum realm, enhancing security in challenging communication scenarios.

Abstract: The concept of anamorphic encryption, first formally introduced by Persiano et al. in their influential 2022 paper titled ``Anamorphic Encryption: Private Communication Against a Dictator,'' enables embedding covert messages within ciphertexts. One of the key distinctions between a ciphertext embedding a covert message and an original ciphertext, compared to an anamorphic ciphertext, lies in the indistinguishability between the original ciphertext and the anamorphic ciphertext. This encryption procedure has been defined based on a public-key cryptosystem. Initially, we present a quantum analogue of the classical anamorphic encryption definition that is based on public-key encryption. Additionally, we introduce a definition of quantum anamorphic encryption that relies on symmetric key encryption. Furthermore, we provide a detailed generalized construction of quantum anamorphic symmetric key encryption within a general framework, which involves taking any two quantum density matrices of any different dimensions and constructing a single quantum density matrix, which is the quantum anamorphic ciphertext containing ciphertexts of both of them. Subsequently, we introduce a definition of computational anamorphic secret-sharing and extend the work of Çakan et al. on computational quantum secret-sharing to computational quantum anamorphic secret-sharing, specifically addressing scenarios with multiple messages, multiple keys, and a single share function. This proposed secret-sharing scheme demonstrates impeccable security measures against quantum adversaries.

Abstract: Exploring sign structures of quantum wave functions attracts considerable attention due to the potential for advances in modeling complex phases of matter. This stimulates developing different optimization procedures for imitating and manipulating sign structures of quantum states. In this work, utilizing a brute force approach based on a set of single-qubit transformations we evaluate protocols enabling positivization of the one-dimensional $J_1 -J_2$ model ground states in the regime of strong frustration. Based on the obtained positivization results, we show the difference between the cases of periodic and open boundary conditions, and also establish the dependence of the sign structure on parity of the simulated spin chains.

Abstract: We propose a general connection between entanglement-entropy scaling laws and the linear response functions of particle-conserving fermionic systems in their ground state. Specifically, we show that the response to perturbations coupled to the particle number within a finite region exhibits the same size scaling as the entanglement entropy of that region. We explicitly verify this scaling in free-fermion systems that display area-law, volume-law, and critical forms of entanglement. The resulting entanglement-governed scaling of response functions leads to unexpected physical consequences. For instance, contrary to conventional expectations, the energy absorption rate and particle-number fluctuations in gapped systems scale with the boundary of the perturbed region rather than with its volume. Our work thus establishes a direct link between linear-response properties and many-body entanglement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the distinguishability of quantum states is fundamental in quantum information theory, and efficient computation methods are desirable for practical applications.

Method: The authors derive properties of variational formulas for these entropies, leveraging convex optimization techniques such as Nesterov accelerated methods to develop algorithms.

Result: The proposed algorithms offer enhanced computational efficiency compared to previous methods based on semidefinite programming.

Conclusion: This work advances quantum hypothesis testing and optimization techniques, providing practically useful tools for quantum information processing tasks.

Abstract: The measured relative entropy and measured Rényi relative entropy are quantifiers of the distinguishability of two quantum states $ρ$ and $σ$. They are defined as the maximum classical relative entropy or Rényi relative entropy realizable by performing a measurement on $ρ$ and $σ$, and they have interpretations in terms of asymptotic quantum hypothesis testing. Crucially, they can be rewritten in terms of variational formulas involving the optimization of a concave or convex objective function over the set of positive definite operators. In this paper, we establish foundational properties of these objective functions by analyzing their matrix gradients and Hessian superoperators; namely, we prove that these objective functions are $β$-smooth and $γ$-strongly convex / concave, where $β$ and $γ$ depend on the max-relative entropies of $ρ$ and $σ$. A practical consequence of these properties is that we can conduct Nesterov accelerated projected gradient descent / ascent, a well known classical optimization technique, to calculate the measured relative entropy and measured Rényi relative entropy to arbitrary precision. These algorithms are generally more memory efficient than our previous algorithms based on semi-definite optimization [Huang and Wilde, arXiv:2406.19060], and for well conditioned states $ρ$ and $σ$, these algorithms are notably faster.

Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are spatially localized modes embedded in the spectrum of extended states, typically stabilized by symmetry or interference. While extensively studied in single-particle and linear systems, the many-body regime of BICs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that giant atoms, quantum emitters coupled nonlocally to structured waveguides, can host robust doublon BICs, i.e., two-photon bound states stabilized by destructive interference and interactions. We first analyze a driven two-photon emission process and show how doublon BICs arise and mediate decoherence-free interaction between distant atoms. We then demonstrate that these many-body BICs also emerge under natural, undriven dynamics via a virtual two-photon emission process in three-level giant atoms. Our results reveal an interference-based mechanism for stabilizing many-body localization in open quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum simulation, non-ergodic dynamics, and protected quantum information processing.

Abstract: Accurately resolving many-body satellite features in molecular core-level spectra requires theoretical approaches that capture electron correlation both efficiently and systematically. The recently developed time-dependent double coupled-cluster (TD-dCC) ansatz achieves this by combining correlation effects from the N- and (N-1)-electron sectors, but its exact formulation remains computationally demanding. Here we introduce a hierarchy of cost-effective approximate TD-dCC ansatzes derived from truncated Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansions, which preserve a single-similarity-transformation structure while retaining the essential correlation diagrams responsible for satellite formation. We further develop a detailed component analysis that isolates hole-mediated excitation pathways, which are correlated processes arising from the coupling between ground-state and ionized-state amplitudes. We use it to interpret quasiparticle and satellite features across the hierarchy. Applications to the single-impurity Anderson model and molecular systems (H2O and CH4) demonstrate that the approximate TD-dCC methods closely and efficiently reproduce exact many-body spectral features and quasiparticle weights. In parallel, we construct a fault-tolerant quantum signal processing algorithm for the core-hole Green's function, providing a scalable quantum route for simulating correlated core-level dynamics. Together, these developments establish complementary classical and quantum methodologies for quantitative, many-body-accurate core spectroscopy.

Abstract: The quantum dynamics of many-qubit systems is an outstanding problem that has recently driven significant advances in both numerical methods and programmable quantum processing units. In this work, we employ a comprehensive toolbox of state-of-the-art numerical approaches to classically simulate the dynamics of the two-dimensional transverse field Ising model. Our methods include three different tensor network techniques -- matrix product states, tree-tensor networks, and two-dimensional tensor-networks under the belief propagation approximation -- as well as time-dependent variational Monte Carlo with Neural Quantum States. We focus on two paradigmatic dynamical protocols: (i) quantum annealing through a critical point and (ii) post-quench dynamics. Our extensive results show the quantitative predictions of various state-of-the-art numerical methods providing a benchmark for future numerical investigations and experimental studies with the aim to push the limitations on classical and QPUs. In particular, our work connects classical simulability to different regimes associated with quantum dynamics in Rydberg arrays - namely, quasi-adiabatic dynamics, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and quantum quenches.

*Atiye Zeynali,Zahra Bakhshi*

TL;DR: DeepQMap, a deep reinforcement learning framework, enhances circuit fidelity and reduces inter-chip operations in multi-chip quantum systems, achieving significant improvements over QUBO methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As quantum computing scales to more chips, managing noise and reducing inter-chip operations becomes critical, meaning efficient and effective frameworks like DeepQMap are needed.

Method: DeepQMap uses a bidirectional LSTM-based DNA network with multi-head attention and Rainbow DQN architecture for dynamic noise adaptation and proactive compensation.

Result: DeepQMap achieved a mean circuit fidelity of 0.920 ± 0.023, which was 49.3% better than QUBO methods, reduced inter-chip communication by 79.8%, coil enhanced scalability up to 100 qubits, and faster convergence.

Conclusion: DeepQMap addresses key challenges in multi-chip quantum systems, making it a crucial advancement for near-term quantum computing applications.

Abstract: The transition from monolithic to distributed multi-chip quantum architectures has fundamentally altered the circuit compilation landscape, introducing challenges in managing temporal noise variations and minimizing expensive inter-chip operations. We present DeepQMap, a deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Dynamic Noise Adaptation (DNA) network with multi-head attention mechanisms and Rainbow DQN architecture. Unlike conventional static optimization approaches such as QUBO formulations, our method continuously adapts to hardware dynamics through learned temporal representations of quantum system behavior. Comprehensive evaluation across 270 benchmark circuits spanning Quantum Fourier Transform, Grover's algorithm, and Variational Quantum Eigensolver demonstrates that DeepQMap achieves mean circuit fidelity of $0.920 \pm 0.023$, representing a statistically significant 49.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art QUBO methods ($0.618 \pm 0.031$, $t_{98} = 4.87$, $p = 0.0023$, Cohen's $d = 2.34$). Inter-chip communication overhead reduces by 79.8\%, decreasing from 2.34 operations per circuit to 0.47. The DNA network maintains noise prediction accuracy with coefficient of determination $R^2 = 0.912$ and mean absolute error of 0.87\%, enabling proactive compensation for hardware fluctuations. Scalability analysis confirms sustained performance across 20-100 qubit systems, with fidelity remaining above 0.87 even at maximum scale where competing methods degrade below 0.60. Training convergence occurs 8.2$\times$ faster than baseline approaches, completing in 45 minutes versus 370 minutes for QUBO optimization. Very large effect sizes validate practical significance for near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The linear and phase insensitive absorption of a single quanta via coherent interactions with a saturable system, even a single ground state qubit, is sufficient to deterministically generate quantum non-Gaussian states in an oscillator, even stimulated merely by increasing thermal oscillator energy. However, the resultant states only approach Fock states and therefore do not exhibit quantum coherence. Here we overcome this limitation using a minimal step: a nonlinear phase-insensitive absorption process added to the linear one. The coherent addition of such individually passive processes allows coherence to emerge and increase in phase space without an external drive and with minimal interaction requirements. The coherence of quantum non-Gaussian states emerges because the linear and nonlinear absorption processes are not mutually passive. In the simplest case rotationally symmetric Wigner functions of the oscillator Fock states convert their many negative regions to an extremely complex asymmetric structure in sharp contrast to the rotational symmetry of those obtained by the individual interactions. We extend this case to include an unsaturable absorber (oscillator) and analyse switching between linear and nonlinear absorptions, suitable for broad classes of experiments.

Abstract: By employing supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we present a general algorithm to construct supersymmetric partner potentials and hence derive exact stationary solutions of the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schrödinger equation (INLSE). This is possible due to the connection between the INLSE and the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE), which can be established from a treatment based on Lie point symmetries and is related with Schrödinger equation, under certain conditions. As an illustrative example, we construct exact solutions for the INLSE through a Pösch-Teller potential with a single bound state.

Abstract: Entropic dynamics (ED) is a framework that allows one to derive quantum theory as a Hamilton-Killing flow on the cotangent bundle of a statistical manifold. These flows are such that they preserve the symplectic and the (information) metric geometries; they explain the linearity of quantum mechanics and the appearance of complex numbers. In this paper the ED framework is extended to deal with local gauge symmetries. More specifically, on the basis of maximum entropy methods and information geometry, for an appropriate choice of ontic variables and constraints, we derive the quantum electrodynamics of radiation fields interacting with charged particles. As a test that despite its unorthodox foundation the ED approach is empirically successful we derive the Maxwell equations.

Abstract: The integer factorization problem (IFP) underpins the security of RSA, yet becomes efficiently solvable on a quantum computer through Shor's algorithm. Regev's recent high-dimensional variant reduces the circuit size through lattice-based post-processing, but introduces substantial space overhead and lacks practical implementations. Here, we propose a qubit reuse method by intermediate-uncomputation that significantly reduces the space complexity of Regev's algorithm, inspired by reversible computing. Our basic strategy lowers the cost from \( O(n^{3/2}) \) to \( O(n^{5/4}) \), and refined strategies achieve \( O(n \log n) \)which is a space lower bound within this model. Simulations demonstrate the resulting time-space trade-offs and resource scaling. Moreover, we construct and compile quantum circuits that factor \( N = 35 \), verifying the effectiveness of our method through noisy simulations. A more simplified experimental circuit for Regev's algorithm is executed on a superconducting quantum computer, with lattice-based post-processing successfully retrieving the factors. These results advance the practical feasibility of Regev-style quantum factoring and provide guidance for future theoretical and experimental developments.

Abstract: The deterministic control of light-matter interactions at the level of single particles and on subwavelength scales is central to quantum optics and hybrid integrated quantum technologies. However, combining cold atom research with nanophotonic devices in a fully controllable platform remains a major experimental challenge. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic coupling of an ultracold atomic lattice to light propagating in suspended on-chip photonic circuits. These capabilities open avenues to address scalability challenges in neutral-atom quantum computers and simulators, enabling fast optical readout, efficient and subwavelength non-diffracting interaction zones, and genuine compatibility with integrated solid-state photon sources, detectors, and stop-band modulators. Beyond controllable quantum matter, the platform also enables in-situ imaging of evanescent fields of light and nanoscale structures, including prospects for three-dimensional scanning microscopy with non-invasive single-atom probes for quantum sensing applications.

Abstract: Characterizing the nonlocal nature of quantum states is a central challenge in the practical application of large-scale quantum computation and simulation. Quantum mutual information (QMI), a fundamental nonlocal measure, plays a key role in quantifying entanglement and has become increasingly important in studying nonequilibrium quantum many-body phenomena, such as many-body localization and thermalization. However, experimental measurement of QMI remains extremely difficult, particularly for nonequilibrium states, which are more complex than ground states. In this Letter, we employ a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to establish a universal mapping between the QMI and local correlations only up to second order for nonequilibrium states generated by quenches in a one-dimensional disordered XXZ model. Our approach provides a practical method for experimentally extracting QMI, readily applicable in platforms such as superconducting qubits. Moreover, this work will establishes a general framework for reconstructing other nonlocal observables, including Fisher information and out-of-time-ordered correlators.

Abstract: Controllable nonlinear quantum interactions are a much sought after target for modern quantum technologies. They are typically difficult and costly to engineer for bespoke purposes. However controllable nonlinearities may have always been in reach via the natural and fundamental forces between quantum particles. The Coulomb interaction between charged particles is the simplest example. We show that after eliminating the harmonic part of the Coulomb force by an auxiliary linear force, the remaining reciprocal nonlinear part results in a directly observable non-reciprocal nonlinear effect: increase of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the coherent displacement of one particle, driven by the position noise, or uncertainty in quantum regime, in another particle. This essential evidence of nonlinear forces is present across large ranges of trap frequency and mass scales, as well as visible in both stochastic and quantum regimes.

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising variational quantum algorithm introduced to tackle classically intractable combinatorial optimization problems. This tutorial offers a comprehensive, first-principles introduction to QAOA and its properties, focusing on its application to Quadratic and Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO and PUBO) problems. The tutorial begins by outlining variational quantum circuits and QUBO problems, focusing on their key properties and the encoding of problem constraints through quadratic penalty terms. Next, it explores the QAOA in detail, covering its Hamiltonian formulation, gate decomposition, and example applications, along with their implementation and performance results. This is followed by an analysis of the algorithm's energy landscape, where proofs are provided for its symmetry and periodicity, and where a resulting parameter space reduction is proposed. Finally, the tutorial extends these concepts to PUBO problems by generalizing the results to higher-order Hamiltonians and discussing the associated symmetries and circuit construction.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate a quantum battery architecture where two identical two-level atoms are charged by a cavity-magnomechanical system, which includes a microwave cavity, a magnon mode hosted in a YIG sphere, and phonon mode due to the deformation of the YIG sphere. The charging process relies on coherent energy exchange, where the atoms couple to the cavity, which in turn, it interacts with the magnon mode via a beam-splitter mechanism. By deriving the system Hamiltonian under the rotating-wave approximation and employing a Lindblad master equation to rigorously model dissipation, we analyze the complete dynamical evolution of the battery. Our study demonstrates that strong, resonant light-matter interactions are crucial for enhancing the key performance metrics: charging efficiency, stored energy, and ergotropy (extractable work). We systematically investigate the deleterious effects of detuning and decoherence, and critically, we uncover a non-trivial interplay between the system's coupling strengths. This reveals optimal operating regimes where constructive interference maximizes performance, while excessive coupling in specific channels can degrade it. Ultimately, our findings provide a quantitative framework for engineering high-efficiency quantum batteries in hybrid magnonic platforms, offering a design roadmap for future experimental realizations.

Abstract: The intriguing physical phenomena associated with exceptional points have established non-Hermitian physics as a frontier of modern research. Recent investigations have extended non-Hermitian physics into the fully quantum domain. However, existing studies predominantly concentrate on discrete-variable quantum systems, while non-Hermitian quantum effects in continuous-variable encoded systems remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the exceptional structure for a driven-dissipative Kerr-cat qubit, realized with a Kerr nonlinear resonator. We find that the dissipation leads to a bidirectional jump between the two basis states of the cat qubit, which is in distinct contrast with the unidirectional jump associated with normal two-level systems. The competition between this jump and a single-photon drive gives arise to the emergence of third-order Liouvillian exceptional points (LEP3s), each corresponds to a crossing point of two lines of LEP2s. We further show that the LEP3 can exhibit the topological character of the Hamiltonian EP3s, which cannot be realized with a single qubit. Our work opens the possibility of realizing non-Hermitian phenomena with continuous-variable quantum systems.

Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to clarify misunderstandings in quantum information theory experiments involving gravitational effects and entanglement.

Method: The paper uses a Hamiltonian formalism and a Newton-Cartan analysis to examine the experimental setup and interpret the results.

Result: The analysis suggests that while gravity cannot independently mediate entanglement, another force must be involved in the experimental setup to produce the observed effect.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the experimental results require additional consideration beyond classical gravity, implying a need for further investigation into the quantum gravitational mechanisms involved.

Abstract: Once again, dispute has arisen over the interpretation of proposed quantum information theory experiments to probe the quantum nature of gravity by testing for gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) between two spatially separated massive particles ([1] vs. [11,12]; further contributions in [7,9]). The confusion appears to reside in interpreting applications of a Hamiltonian formalism. But classical gravity cannot mediate entanglement on independent grounds. A Newton-Cartan analysis shows that if gravity is classical, a mediator, and entanglement is observed as an outcome of performing a GIE experiment, something other than gravity must have supplied the (virtual) force needed during the experiment to produce the effect.

Abstract: A computational model of adiabatic evolutionary quantum system (or AEQS, pronounced "eeh-ks") was introduced in [Yamakami,2022] as a sort of quantum annealing and its underlying input-driven Hamiltonians are generated quantum-algorithmically by various forms of quantum automata families (including 1qqaf's). We study an efficient way to accomplish certain machine learning tasks by training these AEQSs quantumly. When AEQSs are controlled by 1qqaf's, it suffices in essence to find an optimal 1qqaf that approximately solves a target relational problem. For this purpose, we develop a basic idea of approximately utilizing well-known quantum algorithms for quantum counting, quantum amplitude estimation, and quantum approximation. We then provide a rough estimation of the efficiency of our quantum learning algorithms for AEQSs.

Abstract: Fractional calculus has become an essential framework in geophysics, optics, and biological systems to capture long-range correlations and anomalous transport. In this article, we extend fractional calculus to explore a particle in a periodic potential, where the Schrödinger equation is generalized to its fractional form. This framework allows us to study how the Lévy index $q$ governs the formation and inversion of energy bands, offering a pathway to engineer new physical behaviors and device functionalities by tuning $q$ in periodic quantum systems. We solve the fractional Schrödinger equation for periodic rectangular potentials of varying height $V_0$, barrier thickness $L$, and well width $W$ using an imaginary-time evolution algorithm, and supplement the discrete energy dispersion through Gaussian process regression. Our analysis reveals a qualitative shift in the band structure at $q=2$, separating into regimes for $q>2$ and $q<2$. For $q > 2$, energy bands undergo an inverting transformation as symmetric minima emerge within the first Brillouin zone, shifting from $k=0$ toward $k=\pm π/a$ with increasing $q$. These degenerate minima define a Bloch-momentum qubit, suggesting an analog to valley degrees of freedom used in valleytronics. The response of the ground band scales with fractional order as $V_0^{-0.28\pm0.05}L^{-0.34\pm0.08}W^{-0.49\pm0.06}$, indicating tunable sensitivity to geometry. For $q < 2$, the effective mass near $k = 0$ decreases exponentially with $q$, yielding a universal effective mass of $0.15\pm0.01$ as $q \to 1$, demonstrating that the Lévy index serves as a tunable degree of freedom capable of driving band inversion, modulating the band gap, and reshaping carrier dynamics.

Abstract: We explicitly show that the quantum teleportation protocol can be employed to completely reconstruct arbitrary two- and three-qubit density matrices. We also extend the present analysis to n-qubit density matrices. The only quantum resources needed to implement the teleportation-based quantum state tomography protocol are the ability to make Bell measurements and the ability to prepare a few different single qubit states to be teleported from Alice to Bob.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种硬件有意识的最优相位多项式综合算法HOPPS，用于优化包含CNOT和Rz门的量子线路，减少CNOT数量和深度，提升量子电路的 fidelity。该算法在逻辑优化方面表现优于现有工具，但在应用于大型量子线路时存在局限性，此时可采用迭代块优化策略进行改进。


<details>

Motivation: 量子计算中，CNOT和Rz门是量子电路中常用的量子位运算门，特别是在QAOA等量子体系中，这些门的数量和深度往往决定了量子线路的效率和精度。如何减少CNOT数量和深度，提升量子线路的 fidelity是一个重要的研究方向。

Result: 通过实验对比，HOPPS在现有类似工具中表现更优。具体而言，在Small QAOA电路下，HOPPS可以将CNOT数量减少最多50.0%，CNOT深度减少最多57.1%。对于大型QAOA电路，在Qiskit映射后，可以将CNOT数量减少最多44.4%，深度减少最多42.4%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种高效优化量子线路的算法和策略，为量子计算中的CNOT门数量和深度优化提供了新的方法，具有重要的理论意义和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Blocks composed of {CNOT, Rz} are ubiquitous in modern quantum applications, notably in circuits such as QAOA ansatzes and quantum adders. After compilation, many of them exhibit large CNOT counts or depths, which lowers fidelity. Therefore, we introduce HOPPS: a SAT-based hardware-aware optimal phase polynomial synthesis algorithm that could generate {CNOT, Rz} blocks with CNOT count or depth optimality.
  Sometime {CNOT, Rz} blocks are large, such as in QAOA ansatzes, HOPPS's pursuit of optimality limits its scalability. To address this issue, we introduce an iterative blockwise optimization strategy: large circuits are partitioned into smaller blocks, each block is optimally refined, and the process is repeated for several iterations.
  Empirical results show that HOPPS is more efficient comparing with existing near optimal synthesis tools. Used as a peephole optimizer, HOPPS reduces the CNOT count by up to 50.0% and the CNOT depth by up to 57.1% under OLSQ. For large QAOA circuit, after mapping by Qiskit, circuit can be reduced CNOT count and depth by up to 44.4% and 42.4% by our iterative blockwise optimization.

TL;DR: A unified formalism is presented for analyzing the whole processing chain in entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocols, focusing on the interplay between entanglement quality, quantity, and secure key rate.

Motivation: The work introduces a cohesive framework for assessing and enhancing secure key rates in quantum key distribution by integrating quantum preprocessing, measurement strategies, and classical postprocessing, employing the secret key capacity concept.

Method: The authors analyze the processing chain, conducted on Werner states, to determine optimal measurement bases and establish a comparison with existing literature. They also evaluate the impact of entanglement distillation on key rates.

Result: The research identifies the suitable measurement bases for achieving the secret key capacity with Werner states, proposes a novel processing strategy, and determines optimal entanglement distillation levels.

Conclusion: By providing a comprehensive model for the entire processing chain, the authors offer a systematic approach to evaluate and optimize secure key generation in entanglement-based quantum key distribution.

Abstract: The following paper presents a holistic approach to the processing of entangled links within entanglement based quantum key distribution protocols, whose security relies on the Bell inequality. We investigate the interactions, and the collective impact, of the whole processing chain on the final secure key rate. This includes the quantum mechanical preprocessing in the form of entanglement distillation, processing of the entangled states via measurements and the necessary classical postprocessing based on the measurement results. Our investigations are based on the principle idea of the Eckert 1991 protocol and utilize the secret key capacity introduced by Devetak and Winter in 2005. Our results include a proof on what measurement bases need to be chosen to achieve this capacity for the case of Werner states. It also presents a new processing strategy and compares it with the most common one that can be found within the literature. Furthermore, it answers the question on how much entanglement distillation is optimal. By doing so we propose a unified formalism, describing the whole processing chain, that can be used to make quantitative statements on the relation between the quality and quantity of entangled but noisy quantum states used for generating secure keys.

Abstract: Quantum walks represent an excellent testbed for investigating the interplay between unitary coherent and incoherent dissipative processes. Thanks to photonic quantum interferometers of considerable size, experimental studies could be performed, devoted to investigating the consequences of different sorts of realistic noise in these systems. In this work we employ a 20x20 on-chip multimode interferometer to introduce another key aspect in the problem: the presence of edges in the walker lattice, enforcing a confined evolution. We show how noise can disrupt translational symmetry and reshape interference patterns. The non trivial probability distributions obtained along the temporal evolution of the system demonstrate how speed up effects, localization and coherent oscillations are pillar concepts to be fully characterized and understood when applied in realistic quantum dynamics.

Abstract: In finance, predictive models must balance accuracy and interpretability, particularly in credit risk assessment, where model decisions carry material consequences. We present a quantum neural network (QNN) based on a single qudit, in which both data features and trainable parameters are co-encoded within a unified unitary evolution generated by the full Lie algebra. This design explores the entire Hilbert space while enabling interpretability through the magnitudes of the learned coefficients. We benchmark our model on a real-world, imbalanced credit-risk dataset from Taiwan. The proposed QNN consistently outperforms LR and reaches the results of random forest models in macro-F1 score while preserving a transparent correspondence between learned parameters and input feature importance. To quantify the interpretability of the proposed model, we introduce two complementary metrics: (i) the edit distance between the model's feature ranking and that of LR, and (ii) a feature-poisoning test where selected features are replaced with noise. Results indicate that the proposed quantum model achieves competitive performance while offering a tractable path toward interpretable quantum learning.

Abstract: The interplay between external gauge fields and lattice geometry can induce extreme localization dynamics through complete destructive interference. We show that combining this flux-induced localization with engineered dissipation leads to robust spin synchronization in rotationally symmetric spin geometries, referred to as Aharonov-Bohm motifs, with cyclic symmetries of any order. The synchronized dynamics is independent of initial conditions and features entanglement among spins within each motif. We further demonstrate that multiple motifs can fully synchronize when coupled, which is achieved by applying additional collective dissipation acting on all intra-motif spins. These results reveal a direct connection between flux-induced localization, dissipative engineering, and collective quantum synchronization.

Motivation: The analysis explores the integration of DNP sequences with periodic irradiation schemes, prompted by advancements in NMR spectroscopy, aiming to achieve superior performance in solid-state NMR applications.

Method: The method leverages optimal control theory and effective Hamiltonian theory to design the LOOP pulse sequences, which optimize longitudinal polarization transfer and address excitation pulse challenges.

Result: The LOOP sequences achieve effective single-spin rotations with high bandwidth (over 100 MHz) and reduced microwave field inhomogeneity at low field (0.35 T), outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: The LOOP sequences represent a significant advancement in DNP technique for high-field NMR spectroscopy, offering effective performance with moderate microwave field amplitudes.

Abstract: Taking inspiration from NMR spectroscopy, periodic irradiation schemes have recently shown remarkable performance when implemented into pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) sequences. This has prompted considerable interest in development of broadband pulsed DNP sequences utilizing such schemes. On this background, most efforts have focused on solid-state NMR like transverse spin-locked pulse sequences whose performance in DNP applications may be compromised by the broadband capabilities of the initial excitation pulse. Leveraging the flexibility and robustness of optimal control theory combined with underlying insights from effective Hamiltonian theory, we present a new family of broadband DNP pulse sequences, termed LOOP (Longitudinally Optimized with Overarching Periodicity), that alleviates the excitation-pulse challenge by accomplishing longitudinal polarization transfer. These sequences define robust single-spin effective $z$ rotations, with impressive compensation towards microwave field inhomogeneity, and are capable of delivering DNP transfer with bandwidths exceeding 100 MHz, while employing a peak microwave field amplitude of only 32 MHz, at an external magnetic field of 0.35 T.

Result: The proposed method successfully demonstrates improved performance on image datasets compared to manually designed autoencoders.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for automated quantum architecture design using genetic algorithms, enhancing the applicability of quantum machine learning in noisy near-term quantum environments.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning and deep learning have driven advances in domains such as image classification, speech recognition, and anomaly detection by leveraging multi-layer neural networks to model complex data. Simultaneously, quantum computing (QC) promises to address classically intractable problems via quantum parallelism, motivating research in quantum machine learning (QML). Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing high-dimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters.
  This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era. Our approach lays a foundation for broader application of genetic algorithms to quantum architecture search, aiming for a robust, automated method that can adapt to varied data and hardware constraints.

Conclusion: 发现双局域理论的ontological模型能够解释其行为，揭示了某些关键限制和条件。

Abstract: We construct an ontological model for the theory known as bilocal classical theory doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.102.052216. To our knowledge, this is only the second time that an ontological model has been constructed for an entire theory, rather than just for some particular scenarios within a theory. This result refutes a conjecture from doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.102.052216 which suggested that there might be no local-realist ontological model for bilocal classical theory. Moreover, it is the first time that an ontological model has been constructed for a theory that fails to be locally tomographic, showing that the assumption of local tomography underpinning the structure theorem in doi.org/10.22331/q-2024-03-14-1283 is a genuine limitation of the theorem. This demonstrates that in general there is no tension between failures of local tomography and classical explainability (i.e., generalised noncontextuality). In fact, bilocal classical theory is in many ways more simply understood via the underlying ontological model than it is within its original formulation (much as how odd-dimensional stabiliser subtheories can be more simply understood via Spekkens' toy theory). Furthermore, this result naturally leads to the question, does every locally-classical theory admit of an ontological model? By constructing a concrete counterexample, we show that this is not the case. Our findings demonstrate that there is no straightforward relationship between theories being locally-classical, and them being classically-explainable. This shows that the fundamental status of compositional properties (such as local tomography) is not a technical side-issue, but a central and unavoidable question for a coherent understanding even of classicality itself.

*Sreejith Sreekumar,Ziv Goldfeld,Mark M. Wilde*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper establishes non-asymptotic error bounds and concentration properties for quantum neural estimators (QNEs) used to estimate measured (Rényi) relative entropies. It provides minimax optimal copy complexity for estimating such entropies when the density operators are bounded in the Thompson metric. For permutation-invariant operators, the dependence on the dimension is slightly improved. The results aim to guide the principled implementation of QNEs for practical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum entropy estimation is pivotal in quantum physics, information theory, and machine learning. The development of QNEs that combine classical and quantum resources offers a promising approach, though their practical performance hinges on hyperparameter tuning. This paper addresses this challenge by providing theoretical guarantees on the accuracy and concentration properties of QNEs, which is essential for their reliable deployment in real-world applications.

Method: The authors analyze QNEs in the context of estimating measured relative entropies. They derive non-asymptotic error bounds and establish exponential tail bounds, demonstrating concentration about the ground truth. The analysis involves bounding the expected error and demonstrating sub-Gaussian behavior. The authors also derive copy complexity bounds, which depend on the size of the parameter set and the desired accuracy, with different scaling for permutation-invariant operators.

Result: The key results include explicit error bounds for QNEs in estimating measured relative entropies, showing that the error is sub-Gaussian and sharply concentrated. The copy complexity is found to be optimal in terms of accuracy and dimensionality for general operators. For permutation-invariant operators, this complexity improves slightly with a better dependence on the dimension.

Conclusion: This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for QNEs, enabling practical insights into their hyperparameter tuning. The derived bounds and complexity results offer guidelines for implementing QNEs effectively, which is crucial for advancing quantum machine learning and quantum information processing applications.

Abstract: Estimating quantum entropies and divergences is an important problem in quantum physics, information theory, and machine learning. Quantum neural estimators (QNEs), which utilize a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, have recently emerged as an appealing computational framework for estimating these measures. Such estimators combine classical neural networks with parametrized quantum circuits, and their deployment typically entails tedious tuning of hyperparameters controlling the sample size, network architecture, and circuit topology. This work initiates the study of formal guarantees for QNEs of measured (Rényi) relative entropies in the form of non-asymptotic error risk bounds. We further establish exponential tail bounds showing that the error is sub-Gaussian, and thus sharply concentrates about the ground truth value. For an appropriate sub-class of density operator pairs on a space of dimension $d$ with bounded Thompson metric, our theory establishes a copy complexity of $O(|Θ(\mathcal{U})|d/ε^2)$ for QNE with a quantum circuit parameter set $Θ(\mathcal{U})$, which has minimax optimal dependence on the accuracy $ε$. Additionally, if the density operator pairs are permutation invariant, we improve the dimension dependence above to $O(|Θ(\mathcal{U})|\mathrm{polylog}(d)/ε^2)$. Our theory aims to facilitate principled implementation of QNEs for measured relative entropies and guide hyperparameter tuning in practice.

Abstract: This paper examines a quantitative and optimal lower bound on the detector efficiency in a (2,2,2) Bell experiment within a fully device-independent framework, whereby the detectors used in the experiment are uncharacterized. We provide a tight lower bound on the minimum efficiency required to observe a desired Bell-CHSH violation using the Navascués-Pironio-Acín (NPA) hierarchy, confirming tightness up to four decimal places with numerical optimization over explicit quantum realizations. We then introduce the effect of dark counts and demonstrate how to quantify the minimum required efficiency to observe a desired CHSH violation with an increasing dark count error. Finally, to obtain an analytical closed-form expression of the minimum efficiency, we consider the set of no-signaling behaviors that satisfy the Tsirelson bound, which are easier to characterize than the quantum set. Using such behaviors, we find a simple closed-form expression for a lower bound on the minimum efficiency which is monotonically increasing with the CHSH violation, though the analytically obtained lower bounds are meaningfully below the numerically tight lower bound.

Abstract: The Stuart-Landau oscillator generalized to $D > 2$ dimensions has SO($D$) rotational symmetry. We study the collective dynamics of a system of $K$ such oscillators of dimensions $D =$ 3 and 4, with coupling chosen to either preserve or break rotational symmetry. This leads to emergent dynamical phenomena that do not have analogs in the well-studied case of $D=2$. Further, the larger number of internal parameters allows for the exploration of different forms of heterogeneity among the individual oscillators. When rotational symmetry is preserved there can be various forms of synchronization as well as multistability and $partial$ amplitude death, namely, the quenching of oscillations within a subset of variables that asymptote to the same constant value. The oscillatory dynamics in these cases are characterized by phase-locking and phase-drift. When the coupling breaks rotational symmetry we observe $partial$ synchronization (when a subset of the variables coincide and oscillate) and $partial$ oscillation death (when a subset of variables asymptote to different stationary values), as well as the coexistence of these different partial quenching phenomena.

### [104] [Strong Energy Dependent Transition Radiation in a Photonic Crystal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18863)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding particle radiation through photonic crystals for potential applications in particle detection.

Method: Analysis of optical region radiation, investigation of disordered and periodic stacks, mathematical derivation for specific angles.

Result: Exact solutions for backward and forward Brewster angles, strong N² dependence, energy dependence E⁴, saturation at high energies, and photonic crystal behavior analogous to graphene's Dirac cones.

Conclusion: The findings suggest a special 1D photonic crystal capable of detecting relativistic particles via radiation at Brewster's angle.

Abstract: Radiation of a charged particle crossing an alternating stack of slabs in the optical region is considered. Both disordered and periodic stacks are investigated. It is shown that for special type of alternating disordered and periodic stacks the radiation problem can be solved exactly for backward and forward Brewster observation angles. Strong $N^2$ dependence of radiation intensity on slab number is re-established in special case of the disordered stack. This leads to strong directivity either on forward or on backward Brewster angles depending on the type of stack randomness. In certain type of periodic photonic crystal, a strong energy dependence $E^4$ for relativistic particles of the radiation intensity, observed at Brewster's angle is found. Further increment of particle energy leads to saturation. The band structure of the corresponding photonic crystal (PhC) has a behavior, analogous to the Dirac cones in graphene. We suggest this special type $1D$ photonic crystal for application as a detector of relativistic particles.

Abstract: We present a detailed derivation of the quantum and quantum-thermal effective action for non-relativistic systems, starting from the single particle case and extending to the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) field theory for weakly interacting bosons. In the single-particle framework, we introduce the one-particle irreducible 1PI effective action formalism taking explicitly into account the choice of the initial quantum state, its saddle-point plus Gaussian fluctuation approximation, and its finite temperature extension via Matsubara summation. This yields a clear physical interpretation in terms of zero-point and thermal contributions to the Helmholtz free energy. The formalism is then applied to the GP action producing the 1PI effective potential at zero and finite temperature including beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang and thermal corrections. We discuss the gapless and gapped Bogoliubov spectra, their relevance to equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes, and the role of regularization. Applications include the inclusion of an external potential within the local density approximation, the derivation of finite-temperature Josephson equations, and the extension to D dimensional systems. This unified approach provides a transparent connection between microscopic quantum fluctuations and effective macroscopic equations of motion for Bose-Einstein condensates.

Abstract: The Josephson diode, a non-reciprocal quantum element analogous to the familiar semiconductor p-n junction diode, has been realized in solid-state systems but remains unexplored in tunable atomtronic circuits. In this work, we propose and numerically demonstrate the realization of the Josephson diode effect in an atomtronic circuit consisting of a ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate and with optical barriers serving as Josephson junctions. Our implementation of this macroscopic non-reciprocal quantum phenomenon is based on realizing the required inversion symmetry breaking through asymmetric barrier placement and an asymmetric alternating current (AC) drive, enabling position- and drive-tunable diode effects with efficiencies up to 15% and 91%, respectively. While standard time-of-flight absorption imaging can readily observe these effects, we employ cavity optomechanics for in situ, real-time, and non-destructive measurements of the relevant condensate dynamics. Our results establish a highly tunable platform for nonreciprocal Josephson transport, opening avenues for diode-based neutral-atom technologies in future quantum circuits.

Abstract: Locally probing pairing in fermionic superfluids, ranging from micro- to macroscopic scales, has been a long-standing challenge. Here, we investigate a new approach that uses Rydberg impurities as a spectroscopic sensor of the surrounding strongly correlated state of ultracold paired fermions. The extended wavefunction of the Rydberg electron induces a finite-range potential that can bind atoms from the BCS medium, forming molecular states. As a consequence, the optical absorption spectrum of the impurity encodes key many-body properties. Using the functional determinant approach, we provide a direct measure of the superfluid gap through frequency shifts of dimer and trimer peaks. The spectra also reveal whether the Cooper pairs are broken or trapped intact. For static Rydberg atoms, we relate this signature of pairing to the suppression of the orthogonality catastrophe due to the superconducting gap resulting in the formation of well-defined polaron quasiparticles. Our work establishes Rydberg atom spectroscopy as a powerful local probe of strongly correlated matter.

TL;DR: This paper discusses how gravitational waves from cosmic inflation could explain the signals detected by the NANOGrav observatory trying to observe the early universe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between cosmic inflation theory and gravitational wave detection, providing a pathway to understand the early universe's physics.

Method: The paper reviews existing theories on inflationary cosmology, discusses the properties of gravitational waves produced during inflation, and links these to the observational data collected by NANOGrav.

Result: The paper establishes a connection between the expected gravitational-wave signals and the observational targets of NANOGrav, reinforcing the hypothesis that inflationary gravitational waves are a valid tool for studying the early universe.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper successfully links the concepts of cosmic inflation with gravitational waveform models, contributing to the ongoing effort to detect primordial gravitational waves.

Abstract: For millennia, humanity has relied exclusively on light$\unicode{x2014}$initially visible light and, later, broader and broader portions of the electromagnetic spectrum$\unicode{x2014}$to observe the universe. In the past decade, a remarkable chapter in extending astronomy beyond electromagnetic antennas has been concretized: the dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy has opened a new observational window into the cosmos. Among the many new astronomical sources we may now look for and study through their gravitational-wave signals, the Big Bang is surely among the most fascinating. Gravitational waves give us concrete hope of directly observing the primordial universe, whose light, emitted more than 13.7 billion years ago, is blocked from reaching our telescopes. This dissertation is aimed at the study of gravitational waves from cosmic inflation, the main scientific paradigm for the very early universe. Therefore, the text is divided into chapters on gravitational waves, inflationary cosmology, and inflationary gravitational waves. More specifically, our discussion will be steered by the endeavor to explain how the gravitational-wave signal sought by the NANOGrav observatory could have originated in the primordial universe.

Method: 利用 Lanczos 算法构造 Krylov 基底，计算状态和操作符复杂性及其熵。

Result: 在波函数集中时，WDW 和 LQC 中的状态和操作符复杂性均呈二次增长；操作符复杂性是状态复杂的两倍。在 bounce 点，LQC 中的复杂性及熵保持有限，而 WDW 中两者发散。

Conclusion: 该研究为计算复杂性在更复杂模型中的应用铺平了道路，提示 LQC 在 bounce 处的稳定性。

Abstract: We explore Krylov complexity for two exactly solvable models, one in the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) quantum cosmology and another in loop quantum cosmology (LQC), for a spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic universe sourced with a massless scalar field, which serves the role of clock. While the WDW quantization of this model cannot avoid the big bang/big crunch singularity, it is replaced by a big bounce in LQC. We construct the Krylov basis analytically by applying the Lanczos algorithm and evaluate both the Krylov state and operator complexity. In regimes where the wave function of the universe is sharply peaked, our results indicate that the Krylov complexity grows quadratically with the scalar field clock for the state and operator complexities in both the WDW quantum cosmology and LQC. We further show that operator complexity is exactly twice the state complexity in these regimes. We discuss the interpretation of the global behavior of these systems by calculating the Krylov entropy for both quantum cosmological frameworks. We observe that in LQC, the Krylov complexity and entropy remain finite at the bounce, whereas in the WDW quantum cosmology, they diverge at the big bang/crunch singularity. Our work paves the way for computing Krylov complexity in more intricate quantum cosmological models, including those exhibiting phenomena such as quantum chaos.

Conclusion: 提出的方法为引力波背景的研究提供了一种新的工具，但也需要进一步优化和验证其在不同频段的应用。

Abstract: The first all-sky-all-frequency (ASAF) radiometer search was conducted using data from the first three observing runs of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The significance of this search lies in its fast and unmodeled approach, leveraging a cross-correlation technique to identify common signals across the detector network. As a result, this method serves as an excellent alternative to search for unknown or poorly modeled continuous wave sources and narrowband components of the gravitational wave (GW) background. For continuous wave sources whose waveform can be modeled, this method can serve as the first stage of a hierarchical scheme by identifying sub-threshold candidates to be followed up with more optimal but computationally expensive searches. The ASAF search, however, presently suffers from beam smearing, where multiple candidates may arise due to the same noise fluctuations, detector artifact, or a GW source. This can reduce the detection probability in follow-up analyzes, especially with limited computing resources. To mitigate this issue and reduce the number of correlated and unnecessary candidates, we introduce a novel Peak Finder algorithm. This algorithm helps identifying the most representative candidates while preserving detection sensitivity, thereby allowing follow up of a much larger number of independent candidates. The reduction in correlated samples leads to a significant reduction in False Dismissal Rate (FDR) using the Peak Finder method compared to the Full-sky method. For instance, following up 2 Peak Finder candidates at 30 Hz reduces FDR by a factor of 3.

Motivation: The paper proposes a novel approach to address the cosmological constant problem by incorporating μ-deformation into Einstein's equations.

Method: Uses μ-deformed thermodynamic functions of a Bose gas model and applies Verlinde's adapted approach.

Result: Demonstrates that varying the deformation parameter μ allows reducing the effective cosmological constant to realistic values, potentially explaining dark matter effects.

Conclusion: Paves a new pathway toward solving the cosmological constant puzzle and interpreting dark matter through μ-deformation.

Abstract: In this paper, we derive the $μ$-deformed Einstein field equations from the generalized thermodynamic functions of the $μ$-deformed analog of Bose gas model, applying the (adapted) Verlinde's approach. The basic role of deformation parameter is shown: it provides the possibility to vary the value of the cosmological constant. Due to this, we suggest an interesting treatment of the cosmological constant (CC) problem within the framework of $μ$-deformation. Namely, viewing the derived $μ$-deformed CC as an effective one and varying the parameter $μ$ appropriately, we gain the possibility to drastically reduce the CC, so as to get for it the realistic value. Also, the relation with dark matter is discussed.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: We propose a new sensing technique called PMPMWFS to address the arm-axis signal dominance issue in WFS. This technique decouples the angular fluctuation signals of the Power Recycling Cavity (PRC) and incident beam from the arm cavity, enabling better alignment sensing and control in future gravitational-wave detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate alignment is crucial for the stability of Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave (GW) detectors. Conventional WFS suffers from arm-axis signal dominance, limiting detection of other optical axes.

Method: Proposed the PMPMWFS technique, which demodulates the beat signal at the difference frequency between two anti-resonant PM sidebands.

Result: PMPMWFS effectively decouples the angular fluctuation signals of PRC and incident beam from the arm cavity. Furthermore, feedback control using PMPMWFS achieves stable interferometer locking for over one hour.

Conclusion: PMPMWFS provides an effective sensing method for decoupling multiple alignment degrees of freedom in future GW detectors.

Abstract: Precise alignment sensing and control are essential for maintaining the stability of laser interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. Conventional Wave Front Sensing technique (WFS), which relies on the beat between the carrier and phase-modulated (PM) sidebands, is dominated by arm-axis signals when the carrier resonates in the full interferometer. This dominance limits the detection of other optical axes, such as the Power Recycling Cavity (PRC) and incident beam axes. To address this problem, we propose a novel sensing technique, "Phase-Modulated-sideband $\times$ Phase-Modulated-sideband Wave Front Sensing" (PMPMWFS), which demodulates the beat signal at the difference frequency between two anti-resonant PM sidebands. We derived the theoretical response of PMPMWFS and experimentally demonstrated it using the Power-Recycled X-arm (PRXARM) configuration of KAGRA. The results show that PMPMWFS effectively decouples angular fluctuation signals of the PRC and incident beam from those of the arm cavity and provides orthogonal signal components for the end mirror of the arm cavity. Furthermore, feedback control using PMPMWFS achieved stable interferometer locking for over one hour. These results demonstrate that PMPMWFS offers an effective sensing method for decoupling multiple alignment degrees of freedom in future gravitational-wave detectors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating alternative theories of dark energy's effect on stellar structures.

Method: Applied the Durgapal-Fuloria (DP) metric and quintessence model to construct the star's structure.

Result: Succeeded in creating a model that meets physical constraints like TOV, energy conditions, compactness, and surface redshift.

Conclusion: The model provides insights into quintessence's role in compact stars and suggests future applications of the DP metric.

Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the Universe can be suitably attributed to the existence of the dark energy (DE). On the backdrop of this concept, this paper introduces a novel, anisotropic compact star model whose stability and structure are governed by the presence of quintessence field, defined by the parameter $ w_{Q} (-1<w_{Q}<-\frac{1}{3}) $ and which admits conformal symmetry. The construction of the model relied on the Durgapal-Fuloria (DP) metric formulation. The model successfully meets all the necessary physical constraints viz., TOV equation, energy conditions, compactness factor, surface redshift and casuality condition. The results are analyzed through analytical methods as well as through the graphical visualization for the various physical attributes.

Conclusion: 提出的$f(R, L_m)$模型在动态上与ΛCDM一致，且与观测数据吻合，是一个有潜力的替代模型。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the late-time cosmic dynamics in the framework of non-linear $f(R, L_m)$ gravity, adopting the functional form $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+L_m^2$. To explore the dark energy behavior, we assume an oscillatory parametric equation of state, $ω(z) = ω_0 + b \sin[\log(1+z)]$, which allows smooth deviations from the cosmological constant. Using a joint MCMC analysis with the latest Hubble 31 chronometer data, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and Type Ia supernova samples (Pantheon+, DES-SN5Y and Union 3), we obtain well-constrained parameters around $H_0 \simeq 67.2~\text{km s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $ω_0\approx-0.5$, consistent with Planck 2018 and other current observations. The model exhibits a clear transition from deceleration to acceleration with $z_{\rm tr} \sim 0.7$--$0.8$, satisfies the NEC and DEC while violating the SEC and yields present EoS values close to $-1$, reproducing $Λ$CDM behavior at late times. The derived Universe ages ($t_0 \approx 13.3~\text{Gyr}$) agree well with CMB and stellar constraints, confirming that the proposed oscillatory $f(R, L_m)$ model provides an observationally consistent and dynamically viable alternative to $Λ$CDM cosmology.

Abstract: We investigate strong gravitational lensing by a charged loop quantum gravity (LQG) black hole obtained through the polymerisation scheme of Borges \textit{et al.} \cite{Borges:2023fog}. These effective geometries replace the Reissner--Nordström singularity with a symmetric transition surface and admit an extremal, cold remnant determined by the minimal area gap in LQG. In turn, we derive the null geodesic equations, investigate the photon effective potential, and obtain expressions for the photon-sphere radius and critical impact parameter. We compute the weak-field deflection angle and Einstein ring size, highlighting the deviations induced by the polymerisation parameter and the Barbero--Immirzi parameter. In the strong-field regime, we compute the strong deflection coefficients $(\bar{a},\bar{b})$ and evaluate the lensing observables $θ_\infty$, $s$, and $r_{\rm mag}$. Unlike the Reissner--Nordström case, the LQG corrections enhance the deflection angle and increase the angular separation of relativistic images, with deviations growing as the geometry approaches the LQG remnant limit. We further compute the corresponding observables for Sgr~A* and M87*, finding that the quantum-gravity modifications lie within the potential sensitivity of next-generation VLBI facilities. For M87*, the angular separation $s\in(0.05712,0.19123)\,μ\text{as}$, while it is $s\in(0.07595,0.25426)\,μ\text{as}$ for Sgr A*. The relative flux ratio is found to lie in the range, $r_{\rm mag}\in(4.49272,5.96397)$. Our analysis demonstrates that LQG-induced corrections leave characteristic strong and weak-lensing imprints, offering a promising observational pathway to probe quantum gravity using near-future high-resolution observations.

Abstract: In this work we examine the internal structure of compact stars within an extended gravitational framework described by the function $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{T})$. Throughout this work, the quantity $\mathcal{R}$ refers to the curvature scalar formed from the Ricci tensor. The term $\mathcal{G}$ denotes the Gauss--Bonnet curvature invariant, while $\mathcal{T}$ corresponds to the trace obtained by contracting the matter energy-momentum tensor. Our analysis is directed toward massive radio pulsars with masses above $1.8\,M_{\odot}$, which provide an exceptional testing ground for gravity under conditions inaccessible to laboratory experiments. Adopting the linear form $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{T})=\mathcal{R}+α\,\mathcal{G}+β\,\mathcal{T}$ where $α$ and $β$ are parameters of suitable dimensionality,\footnote{$α$ has dimensions of $[L^{2}]$ and $β$ carries units of $[N^{-1}]$.} we obtain an exact analytic solution for static anisotropic stellar matter in hydrostatic equilibrium. This solution allows all physical quantities to be expressed in terms of the dimensionless parameters $ α_{1}=α/R^{2},\qquad β_{1}=β/κ^{2}$ together with the compactness $C=2GM/(Rc^{2})$. We constraint the two parameters $α$ and $β$ by matching the model with the mass and radius of pulsar \textit{U1724} requires restricting these parameters to $α_{1}=\pm0.023$ and $β_{1}=\pm0.001$, where $κ^{2}=8πG/c^{4}$ is the standard Einstein coupling. The resulting stellar configuration satisfies the causal bound on the radial sound speed, $c_{s}^{2}<c^{2}/3$, distinguishing it from the corresponding behaviour in general relativity.

Abstract: We investigate the universal behavior of black hole scalarization induced by a charged scalar field in the extended phase space of the asymptotic AdS spacetime with three distinct horizon topologies. The results indicate that in all the three cases, the charged black hole spacetime undergoes scalarization at low temperatures. Notably, the spherical topology is unique in that its domain of scalarization theoretically extends to much higher temperatures under low pressure in the extended phase space. Moreover, the scalarization process in the spherical case exhibits complex phase transition behaviors without additional non-linear terms, which are similar to those in the planar and hyperbolic topologies with the assistance of non-linear terms. With increasing pressure in the extended phase space, the condensate of the scalarization in all three cases undergoes a transition from the first-order style to a cave-of-wind style.

Abstract: We propose a natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) with repulsive behavior, within a ''Swiss Cheese'' cosmological framework. Considering regular black hole spacetimes such as Hayward, Bardeen, and Dymnikova-as well as the singular Schwarzschild-de Sitter case-we consistently find a robust PBH-driven cosmic acceleration phase. This phase ends either at an energy scale set by the PBH parameters or through black hole evaporation. Notably, one finds that ultra-light PBHs with $m < 5 \times 10^8 \, {\rm g}$ can trigger exponential inflation with graceful exit and reheating. Additionally, PBHs with $m \sim 10^{12} \, {\rm g}$ and abundances $0.107 < Ω_{\rm PBH}^{\rm eq} < 0.5$ near matter-radiation equality can act as an early dark energy component, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose and analyze an autocatalytic mechanism in which bursts of Hawking radiation from evaporating micro-primordial black holes (PBHs) trigger the collapse of near-critical plasma overdensities. In a primordial plasma seeded with such patches, this feedback self organizes into a traveling ignition front that successively forms new PBHs and then self-quenches as the Universe expands. A minimal reaction-diffusion model yields conservative criteria for ignition and freeze-out and predicts a stochastic gravitational-wave background with a sharp causal low-frequency edge set by the freeze-out correlation length and largely insensitive to Planck-scale PBH endpoint microphysics. The resulting sub-Hz-to-audio band and amplitudes satisfy cosmological energy-injection bounds, providing a clean, testable target for forthcoming gravitational-wave observatories.

Result: Lentz的声称错误，存在负能量密度区域，修正后的几何同样违反弱能量条件。

Conclusion: 推翻Lentz的声称，确认 warp 驱动违反 WEC，加强了对 warp 驱动可能性的限制。

Abstract: Warp drive spacetimes capable of superluminal transportation, were first introduced in 1994 by Miguel Alcubierre and then generalized by others. These spacetimes violated the Weak Energy Condition (WEC). Lentz proposed a new type of warp drive in 2020. It was claimed that this warp spacetime has non-negative energy density and can therefore be sourced by a classical plasma. We demonstrate that Lentz's claim is incorrect. We begin with a direct calculation of the energy-momentum tensor of Lentz's warp drive in a Eulerian reference frame, and show that there are spacetime regions where the energy density is negative. We then examine the theoretical basis of Lentz's investigation and identify several derivation errors. The derivation errors can be somewhat ameliorated with a modified version of Lentz's geometry, which more closely respects the equalities and inequalities discussed by Lentz. Even so, we show that the modified geometry still violates the WEC even in the Eulerian reference frame. We conclude with a brief discussion of no-go theorems and their relationship to geometries of the kind proposed by Lentz.

Conclusion: 该研究为未来使用LISA探测器研究大矢量场的性质提供了理论和技术支持，为理解宇宙中可能存在的Proca粒子提供了新的途径。

Abstract: We study the influence of a massive vector (Proca) field on the energy fluxes from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) around a slowly rotating Kerr black hole. The secondary compact object, carrying a Proca hair, emits additional dipolar radiation that alters total energy flux relative to general relativity (GR). These modifications induce a secular drift in the orbital evolution of circular geodesic orbits, leading to measurable dephasing in the resulting EMRIs waveforms. By evaluating waveform mismatches between the Einstein-Proca framework and its GR counterpart, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish the signatures of a light Proca field when black hole rotation is included. Furthermore, using a Fisher information matrix analysis, we forecast LISA's capability to place stringent constraints on the Proca mass with EMRIs signal from slowly rotating Kerr black holes. For representative EMRIs configurations, we find that LISA can detect or constrain Proca masses down to $μ_v\sim 10^{-20}$eV, with typical fractional uncertainties at the level of tens percent, depending on the black-hole spin.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study null geodesics that connect the two asymptotically flat regions of the maximally extended Kerr spacetime. These vortical geodesics traverse both horizons and pass through the ring singularity, linking the positive-$r$ exterior to the negative-$r$ asymptotic side. Using impact parameters, we identify a closed subset of parameter space, the inner throat, where the radial potential has no real roots, and photons exhibit no radial turning points. In this region, at most two constant-latitude geodesics exist, one of which is aligned with the principal null direction. We also identify the forbidden polar-angle band that limits the range of geodesics reaching an asymptotic observer. We solve the geodesic equations analytically and numerically in Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinates, obtaining mutually consistent results that correct and extend previously available formulae. The resulting trajectories are used to construct simulated views for an observer in the negative-$r$ domain, revealing strong image distortion and inversion, with possible implications for analogous white-hole configurations.

TL;DR: A two-field cosmological model with hyperbolic field space in a closed universe is explored, where scalar field kinetic energy is suppressed, allowing spatial curvature to dominate and trigger a non-singular bounce. The model satisfies the Null Energy Condition and predicts detectable CMB signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring cosmological models that explain the early universe dynamics, particularly the origin of the universe, is motivated by the need to understand the universe's evolution and potential singularities.

Method: The study uses a two-field cosmological model in a closed universe with hyperbolic field space. The method involves deriving analytic solutions for the bounce, verifying them numerically, and computing observable predictions.

Result: The model predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio r ≈ 0.003–0.005 and local non-Gaussianity f_{m NL} ≈ O(1), placing it within reach of next-generation CMB experiments like LiteBIRD and CMB-S4. The model is ghost-free by construction.

Conclusion: This study provides a new bouncing cosmology model that avoids exotic physics and is supported by analytic and numerical results. The model's predictions align with observable CMB experiments and offers a promising explanation for the early universe dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate a two-field cosmological model in a closed ($k=+1$) universe where the field space is endowed with a hyperbolic geometry. We demonstrate that the curvature of the field space introduces a kinetic coupling that exponentially suppresses the scalar field kinetic energy as the fields explore certain regions, allowing the spatial curvature to dominate and trigger a non-singular bounce. Crucially, the model satisfies the Null Energy Condition (NEC) throughout, with the bounce driven entirely by the positive spatial curvature -- not by exotic physics. We derive analytic solutions for the bounce, verify them numerically, and compute observable predictions. The model predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \approx 0.003$--$0.005$ and local non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm NL} \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$, placing it within reach of next-generation CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD and CMB-S4.

Abstract: We explore a novel cosmological model based on coupled fields in the framework of scalar tensor theories, considering the specific interplay between gravity and scalar fields. The model further extends a recent axion-dilaton system by introducing viable couplings with the space--time geometry encoded into the scalar curvature. After briefly introducing the action and the corresponding field equations, we employ linear stability theory to investigate the physical properties. The analysis showed the compatibility of the current theoretical model with the recent history of the Universe, obtaining viable constraints for the model's parameters in some specific cases. In the present setup, the axion--dilaton system is non--minimally coupled with gravity in an independent manner, leading to distinct physical features in the phase-space structure, possible alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem.

Abstract: We present a complete characterization of stable, off-equatorial circular orbits around magnetically charged black holes (MBHs). For a static, spherically symmetric MBH, we derive an exact analytic expression for the orbital latitude theta as a function of radius r. We establish a direct connection between these orbits and the spacetime fundamental structure, and demonstrate their stability against synchrotron radiation. We show that charged particles such as electrons and protons can exhibit O(1) latitude deviations at the ISCO radius and remain stable under synchrotron emission even for extremely small values of the black hole magnetic charge. We then extend the analysis to rotating MBHs, numerically computing the prograde and retrograde orbital branches and demonstrating how frame-dragging modifies their structure and stability regions. We show that these off-equatorial orbits are a unique feature of the magnetic charge, being forbidden in the analogous electrically charged Kerr-Newman spacetime. Our results suggest that environments surrounding magnetically charged black holes can exhibit distinctive phenomenological signatures, with potential implications for black hole imaging and polarimetric observations.

*Lei Ming,Himanshu Chaudhary,Shi-Dong Liang,Hong-Hao Zhang,Tiberiu Harko*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper presents an f(Q,T) gravity theory with Schrödinger-type vectorial non-metricity, exploring cosmological implications by deriving generalized Friedmann equations. It investigates warm inflation scenarios and compares observations with existing data, suggesting the theory could complement standard ΛCDM. The analysis involves deriving field equations, considering specific variable forms, and employing MCMC methods for comparison. The findings imply potential for new insights into early Universe cosmology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper advances modified gravity theories by introducing non-metricity, exploring applications in early Universe physics and cosmological data analysis. The Schrödinger-type non-metricity is particularly intriguing as it preserves vector length during autoparallel transport, offering new perspectives on gravity's role in cosmic evolution. Investigating such theories may provide alternative explanations for cosmological observations, such as dark energy and inflationary dynamics. Additionally, reformulating Einstein's equations with f(Q,T) gravity opens new avenues for addressing long-standing questions in cosmology, potentially offering a unified approach to early and late Universe phenomena through detailed comparisons with observational data like the Hubble function using methods like MCMC.

Method: The authors consider an f(Q,T) gravity theory with a Schrödinger-type vectorial non-metricity, assuming vanishing total scalar curvature with a Lagrange multiplier. They derive generalized Friedmann equations incorporating non-metricity and the Lagrange multiplier. Two distinct cosmological applications are explored: first, by assuming different forms of non-metricity and the Lagrange multiplier, investigating warm inflationary scenarios, and showing that when the non-metricity is a constant vector, standard GR is recovered. The second application involves assuming the Lagrange multiplier is a constant, demonstrating radiation creation during early expansion, with radiation's peak occurring after an accelerating inflationary phase followed by deceleration. Observational data comparison is conducted using Hubble function data from Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with a linear Lagrange density, and the model's predictions are compared to the ΛCDM standard paradigm. The results suggest the Schrödinger f(Q,T) theory can effectively describe both early and late Universe observations.

Result: The paper's findings indicate that the Schrödinger-type f(Q,T) gravity theory with vectorial non-metricity can effectively describe both early and late Universe cosmological observations, offering a promising alternative or complement to the standard ΛCDM model. The analysis reveals that specific assumptions about variables lead to standard GR recovery and warm inflation scenarios, while detailed observational comparison suggests the theory's potential to explain cosmic expansion phases and alignment with established cosmological data.

Conclusion: This study contributes to modified gravity theories by incorporating Schrödinger-type vectorial non-metricity. The derived generalized Friedmann equations and explored cosmological applications, particularly inflation scenarios and compatibility with observational data, suggest that this theory could be valuable in understanding early Universe physics and complementing current cosmological models like ΛCDM. The findings open new avenues for theoretical exploration in gravity and cosmology, potentially offering a unified framework for explaining cosmic expansion dynamics across different epochs. The use of MCMC analysis and detailed observational comparisons enhances the credibility of the proposed model, indicating its potential to contribute significantly to the field of cosmology.

Abstract: We consider an $f(Q, T)$ gravity theory with a Schrödinger type vectorial non-metricity. In the presence of such a non-metricity, the length of vectors is preserved under autoparallel transport. We obtain the field equations assuming a vanishing total scalar curvature, implemented by a Lagrange multiplier, and investigate their cosmological implications. To do this, we derive the generalized Friedmann equations which now have terms involving the non-metricity and the Lagrange multiplier. Then, we consider two distinct cosmological applications of the model. First of all, by adopting distinct forms of these two basic variables and investigate the possibility of the existence of warm inflationary scenarios within the framework of these models. In particular, we consider the case that the non-metricity is described by a constant vector, and we show that with this assumption we recover standard general relativity. The scenario in which the Lagrange multiplier is a constant is also investigated, and we show that radiation can be created during the very early phases of expansion. The amount of radiation peaks at a certain time after which, there is a transition from an accelerating inflationary phase to a decelerating one. Moreover, we perform a detailed comparison of the predictions of the considered Schrödinger type cosmology with a set of observational data for the Hubble function, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, by adopting a simple linear form for the Lagrange density. The model predictions are also compared with the results of the $Λ$CDM standard paradigm. Our results indicate that the Schrödinger $f(Q,T)$ type theory can give a good description of the observational data for both the very early and the late Universe.

Abstract: We revisit the framework of Newer General Relativity, defined by all independent quadratic invariants of the non-metricity tensor, including the unique quadratic parity-violating term. We analyze linear perturbations around a flat FLRW background and find that the theory generically exhibits ghost instabilities, except for the special case of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR) supplemented by the parity-violating operator. Using both the Dirac-Bergmann procedure and the Cartan-Kuranishi algorithm, we show that this remaining case propagates eight degrees of freedom at the fully non-linear level. This result implies that the parity-violating extension of STEGR is strongly coupled around FLRW and therefore lies beyond the regime of validity of standard linear perturbation theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, stationary black holes have a non-vanishing scalar charge. During the inspiral, the phase evolution is modified by several effects, primarily an additional scalar dipole radiation, which enters at -1PN order. This effect accelerates the inspiral when compared to general relativity, when including corrections up to 2PN. Using fully non-linear numerical simulations of quasi-circular, comparable mass binaries, we find that in the late stages the orbital dynamics are altered so that the overall effect is instead a decelerated merger phase for the modified gravity case. We attribute this to a change in the conservative dynamics, and show that at the late inspiral stage more energy must be emitted in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to induce a given change in frequency. In longer signals, this should lead to a distinctive switch between a faster and slower frequency evolution relative to general relativity as the binary approaches merger. This work suggests we should revisit existing constraints on the theory that are obtained assuming PN approximations apply up to merger, or based on order by order approximations that neglect backreaction effects on the metric, and shows the importance of including non-linear effects that modify the gravitational sector in the strong field regime.

We show that if the metric is real-analytic, then the constraints can be always expressed locally as a system of first order PDE's - this system is obtained by a special choice of the coframe, which reduces to zero all second order terms in the scalar constraint.

Abstract: We formulate a generalized $k$-essence model in the presence of a Palatini $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravitational sector. In the corresponding biscalar-tensor theory, we discuss the distinguished dynamical properties of the two scalar fields, elucidating how the Palatini scalaron can be still algebraically solved in terms of matter, the $k$-essence field and its kinetic term. We derive the conditions ensuring the absence of Ostrogradsky modes and the well-posedness of the initial data problem, also providing an intriguing analogy with a specific class of DHOST theories. Then, we investigate the cosmology of a flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker spacetime according a dynamical system approach, with the aim of determining the set of fixed points in the phase space, representing specific periods of the Universe evolution and characterized by different effective barotropic index $w_{\text{eff}}$. The analysis reveals the presence of a range of possible configurations, with the existence of (quasi) de-Sitter epochs connected by heteroclinic orbits, scaling solutions and quintessence phases.

Abstract: We investigate boson stars within the framework of the self-interacting Einstein-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin (E-FLS) model, constituted by a complex scalar field with a quartic self-interaction and a real scalar field. Our analysis explores the family of static solutions across a broad range of parameters, including the self-interaction of the complex scalar field. We obtain that positive self-interaction terms increase the maximum mass and compactness of E-FLS stars, allowing them to reach masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar limit without the need of ultralight bosonic masses. Moreover, in the limit where the real scalar field becomes massless, the solutions present larger effective radii and allow a broader range of stable solutions. Astrophysical images, generated via backward ray-tracing, show that these compact, self-interacting E-FLS stars produce strong gravitational lensing, yielding shadows that could visually mimic black holes, thus providing potential observational signatures detectable in ongoing electromagnetic surveys.

In particular, we consider inflaton models which are invariant under the subgroup of transverse diffeomorphisms and address the possibility of implementing a slow-roll phase. We obtain the corresponding expressions for relevant quantities such as the slow-roll parameters and the number of $e$-folds, and derive the primordial power-spectrum of curvature perturbations. The scalar spectral index features modifications which are confronted with CMB data from Planck and ACT. We study in detail the quadratic potential model, combining asymptotic and numerical analysis. We show that the post-inflationary behavior can be drastically different from the diffeomorphism-invariant case, exhibiting novel dynamical regimes.

Abstract: We examined the asymmetric deformation in collisions and the transition conditions from oblique to normal collisions and non-collisions to address the problem of oblique collisions of rigid bodies in classical mechanics. A closed solution satisfying the fundamental equations and adhering to the energy conservation law without introducing new material parameters was derived. The solution exhibited a nonlinear relationship between post-collision velocity and initial state parameters, contrasting with the linear results of existing studies. This solution avoided the fallacy in Whittaker's hypothesis that kinetic energy might increase after a collision. Consequently, the solution presented herein fundamentally resolves Kane's puzzle, previously overlooked in classical mechanics.

Abstract: A direct linearisation scheme, based on an elliptic Cauchy kernel, is set up for the lattice CKP equation. This leads to an elliptic parametrisation of the lattice CKP equation, together with its Lax triplet, which allows us to perform appropriate continuum limits and construct elliptic solutions. By selecting appropriate integration measures and domains for the singular linear integral equation in the scheme, elliptic multi-soliton solutions of the lattice CKP equation are found.

### [137] [Higher order Hirota bilinear forms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18466)
*Metin Gürses,Aslı Pekcan*

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the soliton solutions of certain Hirota bilinear equations. It establishes conditions under which these equations admit three-soliton solutions and conjectures about the possibility of four-soliton solutions. Additionally, it explores solutions like lump and hybrid solitons in specific cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of soliton solutions is fundamental in nonlinear science, with applications in various fields including optics, fluid dynamics, and plasma physics. Understanding the conditions for the existence of multiple soliton solutions helps in modeling complex physical phenomena and developing new mathematical methods for solving nonlinear partial differential equations.

Method: The paper uses the Hirota bilinear method, a powerful technique for finding exact solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations. It involves transforming the original equations into bilinear forms using the Hirota D-operator and then seeking solutions in terms of exponential functions representing solitons. The method also includes analyzing the degrees of homogeneity and the parity of coefficients in the equations.

Result: The key results include necessary conditions for the existence of three-soliton solutions, specifically requiring that two of the exponents in the D-operator are odd and the third is even. Additionally, it is shown that three-soliton solutions exist for D-operators raised to an odd power, while four-soliton solutions are conjectured to be rare. The paper also demonstrates the existence of lump and hybrid solutions, expanding the range of possible solutions for these equations.

Conclusion: The study contributes to the classification of soliton solutions for Hirota bilinear equations with multiple space-time dimensions. It provides a framework for further exploration of nonlinear phenomena and offers new exact solutions that can be utilized in both theoretical and applied contexts.

Abstract: In this paper we study Hirota bilinear forms of the type $P(D) \{f\cdot f\}=0$. We prove that for $P(D)=D_x^mD_y^rD_t^n$ the equations have three-soliton solutions if only if two of nonzero $m,n,p$ are odd and the other one even. We explicitly derive the nonlinear partial differential equations corresponding to this form for $m+n+p=4$ and $m+n+p=6$. We show that the equations for $P(D)=D_x(D_x^3+α_1 D_t+α_2 D_y)^{2k+1}$ possess three-soliton solutions for any constants $(α_1,α_2)\neq (0,0)$ and $k\in \mathbb{N}$. We conjecture that these equations have four-soliton solution only for $k=0$. Finally, we consider the equations for $P(D)=D_x^{m_1}D_y^{m_2}D_t^{m_3}D_z^{m_4}$. We prove that these equations have three-soliton solutions if only if one of $m_i=1$, and all the other $m_i$'s are odd for $i=1,2,3,4$. We observe that the monomials $D_x^mD_y^rD_t^n$ and $D_x^{m_1}D_y^{m_2}D_t^{m_3}D_z^{m_4}$ do not result genuine four-soliton solutions. In addition, we obtain three-soliton, lump, and hybrid solutions of these three type of equations for particular powers of the Hirota $D$-operators.

Abstract: High-fidelity shock experiments were performed on copper powders with controlled porosity via improved target fabrication and assembly. Optical velocimetry and multi-channel pyrometry were used to obtain Hugoniot data, isentropic release paths, and interface temperature histories. The results validate a modified two-phase equation of state (EOS) for copper based on the framework of Greeff et al. The measured Hugoniot shows good agreement with the present model but exhibits significant softening above ~156 GPa relative to the original Greeff EOS, indicating that reduction in lattice specific heat becomes essential when shock temperatures exceed three times the melting point (T > 3Tm). Unloading behavior matches hydrodynamic simulations incorporating the recalibrated EOS, confirming its accuracy for off-Hugoniot states. Theoretical analysis of temperature release profiles suggests that the thermal conductivity of shocked copper powders may be considerably higher than first-principles predictions. Crucially, despite heterogeneity in shock heating, the macroscopic dynamic response of copper powders with a porosity of ~1.7 is well captured by an average-density EOS model, supporting the use of porous material experiments for EOS validation under extreme conditions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Growing energy demands of modern digital devices necessitate alternative, low-power computing mechanisms. When incident loads take the form of acoustic or vibrational waves, the ability to mechanically process information eliminates the need for transduction, paving the way for passive computing. Recent studies have proposed systems that learn and execute mechanical logic through buckling, bistability, and origami-inspired lattices. However, owing to the large timescales of shape morphing, such concepts suffer from slow operation or require active stimulation of adaptive materials. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach to mechanical logic, leveraging the rich dynamics of wave propagation in elastic structures. In lieu of traditional forward-design tools, such as band diagrams and transmission spectra, we employ a multi-faceted topology optimization approach, enabling us to identify candidate waveguide configurations within an extremely large design space. By incorporating voids within an otherwise uniform substrate, the optimized waveguides are able to precisely manipulate wave propagation paths, triggering desirable interferences of the scattered wavefield that culminate in energy localization at readouts corresponding to a given logic function. An experimental setup is used to demonstrate the efficacy of such logic gates and their resilience to non-uniform loading. By implementing these building blocks into a mechanical adder, we demonstrate the scalable deployment of more sophisticated mechanical computing circuits, opening up new avenues in mechanical signal processing and physical computing.

TL;DR: The paper investigates feature selection algorithms for accurate material classification using sparse-frequency THz spectroscopy, showing that SFS-based features yield high accuracy and align with absorption bands, eliminating the need for reference measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the need for reference measurements and broaden the application of material classification in real-world scenarios like security and environmental monitoring.

Method: Three feature selection strategies (mRMR, LASSO, SFS) are evaluated with three classifiers (LLR, Naïve Bayes, SVM). The method shows high accuracy with a small subset of frequencies and connects feature selection to material absorption bands.

Result: Results show high classification accuracy using fewer frequencies. SFS-selected features align with absorption bands, and the method eliminates the need for reference measurements, broadening applications.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that data-driven feature selection reduces spectral dimensionality, enabling compact sensors for real-world use like security and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: We investigate how feature selection algorithms can enable accurate, reference-free classification of materials using sparse-frequency terahertz (THz) reflection spectroscopy. Three classes of feature selection strategies are evaluated. Namely, the filter-based mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance), the embedded LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), and the wrapper-based SFS (Sequential Forward Selection) algorithms. Each strategy is assessed using the Linear Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine classifiers. Our results show that high classification accuracy can be achieved using only a small subset of frequencies. Particularly, when non-referenced spectra are applied. Furthermore, we show that the SFS-selected features align with the materials' absorption bands, confirming that the discriminative power arises from genuine spectroscopic contrasts. These findings highlights that reducing spectral dimensionality through data-driven selection eliminates the need for broadband sources and reference measurements, enabling compact, application-specific THz sensors. This approach offers robust material identification in real-world scenarios such as security screening, non-destructive testing, and environmental monitoring.

Result: The prototype silicon device successfully demonstrated voltage-controlled narrowband thermal emission in the mid-infrared region.

Conclusion: The development of a cost-effective, scalable silicon platform for thermal emission control opens new possibilities in thermal management technologies and applications.

Abstract: Control of thermal emission is important in a number of applications from thermal energy harvesting and management and sensing of gas and chemical to thermal camouflage. Semiconductor-based devices can be engineered to enable electrical control of thermal emission, offering high modulation speed and ease of voltage control. Existing device designs for modulating thermal emission rely on semiconductors other than silicon, such as III-V and II-VI compounds, which are expensive. The silicon platform offers several advantages, including significantly lower cost, CMOS compatibility, and mature fabrication processes. However, a silicon-based design for modulating thermal emission remains absent. Here, we present an all-silicon device utilising electrical control over carrier dynamics to modulate a narrowband thermal emission in the mid-infrared region. We design a silicon device exhibiting voltage-controlled narrowband thermal emission at 10 μm and confirm its performance using electromagnetic calculations. This work paves the way for scalable, low-cost, and integrated thermal emission devices made possible by the silicon platform.

Result: The robotic system achieved a 2% resistance spread, comparing to 7% by humans.

Conclusion: Robotics can provide the consistency needed in research settings, moving closer to industrial standards.

Abstract: Unlike the rigid, high-volume automation found in industry, academic research requires process flexibility that has historically relied on variable manual operations. This hinders the fabrication of advanced, complex devices. We propose to address this gap by automating these low-volume, high-stakes tasks using a robotic arm to improve process control and consistency. As a proof of concept, we deploy this system for the resist development of Josephson junction devices. A statistical comparison of the process repeatability shows the robotic process achieves a resistance spread across chips close to 2%, a significant improvement over the ~7% spread observed from human operators, validating robotics as a solution to eliminate operator-dependent variability and a path towards industrial-level consistency in a research setting.

Abstract: The functional renormalization group (fRG) is acknowledged as a powerful tool in quantum many-body physics and beyond. On the technical side, conventional implementations of the fRG rely on regulators for bare propagators only. Starting from Schwinger--Dyson and Bethe--Salpeter equations, we develop here an fRG formulation where both bare propagators and bare interactions can be dressed with regulators. The approach thus obtained is a generalization of the multiloop fRG recently introduced for many-fermion systems. Using the single-boson exchange decomposition, we show that the underlying flow equations are simply interpreted as adding a regulator to the bosonic propagator and that such an extension scarcely changes the original structure of the flow equations. Overall, we provide a framework for implementing approaches that cannot be realized with conventional fRG methods, such as temperature flows for models with retarded interactions. For concrete applications, we analyze the loop convergence of our scheme against conventional cutoff schemes for the Hubbard atom and the Anderson impurity model. Finally, we devise a new temperature-flow scheme that implements a cutoff in both the propagator and the bare interaction, and demonstrate its validity on a model of an Anderson impurity coupled to a phonon.

Abstract: The pyrochlore lattice materials can exhibit geometrical frustration, while the related many-body electronic states remain elusive. In this work, we performed scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on the pyrochlore superconductor CsBi2 and spin liquid Pr2Ir2O7 at 0.3 K. For the first time, we obtained atomically resolved images of their (111) surfaces, revealing a hexagonal lattice or a kagome lattice. Tunneling spectroscopy in CsBi2 reveals a nearly fully opened superconductivity gap. The ratio of 2Δ/kBTC = 4.7 suggests relatively strong coupling superconductivity, as compared with that in kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs). In contrast to the previous study categorizing CsBi2 as a type-I superconductor, the applied magnetic field induces a hexagonal vortex lattice in which each vortex core exhibits an intriguing three-fold symmetry state. In Pr2Ir2O7, we observed a spatially homogeneous Kondo-lattice resonance, which is compared with that in the kagome Kondo-lattice material CsCr6Sb6. We further discover that the Kondo resonance exhibits a spatial modulation with three-fold symmetry, and the applied magnetic field induces a Zeeman splitting of the Kondo resonance with intriguing atomic site dependence. We discuss the relations of these many-body electronic phenomena with the pyrochlore lattice geometry and its charge or spin frustration. Our systematic observations offer atomic-scale insights into the many-body electronic structures of the geometrically frustrated pyrochlore superconductors and spin liquids.

Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional tight-binding model in which onsite
  potentials $\{\varepsilon_i\}$ exhibit power-law spatial correlations
  (with exponent $α$) and the hopping amplitudes decay as
  $t_{ij}\sim |i-j|^{-β}$. This two-parameter family interpolates
  continuously between short-range Anderson-like disorder, correlated
  disorder with conventional hopping, and long-range hopping models with
  nontrivial delocalization tendencies. Using large-scale exact
  diagonalization, we construct a comprehensive phase map in the
  $(α,β)$ plane by combining spectral statistics, density-of-states
  analysis, and energy-resolved localization indicators such as the
  participation ratio, single-particle entanglement entropy, level-spacing
  ratio $r$, and the ratio of the geometric to arithmetic density of
  states. From these observables we define phase-indicator functions that
  compactly quantify localization behaviour across the spectrum. Our analysis reveals robust mobility edges and multiple regimes of
  spectral coexistence between localized, extended, resonant, and critical
  states. Finite-size scaling, implemented via an explicit smoothness-based
  cost function, enables extraction of critical exponents and delineation
  of transition lines across the $(α,β)$ parameter space.
  To validate and complement these physics-based diagnostics, we employ a
  supervised autoencoder that learns high-level representations of
  eigenstate structure directly from raw features and reliably reproduces
  the phase classification defined by the indicator functions. Together,
  these approaches provide a coherent and internally consistent picture of
  the spectral transitions driven by correlated disorder and long-range
  hopping, establishing a unified framework for characterizing mobility
  edges in long-range one-dimensional systems.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework combining DFT, NEGF, and DMFT to model spintronic devices under realistic conditions, accounting for correlations and non-equilibrium effects in charge and spin transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing methods in modeling spintronic devices under realistic conditions, where correlations and non-equilibrium dynamics play significant roles.

Method: The method involves integrating density functional theory (DFT), non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method, and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to model steady-state quantum transport in spintronic devices.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrates that under finite bias, Co exhibits a transition from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior due to electron scattering with electron-hole pairs. In contrast, the Fe/MgO/Fe tunnel junction shows weaker correlation effects, with Fe remaining close to equilibrium even at large biases. However, inelastic scattering leads to partly incoherent transport, altering the device's response to external bias.

Conclusion: This framework provides a comprehensive approach to model spintronic devices beyond single-particle descriptions, enabling new insights into experimental results.

Abstract: Two-terminal spintronic devices remain challenging to model under realistic operating conditions, where the interplay of complex electronic structures, correlation effects and bias-driven non-equilibrium dynamics may significantly impact charge and spin transport. Existing {\it ab initio} methods either capture bias-dependent transport but neglect dynamical correlations or include correlations but are restricted to equilibrium or linear-response regimes. To overcome these limitations, we present a framework for steady-state quantum transport, combining density functional theory (DFT), the non-equilibrium Greens' function (NEGF) method, and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The framework is then applied to Cu/Co/vacuum/Cu and an Fe/MgO/Fe tunnel junction. In Co, correlations drive a transition from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior under finite bias, due to scattering of electrons with electron-hole pairs. In contrast, in the Fe/MgO/Fe junction, correlation effects are weaker: Fe remains close to equilibrium even at large biases. Nevertheless, inelastic scattering can still induce partly incoherent transport that modifies the device's response to the external bias. Overall, our framework provides a route to model spintronic devices beyond single-particle descriptions, while also suggesting new interpretations of experiments.

The work focuses on analyzing electronic properties through synchrotron-based techniques, particularly resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS), and establishes a theoretical framework for modeling such materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the electronic properties of perovskite materials, specifically Ca2RuO4, using advanced theoretical techniques. The authors aim to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental data by employing a method that accounts for strong correlations and spin-orbit coupling. This is particularly relevant for materials with technological applications, where accurate modeling of electronic properties is crucial.

Method: The study employs a combination of DFT with the GGA+SO+$U$ functional and a fully relativistic, spin-polarized LMTO method. The approach includes modeling of relevant spectra obtained from synchrotron-based techniques, focusing on RIXS at the Ru $L_3$ and O $K$ edges. This allows for a detailed analysis of the material's electronic structure and correlation effects. The use of RIXS as a key tool enables the extraction of information about the electronic configuration and spin properties of the material.

Result: The results of the study demonstrate a high agreement between the computed spectra from the LMTO method and the experimental data for Ca2RuO4. This agreement provides a reliable interpretation of the key features in the RIXS spectra, offering a deeper understanding of the material's electronic properties. The findings highlight the importance of spin-orbit coupling and strong electron correlations in shaping the material's behavior. The approach developed in this work offers a robust framework for future studies of similar materials, facilitating accurate modeling of their electronic properties using RIXS.

Conclusion: This paper successfully establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework for studying the electronic properties of Ca2RuO4 using RIXS. By incorporating advanced computational methods that account for strong correlations and spin-orbit coupling, the authors have provided a solid foundation for understanding and characterizing the electronic structure of perovskite materials. This framework can now be extended to other similar materials, aiding in their analysis and potential application in various technological fields.

Abstract: The single-layered perovskite Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, characterized by a 4$d^4$ electron configuration, has been studied from first principles using density functional theory (DFT) using the generalized gradient approximation, with inclusion of strong on-site Coulomb interactions and spin-orbit coupling (GGA+SO+$U$), in the framework of the fully relativistic, spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) band-structure method. This approach enabled a comprehensive investigation of the electronic structure of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ through the modeling of relevant spectra obtained from synchrotron-based techniques widely used to probe electronic properties, with a primary focus on resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ru $L_3$ and O $K$ edges. The calculated spectra were thoroughly analyzed with available experimental data reported in the literature. The good agreement between our results and experimental observations for Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ enables a conclusive interpretation of key features in the spectra obtained from the aforementioned techniques. Consequently, this enables us to describe its electronic properties and to establish a solid theoretical approach suitable for routine modeling of spectra, particularly from RIXS, aimed at characterizing the electronic structure and properties of similar or more complex strongly correlated, technologically relevant materials.

Motivation: 研究高树超导体在 Hubbard 模型中的存在性一直是个热门话题，尤其是当 Hubbard 势 U 大约为 band 宽度的大小时。本研究通过八根腿圆柱结构，考虑下一跳越对结果的影响，为证实这一理论提供了直接的数值证据。

Method: 采用了矩阵积态方法，系统中每一点的状态由足够大的 bond 维度表示，计算能级差异可达 $10^{-3}t$ 每个原子。结果显示，其在 t' ≤ 0 和不同 U 下，基态呈现不同形式的 CDW，同时 SC 的相关性非常短暂。而对于 t' > 0 的情况，结果受到边界条件的显著影响，难以在二维极限下明确 SC 或 CDW 的主导地位。

Result: 在 Hubbard 模型中，$U = 8t$ 和 $U = 12t$，分别在 δ=1/12 和 δ=1/8 填穴率下，通过八根腿圆柱形计算发现：当 t' ≤ 0 时，基态主要呈现 CDW 的不同形式，SC 相关性非常短暂。但对于 t' > 0 的情况，边界条件对结果影响显著，结果出现分歧，难以判断哪种方式主导二维极限下的 CDW 或 SC。

Conclusion: 主要结论是：在二维情况下， Hubbard 模型的 d-波超导体状态的存在与否仍有待进一步探讨。特别是在不同的 U 参数下， d-波超导体可能在二维极限下表现为主导现象，或无法形成，取决于具体情况。

Abstract: The issue of whether $d$-wave superconductivity (SC) occurs in the square-lattice Hubbard model with $U$ of order of the bandwidth has been one of the most debated issues to emerge from the study of high temperature SC. Here, we report variational results on eight-leg cylinders with next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the range $-0.5 t \leq t'\leq 0.25 t$ with $U = 8t$ and $12t$ and doped hole concentrations $δ=1/12$ and $1/8$. For $t'\leq 0$, the ground-state appears to be a charge-density wave (CDW) of one sort or another with SC correlations that are extremely short-ranged. In contrast, in some cases, the local magnetic order has a correlation length greater than half the cylinder width - suggestive that magnetic order might also arise in the 2D limit. For $t'>0$, our results depend more strongly on boundary conditions (periodic vs antiperiodic), making it still harder to correctly guess whether SC or CDW correlations dominate in the 2D limit. These results were obtained employing matrix-product states with bond dimensions large enough that energy differences as small as $10^{-3}t$ per site can be resolved.

Abstract: We extend non-invertible duality concepts from one-dimensional systems to two spatial dimensions by constructing a web of non-invertible dualities for lattice models with subsystem symmetries. For the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact.

Abstract: Optical control offers a compelling route for tailoring material properties on an ultrafast time scale. Ordered states such as charge density waves (CDWs) can be transiently melted by an ultrafast light excitation. This is also the case for the rare-earth tritelluride LaTe$_3$, a prototypical CDW compound. For this material it has recently been reported that the suppression of the primary CDW allows the transient formation of a second CDW, whose wave vector is orthogonal to the primary one. This creates the intriguing scenario where light enables switching between two distinct ordered phases of the material. While the second CDW has so far been observed by structural techniques, it remains an open question how the interplay of the two CDW phases is reflected in the material's electronic structure. We investigate this via time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements of LaTe$_3$. The complex Fermi contour is probed using a FeSuMa analyzer, which records the photoemission intensity of the entire Fermi contour at once. The dynamics revealed by the FeSuMa analyzer are complemented by measurements using a conventional hemispherical electron analyzer. We combine conventional data analysis with $k$-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, demonstrating its strong potential for disentangling large datasets. While we do not find any features that cannot be explained by the melting and re-establishment of the primary CDW, distinct dynamics and coherent oscillations are observed in the different branches of the Fermi contour.

Abstract: Bound states and its energies for systems with the quartic energy-momentum dispersion $E(p) \sim p^4$ and polynomial potentials are studied using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) semiclassical approximation and the Wentzel complex method taking into account higher order WKB corrections. The obtained energies are compared with numerical values found by applying the variational approach utilizing the universal Gaussian basis. It is found that the wave functions of the ground and higher-energy states for systems with quartic dispersion have nodes in the classically forbidden region. Thus, the well-known oscillation theorem for the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation is not, in general, applicable for systems with quartic dispersion. Still it is observed that the oscillation theorem holds in the classically allowed region in all considered examples. The properties of bound state wave functions are compared with the solutions of the exactly solvable problem of a square well potential.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A novel continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method is introduced for computing the low-lying spectrum of quantum Hamiltonians. The method addresses the limitations of Quantum Monte Carlo in dealing with excited states and sign problems by projecting the thermal density matrix onto a chosen subspace. It systematically converges to low-energy states with finite overlap, despite significant discretization errors. The approach is sign problem-free when possible but can also handle cases with sign problems. It is applied to the one-dimensional Ising model without a sign problem and the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model with a sign problem, demonstrating its versatility and accuracy even for larger systems where exact diagonalization is not feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of accurate and efficient quantum Monte Carlo methods for studying low-lying spectra of quantum systems, especially in cases with complex interactions and sign problems, remains a significant challenge in theoretical and computational physics. This study introduces a new method that circumvents some of the limitations of traditional Quantum Monte Carlo approaches.

Method: The method involves path-integral Monte Carlo simulations that project the thermal density matrix onto a selected subspace of linearly independent states. The approach avoids Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states as the inverse temperature ($eta$) increases. It is applied to two different quantum systems: a sign-free system and a system with a sign problem.

Result: The method successfully computes the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields. For this case, it demonstrates the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. In the case of the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model with a sign problem, the method provides accurate results for low-energy spectra on small lattices and scaling behaviors for larger systems, limited by sign problems.

Conclusion: This work presents a promising new direction for quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy, offering a general approach to studying low-lying spectra of lattice Hamiltonians, provided that sign problems can be managed or are not prohibitive.

Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for studying quantum many-body systems but face difficulties in accessing excited states and in treating sign problems. We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $β$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $β$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians.

Abstract: Characterizing topological phases for strongly interacting fermions in the mixed-state regime remains a major challenge. Here we introduce a general and numerically efficient framework to diagnose mixed-state topological phases in strongly interacting systems via the disorder parameter (DP) of the U(1) charge operator. Specifically, from the finite-size scaling of the second derivative of the DP generating function, we introduce the topological scaling indicator, which exhibits a characteristic linear scaling with the system's linear dimension for topological phases, a signature that vanishes upon transition into a topologically trivial phase. Crucially, we develop an efficient determinant Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that facilitates the evaluation of this indicator in interacting systems. We apply our approach to two paradigmatic models: for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, we successfully map the interaction-driven transition from a quantum spin Hall insulator to a trivial Mott insulator. Furthermore, our method circumvents the limitations imposed by the severe sign problem in the Haldane-Hubbard model, enabling robust identification of the quantum anomalous Hall phase at accessible temperatures. This work provides a powerful and accessible tool for the numerical exploration of topological phenomena in interacting mixed states, opening a pathway to study systems previously inaccessible due to computational obstacles.

Abstract: We propose a minimal model to capture the anomalous low-temperature thermodynamics of doped semiconductors, such as Si:P, across the metal-insulator transition. We consider pairs of local magnetic moments coupled to a highly disordered, non-interacting electronic bath that undergoes a metal-insulator transition with increasing doping. Using a large-$\mathcal{N}$ variational approach, we capture both the inhomogeneous local Fermi-liquid and the insulating random-singlet phase, and find that the local moment susceptibility exhibits a robust power-law behavior, $χ(T) \propto T^{-α}$, with $α$ evolving smoothly with doping before saturating in the metal. Our results highlight the competition between Kondo screening and random-singlet formation as the key ingredient in constructing a complete theory for the low-temperature behavior of strongly disordered interacting systems.

Abstract: We study the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb gapless spin liquid in the presence of Stone-Wales-type local lattice defects with odd-sided plaquettes. While the clean Kitaev model has no finite-temperature phase transitions, we find that introducing a finite defect density $n_d\approx 10^{-4}$--$10^{-2}$ produces a true phase transition with a sizeable $T_c \approx 2 n_d$ in units of the Kitaev exchange. The resulting non-Abelian chiral quantum spin liquid exhibits scalar spin chirality and electron orbital magnetization which peak near lattice defects. This disorder-driven instability relies on an emergent long range ferromagnetic interaction $r^{-γ}$ ($γ\approx 2.7$) between defect chiralities, mediated by the nearly-gapless fermions, with implications for topology generation in Dirac cones with fluctuating mass terms.

Abstract: Ab initio quantum chemical methods for accurately computing interactions between molecules have a wide range of applications but are often computationally expensive. Hence, selecting an appropriate method based on accuracy and computational cost remains a significant challenge due to varying performance of methods. In this work, we propose a framework based on an ensemble of $Δ$-ML models trained on features extracted from a pre-trained atom-pairwise neural network to predict the error of each method relative to all other methods including the ``gold standard'' coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations at the estimated complete basis set limit [CCSD(T)/CBS]. Our proposed approach provides error estimates across various levels of theories and identifies the computationally efficient approach for a given error range utilizing only a subset of the dataset. Further, this approach allows comparison between various theories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an extended BioFragment dataset, which includes the interaction energies for common biomolecular fragments and small organic dimers. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves very small mean-absolute-errors below 0.1 kcal/mol regardless of the given method. Furthermore, by analyzing all-to-all $Δ$-ML models for present levels of theory, we identify method groupings that align with theoretical hypotheses, providing evidence that $Δ$-ML models can easily learn corrections from any level of theory to any other level of theory.

For this dataset, HF/3-21G achieves 45.5% mean absolute percentage error with perfect pairwise ranking in 7.4 minutes per molecule. All 30 tested combinations of functional and basis sets maintain perfect pairwise agreement, validating their use as evolutionary fitness functions despite moderate absolute errors. Larger basis sets yield a lower percentage error compared to the experimental values than the difference with the functional. The preservation of pairwise rankings across all combinations of functionals and basis sets provides crucial guidance for evolutionary optimization of nonlinear optical materials.

TL;DR: The paper discusses spin-orbital entanglement in double perovskite materials using relativistic crystal field theory. Entropies for specific states are measured through optical transitions and magnetic moments, revealing that increased effective magnetic moments can stem from spin-orbital entanglement without a larger spin-orbit coupling constant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the origins of enhanced magnetic moments in these materials by analyzing their spin-orbital entanglement.

Method: Relativistic crystal field theory is applied to model the system; measurements of optical d-d transitions and magnetic dipole moments are used to quantify spin-orbital entropy.

Result: States exhibit spin-orbital entanglement measured by von Neumann entropy, effectively linked to magnetic moments.

Conclusion: Spin-orbit coupling constant isn't necessarily driving the increase in magnetic moments; entanglement could be the key mechanism.

Abstract: The spin-orbital entanglement in $5d^1$ transition metal ions embedded in double perovskites, where anomalous effective magnetic dipole moments are frequently observed, is quantified by the spin-orbital von Neumann entropy $ΔS_{\rm vN}^{\rm SO}$. The framework is grounded on the relativistic crystal field theory, and is illustrated through a series of quantum materials: $A_2{\rm TaCl}_6$ ($A = {\rm K}, {\rm Rb}$), $A_2{\rm MgReO}_6$ ($A = {\rm Ca}, {\rm Sr}, {\rm Ba}$) and ${\rm Ba_2NaOsO_6}$, all analyzed in their paramagnetic phases, alongside the ${\rm ReF_6}$ molecular system. The entropies are derived from measurements of the optical $d$-$d$ transitions $Γ_7(t_{2g})\leftarrowΓ_8(t_{2g})$ and $Γ_8(e_g)\leftarrowΓ_8(t_{2g})$, and of the effective magnetic dipole moment $μ_{\rm eff}$. It is demonstrated that, regardless of the system, the Kramers doublet $Γ_7(t_{2g})$ exhibits no spin-orbital von Neumann entropy. The entropies obtained for the relativistic crystal field states $Γ_8(t_{2g})$ and $Γ_8(e_g)$ uncover that, a larger effective magnetic dipole moment can be attributed to a grater spin-orbital entanglement, yet paradoxically not to a larger spin-orbit coupling constant.

Abstract: Calculating excited-state gradients and derivative couplings using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) remains a computationally demanding task. An efficient variant, TDDFT with resolution of the identity and a minimal auxiliary basis (TDDFT-ris), has been developed to accelerate excitation energy calculations. However, the formulation and implementation of analytical derivatives for this method have not yet been reported. In this work, we present an implementation of analytical excited-state gradients and derivative couplings within the TDDFT-ris framework. Benchmark calculations on medium-sized organic molecules demonstrate a two- to three-fold speedup for both gradients and derivative couplings compared to standard TDDFT. The accuracy of the TDDFT-ris approach is assessed for gradient-dependent applications, including geometry optimizations, emission energy calculations, and the localization of minimum-energy crossing points. Overall, the TDDFT-ris method provides reliable approximations for most cases, with noticeable errors mainly occurring in derivative couplings between nearly degenerate states.

Abstract: Density functional theory is one of the most efficient and widely used computational methods of quantum mechanics, especially in fields such as solid state physics and quantum chemistry. From the theoretical perspecive, its central object is the universal density functional which contains all intrinsic information about the quantum system in question. Once the external potential is provided, in principle one can obtain the exact ground-state energy via a simple minimization. However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network. The resulting neural network preserves the positivity and convexity of the exact functionals. More importantly, it is differentiable, so it can be directly used in a Kohn--Sham calculation.

Abstract: The crystal field theory as explained by Abragam and Bleaney in their landmark 1970 book on transition-ion electron paramagnetic resonance remains a cornerstone in the development of luminescence applications and molecular magnets based on the $f$-elements. The modern numerical derivation of the 27 $B_k^q$ Stevens crystal field parameters (CFPs), which describe the splitting of the energy levels of a central ion, is traditionally achieved through the effective Hamiltonian theory and multiconfiguration wavefunction theory calculations, insofar as the lowest $J$ level fully captures the targeted low-energy physics. In this work, we present a novel theoretical approach for determining the CFPs. The procedure resembles the traditional extraction path but crucially accounts for the full $\ket{J,M_J}$ space of an ion configuration with $L=3$ and $S=\nicefrac{1}{2}$. By demonstrating the extraction procedure using the simplest case of a Ce$^\text{III}$ 4f$^1$ ion with a crystal-field split $J \in \{\nicefrac{5}{2}, \nicefrac{7}{2}\}$ manifold, it is shown for the first time that a unique set of CFPs describes the splitting and mixing both the $J$ manifolds. In fact, this $J/J^\prime$ mixing is analogous to the ``spin mixing'' in binuclear transition metal complexes. At the employed level of calculation, we demonstrate that there is no spin-orbit coupling influence on the CFP values, contrary to previous beliefs. This work represents the first step of a larger effort in reviewing the theory and extraction procedures of CFPs in f-element complexes.

### [163] [Tuning Domain-Based Charge Transfer in Organic Dyes: Impact of Heteroatom Doping in the pi-linker of Carbazole-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19001)
*Ram Dhari Pandey,Marta Galynska,Katharina Boguslawski,Pawel Tecmer*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores domain-based charge transfer in nitrogen-, oxygen-, and sulfur-doped carbazole-based dyes using pCCD method. The study shows that charge transfer efficiency increases with higher doping levels. Nitrogen-doped systems are particularly effective, with one of the tri-nitrogen dyes achieving 42.6lem highlight of charge transfer efficiency. The calculations indicate that charge transfer predominantly occurs from the bridge to the acceptor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding charge transfer mechanisms in organic dyes is crucial for improving their efficiency in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). This paper contributes to the field by providing insights into how doping at different bridge positions affects charge transfer, which is essential for optimizing dye-based materials for energy conversion applications.

Method: A computational study using the pCCD method was performed to analyze domain-based charge transfer in a series of nitrogen-, oxygen-, and sulfur-doped carbazole-based dyes. The study involved characterizing the electronic properties of the dyes, including their donor-to-bridge, bridge-to-acceptor, and donor-to-acceptor charge transfer efficiencies.

Result: The results demonstrate that charge transfer efficiency increases with higher levels of nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur doping. Nitrogen-doped systems consistently outperform their oxygen and sulfur counterparts. Among all variants, the tri-nitrogen dyes exhibit the highest donor-to-acceptor charge transfer efficiency (42.6lem highlight of charge transfer efficiency). The calculations indicate that charge transfer predominantly occurs from the bridge to the acceptor.

Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of strategic doping at the bridge positions of carbazole-based dyes for enhancing charge transfer efficiency. The findings provide valuable insights for the design of more efficient dye-sensitized solar cells.

Abstract: This work presents an innovative computational study of domain-based charge transfer that leverages the localized orbitals of pair Coupled Cluster Doubles (pCCD). This method enables both directional monitoring and quantitative assessment of charge transfer among donor (D), bridge (B), and acceptor (A) moieties. We applied this approach to a series of newly designed carbazole-based prototypical organic dyes, doping the bridge at positions 1, 2, and 3 with nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms to generate mono-, di-, and tri-doped variants. Our results demonstrate a clear and progressive enhancement in charge transfer as the degree of nitrogen or oxygen doping increases from mono- to di- to tri-doped systems. For mono-doped dyes, the highest forward charge transfer from donor to bridge to acceptor (D$\xrightarrow{}$B$\xrightarrow{}$A) occurs when a heteroatom (N or O) is placed in the terminal ring of the bridge, closer to the acceptor. In di-doped dyes, the largest forward charge transfer is observed when heteroatoms occupy both terminal positions, with one atom (N or S) adjacent to the donor and the other (N) near the acceptor. Nitrogen-doped systems consistently outperform their oxygen and sulfur counterparts. Among all variants, the organic dye doped with three nitrogen atoms at the bridge exhibits the most efficient and highest directional donor-to-acceptor charge transfer (42.6\%), making it the most promising candidate for potential applications in dye-sensitized solar cells. Finally, our calculations predict weak charge separation in all systems, indicating that charge transfer predominantly occurs from the bridge to the acceptor.

Abstract: Sigma-profiles obtained from quantum-chemical calculations are key molecular descriptors for solvent selection, thermodynamic modeling, and data-driven molecular design. However, existing sigma-profile libraries are limited in size and inconsistent in quality, which restricts their utility. In this work, we introduce CHAOS (Computed High-Accuracy Observables and Sigma Profiles), a large-scale and internally consistent database providing sigma-profiles for 53091 molecules, along with additional quantum-chemical observables including gas-phase geometries, single-point conductor-like polarizable continuum (C-PCM) data, infrared spectra, ideal-gas heat capacities and entropies, and atomic orbital nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shielding tensors. All data were generated using a standardized quantum-chemical workflow based on an wB97X-D/def2-TZVP level of theory. The CHAOS database covers molecules composed of a diverse set of elements, with molar masses up to 400 amu and dipole moments up to 15 D, and is freely available on Zenodo under an open license. It extends the number of molecules for which sigma-profiles are publicly available by more than an order of magnitude and systematically links them to a broad range of other quantum-chemical molecular descriptors. CHAOS provides a comprehensive and consistent foundation for developing models of molecular and thermodynamic properties -- both physics-based and machine-learning approaches -- across chemistry, chemical engineering, and materials science, greatly extending the possibilities and the available quantum-chemical data basis.

*Steven Young Eulig*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: We introduce WavePID, a likelihood-ratio-based method for distinguishing neutrino tracks from hadronic showers in the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, improving purity by 5% while maintaining Data-MC agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutrino detection, particularly in the low-energy regime, is challenging due to sparse hit patterns, necessitating effective track-cascade separation methods.

Method: WavePID employs waveform-based timing observables, leveraging Monte Carlo simulations for distinguishing particle tracks from hadronic showers.

Result: WavePID enhances track purity by 5% at a 20% down-selection rate, demonstrating significant improvement over current methods while maintaining accuracy across detector systematic uncertainties.

Conclusion: WavePID represents a robust advancement forIceCube's low-energy neutrino studies, leveraging waveform timing for reliable particle identification in sparse observational scenarios.

Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov detector embedded in the Antarctic ice at the South Pole. Its densely instrumented sub-array and dedicated low-energy analyses provide sensitivity to neutrinos in the 5-100 GeV range, enabling precision studies of neutrino oscillations and searches for new physics. This work focuses specifically on this low-energy regime, where sparse hit patterns limit the performance of topology-based reconstruction and classification methods. We introduce Waveform-based Particle Identification (WavePID), a statistically rigorous and interpretable likelihood-ratio discriminator for track-cascade separation, built from Monte Carlo templates in timing-aware, physics-motivated observables and validated through dedicated simulations. Applied to both Monte Carlo and 11.1 years of IceCube data, WavePID suggests improved cascade purity by about 5 percentage points at a fixed 20% down-selection rate relative to the current leading cascade selection, while maintaining Data-MC agreement within detector systematics. The approach is compact and robust to sparse observations, demonstrating the value of waveform-level timing for low-energy reconstruction.

Abstract: Single-crystal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond is a promising material for radiation detectors operating in extreme environments, owing to its outstanding radiation hardness. As nuclear and high-energy physics applications demand particle detectors that withstand higher radiation fluences, understanding the damage thresholds and degradation mechanisms of diamond-based detectors is essential. In this study, single-crystal CVD diamond sensors were exposed to fast neutron irradiation at fluences up to $3.3\times10^{17}$ ${n/cm^2}$. Modules exhibited stable output confirming potential for application in future high-dose radiation environments. The dominant defects were identified as point defects including <100> self interstitials, vacancies, and lattice disorder. Macroscopic defects including nanocavities and cracks were observed with areal densities approaching $10^7$ $cm^{-2}$. The impact of 100 MeV proton irradiation on diamond detector response was quantified by extracting a damage constant of $k^{100 MeV}_{proton}=(1.452\pm0.006)\times10^{-18}cm^2/(p\cdotμm)$ from a linear carrier drift degradation model. The mean free path of carriers was found to exhibit saturation behavior beyond a fluence of $4\times10^{16}$ ${p/cm^2}$ under 100 MeV proton irradiation. Monte Carlo together with molecular dynamics simulations were performed to assess irradiation induced defect and its influence on carrier transport. By considering saturation effects and defect-interaction corrections, we develop an enhanced carrier-drift degradation model that accurately captures detector response under high-dose irradiation. Furthermore, the simulation framework was applied to evaluate damage induced by protons and pions on diamond at various energies, yielding results that show better agreement with experimental data than conventional NIEL based estimates.

Abstract: Gravitational wave detection has transformed astrophysics, granting us direct access to black hole mergers, neutron star collisions, and the cataclysms of stellar death. Yet the great observatories of today, LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and the planned Einstein Telescope, rest on Michelson interferometers that, despite their triumphs, confront fundamental barriers of scale, cost, and environmental vulnerability. We envision a new path, a Sagnac-based fiber interferometer that leverages reciprocity and inherent robustness. Its meter-scale, modular design compact enough to fit within a small facility, offers dramatic gains in scalability and affordability over kilometer scale Michelson systems. Tunable to frequency bands where conventional detectors lose sensitivity, it opens the door to compact, versatile, and accessible GW observatories, empowering universities and research centers worldwide. Linked together in a global network, such facilities could transcend mere detection, they could localize cosmic sources and reconstruct them into images, much as black holes were first directly revealed, ushering in a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy and multi-messenger discovery.

Abstract: The RELICS (REactor neutrino LIquid xenon Coherent elastic Scattering) experiment aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from reactor antineutrinos using a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber. To validate the detector concept and ensure technical reliability for the full-scale experiment, a dedicated prototype was designed, constructed, and operated. This work presents an overview of the design, construction, and operational performance of the prototype, with emphasis on its major subsystems, including the TPC, cryogenic and xenon purification systems, slow control, and data acquisition. During operation, the detector demonstrated the capability to achieve a sub-keV energy threshold required for the RELICS physics program, as reflected by a measured single electron gain of 34.30~$\pm$~0.01~(stat.)~PE/e$^-$ and the successful detection of 0.27~keV L-shell decay events from $^{37}$Ar. In addition, essential data analysis techniques and simulation frameworks were developed and validated, establishing the methodological foundation for future RELICS operations. The successful construction and operation of this prototype confirm the feasibility of the core technologies and provide a crucial experimental basis for the final RELICS detector.

Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline neutrino experiment based in the USA and composed of a Near Detector (ND) complex at Fermi National Laboratory (FNAL), and a Far Detector (FD) complex located at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) $\sim$1300\,km distant. DUNE will study neutrino oscillations looking for unresolved issues of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) such as CP violation in the leptonic sector, neutrino mass ordering and others, starting from the early 2030s. The FD, with a mass of $\sim$17\,kt, that will exploit both ionization and scintillation signals to detect neutrino interactions with Argon. Scintillating photons in LAr will be detected by the photon detection system (PDS) based on light collectors coupled to Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). During a test campaign, different laboratories of the collaboration performed an investigation of the best SiPM candidates that fulfill the DUNE FD requirements. We identified two models of SiPM, produced by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. (HPK) and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), respectively. In this paper, we focus on the FBK selected model showing its main features. We will describe the characterization protocol, the results at both room and cryogenic temperatures and the photon detection efficiency measurements.

Abstract: We present an analytic convoluted-gap function, eq. 11 in the manuscript, for fitting dispersion gaps measured on triple-axis spectrometers (TAS). At the gap, the instrumental resolution skews the signal, producing a high-energy tail that complicates fitting. Our function assumes an instrumental $Q$-resolution with two equal wide and one narrow direction (typical of focused TAS instruments), and a parabolic dispersion at the gap, which is exact for quadratic and accurate for linear dispersions if the resolution is moderate. We demonstrate, that our function outperforms previous methods of fitting a gap, by giving a better fit and more accurate gap determination, seen in figure 4. Here, the anti-ferromagnetically gapped material; MnF$_2$ is simulated in a double-focusing TAS instrument. We also tested our function on experimental data on MnF$_2$ from a TAS-like instrument, where we reproduce the gap size from previous accurate experimentally determined measurements. The function is simple to implement, converges reliably, and we recommend its use for future gap fitting on TAS data.

Abstract: Neutron transport inside the reflector tank of the new Brazilian nuclear reactor, called the RMB (Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor), is investigated using the stochastic Monte Carlo method. One of the main characteristics of research nuclear reactors is the core power density, which is proportional to the neutron flux generated in the fission reaction. The RMB is part of the new generation of multipurpose reactors, and studying neutron transport is essential for the project to meet its objectives of producing radioisotopes, irradiating materials, and generating neutron beams for scientific investigations. The neutron moderation process in the reflector tank is very well described by Maxwellian distributions, which provide temperatures ranging from T = 331.5 K in the core to T = 266.8 K in the peripheral regions. The relative proportions reveal the predominance (52%) of epithermal neutrons in the reactor core, followed by thermal (29%) and fast (19%) neutrons. The moderation process proves to be effective, considering that 100% of the neutrons fall within the thermal spectrum near the reflector tank wall. The fits using Maxwellian distributions reveal another effect of neutron moderation, a shift in the peak wavelength from 1.07 Å to 1.19 Å. The same effect is observed along the tube that supplies a neutron beam to the RMB imaging instrument, with $λ_{peak}$ = 1.18 Å increasing to $λ_{peak}$ = 1.21 Å.
