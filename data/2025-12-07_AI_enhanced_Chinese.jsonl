In 1D arrays, the frequency variation tolerance decreases inversely proportional to the square root of the element number. In 2D arrays, as the number of columns is increased while keeping the number of elements per column constant, the frequency variation tolerance increases for small number of columns, reaches a maximum at square configuration, and then decreases with increasing number of columns. The element-number dependence in 2D arrays is smaller than that in 1D arrays.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We first suggest a generalized nonlinear stimulated Raman exact passage (STIREP) technique for the coherent conversion of ultracold atoms to tetraatomic molecules, which is subsequently followed by a chainwise-STIREP technique to transfer the resulting molecules into a sufficiently stable ground state.

These have attracted significant interest for the role they play in the device microelectronic operation and for quantum information applications. Andreev physics has so far been synonymous with the microwave range. However, the maturation of superconductor--semiconductor hybrid junctions opens the door to the characterization, and manipulation, of Andreev states by light. Here we introduce a model for light--Andreev interaction, with distinct features: Electrons transitioning into Andreev levels can sidestep Pauli exclusion, resulting in two optical absorption resonances separated by twice the bound state energy. One resonance populates the Andreev state and the other empties it; pumping both resets the junction and prevents saturation. Given their natural microwave coupling, we show how Andreev bound states can operate as optical--to--microwave transducers. We illustrate these effects with realistic device parameters.

At the Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC), high-performance calorimetry is essential for exploring the internal structure of nucleons and studying the dynamics of quarks and gluons within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper presents the optimized design and performance simulation of the EicC ECAL system. The ECAL consists of three specialized sections tailored to distinct detection environments: (1) an electron-Endcap employing high-resolution pure Cesium Iodide (pCsI) crystals, (2) a central barrel, and (3) an ion-Endcap, both adopting a cost-effective Shashlik-style sampling calorimeter with improved light yield. Each segment's geometry and material composition have been systematically optimized through Geant4 simulations to achieve excellent energy and position resolutions as well as strong electron-pion discrimination. The simulated performance indicates that the ECAL can achieve energy resolutions of 2 percent divided by sqrt(E) for pCsI crystals and 5 percent divided by sqrt(E) for Shashlik modules, meeting the design goals of the EicC detector.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Most of such gyroscopes rely on electrostatic actuators with nanometer-scale air gaps$\\unicode{x2013}$an architecture that enables large particle velocities in a proof mass and, consequently, high Coriolis-force sensitivity to angular velocity$\\unicode{x2013}$but is inherently susceptible to damage under shock and vibration. This vulnerability is typically mitigated by purposely reducing gyroscopic sensitivity, thereby compromising readout accuracy. Microacoustic gyroscopes, by contrast, offer greater resilience to shock and vibration but currently exhibit significantly lower sensitivities. This limitation stems from the low dynamic compliance of the modes they employ$\\unicode{x2013}$typically Lamb or Rayleigh modes$\\unicode{x2013}$which restricts their maximum achievable particle velocity. This work presents a piezoelectric microacoustic device that overcomes this fundamental constraint by harnessing a topological interface state at the boundary between two microscale metamaterial structures. We theoretically and experimentally show that this state exhibits much higher modal compliance than Lamb or Rayleigh modes. This enables record-high particle velocities (>51 m/s) never reached, due to material limits, by any previously demonstrated piezoelectric gyroscope.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5fae\u7535\u58f0\u5f0f\u9640\u87ba\u4eea\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u63a5\u53e3\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u5fae\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u7ed3\u6784\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u521a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u7c92\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fbe51 m/s\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7535\u58f0\u9640\u87ba\u4eea\u9ad8\u5f97\u591a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u53bb\uff0c\u5fae\u578b\u7535\u58f0\u9640\u87ba\u4eea\u56e0\u6297\u632f\u6027\u80fd\u597d\u4f46\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4f4e\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u6297\u632f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u6765\u8bfb\u6570\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5c31\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u5fae\u7535\u58f0\u5f0f\u9640\u87ba\u4eea\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5236\u9020\u4e24\u79cd\u5fae\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u754c\u9762\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u63a5\u53e3\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u5fae\u7535\u58f0\u5f0f\u9640\u87ba\u4eea\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u6a21\u6001\u521a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe51 m/s\u7684\u5fae\u7c92\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u4efb\u4f55\u4e00\u79cd\u7535\u58f0\u9640\u87ba\u4eea\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u9640\u87ba\u4eea\u5728\u6297\u632f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u5fae\u7535\u58f0\u5f0f\u9640\u87ba\u4eea\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u63a5\u53e3\u72b6\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6297\u632f\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose symmetry-preserving deformations of these models, in the presence of a transverse field, and identify special points along the deformations with interesting features: (i) the special point is frustration-free, (ii) its ground states include a product state and the code space of the underlying code, and (iii) it remains gapped in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit. So the special point realises a first-order transition between (or the coexistence of) the trivial gapped phase and the nontrivial gapped phase associated with the code. In addition, if the original model has a non-invertible duality symmetry, then so does the deformed model. In this case, the duality symmetry is spontaneously broken at the special point, consistent with the associated anomaly.\n  A key step in proving the gap is a coarse-graining/blocking procedure on the Tanner graph of the code that allows us to apply the martingale method successfully. Our model, therefore, provides the first application of the martingale method to a frustration-free model, that is not commuting projector, defined on an arbitrary Tanner graph.\n  We also discuss several familiar examples on Euclidean spatial lattice. Of particular interest is the 2+1d transverse field Ising model: while there is no non-invertible duality symmetry in this case, our results, together with known numerical results, suggest the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram.", "AI": {"tldr": "LDPC \u7801\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6a2a\u573a\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u70b9\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301gap\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u7a77\u5927\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u70b9\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u975e\u53ef\u9006\u5bf9\u5076\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u90a3\u53d8\u5f62\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u62e5\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u70b9\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u88ab\u663e\u5f0f\u6253\u7834\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5411\u4e0b\u7c97\u5316/\u5206\u5757\u5728 Tanner \u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u9785\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f Tanner \u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u6295\u5f71\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u4ea4\u53c9\u9886\u57df\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LDPC\u7801\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6a2a\u573a\u65f6\u7684\u65b0\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u53d8\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u5076\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548cgap\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u6d89\u53caLDPC\u7801\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u884c\u53d8\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9785\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660egap\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728Yang-Baxter\u4ee3\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u4e2d\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u65e0\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5e94\u7528\u9785\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4Ising\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4e09\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5173\u4e8eLDPC\u7801\u5728\u6a2a\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5bf9\u5076\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e09\u7ef4Ising\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

The algorithm is similar to phase retrieval algorithms which transform signals back and forth between the signal domain and the Fourier domain and apply constraints to retrieve the missing phase.

In conventional lattice surgery compilation schemes, logical circuits are compiled following a place-and-route paradigm, where logical qubits remain statically fixed in space throughout the computation. In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by exploiting movable logical qubits via teleportation during the logical lattice surgery CNOT gate. Focusing on lattice surgery with the color code, we propose a proof-of-concept compilation scheme that leverages this capability. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach can substantially reduce the routed circuit depth compared to standard place-and-route compilation techniques. Our results demonstrate that optimizations based on movable logical qubits are not limited to architectures with physically movable qubits, such as neutral atoms or trapped ions - they are also readily applicable to superconducting quantum hardware.

Among various approaches, parametric frequency mixing processes such as four-wave mixing (FWM) offer a promising pathway toward efficient and low-noise transduction. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of coherent quantum state transfer by indirectly verifying high-fidelity wavefunction's phase mapping (>99%) from the input field to the generated output field wave. Using a gas-filled hollow-core capillary fiber, we systematically investigate spectral phase evolution across a broad range, including infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) transitions, as well as conversions from telecom-band (1550 nm) to visible (516 nm) and deep-UV (308 nm) wavelengths. Our results reveal that strong phase coherence can be maintained throughout these diverse conversion regimes. Because quantum properties such as coherence and entanglement are intrinsically encoded in both the amplitude and phase of a photonic wavefunction, preserving spectral phase is essential for faithful quantum information transfer. We further show that efficient and phase-preserving transduction can be achieved by tuning system parameters, offering valuable insights into nonlinear coupling dynamics. These findings establish a promising foundation for advancing FWM-based quantum transduction schemes and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous quantum systems across wide spectral domains within future quantum communication networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We utilize a steady-state analytical model based on the continuity equation in phase space to estimate the population in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The normalization of this model is linked to the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation describing stellar relaxation. Adopting a conservative one-year observation baseline ($P>1$ year), we estimate the steady-state population of popcorn EMRIs. We forecast an observable burst rate of 5 to 44 events per year. The low duty cycle ($\\sim 10^{-4}$) confirms their manifestation as isolated transients. Individual bursts from the Galactic Centre exhibit high detectability. Analyzing these intrinsically transient signals demands a rigorous mathematical framework, as standard windowing techniques distort burst morphology.

This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems.

In this work, we show that qualitatively new features arise when an in-plane magnetic field is applied to a 3D Weyl semimetal in the quantum Hall regime. An unexpected Hall quantum oscillation, distinct from the Weyl-orbit oscillation, coexists with the QHE, along with an unquantized two-terminal magnetoresistance. Moreover, unconventional antichiral transmission enables a peculiar disorder-robust negative longitudinal resistance.

Single Differential Cross Sections (SDCS) were calculated for incident energies of 100, 150, 200, and 250 eV. The data obtained indicated a peak in the ionization rates approximately at 200 eV, with the ionization rate decreasing as the incident energy increased further. The diffuse radial nature of the 3s wave function is shown to increase the sensitivity of the ionization dynamics to the incident particle energy. Asymmetries in charge were also detected; specifically, at low energy of the ejected electron, the SDCS values for positrons were greater than the corresponding values for electrons; however, as the energy of the incident particles was increased, these differences disappeared, thereby demonstrating the applicability of the FBA at high energy limits. The residual differences at low energy were due to the omission of exchange and post-collision interactions from the model.

Unfortunately, each switch is costly-adding time and space overhead and increasing the logical error rate. Minimizing the number of switching operations is, therefore, essential for quantum computations using code switching. In this work, we study the problem of minimizing the number of code switches required to run a given quantum circuit.

These techniques typically require high optical intensities to increase the strength of the nonlinear interactions, which can perturb native biochemistry and damage or kill living samples. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy visualizes the spatial distribution of molecules using a nonlinear interaction between light and chemically specific molecular vibrations. However, the detection of biomolecules at low concentrations is limited by the total photon dose that can be applied before photodamage alters the sample, and photon shot noise sets the minimum achievable noise floor for most microscopes. Here we demonstrate a cavity-enhanced SRS microscope that is more sensitive than an equivalent conventional SRS microscope by up to 8.3(7) dB in spectroscopy and 8.6(1) dB in cell imaging.

The reason for this lies not only in the unique nature of these extremely thin samples, but also in the different experimental configurations and data processing methods used. Moreover, since this type of spectroscopy was originally used to characterize the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carriers in chemical compounds, colloidal nanostructures and gas molecules, a purely 'molecular' approach to interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors is often proposed. However, this approach is fundamentally inapplicable to thin-film semiconductors grown or mechanically exfoliated on transparent substrates. This review considers the recent experimental results of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of 2D semiconductors in a wide spectral range from several THz to UV (~1000 THz) based on the 'solid-state' approach to their interpretation.

Spin-polarized DFT calculations on 240 bimetallic clusters reveal systematic trends in binding and formation energies, distortion penalties, effective coordination number, d-band centre, and HOMO-LUMO gap that govern the competition between core-shell (in) and surface-segregated (out) arrangements. We then pretrain a transformer architecture on a curated set of 2968 unary clusters from the Quantum Cluster Database and fine-tune it on bimetallic data to predict formation energies and in/out preference, achieving mean absolute errors of about $0.6-0.7$eV and calibrated uncertainty intervals.

Our architecture, which we call QGATE, is tailored for discrete-variable photonic quantum computers with deterministic photon sources capable of generating 1D entangled photonic states. QGATE achieves universal quantum computing on a logical data qubit register via the implementation of Clifford operations, QGATE ancilla, and arbitrary angle single-qubit measurements. We realise unitary evolutions defined by multi-qubit Pauli strings via the generation of entanglement between a sub-set of logical qubits and a mutual QGATE ancilla qubit. Measurement of the QGATE ancilla in the appropriate basis then implements a given term of the desired unitary operation. This enables QGATE to both directly perform Hamiltonian evolutions in terms of a series of multi-qubit Pauli operators, in terms of projectors for an arbitrary sparse Hamiltonian, or realise multi-controlled gates enabling direct translation of circuit models to QGATE. We consider examples inspired by quantum chemistry and computational fluid dynamics. We propose an example photonic implementation of QGATE and calculate thresholds of $10.36\\pm0.02\\%$ or $25.98\\pm0.28\\%$ on the photonic loss for logical qubits constructed from foliated rotated surface codes, dependent on the deployment of intra-layer or inter-layer fusion respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784QGATE\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86MBQC\u548c\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u91cf\u5b50\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u4e14\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "QGATE\u67b6\u6784\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) offers a promising non-invasive and stand-off detection technique owing to its ability to penetrate optically opaque materials without causing ionization damage. While many chemicals exhibit distinct spectral features in the terahertz range, conventional terahertz-based detection methods often struggle in real-world environments, where variations in sample geometry, thickness, and packaging can lead to inconsistent spectral responses. In this study, we present a chemical imaging system that integrates THz-TDS with deep learning to enable accurate pixel-level identification and classification of different explosives. Operating in reflection mode and enhanced with plasmonic nanoantenna arrays, our THz-TDS system achieves a peak dynamic range of 96 dB and a detection bandwidth of 4.5 THz, supporting practical, stand-off operation. By analyzing individual time-domain pulses with deep neural networks, the system exhibits strong resilience to environmental variations and sample inconsistencies. Blind testing across eight chemicals, including pharmaceutical excipients and explosive compounds, resulted in an average classification accuracy of 99.42% at the pixel level. Notably, the system maintained an average accuracy of 88.83% when detecting explosives concealed under opaque paper coverings, demonstrating its robust generalization capability.

In particular, the non-commutative structure is controlled by Drinfel'd twists that are built out of symmetry generators that include the scale transformation. To achieve this, we construct a twisted differential calculus that allows us to identify the proper gauge-covariant quantities. We also show that our construction is equivalent to twists where the symmetry generators are implemented as active transformations of fields.

This enhancement is polynomial for Sobolev initial data and super-polynomial, but sub-exponential, for real analytic initial data. We further show that, when the expansion rate is the borderline $t^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ -- the rate which describes a radiation filled universe -- a degenerate phase mixing effect results in a logarithmic enhancement for Sobolev initial data and a super-logarithmic enhancement (in fact, a gain of $\\exp(-\u03bc(\\log t)^\u03b5)$ for some $\u03bc,\u03b5>0$) for analytic initial data.

We calibrate the spectral shifts as a function of fringe spatial location by measuring the incident light spectrum at various points across the fringe pattern, and observe that the spectral peak traces out a `teardrop' shape, whose width is dependent on the spectral bandwidth of the source, the relative tilt and path difference between the two arms of the interferometer, and the divergence of the beam.

A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation. Other order parameters are also examined, and a certain hierarchy among those that belong to different representations of the exact $O(2N)$ is observed.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We show that when the momenta of the middle two operators are spacelike, four-point exchange Wightman functions factorize into a product of three-point functions. This expression coincides with a Wightman conformal partial wave corresponding to the operator dual to the exchanged particle in the bulk. Further, we discuss and explicitly show how these results can be analytically continued to obtain Euclidean AdS correlators up to contact diagrams and avoid the need to perform any nested bulk point integrals in contrast to the traditional Witten diagram approach. We then translate our results to twistor space taking first steps towards a twistor space reformulation of four point Wightman functions. For conformally coupled scalars interacting with a cubic potential, we obtain a beautiful form for four and five point functions. For the interesting case of Yang-Mills theory and Einstein gravity, we derive a simple double copy relation.

To construct the full many-body Hamiltonian, we introduce a linear table formalism, which, to our knowledge, has been rarely used in this context. In ordered rings, the current decreases monotonically with increasing on-site repulsion, while the impact of the extended interaction depends strongly on the filling factor. At low filling, stronger extended interaction suppresses the current, whereas near half-filling, it enhances the current up to a critical ratio, half of the on-site strength, before reducing it. Disorder significantly modifies these behaviors, notably enhancing the current at less than quarter-filling with increasing extended interaction. The localization properties of eigenstates, examined via the inverse participation ratio, further support the crucial roles of filling and the interplay between on-site and extended interactions in governing persistent current.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We show that the shape of the potential energy surfaces can be engineered and controlled by exploiting the sideband transitions of the crystal vibration and dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg ions in the Lamb-Dicke regime. Using the sideband transition, we realize a sloped conical intersection whose cone axis is only tilted along one spatial axis. When the phonon wavepacket is located in the potential minimum of the lower potential surface, the spin and phonon dynamics are largely frozen owing to the geometric phase effect. When starting from the upper potential surface, the electronic and phonon states tunnel to the lower potential surface, leading to a partial revival of the initial state. In contrast, the dynamics drastically change when the initial wavepackets are away from the conical intersection.

We develop machine learning-based wavefront correction algorithms to compensate for observed WFEs, via phase retrieval, resulting in up to a 2/3 reduction in the relative phase error variance. Further, we analyze the excess noise contributions from relative WFEs in the context of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), where our findings suggest that if future CV-QKD implementations employ wavefront correction algorithms similar to those reported here, an order of magnitude increase in secure key rates may be forthcoming.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We demonstrate potentially observable consequences of inflation with a finite initial time in a model in five-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter space, with both a UV and an IR brane present during inflation. Considering an inflaton with an approximately flat potential localized on the UV brane, we derive the resulting brane motion in the bulk and the 4D effective action describing the dynamics. A concrete model allows us to evaluate possible consequences of a starting point of inflation. The background evolution is driven by the fast roll of the radion at early times and the slow roll of the inflaton at late times. We find that the action has the form of a two-field hyperbolic inflation model, the two fields being the radion and the inflaton, both of which have a time-dependent background solution. This setup is holographically dual to an inflaton coupled to a strongly coupled confined sector in which the confinement scale is larger than the Hubble scale, and a confinement scale whose ratio to the 4D Planck scale evolves cosmologically. Focusing on the period when the equation of state becomes that of inflation, we find that the presence of the IR brane leads to deviations from the approximate de Sitter background in addition to those from the slow-roll parameters of the inflaton potential. We quantify the effect of the presence of the IR brane on the two point function of the adiabatic scalar perturbations and tensor perturbations. The dominant deviations occur at large scales: the adiabatic power spectrum has a blue tilt, while the tensor power spectrum shows oscillatory features.

These astrophysical scenarios are expected to introduce novel phenomenology in the scattering of particles and fields. Wormholes are viable candidates for exotic compact objects that can mimic some black hole properties. Hence, it is natural to wonder what would happen if the central astrophysical object were a wormhole, instead of a black hole. We investigate the astrophysical environment effect on the absorption of a massless scalar field by a dirty wormhole surrounded by a thick shell of matter. We study null geodesics around these dirty wormholes and analyze under which conditions new pairs of light rings can appear. The presence of new stable light rings allows new quasibound states in the spacetime, apart from the ones trapped near the throat. Thus, the astrophysical environment can introduce deviations in the absorption bands.

It is based on an extension of Kelly's model, a framework derived from information theory and investment theory, applied here to understand macro-financial and climate dynamics. This approach complements traditional Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) by explicitly linking financial dynamics to cumulative emissions, enabling the assessment of policy alignment (or misalignment) with net-zero pathways. We find that injecting debt into the system increases short-term production gains, but at the expense of higher bankruptcy risk and cumulative emissions. Thus, the model reveals a double constraint: financially, debt requires growth to be repaid; ecologically, growth requires energy, and therefore emissions. When the intrinsic growth rate falls below the interest rate, the probability of solvency drops to zero: the economy enters a zone of structural instability. The model then identifies an optimal leverage frontier: beyond a certain threshold, additional debt no longer fuels real wealth; it only increases the risk of bankruptcy and carbon debt.

Under ambient conditions, the trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 stabilizes in a twinned monoclinic structure with space group P21/c. Upon heating, it undergoes a structural transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at Ts ~ 1030 K, while a second transition associated with the onset of density-weave (DW) ordering emerges upon cooling below TDW ~ 135 K. Here from pressure-temperature x-ray diffraction on high quality flux-grown single crystals we unequivocally demonstrate a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition with no trace of intermediate orthorhombic Bmab phase. Ab initio density-functional theory calculations as a function of pressure fully corroborate the experimental observations. The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure. This is in contrast to Raman measurements that reveal the appearance of additional phonon modes below 130 K, implying a further reduction in symmetry from monoclinic P21/c and thus indicating the presence of a third structural phase associated with the DW ordering in La4Ni3O10.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\uff0cLa4Ni3O10\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u4ece monoclinic P21/c \u7ed3\u6784\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a tetragonal I4/mmm \u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u5219\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7f16\u7ec7\uff08DW\uff09\u6709\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u3002 pressures significantly alter the structural phase transitions in the Ruddlesden-Popper system.", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8d85\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u538b\u53d8\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u8d85\u5bfc\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u538b-\u6e29\u5ea6 X \u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6676\u5706\u4f53\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86 La4Ni3O10 \u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u76f4\u63a5\u7684 tetragonal \u5230 monoclinic \u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u65e0\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f53\u3002\u5728 1030 K \u4ee5\u4e0a\u6709 tetragonal structures\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7f16\u7ec7\u6709\u5e8f\u3002\u9ad8\u538b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u538b-\u6e29\u884c\u4e3a\u63ed\u793a\u4e86 La4Ni3O10 \u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u53d8\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7f16\u7ec7\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

However, the growing diversity of simulation methods and software tools creates a high barrier to selecting the most suitable backend for a given circuit. We introduce Maestro, a unified interface for quantum circuit simulation that integrates multiple simulation paradigms - state vector, MPS, tensor network, stabilizer, GPU-accelerated, and p-block methods - under a single API.

A question of both practical and foundational value is: Given some copies of a state with low coherence, can we prepare a more coherent state via coherence non-increasing operations? Here, we study this question in the minimal limiting case: Given two uncorrelated copies of a coherent state, can one, via globally coherence non-increasing unitaries, increase the coherence in a subsystem? We fully solve this problem for qubits, identifying the optimal unitaries and revealing the existence of bound coherence. This is then used to create a completely constructive multi-qubit coherence enhancement protocol, where only effective-qubit unitaries are used. Unexpectedly, in this protocol, we show that there exists states for which the ratio of the input-output coherence can be amplified unboundedly.

Photonic alternatives offer a promising route, yet the difficulty of realizing optical nonlinearities has prevented the realization of all-optical CNNs capable of end-to-end image classification. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical CNN that bypasses the need for explicit optical nonlinear activations. Our architecture comprises a single spatial-differentiation convolutional stage--using 24 directional kernels spanning 360\u00b0, along with a mean-filtering kernel--followed by a diffractive fully-connected layer. The directional convolution enhances feature selectivity, suppresses noise and crosstalk, and simplifies the classification task, allowing the weak nonlinearity inherent in optical diffraction to achieve high accuracy. We report experimentally classification accuracies of 86.8% on handwritten digits (MNIST) and 94.8% on a ten-class gesture dataset. The system delivers a computational throughput of 1.13X10^5 tera-operations per second (TOPS) and an energy efficiency of 1.51X10^3 TOPS/W--the highest reported among CNN hardware--with the potential to improve by a further 5-6 orders of magnitude using nanosecond-scale detectors.

A key feature of this construction is that a stretched horizon in the static patch, equipped with an emergent UV boundary condition, acts as a gravitating observer.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We demonstrate that an anisotropic and rotated Fermi surface can generate a finite Hall-like transverse response in electron transport, even in the absence of a magnetic field or Berry curvature. Using a two-dimensional continuum model, we show that broken $k_y \\to -k_y$ symmetry inherent to anistropic band structures leads to a nonzero transverse conductivity. We construct a lattice model with direction-dependent nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings that faithfully reproduces the continuum dispersion and allows controlled rotation of the Fermi contour. Employing a multiterminal geometry and the B\u00fcttiker-probe method, we compute the resulting Hall voltage and establish its direct correspondence with the continuum transverse response.

In our work, we have used VQE to identify the phase transition boundary for an infinite order phase transition. We use long-range XXZ (LRXXZ) chain for our study. In order to probe infinite order phase transition, we propose to utilise the ground state energy obtained from VQE. The idea rests on the argument that VQE requires an ansatz circuit; therefore, the accuracy of the VQE will rely on this ansatz circuit. We have designed this circuit such that the estimated ground state energy is sensitive to the phase it is evaluated in. It is achieved by applying the constraint that the net spin remains constant throughout the optimisation process. Consequently, the ansatz works in a certain phase where it gives relatively small random error, as it should, when compared to the error in ground state energy calculations of the other phases, where the ansatz fails. By identifying these changes in the behaviour of the error in ground state energy using VQE, we were able to determine the phase boundaries. Using exact diagonalisation, we also compare the behaviour of the energy gradient and energy gap across both the phase transition boundaries for this model.

Yet, the manifestation of this edge anomaly within the bulk ground-state wavefunction itself remains only partially understood. In this work, we introduce a family of multipartite entanglement measures that probe chirality directly from the bulk wavefunction. Our construction involves applying different permutations between replicas of the ground state wavefunction in neighboring spatial regions, creating \"permutation defects\" at the boundaries between these regions. We provide general arguments for the robustness of these measures and develop a field-theoretical framework to compute them systematically. While the standard topological field theory prescription misses the chiral contribution, our method correctly identifies it as the chiral conformal field theory partition function on high-genus Riemann surfaces. This feature is a consequence of the bulk-edge correspondence, which dictates that any regularization of the theory at the permutation defects must introduce gapless boundary modes. We numerically verify our results with both free-fermion and strongly-interacting chiral topological states and find excellent agreement. Our results enable the extraction of the chiral central charge and the Hall conductance using a finite number of wavefunction replicas, making these quantities accessible to Monte-Carlo numerical techniques and noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Theoretical security proofs assume idealized conditions, practical certification must contend with adaptive adversaries who optimize their attack strategies against detection systems. Established fundamental adversarial limits for quantum certification using Eve GAN, a generative adversarial network trained to produce classical correlations indistinguishable from quantum. Our central finding: when Eve interpolates her classical correlations with quantum data at mixing parameter, all tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50, equivalent to random guessing. This means an eavesdropper needs only 5% classical admixture to completely evade detection. Critically, we discover that same distribution calibration a common practice in prior certification studies inflates detection performance by 44 percentage points compared to proper cross distribution evaluation, revealing a systematic flaw that may have led to overestimated security claims. Analysis of Popescu Rohrlich (PR Box) regime identifies a sharp phase transition at CHSH S = 2.05: below this value, no statistical method distinguishes classical from quantum correlations; above it, detection probability increases monotonically. Hardware validation on IBM Quantum demonstrates that Eve-GAN achieves CHSH = 2.736, remarkably exceeding real quantum hardware performance (CHSH = 2.691), illustrating that classical adversaries can outperform noisy quantum systems on standard certification metrics. These results have immediate implications for QKD security: adversaries maintaining 95% quantum fidelity evade all tested detection methods.

Yet most existing hybrid designs omit realistic finite-key effects on QKD key rates and do not specify how to maintain security when both QKD and PQC primitives leak information through side-channels. These gaps limit the applicability of hybrid systems in practical, deployed networks. In this work, we advance a recently proposed hybrid QKD-PQC system by integrating tight finite-key security to the QKD primitive and improving the design for better scalability. This hybrid system employs an information-theoretically secure instruction sequence that determines the configurations of different primitives and thus ensures message confidentiality even when both the QKD and the PQC primitives are compromised. The novelty in our work lies in the implementation of the tightest finite-key security to date for the BBM92 protocol and the design improvements in the primitives of the hybrid system that ensure the processing time scales linearly with the size of secret instructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\uff08QKD\uff09\u548c\u540e\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u7801\uff08PQC\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\u548c\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6211\u4eec\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5728BBM92\u534f\u8bae\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5bc6\u94a5\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f7f\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u5bc6\u94a5\u957f\u5ea6\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u7ec8\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5bc6\u94a5\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6df7\u5408QKD-PQC\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Three-dimensional waveguide crossings, which distribute optical pathways across multiple planes, can achieve near-zero crosstalk and extremely low crossing-induced loss. However, they face an intrinsic trade-off between interlayer crossing performance and coupling efficiency. To address this challenge, we developed a low-cost fabrication method for 3D waveguide crossings by exploiting the edge rounding effect inherent to chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Using this method, we demonstrate waveguide crossings with average loss below 0.002 dB and crosstalk below -62 dB on Ta2O5-on-LNOI integrated photonic platform. Our method maintains full compatibility with conventional semiconductor manufacturing technology and paves the way for realizing VLSPI on the thin-film lithium niobate platform.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The geometry of these surfaces depends sensitively on the ratio $\u03b7= A/C$, the quotient of the conformal charges characterizing the underlying CFT. We then fully integrate the conformal anomaly near the singularity for a generic Kasner-type metric and obtain the corresponding stress-energy tensor. Its components are expressed in terms of three symmetric polynomials (of degrees $2$, $3$ and $4$) and depend on seven arbitrary constants, which may be interpreted as parameterizing different choices of the quantum state at the singularity. By imposing a set of constraints we reduce this parameter space to a single free constant. Subsequently, we solve, at leading order near the singularity, the modified gravitational equations.

We here develop a general theory to control an arbitrary number of bosonic modes governed by the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. It takes advantage of the gauge potential in the instantaneous frame rather than the energy spectrum of Hamiltonian. In particular, the dynamics of a general non-Hermitian continuous-variable system is analyzed in the instantaneous frame associated with time-dependent ancillary operators that are superpositions of the laboratory-frame operators and irrelevant to the original Hamiltonian. The gauge potential is determined by the unitary transformation between the time-dependent and stationary ancillary frames. The upper triangularization condition for the Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the stationary ancillary frame enables two of the time-dependent ancillary operators to be nonadiabatic Heisenberg passages of the non-Hermitian system. The probability conservation of the system wavefunction can be restored at the end of these passages without artificial normalization. Our theory is exemplified with the perfect and nonreciprocal state transfers in a cavity magnonic system. The former holds for arbitrary initial states and is irrelevant to the parity-time symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the exceptional point of the spectra; and the latter is consistent with the unidirectional perfect absorbtion.

We develop direct methods to compute matrix elements of the $N$-operator, which we refer to as Magnus amplitudes, bypassing scattering amplitudes entirely. At tree level, Magnus amplitudes are expressed in terms of retarded and advanced propagators, with each diagram weighted by factors that we identify as Murua coefficients. At loop level this structure is augmented by the Hadamard cut function, and we establish remarkable relations between loop- and tree-level Magnus amplitudes. Among these, we find that $n$-point one-loop Magnus amplitudes are entirely determined by phase-space integrals of forward limits of $(n{+}2)$-point tree-level amplitudes, and hence related to Murua coefficients, and we generalise this to a class of higher-loop contributions. Furthermore, in the case of heavy particles interacting via massless mediators, we conjecture that Magnus diagrams that contribute to the classical limit are always given by forward limits of trees, and we show this explicitly in a one-loop example. We derive these results studying theories of scalar fields with cubic interactions, but our methods are applicable to general theories as well as to integral functions appearing in gravitational-wave computations.

Using a fluctuation electrodynamics framework combined with full-wave numerical simulations, we quantify the near-field radiative heat transfer between such elliptically perforated plates as a function of ellipse orientation, aspect ratio, and separation distance. The results reveal that elliptical perforations enable enhanced spectral and directional control of evanescent mode coupling and surface polariton excitation, leading to significant modulation of the near-field heat flux.

We illustrate our general framework through two example systems: superconductivity and perturbative quantum gravity. In both cases, spontaneously broken symmetries imply the existence of unitarily inequivalent Hilbert spaces that play the role of distinct backgrounds relative to which observables are measured. Background independence can be realized by gauging the broken symmetry; extending the algebra of observables for the theory to include new physical processes that intertwine between these disjoint representations. From the point of view of the background independent theory, different backgrounds have an interpretation as different vacuum expectation values of these intertwining operators. In superconductivity, the intertwiners are intimately related to the Josephson effect. In gravity, they are related to geometric fluctuations. We explain how this framework is connected to recent work on generalized symmetries and algebraic extensions.

Advances in nanofabrication have allowed precise dispersion engineering, unlocking octave-spanning soliton combs that are essential for applications such as optical atomic clocks, frequency synthesis, precision spectroscopy, and astronomical spectrometer calibration. However, a key challenge hindering their practical deployment is the intrinsic bandwidth-efficiency trade-off: achieving broadband soliton generation requires large pump detuning, which suppresses power coupling and limits pump-to-comb conversion efficiencies to only a few percent. Recent efforts using pulsed pumping or coupled-resonator architectures have improved efficiency to several tens of percent, yet their bandwidths remain below one-tenth of an octave, inadequate for applications demanding wide spectral coverage. Here, we overcome this limitation by harnessing mode interactions between spatial modes within a single microresonator. The mode hybridization creates an additional power-transfer channel that supports large pump detuning while maintaining strong pump-to-resonator coupling, enabling broadband soliton formation at substantially reduced pump power. Using this approach, we demonstrate an octave-spanning soliton microcomb with a record pump-to-comb conversion efficiency exceeding 50%. These results resolve the fundamental bandwidth-efficiency dilemma in soliton microcombs and paves the way toward fully-integrated, high-efficiency, ultrabroad comb sources for next-generation photonic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Propagation losses and perturbations in the encoded photons' degrees of freedom, such as polarisation or phase, limit both the QKD range and key rate. The maintenance of phase coherence over optical fibres has lately received considerable attention as it enables QKD over long distances, e.g., through phase-based protocols like Twin-Field (TF) QKD. While optical single mode fibres (SMFs) are the current standard type of fibre, recent hollow core fibres (HCFs) could become a superior alternative in the future. Whereas the co-existence of quantum and classical signals in HCF has already been demonstrated, the phase noise resilience required for phase-based QKD protocols is yet to be established. This work explores the behaviour of HCF with respect to phase noise for the purpose of TF-QKD-like protocols. To achieve this, two experiments are performed. The first, is a set of concurrent measurements on 2 km of HCF and SMF in a double asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer configuration.

Our study focuses on the analysis of the spectra of the post-merger gravitational-wave signals and on how these are affected by the treatment of thermal effects in the two EOS representations. Our simulations highlight distinct differences in the GW frequency evolution related to the thermal modeling of the EOS, demonstrating that deviations from established quasi-universal relations become significant at late post-merger phases. Furthermore, we investigate the stability of the HMNS against convection.

In this work, we propose a classical quantum-inspired strategy for solving combinatorial optimization problems with integer-valued decision variables by encoding decision variables into multi-level quantum states known as qudits. This method results in a reduced number of decision variables compared to binary formulations while inherently incorporating single-association constraints. Efficient classical simulation is enabled by constraining the system to remain in a product state throughout optimization. The qudit states are optimized by applying a sequence of unitary operators that iteratively approximate the dynamics of imaginary time evolution. Unlike previous studies, we propose a gradient-based method of adaptively choosing the Hermitian operators used to generate the state evolution at each optimization step, as a means to improve the convergence properties of the algorithm.

Commensurate driving, where the pulse length is an integer multiple of the drive period, can mitigate errors from residual intra-qubit exchange, including effects from counter rotating terms and off-axis rotations, as well as leakage errors during two-qubit operations. Residual inter-qubit exchange creates crosstalk errors that reduce single-qubit control fidelities. We show that using a single-spin coupler between two resonant singlet-triplet qubits can reduce this crosstalk error by an order of magnitude. Assuming perfect coupler state preparation and realistic charge and hyperfine noise, we predict that coupler-assisted two-qubit gate errors can be below $3\\times10^{-3}$ for gate times as short as $66~\\text{ns}$, even in the presence of residual exchange levels exceeding several hundred kHz.

We experimentally implement a SE protocol using polarisation qubits, achieving uncertainties close to the classical Van Trees bounds. However, comparing the total error to the ultimate quantum Van Trees bound for JE reveals that averaging over prior distributions erases the asymptotic SE advantage.

Unlike conventional approaches requiring the transmission of a number of bits that is exponential in the number of qubits, STT-UEP achieves communication complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of observables, depending on the observable weight. The protocol exploits classical shadow tomography for measurement efficiency, and applies unequal error protection by encoding measurement bases with stronger channel codes than measurement outcomes.

This tutorial-style chapter focuses on the use of classical electromagnetic fields to steer the system dynamics. In this approach, the quantum nature of the control stems solely from the underlying dynamics, through the exploitation of destructive and constructive interference to reach the control target. We first discuss two basic control principles -- coherent control which uses manipulation in frequency or time to design these interferences, and adiabatic following where access to the control target is enabled by tracking the time-dependent ground state. For complex control targets and system dynamics that exceed the scope of these basic principles, optimal control theory provides a powerful suite of tools to design the necessary protocols. A key consideration for the successful application of optimal control theory is a proper choice of the optimization functional. All concepts are illustrated using recent work from my research group, with a focus on controlling atoms and superconducting qubits.

In this work, we propose the Quantum-inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Long Short-Term Memory (QKAN-LSTM), which integrates Data Re-Uploading Activation (DARUAN) modules into the gating structure of LSTMs. Each DARUAN acts as a quantum variational activation function (QVAF), enhancing frequency adaptability and enabling an exponentially enriched spectral representation without multi-qubit entanglement. The resulting architecture preserves quantum-level expressivity while remaining fully executable on classical hardware. Empirical evaluations on three datasets, Damped Simple Harmonic Motion, Bessel Function, and Urban Telecommunication, demonstrate that QKAN-LSTM achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalization with a 79% reduction in trainable parameters compared to classical LSTMs. We extend the framework to the Jiang-Huang-Chen-Goan Network (JHCG Net), which generalizes KAN to encoder-decoder structures, and then further use QKAN to realize the latent KAN, thereby creating a Hybrid QKAN (HQKAN) for hierarchical representation learning.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "We study finite-time driving across second-order dissipative quantum phase transitions described by Lindblad dynamics. We show that the nonadiabatic entropy production, which quantifies deviations from the instantaneous nonequilibrium steady state, exhibits universal power-law scaling with the ramp duration in analogy to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for closed systems. This establishes the universality of irreversible dissipation induced by driving an open quantum system near criticality. Furthermore, in systems described by bosonic Gaussian states, our scaling laws predict that the nonadiabatic entropy production is independent of driving speed to leading order, revealing a distinctive feature of Gaussian dissipative quantum phase transitions. We validate these analytical predictions in the thermodynamic limit of the driven-dissipative Dicke model and via finite-size scaling in the open Kerr model. Our results establish a general framework for understanding universal nonequilibrium response and thermodynamic irreversibility in critical open quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e34\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u65f6\uff0c\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u91cf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u95ed\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u5e42\u5f8b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u8017\u6563\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8017\u6563\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u76f8\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86Lindblad\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7531 OPEN \u9a71\u52a8\u7684 Dicke \u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f00\u5f0f Kerr \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u88ab\u9a71\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u91cf\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u9644\u8fd1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e8e bosonic Gaussian \u72b6\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u91cf\u7684\u65e0\u901f\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u8d28\u88ab\u8bc1\u5b9e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u70ed\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e34\u754c\u73b0\u8c61\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

Quantum transduction, which coherently converts between microwave and optical (M-O) photons, is a critical component of such an architecture. Current approaches are hindered by the unavoidable problem of device heating due to the optical pump. In this work, we propose a pump-free scheme based on color centers that generates time-bin encoded M-O Bell pairs. Our scheme first creates spin-photon entanglement and then converts the spin state into a time-bin-encoded microwave photon using a strongly coupled Purcell-enhanced resonator. In our protocol, the microwave retrieval is heralded by detecting the microwave signal with a three-level transmon. We have analyzed the resulting Bell state fidelity and generation probability of this protocol. Our simulation shows that by combining a state-of-the-art spin-optical interface with our proposed strongly-coupled spin-microwave design, the pump-free scheme can generate M-O Bell pairs at a heralding rate exceeding one kilohertz with near-unity fidelity, which establishes the scheme as a promising source for M-O Bell pairs.", "AI": {"tldr": "A pump-free scheme for generating microwave-optical (M-O) Bell pairs using color centers and time-bin encoding, achieving a heralding rate of >1kHz and near-unity fidelity.", "motivation": "Quantum computing relies on the generation of entangled photon pairs, but conventional methods involve optical pumping which generates waste heat.

We provide an analysis of our scheme based on existing security proofs, allowing the calculation of secret key rates including finite key effects. This enables us to demonstrate, with a realistic single-photon source, positive secret key rates using our scheme over 227 km of optical fiber, equivalent to a loss tolerance one order of magnitude greater than non-decoy schemes.
