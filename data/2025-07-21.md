### [1] [Jordanian spin chains for twisted strings in $AdS_5\times S^5$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13911)
*Sibylle Driezen,Adrien Molines*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses Jordanian deformations of the AdS5×S5 superstring using Drinfel'd twists. It identifies a unique supergravity deformation and develops a general framework for closed spin chains with twists. The Jordanian twist disrupts standard magnon excitation labelling but is mapped using a twisted-boundary approach, leading to a novel method for the spectral problem. Ground state deformations align with classical results, and while higher excited states aren't fully resolved, the framework provides progress toward understanding non-abelian twists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to explore a challenging topic in integrable systems, specifically Jordanian deformations in AdS/CFT. The use of Drinfel'd twists is a sophisticated method, so the motivation is likely to understand these deformations and their implications for the spectrum of the model.

Method: The authors use a spin chain approach, studying twists in both thermodynamic and short-chain limits. They introduce a twisted boundary framework and analyze Q-system asymptotics, offering a new approach to solve the spectral problem despite disruptions to standard methods.

Result: They identify a unique supergravity deformation and successfully map the system with Jordanian twist, showing agreement with classical results in the ground state. Higher excited states remain elusive, and the Q-system analysis is consistent but incomplete.

Conclusion: The work offers partial solutions but paves the way for further studies on non-abelian twists, encouraging more research in this mathematical physics area.

Abstract: We study the integrable spin chain formulation of Jordanian deformations of
the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, realised via Drinfel'd twists. Among these
models, we first identify a unique supergravity deformation confined to an
$SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ sector and with constant dilaton. We then develop a general
framework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit
map to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non
compact $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan
generator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods.
Instead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral
problem based on a residual root generator both in the thermodynamic limit and
for short chains. We find that the ground state is non-trivially deformed, and
is in agreement with the classical string result, while our analysis does not
capture higher-spin excited states. We also study the asymptotics of the
associated $Q$-system, which is well-behaved and compatible with the
boundary-twist. While a full understanding of the spectrum remains open, our
work provides concrete steps toward a spectral description of non-abelian
twisted integrable models.

*Sarang Shah*

Main category: hep-th

Abstract: The $SU(2)$ monopole with a Dirac singularity was constructed in Durcan
(2007) and Cherkis and Durcan (2007). We study its moduli space by identifying
the tangent direction to the moduli space. The tangent vectors to the moduli
space are composed of the monopole's phase and translational zero modes. We
construct the phase and translational zero modes using the Nahm transform.
These zero modes are then used to construct the metric components $g_{00}$ and
$g_{0q}$ of the $SU(2)$ singular monopole moduli space, where $0$ denotes the
gauge coordinate and q denotes the translational coordinates. We find the
moduli space to be the Taub-NUT space. It has been shown by Nakajima (1990) and
Maciocia (1991) that there is an isomorphism between the monopole moduli space
of regular monopoles and the moduli space of the Nahm data used to construct
them. We compute the moduli space of the Nahm data of a singular monopole using
the hyperk\"ahler quotient construction as described in Gibbons and Rychenkova
(1997). We find it to be isometric to the moduli space of the singular
monopole. Finally we make an explicit connection between the moduli space of
the Nahm data and the monopole moduli space using Corrigan's inner product
formula (Osborn 1981) independently proving this isomorphism.

### [3] [From Regular to Irregular: A Unified Origin for Argyres-Douglas Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13434)
*Simone Giacomelli,William Harding,Noppadol Mekareeya,Alessandro Mininno*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 该论文提出可以通过一系列质量变形从一个共同的祖父母理论中获得Argyres-Douglas理论。他们利用了3d镜像对偶中的费 algorithms Euclidean算法，构建了一个递归的星型_quiver，用于描述祖父母理论。此外，通过实际例子说明了这个方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者试图理解如何通过质量变形从一个基础的祖父母理论中生成不同的Argyres-Douglas理论，这在高能物理和弦理论的联系中具有重要意义。

Method: 论文提出的方法基于3d镜像对偶和Euclidean算法，利用费 FI形变构建星型_quiver，作为祖父母理论的基础结构。

Result: 结果展示了通过这种方法获得的Argyres-Douglas理论的结构和关系，并通过具体的例子进行了验证。

Conclusion: 结论表明这种方法为从4d场论中构建更高阶理论提供了一种系统且可操作的途径，有助于深入理解这些理论的起源和相互关系。

Abstract: We propose that Argyres-Douglas theories of type $D_p(\mathrm{SU}(N))$ and
$(A_{p-1}, A_{N-1})$ - both realizable as Type A class $\mathcal{S}$ theories
with irregular punctures - can be obtained via a sequence of mass deformations
from a common ancestor: a class $\mathcal{S}$ theory with only regular
punctures. Building on our previous work, this result establishes that these
theories ultimately originate from 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ orbi-instanton
theories compactified on a torus. The requisite 4d mass deformations are
realized as tractable Fayet-Iliopoulos deformations on the 3d mirror quiver.
The core of our method is a constructive procedure that utilizes the Euclidean
algorithm to define a chain of deformations connecting different
$D_p(\mathrm{SU}(N))$ theories. By reversing this chain, we recursively build a
"parent" star-shaped quiver for any given $(N,p)$. This quiver is the 3d mirror
theory of the required class $\mathcal{S}$ ancestor. We substantiate our
general claims with several detailed examples that explicitly illustrate the
deformation procedure.

*Sebastián Bahamondes,Ignacio Salazar Landea,Rodrigo Soto-Garrido*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究论文提出了一个二维相 newArray的强相关物态系统，通过AdS/CFT holography发现半Dirac临界区的热相变，并模定了粘度系数η。引入旋转对称性破坏后，发现η/s 比值打破了KSS边界，在低温下η/s与温度呈单调关系，由Lifshitz动态临界指数调节。Lifshitz指数在非对称方向约为2。还发现温度为零时通过量子相变分立的热临界相区，之前低温临界相区源于零温度的量子相变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究物态相变和量子临界现象，利用AdS/CFT holography方法分析材料系统。

Method: 在二维相变系统中引入旋转对称性破坏，通过AdS/CFT bulk方程求解得到边界系统的Transport系数，计算了粘度系数η。通过参数空间的量子相变分析低温和无温度下的物理量行为，引入Lifshitz动态指数来描述异向临界指数。探索温度与不同参数间的相变关系。

Result: 半Dirac临界区出现了KSS边界破坏，η/s比值在低温下不依赖温度进化。通过调整系统参数，找到了零温度下的相变点，并解释了高低温相区分立的现象。Lifshitz指数约为2，在非对称方向上表现出单调依存关系。结论是低温下物态相变来自零温度的量子相变。

Conclusion: 该二维材料系统展示了半Dirac临界区的热相变及其与量子相变的联系，证实了KSS边界破坏的存在，并通过Lifshitz指数分析了物态相变的温度依赖性。结果显示η/s比值在不同温度下的行为特性，并揭示了系统低维结构下的新相变机制。

Abstract: We present a version of a strongly correlated 2+1-dimensional condensed
matter system that features a thermal phase transition between a semimetal and
an insulator through a semi-Dirac quantum critical region using AdS/CFT
holography. We introduce backreaction into the bulk equations of motion to
measure transport coefficients in the boundary; specifically the shear
viscosity $\eta$. By explicitly breaking rotational symmetry we find a new
instance of violation of the KSS-bound for the $\eta/s$ ratio in the quantum
critical region, as well as a monotone dependence on temperature in the $T\to
0$ regime fixed by a Lifshitz dynamical critical exponent. We find that the
Lifshitz critical exponent in the anisotropic direction is approximately equal
to $2$ for our choice of backreaction parameters. We find explicit $T=0$
solutions separated by a quantum critical point in parameter space, showing
that the thermal critical phase found in previous work comes from a quantum
phase transition at zero temperature.

*Antonino Flachi,Takahiro Tanaka*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the potential to observe quantum droplets in microgravity, which could have implications for quantum physics and gravity theories.

Method: The researchers likely used computational models or simulations to analyze quantum systems in curved spacetime, particularly in 2D.

Result: They discovered curvature-driven quantum effects leading to quasi-stable droplets, suggesting experiments could observe these droplets.

Conclusion: Curvature plays a significant role in quantum droplet formation, offering new experimental opportunities in microgravity settings.

### [6] [Gravity and the Higgs boson mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13832)
*Carlo Branchina,Vincenzo Branchina,Filippo Contino,Riccardo Gandolfo,Arcangelo Pernace*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究中发现标量粒子的质量平方在平移和曲率时空中的二次相关性，在普通计算中会被UV物理切-off参数Λ二次依赖，但在本研究中发现，通过路径积分测度和Λ引入的方式，标量场在一阶有效作用中发现质量平方只对Λ有轻微的对数依赖。这在无需超对称嵌入或正则化方案（如维度或ζ函数正则化，后者在这些方案中没有幂次级数发散）的情况下得出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该 pager研究了在量子场论中，标量粒子的质量平方在不同时空背景下的量纲敏感性，尤其是与UV物理切-off参数Λ之间的关系。通过传统计算，二次依赖关系存在，但在本研究中，通过特定位移积分测度和Λ引入的方式，结果显示出轻微的对数依赖关系，这对于理解量子有效作用在一般引力背景下是重要的。

Method: 作者通过研究路径积分测度和Λ的引入方式，计算了一阶有效作用Γ^{1l}，特别是在非平凡引力背景中。望远镜计算表明，质量平方m²显示出轻微的对数依赖，而不是二次依赖。主要使用的数学工具是微扰理论和量子场理论中的积分技术。

Result: 通过路径积分测度和Λ的引入方式，标量场的有效作用 Γ^{1l} 表明，质量平方m² 的双重量纲敏感性被消除，转而呈现轻微的对数依赖关系。这表明质量平方对Λ的依赖性随着对数增长，而不是二次增长。

Conclusion: 这一发现提供了一种理解在一般引力背景下量子有效作用如何处理UV物理切-off的机制。质量平方的轻微对数依赖性可能提示在构造拟微分理论时考虑轻微对数发散的可能性。这为理论物理中的量纲处理问题提供了一个新的观点。

Abstract: According to usual calculations in quantum field theory, both in flat and
curved spacetime, the mass $m^2$ of a scalar particle is quadratically
sensitive to the ultimate scale of the theory, the UV physical cutoff
$\Lambda$. In the present work, paying attention to the path integral measure
and to the way $\Lambda$ is introduced, we calculate the one-loop effective
action $\Gamma^{1l}$ for a scalar field on a non-trivial gravitational
background. We find that $m^2$ presents only a (mild) logarithmic sensitivity
to $\Lambda$. This is obtained without resorting to a supersymmetric embedding
of the theory, nor to regularization schemes (as dimensional or zeta-function
regularization) where power-like divergences are absent by construction. In
view of the results of the present work, we finally speculate on the way the
Minkowski limit should be approached.

### [7] [Probing the singularity at the holographic screen via $q$-holography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13873)
*Andreas Belaey,Thomas G. Mertens,Jacopo Papalini*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Abstract discusses the emergence of q-deformed spacetime in a lower-dimensional gravitational system, focusing on 2D sinh dilaton gravity. They analyze the two-point correlator and suggest that q-deformed holographic duality persists when considering sine dilaton gravity instead of sinh dilaton gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research seems to aim at understanding quantum spacetime and holographic principles by studying specific gravitational models and their dual conformal field theories.

Method: They use 2D sinh dilaton gravity as a model system, derive classical metric solutions, and analyze probe behavior near the boundary, particularly looking at curvature singularities and correlators. They compare their setup with DSSYK model to conjecture the persistence of q-deformed structures in related gravitational theories.

Result: The analysis shows that near the boundary, q-deformed spacetime elements emerge, particularly in the two-point correlator. The use of DSSYK model as a comparison suggests that the duality holds under different gravitational models, such as sine dilaton instead of sinh dilaton gravity.

Conclusion: The study contributes to the understanding of q-deformed spacetime structures in asymptotically deformed gravitational systems and provides evidence for q-deformed holographic correspondences in lower-dimensional models, with implications for quantum gravity and holography.

Abstract: We study the emergence of $q$-deformed spacetime in a lower-dimensional
gravitational system whose asymptotic region geometrizes the global symmetry of
a $q$-deformed CFT. More precisely, we consider the 2d sinh dilaton gravity
model, whose classical metric solutions exhibit a curvature singularity at the
holographic boundary. Our aim is to probe this UV near-boundary regime by
injecting a small probe into the bulk, and identifying the geometrical features
it observes. At the level of the two-point correlator, we see the emergence of
$q$-deformed hyperbolic disk isometries. By formulating DSSYK in terms of the
analogous sine dilaton gravity model, we expect this $q$-deformed holographic
duality to persist.

Abstract: We consider a class of spontaneously broken $SU(2)$ gauge theories with
adjoint scalar and look for exact magnetic monopole solutions in the
Bogomol'nyi--Prasad--Sommerfield (BPS) limit. We find that some of the
resulting solutions exhibit a new internal degree of freedom (a moduli space
parameter) that controls the energy density profile of the monopole while
keeping the total energy (mass) constant.

Conclusion: 量子态在一般时空中的演化需要根据具体时空动态来定义合适的演 化条件。这不仅有助于解决量子场论在动态几何中的应用问题，还为理解宇宙波函数和 Wheeler-DeWitt 方程提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Description of evolution between spatial slices in a general spacetime
suffers from a significant difficulty: the states on the slices, in a given
basis, are not related by a unitary transformation. This problem, which occurs
in spacetime dimensions above two, is directly related to the infinite number
of inequivalent representations of the canonical commutators, and in particular
will arise for interacting theories in time-dependent spacetimes. We connect
different facets of this issue, and discuss its possible resolution. It is
directly related to discussions of failure of a standard Schr\"odinger picture
of evolution, and of evolution via "many-fingered time." One requires a
condition specifying a physical unitary equivalence class of states; in general
this equivalence class evolves with time, and an important question is how it
is determined. One approach to this in free theories is by imposing a Hadamard
condition on the two point function. We explore a different approach, which
also may be helpful for interacting theories, analyzing the structure of the
state in a local limit, and relate these approaches. We also elucidate the
non-Hadamard behavior of unphysical vacua, and discuss concrete examples of
these approaches involving cosmological and black hole evolution. The issues
are extended in the context of quantum dynamical geometry, and raise important
questions for the proper description of the wavefunction of the universe and
for the role of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation.

### [10] [Near-extremal quantum cross-section for charged fields and superradiance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13896)
*Panos Betzios,Olga Papadoulaki,Yanjun Zhou*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper investigates the scattering and absorption properties of charged scalar fields around a near-extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole. They find that quantum effects enhance the reflection coefficient in the superradiant regime and suppress it otherwise. The absorption cross-section increases in both regimes. Kinks in plots occur due to these quantum effects stopping certain processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the quantum behavior of fields near extremal black holes is crucial for exploring quantum gravity and phenomena like superradiance. This paper provides insights into scattering and absorption properties, which are fundamental to black hole physics and testing gravitational theories.

Method: The authors use effective action methods, focusing on the one-dimensional Schwarzian action to model quantum fluctuations. They analyze both superradiant and non-superradiant regimes to determine reflection and absorption coefficients.

Result: The study reveals that quantum effects significantly modify the reflection and absorption characteristics, leading to enhanced reflection in the superradiant regime and increased absorption in all regimes. Kinks appear in the plots due to quantum effects ceasing certain processes.

Conclusion: This research contributes to our understanding of quantum fields near extremal black holes, highlighting the role of quantum fluctuations in phenomena like superradiance and absorption, which are vital for theoretical physics and black hole thermodynamics.

Abstract: We study the scattering and absorption properties of charged scalar fields on
a near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole background. We show that in
this low-temperature regime the near-horizon throat experiences large quantum
fluctuations, whose leading contribution is described by the one dimensional
Schwarzian effective action, while the soft $U(1)$ gauge modes can only
contribute to subleading order. We investigate the role of the leading quantum
effects both inside and outside the superradiant regime. These effects result
in an enhanced reflection coefficient within the superradiant regime, while
causing a suppression in the non-superradiant regime. On the other hand, the
absorption cross-section increases in both regimes. Additional physical
features appear as kinks in the reflection coefficient and absorption
cross-section plots, corresponding to the shutdown of absorption in the
superradiant regime and of stimulated emission in the non-superradiant regime.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该摘要涉及杨米尔斯和引力的MHV振幅构建，这在理论物理中是一个重要的课题。研究者通过递归关系和spanning trees的组合，为MHV公式提供了一个直接的推导方法，这对于深入理解量子引力和规范理论的基础结构具有重要意义。

Method: 引入了贝尔斯-吉列斯 Current递归关系和spanning trees作为解决方案，计算了所有的Plus和减一Plus当前，然后将其应用于MHV振幅的显式构建。

Result: 显式表达式被用来证明MHV振幅，特别是引力的MHV振幅。

Conclusion: 研究者成功从引力和规范理论的Feynman规则出发，得到了MHV振幅的显式公式。这说明了这些规则的深层结构及其对振幅计算的指导作用。

Abstract: Berends and Giele derived the Parke-Taylor formula for Yang-Mills MHV
amplitudes by computing Berends-Giele currents involving gluons of all-plus and
all-but-one-plus helicities. Remarkably, the all-plus current already encodes
much of the Parke-Taylor formula structure. The all-but-one-plus current
satisfies a more intricate recursion relation than the all-plus case, but one
that can still be solved explicitly. This current turns out to be proportional
to the all-plus current, which explains why the essential features of the MHV
formula are already present at the all-plus level.
  In this paper, we carry out an analogous program for gravity. The all-plus
graviton Berends-Giele current satisfies a recursion relation that is more
involved than in the Yang-Mills case, but whose explicit solution is known: a
sum over spanning trees of the complete graph on n vertices. We derive and
solve the recursion relation for the all-but-one-plus graviton current. The
solution is again given by a sum over spanning trees, where each tree
contributes a term proportional to the corresponding all-plus current,
multiplied by a factor given by a sum over subtrees. Only a small subset of
these terms contributes to the MHV amplitude, which we recover explicitly. This
provides a direct derivation of the gravity MHV formula from the gravitational
Feynman rules - achieving what Berends, Giele, and Kuijf in their 1987 paper
regarded as "hard to obtain directly from quantum gravity".

both the gauge field and the torsion. We explicitly calculate the gauge-torsion

simultaneously on torsion, curvature, and gauge field.

Motivation: The paper presents a novel method combining AdS×S factorization with Mellin bootstrap to compute higher-point correlators, which is a promising approach for understanding CFTs using AdS/CFT.

Method: AdS×S factorization and Mellin bootstrap are used to compute correlators, handling multiple points and configurations efficiently.

Result: They successfully compute five-point half-BPS and four-point with one superdescendant, unified formulas provided for all cases.

Conclusion: Their method is effective for tree-level multi-point correlator computations, with potential applicability beyond that水平。

Abstract: We propose an AdS$\times$S factorization formula at the level of the
generating function for correlators with arbitrary Kaluza-Klein configurations,
and implement it in the supergravity limit of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills.
By incorporating this mechanism into Mellin space bootstrap, together with an
observed $Z_2$ symmetry under AdS$\ \leftrightarrow\ $S, we manage to
simultaneously work out unified formulas both for all five-point half-BPS
correlators and for all four-point correlators with one superdescendant. This
AdS\times$S bootstrap method is directly applicable to generic multi-point
computation at tree level.

Abstract: Programmable photonic circuits are versatile platforms that route light
through multiple interference paths using reconfigurable optoelectronic
elements to perform complex discrete linear operations. These circuits offer
the potential for high-speed and low-power photonic information processing in
various applications. The mainstream research on programmable photonics has
focused on implementing linear operations on discrete signals encoded in the
modal amplitudes of an array of spatially separated single-mode waveguides.
However, many photonic device applications require simultaneous transformations
in the space-frequency domain, where information is encoded in both the spatial
modes of waveguides and their spectral content. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate linear space-frequency transformations using a $4 \times 4$-port
programmable silicon photonic circuit with an alternating architecture. This
design leverages the limited dispersion of coupled waveguide arrays to enable
linear operations with reconfigurable frequency-dependent matrix elements. We
utilize this device to perform wavelength demultiplexing and filtering. This
architecture platform can pave the way for versatile devices with applications
ranging from wavelength routing to programmable dispersion control.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种经济高效的方法来测量介电常数在整个频率范围内，适用于需要精确频率调节的领域，如电离天线等。

Abstract: Dielectric permittivity, $\varepsilon_r$, of materials are often limited to a
sub-GHz range using normal LCR meters. In the GHz range the $\varepsilon_r$ can
be measured using Vector Network Analyzers and measurement jigs (waveguides)
which are specific for different frequency regimes. Hence, to measure er for
the entire frequency range one needs several components and is an extremely
costly experiment. However, for applications such as Dielectric Resonator
Antennas one need to know the er and the dielectric loss to estimate the
resonant frequency. An indirect method is proposed in this letter to find the
er from Transversely Misaligned Dual-Fiber Optical Trapping at the optical
frequency range to approximately estimate {\epsilon}r and thereby understand
the correlation between these two regimes of frequency responses.

Abstract: Snapshot multi-dimensional imaging offers a promising alternative to
traditional low-dimensional imaging techniques by enabling the simultaneous
capture of spatial, spectral, polarization, and other information in a single
shot for improved imaging speed and acquisition efficiency. However, existing
snapshot multi-dimensional imaging systems are often hindered by their large
size, complexity, and high cost, which constrain their practical applicability.
In this work, we propose a compact lensless diffuser camera for snapshot
multi-dimensional imaging (Diffuser-mCam), which can reconstruct
five-dimensional (5-D) images from a single-shot 2D recording of speckle-like
measurement under incoherent illumination. By employing both the scattering
medium and the space-division multiplexing strategy to extract high-dimensional
optical features, we show that the multi-dimensional data (2D intensity
distribution, spectral, polarization, time) of the desired light field can be
encoded into a snapshot speckle-like pattern via a diffuser, and subsequently
decoded using a compressed sensing algorithm at the sampling rate of 2.5%,
eliminating the need for multi-scanning processes. We further demonstrate that
our method can be flexibly switched between 5D and selectively
reduced-dimensional imaging, providing an efficient way of reducing
computational resource demands. Our work presents a compact, cost-effective,
and versatile framework for snapshot multi-dimensional imaging and opens up new
opportunities for the design of novel imaging systems for applications in areas
such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and autonomous systems.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper introduces advanced methods for optimizing projection patterns in Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (TVAM) under various challenging conditions, such as occlusions and materials with diverse optical properties. The framework developed, Dr.TVAM, preserves material integrity while enabling high-speed production of complex designs, demonstrating successful applications in biomedical and optical engineering areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and accurate 3D printing under diverse and often challenging manufacturing conditions drives the motivation behind this research. The potential applications of TVAM in biomedical and optical fields further emphasize the importance of solving these challenges.

Method: The paper employs a differentiable physically-based ray optical approach to optimize projection patterns for both LaserTVAM and LEDTVAM setups. This method integrates material property considerations and leverages an open-source framework named Dr.TVAM to achieve high-speed and high-quality 3D printing.

Result: The framework outperforms existing solutions in terms of speed, flexibility, and quality, successfully printing complex structures such as gears, perfusion systems, and microlenses while maintaining material integrity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, Dr.TVAM, represents a significant advancement in TVAM technology, enabling efficient and high-quality production under non-ideal conditions through optimized projection patterns and advanced optical modeling. This opens up new possibilities for applications in biomedical devices and optical engineering.

Abstract: Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (TVAM) is a light-based 3D
printing technique capable of producing centimeter-scale objects within
seconds. A key challenge lies in the calculation of projection patterns under
non-standard conditions, such as the presence of occlusions and materials with
diverse optical properties, including varying refractive indices or scattering
surfaces. This work focuses on demonstrating a wide variety of overprinting
scenarios. First, utilizing a telecentric laser-based TVAM (LaserTVAM), we
demonstrate the printing of a microfluidic perfusion system with biocompatible
resins on existing nozzles for potential biomedical applications. In a
subsequent demonstration, embedded spheres within the bio-resins are localized
inside this perfusion system, optimized into specific patterns, and
successfully connected to the nozzles via printed channels in less than three
minutes. As a final LaserTVAM example, we print gears on a glossy metal rod,
taking into account the scattered rays from the rod's surface. Using a
non-telecentric LED-based TVAM (LEDTVAM), we then overprint engravings onto an
existing LED placed in the resin. With an additional printed lens on this LED,
we can project those engravings onto a screen. In a similar application with
the same setup, we print microlenses on a glass tube filled with water,
allowing us to image samples embedded within the glass tubes. Based on a
differentiable physically-based ray optical approach, we are able to optimize
all these scenarios within our existing open-source framework called Dr.TVAM.
This framework enables the optimization of high-quality projections for both
LaserTVAM and LEDTVAM setups within minutes, as well as lower-quality
projections within seconds, outperforming existing solutions in terms of speed,
flexibility, and quality.

*Emiliano Staffoli,Elisabetta Ferri,Stefano Gretter,Lorenzo Pavesi*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper proposes an integrated feed-forward Photonic Neural Network (PNN) with a linear FIR filter and nonlinear square modulus operation to equalize optical communication signals, achieving performance up to 200 km with dispersion compensation and handling up to 450 km with self-phase modulation correction. The design is implemented using a Silicon-On-Insulator device and shows potential for high-speed applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of efficiently equalizing optical communication signals while maintaining low power consumption and minimal latency. With the increasing demand for higher data rates, traditional methods may struggle to keep up, prompting the exploration of advanced neural network-based solutions like PNNs. Additionally, the integration of adaptive components such as tunable dispersion compensation adds flexibility in managing signal distortions across varying transmission conditions.

Method: The method involves designing an integrated PNN that combines a linear Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter with tunable weights and an optical square modulus operation at the photodetector stage to perform nonlinear processing. The system is implemented using an Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection (IMDD) setup with 2-level PAM signals over multiple fiber spans. The linear stage preprocesses the signal to handle distortions, while the nonlinear stage optimizes by removing effects like chromatic dispersion, allowing for extended equalization distances. Tunable components like the Dispersion Compensator enable real-time adjustments based on signal characteristics.

Result: The experimental results show that the PNN can effectively equalize signals with chromatic dispersion up to 200 km and extend the equalization to 450 km when self-phase modulation is addressed without dispersion. Additionally, simulations suggest the potential for the PNN to adapt to even higher data rates, such as 100 Gbps, and to handle cross-phase modulation, indicating scalability for future high-speed optical communication systems. The setup achieved minimal power consumption and negligible latency, positioning it as a low-footprint, high-performance solution for beyond-Gbps networks.

Conclusion: The proposed integrated feed-forward PNN offers a promising approach for equalizing optical communication signals, particularly in challenging propagation conditions. By combining linear and nonlinear processing, tunable components, and fully optical signal processing, the system achieves significant equalization gains and shows potential for application in high-speed, long-distance optical communication networks. It represents a notable advancement in leveraging neural networks for real-time signal processing in optical systems, offering scalability and efficiency for future communication needs.

Abstract: Linear and nonlinear distortions in optical communication signals are
equalized using an integrated feed-forward Photonic Neural Network (PNN). The
PNN is based on a linear stage made of an 8-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR)
filter, featuring tunable amplitude and phase weights at each tap, and of a
nonlinear stage achieved through the square modulus operation at the
end-of-line photodetector. Within an Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection
(IMDD) system, the PNN is applied to 2-level Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM2)
optical signals undergoing multi-span propagation. Each 50 km segment includes
fiber transmission, optical power restoration, and optional chromatic
dispersion compensation via a Tunable Dispersion Compensator. Positioned at the
receiver, the PNN enables fully optical signal processing with minimal latency
and power consumption. Experimental validation is conducted using a
Silicon-On-Insulator device operating on 10 Gbps signals. It demonstrates
chromatic dispersion equalization over distances up to 200 km and self-phase
modulation (with dispersion removed) up to 450 km. Simulations explore PNN
adaptation for 100 Gbps modulations and its potential for cross-phase
modulation equalization.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the synthesis and characterization of colloidal J-aggregate flakes, which are promising for nanophotonic applications due to their surface exciton polaritons at room temperature.

Motivation: The paper addresses the synthesis of a novel material (J-aggregates) for nanophotonic applications, highlighting their advantages such as room temperature surface excitons. It introduces a new colloidal system for these materials, expanding on their potential uses in optical devices and structures.

Method: The authors used electrostatic interaction of cyanine molecules and polyelectrolytes to synthesize colloidal J-aggregate flakes. They employed characterization techniques like transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy to study the structural and optical properties.

Result: Colloidal J-aggregate flakes exhibit colloidal stability and support room temperature surface excitons. Single-particle analysis shows an angular-independent Reststrahlen band with significant scattering contributing to the extinction and photoluminescence shifts. This confirms their viability for advanced photonic applications.

Conclusion: The synthesis and characterization demonstrate a new colloidal system for designing excitonic nanostructures, offering scalable and versatile tools for next-generation photonic technologies. The findings could pave the way for tailored photonic applications in areas like light manipulation and device scalability.

Abstract: J-aggregates are promising organic materials for nanophotonic applications
due to their excitonic properties and ability to support surface exciton
polaritons at room temperature, providing a robust platform for nanoscale light
manipulation. While thin films composed of J-aggregates have demonstrated these
advantages, colloidal J-aggregate nanoparticles remain underexplored. Herein,
we report the synthesis of colloidal J-aggregate flakes by electrostatic
interaction of cyanine molecules (TDBC) and oppositely charged polyelectrolytes
(polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, PDDA). These flakes exhibit colloidal
stability maintaining the J-aggregate conformation even in solvents that
favoured their monomeric state. The characterization of the colloidal
J-aggregate flakes reveals their capability to support surface exciton
polaritons at room temperature. This was further confirmed at single-particle
level by observing an angular-independent Reststrahlen band near the excitonic
resonance. In addition, the colloidal flakes exhibit a strong scattering
component that broadens the extinction band and redshifts the
photoluminescence, indicating that the colloidal architecture influences the
optical response. These findings introduce a versatile colloidal system for
constructing excitonic nanostructures tailored for advanced photonic
applications.

Below 1 K, the CTE is measured to be around 1e-13 K^-1 with a specific value at 655 mK. A theoretical model based on Debye and Einstein models is developed to explain the measurements. This is an important step in improving laser stabilization at very low temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of accurately measuring the thermal expansion coefficient of materials at very low temperatures, which is crucial for various applications including laser stabilization and quantum computing. At such low temperatures, thermal noise becomes significant, so precise measurement techniques are essential to ensure reliable results. This study contributes to the advancement in low-temperature physics and materials science by demonstrating a robust method for obtaining accurate thermal expansion data across a wide temperature range.

Method: The method involves constructing an ultra-stable laser system using a single-crystal silicon Fabry-Perot cavity. The measurements were taken from 655 mK up to 16 K, with particular focus on temperatures below 1 K. The researchers used the Debye and Einstein models to create a theoretical framework to interpret the observed data, which helped in understanding the thermal expansion behavior at these ultra-low temperatures.

Result: The study successfully measured the coefficient of thermal expansion of single-crystal silicon across a range of temperatures from 655 mK to 16 K. Below 1 K, the CTE was found to be consistently around 1e-13 K^-1, with a specific value of α(655 mK) equal to 3.5 ± 0.4 × 10^-13 K^-1. The integration of Debye and Einstein models allowed for an effective approximation of the thermal expansion behavior in the measured temperature range, providing insights into the material's thermal properties at such low temperatures.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that this new measurement technique has achieved a significant milestone by providing the lowest-temperature CTE measurement of silicon. This advancement enhances understanding of thermal expansion at ultra-low temperatures and paves the way for future applications in laser stabilization and potentially other low-temperature sensitive technologies. The theoretical model based on Debye and Einstein models offers a reliable tool for interpreting thermal expansion data in similar studies.

Abstract: In this letter, we report the measurement of the coefficient of thermal

point at $\boldsymbol{\alpha(}655$ mK$ \boldsymbol{)=} 3.5 \pm 0.4 \times
10^{-13}$ K$^{-1}$. We produce a theoretical model based on Debye and Einstein

TL;DR: This paper discusses the use of III-V semiconductor quantum dots in nanopthonic structures for single-photon emission, but the proximity of quantum dots to sidewalls causes linewidth broadening. They designed GaAs photonic crystal nanobeam cavities that increase the quantum dot distance, achieving high quality factors and potential for enhanced radiative rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses an important application of quantum dots in photonic circuits, which is single-photon emission, and identifies a critical limitation with current designs. The motivation is to find a way to maintain or improve single-photon indistinguishability while maximizing the quality of the photonic structures.

Method: The authors designed photonic crystal nanobeam cavities to increase quantum dot distances. They faced challenges with multimode propagation but achieved high-quality factors despite this.

Result: The designed cavities successfully achieved quality factors around 10^3 and potential radiative rate enhancements of 100 times.

Conclusion: By increasing quantum dot distance, the researchers managed to reduce spectral broadening, suggesting promising avenues for on-demand indistinguishable single-photon emission in integrated circuits, despite the complexity of cavity design.

Abstract: Epitaxial III-V semiconductor quantum dots in nanopthonic structures are
promising candidates for implementing on-demand indistinguishable single-photon
emission in integrated quantum photonic circuits. Quantum dot proximity to the
etched sidewalls of hosting nanophotonic structures, however, has been shown to
induce linewidth broadening of excitonic transitions, which limits emitted
single-photon indistinguishability. Here, we design and demonstrate GaAs
photonic crystal nanobeam cavities that maximize quantum dot distances to
etched sidewalls beyond an empirically determined minimum that curtails
spectral broadening. Although such geometric constraint necessarily leads to
multimode propagation in nanobeams, which significantly complicates high
quality factor cavity design, we achieve resonances with quality factors
$Q\approx10^3$, which offer the potential for achieving Purcell radiative rate
enhancements $F_p\approx100$.

*Francois Hénault,Yan Feng,Alain Spang,Laura Schreiber*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper explores static wavefront sensors using reflective prisms with gradient filters, showing they can achieve accurate wavefront measurements comparable to diffraction limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high-resolution wavefront sensors in optical systems, especially in fields like adaptive optics where traditional sensors are insufficient.

Method: Proposing static prism-based WFS, using gradient filters, modeled with mathematical equations, validated with simulations.

Result: Successful demonstration with simulations matching diffraction limits, implying feasible accurate measurements.

Conclusion: Static WFS using prisms can match or exceed traditional methods in accuracy, suitable for high-resolution optical systems.

Abstract: Wavefront sensors (WFS) are now core components in the fields of metrology of
optical systems, biomedical optics and adaptive optics systems for astronomy.
Nowadays, the most popular WFS is the Shack-Hartmann, which is fully static but
suffers from a limited spatial resolution in the pupil plane of the tested
optical system. Higher spatial resolutions are achievable with other types of
sensors, e.g. the pyramid WFS that requires temporal modulation of the recorded
signals and implies high mechanical and electronic complexity. This paper
examines the possibility of performing quantitative wavefront sensing inspired
from the well-known Foucault test and only comprising static, non-modulated
optical components. Here, two candidate designs of static WFS are proposed,
based on a set of reflective prisms. Those prisms may be coated with gradient
density filters. A simplified mathematical model allows for the definition of
the wavefront slopes reconstruction formula and for the calculation of the
wavefront itself. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the wavefront
measurement accuracy is compliant with classical diffraction limit criteria
when using coated prisms. Thus accurate WFE measurements are feasible in that
case.

*I. I. Ryabtsev,I. N. Ashkarin,I. I. Beterov,D. B. Tretyakov,E. A. Yakshina,V. M. Entin,P. Cheinet*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: Three-qubit quantum gates using Rydberg atoms in optical traps require precise control of three-body Förster resonances. This study finds a resonance splitting that allows tuning the interaction strength with electric fields, which is crucial for implementing quantum logic gates accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability to implement quantum gates with high precision is essential for quantum computing. Rydberg atoms in optical traps are promising for this due to their strong interactions. Understanding and controlling Förster resonances is a key step towards achieving such quantum gates.

Method: Theoretical analysis with a focus on three-body Förster resonances in Rb Rydberg atoms. Includes derivation of analytical formulas to describe the resonance splitting depending on the distance between atoms.

Result: The splitting of the Förster resonance decreases with increasing distance between atoms, controlled by the dipole-dipole interaction. This allows for tuning interaction strengths precisely, supporting the design of robust quantum gates.

Conclusion: The findings provide a theoretical foundation for optimizing three-qubit gates using Rydberg atoms by controlling the resonance splitting via electric fields, enhancing the feasibility of quantum computing with these systems.

Abstract: Three-body F\"orster resonances controlled by a dc electric field are of
interest for the implementation of three-qubit quantum gates with single atoms
in optical traps using their laser excitation into strongly interacting Rydberg
states. In our recent theoretical paper [Zh. Eksper. Teor. Fiz. 168(1), 14
(2025)] it was found that the proposed earlier three-body F\"orster resonance
$3\times nP_{3/2} \to nS_{1/2} +(n+1)S_{1/2} +nP_{1/2} $ in Rb Rydberg atoms
has a splitting, with one of the split components having weaker dependence of
the resonant electric field (and the corresponding dynamic shift) on the
distance $R$ between the atoms. Here we study this effect in more detail, since
such a resonance is the most suitable for performing experiments on observing
coherent oscillations of populations of collective three-body states and
implementing three-qubit quantum gates based on them. For a linear spatial
configuration of three interacting Rydberg atoms, the physical mechanism of
this phenomenon is revealed and analytical formulas are obtained that describe
the behavior of split structure of the F\"orster resonance depending on $R$. It
is found that the splitting is a measure of the energy of the resonant
dipole-dipole exchange interaction with an excitation hopping between
neighboring Rydberg states $S$ and $P$.

Abstract: We describe a transportable optical lattice clock based on the
$^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow {^3\mathrm{P}_0}$ transition of lattice-trapped
$^{87}$Sr atoms with a total systematic uncertainty of $2.1 \times 10^{-18}$.
The blackbody radiation shift, which is the leading systematic effect in many
strontium lattice clocks, is controlled at the level of $4.0 \times 10^{-19}$,
as the atoms are interrogated inside a well-characterised, cold thermal shield.
Using a transportable clock laser, the clock reaches a frequency instability of
about $5 \times 10^{-16}/\sqrt{\tau/\mathrm{s}}$, which enables fast
reevaluations of systematic effects. By comparing this clock to the primary
caesium fountain clocks CSF1 and CSF2 at Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt,
we measure the clock transition frequency with a fractional uncertainty of
$1.9\times 10^{-16}$, in agreement with previous results. The clock was
successfully transported and operated at different locations. It holds the
potential to be used for geodetic measurements with centimetre-level or better
height resolution and for accurate inter-institute frequency comparisons.

### [28] [The Hofstadter Butterfly: Bridging Condensed Matter, Topology, and Number Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13418)
*Indubala Satija*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper explores the Hofstadter butterfly fractal, highlighting its connection to Hall conductivity and its role in topological insulators, using geometry and number theory to explain its structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Hofstadter butterfly fractal is a fascinating example of mathematical art intersecting with physics, so analyzing its structure and significance in theoretical physics is intriguing.

Method: The authors use geometry, number theory, and unimodular matrices to analyze the butterfly fractal, linking it to Farey sequences, Apollonian gaskets, and Pythagorean triplets.

Result: The analysis reveals how the fractal encodes integer Hall conductivities and how these relate to topological insulator states.

Conclusion: This paper bridges abstract mathematics with quantum physics, showing the fractal's role in understanding topological phenomena.

Abstract: Celebrating its golden jubilee, the Hofstadter butterfly fractal emerges as a
remarkable fusion of art and science. This iconic X shaped fractal captivates
physicists, mathematicians, and enthusiasts alike by elegantly illustrating the
energy spectrum of electrons within a two dimensional crystal lattice
influenced by a magnetic field. Enriched with integers of topological origin
that serve as quanta of Hall conductivity, this quantum fractal and its
variations have become paradigm models for topological insulators, novel states
of matter in 21st century physics. This paper delves into the theoretical
framework underlying butterfly fractality through the lenses of geometry and
number theory. Within this poetic mathematics, we witness a rare form of
quantum magic: Natures use of abstract fractals in crafting the butterfly graph
itself. In its simplest form, the butterfly graph tessellates a two dimensional
plane with trapezoids and triangles, where the quanta of Hall conductivity are
embedded in the integer sloped diagonals of the trapezoids. The theoretical
framework is succinctly expressed through unimodular matrices with integer
coefficients, bringing to life abstract constructs such as the Farey tree, the
Apollonian gaskets, and the Pythagorean triplet tree.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates a spin-electric coupling mechanism using molecular spin systems for quantum control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum technologies need precise control over spin properties of magnetic molecules like FePc. This paper explores using electric fields to control their spin states for applications in quantum information processing.

Method: The study used ESR-STM to locally address FePc and Fe-FePc complexes with a STM tip and electric bias, observing nonlinear voltage effects linked to orbital interactions.

Result: The voltage-dependent resonance changes indicate a strong exchange interaction influenced by the tip, enabling coherent spin control through electric means.

Conclusion: This mechanism provides a scalable path for electrically controlled quantum operations using magnetic molecules as building blocks.

Abstract: Individual magnetic molecules are promising building blocks for quantum
technologies because of their chemical tunability, nanoscale dimensions, and
ability to self-assemble into ordered arrays. However, harnessing their
properties in quantum information processing requires precise local control of
their spin properties. In this work, we present spin-electric coupling (SEC)
for two molecular spin systems, iron phthalocyanine (FePc) and Fe-FePc
complexes, adsorbed on a surface. We use electron spin resonance combined with
scanning tunnelling microscopy (ESR-STM) to locally address them with the STM
tip and electrically tune them using the applied bias voltage. These
measurements reveal a pronounced nonlinear voltage dependence of the resonance
frequency, linked to the energic onset of other molecular orbitals. We
attribute this effect to a transport-mediated exchange field from the magnetic
tip, providing a large, highly localized, and broadly applicable SEC mechanism.
Finally, we demonstrate that the SEC enables all-electrical coherent spin
control: In Rabi oscillation measurements of both single and coupled Fe-FePc
complexes we show that the spin dynamics can be tuned, demonstrating a pathway
towards electrically controlled quantum operation.

### [30] [Enhancing Coherence with a Clock Transition and Dynamical Decoupling in the Cr$_7$Mn Molecular Nanomagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13714)

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper investigates the molecular nanomagnet Cr7Mn at different conditions, demonstrates how clock transitions enhance coherence times in a magnetic field, and provides insights into the mechanisms of decoherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent interest in molecular magnets stems from their potential use as spin qubits. The paper addresses the challenge of improving coherence times, which is crucial for quantum computing applications. By studying systems immune to magnetic field fluctuations, the authors aim to develop more stable quantum bits.

Method: The researchers used Hahn-echo pulse sequences at the clock transition to measure coherence times. Away from the clock, they employed electron-spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM). Dynamical decoupling with CPMG sequences was used for further comparisons. Experiments were conducted at low temperatures, with measurements taken in different solvent conditions, including deuterated solvents. A theoretical model incorporating both nuclear spin fluctuations and noise in the transition frequency was developed to explain the observed decoherence mechanisms.

Result: The study found that at temperatures ≤2 K, coherence times (T2) reached as low as 1 μs but peaked at higher T2 values near the clock transition (up to 3.6 μs). They observed that decoherence sources were intrinsic to the molecules themselves, with contributions from nuclear spin fluctuations and 1/f noise in anisotropy parameters. This indicates that magnetic field fluctuations are not the primary cause of decoherence when operating near the clock transition.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of molecular nanomagnet-based spin qubits and suggest that manipulating environments to suppress specific decoherence mechanisms can extend coherence times for quantum spin systems. The model developed provides a framework for rational design of such qubits, emphasizing the importance of controlling both nuclear and anisotropy-based fluctuations.

Abstract: Molecular magnets are attractive as spin qubits due to their chemical
tunability, addressability through electron-spin resonance techniques, and long
coherence times. Clock transitions (CTs), for which the system is immune to the
effect of magnetic-field fluctuations to first order, provide a method to
enhance the coherence time $T_2$, and to reveal mechanisms of decoherence that
are not due to such fluctuations. Here we investigate two variants of Cr$_7$Mn,
a spin-1 molecular nanomagnet, at fields near a zero-field CT. We find that at
temperatures $\le$2 K, $T_2\sim1$ $\mu$s at the CT using a Hahn-echo pulse
sequence. Away from the CT, electron-spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM)
oscillations due to coupling to nuclear spins are observed and have a $T_2$ as
high as $1.35$ $\mu$s, indicating a distinct mechanism of coherence
preservation. Dynamical decoupling with the CPMG pulse sequence yields
$T_2\sim\!2.8$ $\mu$s at the CT and up to $\sim\!3.6$ $\mu$s in the ESEEM
regime along with a demodulation of the oscillatory behavior. The experimental
values of $T_2$ are largely independent of the degree of dilution of the
molecules in solvent or whether the solvent is deuterated, indicating that much
of the decoherence and ESEEM arises from sources within the molecules
themselves. To account for decoherence, we develop a model that includes not
only field fluctuations but also fluctuations in the CT transition frequency
itself. Our results can be well explained by treating the environment as a
combination of noise at the nuclear Larmor precession frequency and $1/f$ noise
in the transverse anisotropy parameter $E$. Such information about the
microscopic origins of decoherence can aid the rational design of
molecular-based spin qubits.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper discusses implementing a versatile two-qubit gate set for spin-based quantum processors using a single pulse method which minimizes decoherence and crosstalk, achieving a high-fidelity resonant iSWAP gate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about quantum computing, specifically quantum simulations, aiming to enhance the performance of near-term quantum algorithms using spin qubits and fSim gates.

Method: The fSim gate set involves fermionic simulation gates such as CZ and iSWAP, utilizing a combination of baseband and resonant exchange drives with a single pulse method to implement these gates effectively.

Result: The proposed method successfully demonstrated a resonant iSWAP gate with high fidelity (~94%) in Germanium samples, with quantum process tomography confirming accurate gate calibration and identifying decoherence as the main error source.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical and efficient approach for implementing the fSim gate set in spin qubits, improving the scalability and reliability of quantum simulation algorithms, which is crucial for advancing quantum computing technology.

Abstract: In gate-defined semiconductor spin qubits, the highly tunable Heisenberg
exchange interaction is leveraged to implement fermionic two-qubit gates such
as CZ and SWAP. However, the broader family of fermionic simulation (fSim)
gates remains unexplored, and has the potential to enhance the performance of
near-term quantum simulation algorithms. Here, we demonstrate a method to
implement the fSim gate set in spin qubits using a single pulse combining
baseband and resonant exchange drives. This approach minimizes gate duration
and drive amplitude, mitigating decoherence and crosstalk. We validate its
effectiveness by realizing a resonant iSWAP gate between two hole spins in
germanium, achieving a fidelity of 93.8(5)% extracted with interleaved
randomized benchmarking. Quantum process tomography confirms accurate gate
calibration and identifies qubit decoherence as the dominant error source. Our
results establish a practical route toward a versatile and efficient two-qubit
gate set for spin-based quantum processors.

*L. E. Golub,E. L. Ivchenko*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper presents a semiclassical theory including Berry curvature dipole, side jumps, and skew scattering to explain the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals. It challenges previous quasiclassical approaches by showing they produce results differing from full quantum mechanics, regardless of disorder ranges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the CPGE mechanism in Weyl semimetals is crucial for advancing studies in topological materials and potential applications in quantum technologies.

Method: Uses semiclassical theory incorporating specific transport mechanisms like Berry curvature dipole, side jumps, and skew scattering to model intraband absorption effects.

Result: Identifies a discrepancy between quasiclassical methods and full quantum mechanics in the CPGE current, particularly noting that this discrepancy persists across various disorder levels.

Conclusion: uggests that a new microscopic mechanism must be integrated into quasiclassical models for a more accurate description of CPGE in Weyl semimetals, enhancing theoretical understanding of topological materials.

Abstract: We apply the semiclassical theory including the Berry curvature dipole, side
jumps and skew scattering for a quantitative description of the circular
photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals at intraband absorption. In
contrast to gapped systems where they completely exhaust all contributions to
the CPGE current, all previously known semiclassical mechanisms give a result
different from that obtained using a complete quantum-mechanical approach. We
show that this difference in the existing quasiclassical and full
quantum-mechanical approaches persists at all spatial ranges of the disorder
potential. Apparently, the implementation of another microscopic mechanism into
the quasiclassical description of the CPGE is required.

Abstract: We investigate resonant photoluminescence arising from incompressible quantum
liquids formed in two-dimensional electron systems. We demonstrate that, for
excitons composed of a photoexcited electron occupying the upper spin sublevel
of the zeroth Landau level and a valence-band hole, the influence of disorder
potential fluctuations on optical recombination is strongly suppressed,
indicating complete screening of the disorder. We identify an optical invariant
quantity that is insensitive to excitation energy yet strongly dependent on the
electron temperature, serving as a probe of exciton recombination in quantum
liquids. Analysis of this quantity reveals that quantum-liquid formation
initiates at (n = 1/3) as the electron temperature decreases, consistent with
the Laughlin state. Upon further cooling, the range of filling factors
exhibiting quantum-liquid behavior expands continuously from (n = 1/3) toward
(n = 1/2). Transitions between distinct incompressible quantum-liquid states
occur smoothly, without well-defined phase boundaries separating insulating and
conducting regimes. Locally, the system retains quantum-liquid characteristics
even as bulk transport measurements indicate finite conductivity. Finally, we
present a phase diagram delineating the stability region of incompressible
quantum liquids relative to conductive phases.

TL;DR: The study shows that modifying the surface of magnetite nanoparticles enhances their biomedical applications by increasing magnetic properties and blocking temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on understanding the role of surface states in enhancing the performance of magnetite nanoparticles in biomedical fields.

Method: Various techniques including synchrotron powder diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and neutron spectroscopy were used to study the surface modifications and their effects.

Result: Surface treatment increases specific absorption rate by 140%, enhances magnetic anisotropy, reduces spin relaxation time, and raises blocking temperature.

Conclusion: Optimizing surface states through engineering can significantly improve the functionality of magnetite nanoparticles for biomedical use.

Abstract: Magnetite ($Fe_3O_4$) nanoparticles are crucial for biomedical applications,
including magnetic hyperthermia, targeted drug delivery, and MRI contrast
enhancement, due to their biocompatibility and unique physicochemical
properties. Here, we investigate how surface states influence their induction
performance. Heat treatment removes surface water and FeOOH, forming a
${\gamma}$-$Fe_2O_3$ shell, as confirmed by synchrotron powder diffraction,
neutron powder diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and time-of-flight inelastic
neutron spectroscopy. AC magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that this
surface modification enhances magnetic anisotropy and reduces the spin
relaxation time, leading to a 140% increase in the specific absorption rate.
Additionally, the increased anisotropy suppresses the low-temperature clustered
spin-glass transition and raises the blocking temperature. These findings
highlight surface-state engineering as a powerful approach to optimizing
$Fe_3O_4$ nanoparticles for biomedical applications.

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that applying electric fields, specifically through flexoelectricity, can control the alignment of diopside 2D materials, improving their electronic properties by 20-30%. They used AC fields, observed alignment via Raman spectroscopy, and confirmed with molecular dynamics simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for flexible electronics and sensors has highlighted the need for controlling 2D material properties. This paper proposes a method using electric fields to achieve better performance in such materials.

Method: Exfoliated diopside crystals into thin flakes, placed them on microelectrodes, applied AC electric fields to induce alignment, used Raman spectroscopy to observe changes, and performed molecular dynamics simulations to validate results.

Result: Alignment improves electronic conductivity by 20-30%. Raman peaks weakened at higher frequencies, and simulations matched experimental data.

Conclusion: Electric fields effectively control diopside alignment, enhancing their properties for applications in flexible electronics and devices.

Abstract: Controlling the alignment of two dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for
optimizing their electronic and mechanical properties in next generation
devices. This study explores how electric fields can manipulate the orientation
of 2D diopside (CaMgSi2O6) flakes, a flexible silicate material, through a
phenomenon called flexoelectricity, where applied voltage generates mechanical
strain. We exfoliated diopside crystals into ultrathin flakes, placed them on
microelectrodes, and used AC electric fields to induce alignment via acoustic
strain. Raman spectroscopy showed that the flakes reoriented/realigned under
the field, with vibrational peaks weakening most at high frequencies (10 MHz).
Electrical tests revealed this alignment improves conductivity by 20-30%, as
straightened flakes create better pathways for current flow. Fully atomistic
molecular dynamics simulations further explained how these flakes naturally
align on surfaces within picoseconds, matching our experimental observations.
Together, these findings demonstrate a practical way to tune diopside
properties using electric fields, opening doors for its use in flexible
electronics, sensors, and energy devices.

Abstract: Geometry plays a fundamental role in a wide range of physical responses, from
anomalous transport coefficients to their related sum rules. Notable examples
include the quantization of the Hall conductivity and the Souza-Wilkens-Martin
(SWM) sum rule -- both valid at zero temperature, independent of interactions
and disorder. The finite-temperature generalization of the SWM sum rule has
been explored in the literature, revealing deep connections to the geometry of
density matrices. Building on recent advances in time-dependent geometric
frameworks, we propose a time-dependent quantum geometric tensor for thermal
density matrices. This formalism provides a unified interpretation of known sum
rules within the framework of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, further
elucidating their fundamental geometric origin. In addition, it provides
experimentally accessible methods to probe quantum geometry beyond the
zero-temperature regime.

TL;DR: This paper discusses armchair graphene nanoribbons and their interface states, showing that width, bonding, and strain affect both the number of interface states and the spin states. They use a Hubbard model to predict these properties as design guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The progress in graphene-based materials has led to a need to better understand and manipulate their electronic and magnetic properties, especially in junctions which are critical for device applications.

Method: Theoretical analysis involving varying width armchair graphene nanoribbons, using the Hubbard model to predict spin states and interface localizations.

Result: The key finding is that to determine the number of interface states and spin states, one must consider the width differences, bonding configurations, and strain effects. They also derived rules to predict these based on junction design.

Conclusion: This study helps in engineering localized states and thus enhances the design of graphene-based nanodevices, both in terms of electronics and magnetism, through structural adjustments.

Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of interface states emerging at junctions
between armchair graphene nanoribbons of varying widths. By exploring diverse
width combinations and junction geometries, we demonstrate that predicting the
precise number of interface states requires considerations beyond the
topological classification alone; specifically, the width differences and
bonding configuration at the interface play crucial roles. For junctions
involving ribbons with small gaps, we further examine how an applied strain
affects their topological properties and, consequently, the interface states
formed. The spin states at these junctions are investigated using the
mean-field Hubbard model, revealing how the magnetic behavior at the interface
depends on the number of localized states present. These results are summarized
in a series of ``rules of thumb" to predict the number of localized states and
the magnetic moment at the junction. Our findings contribute to understanding
and engineering localized states in graphene-based devices, providing
guidelines for manipulating electronic and magnetic properties through
structural design.

Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of novel topological phases in quantum
Hall-superconductor hybrid systems driven by Landau level mixing and spin-orbit
interactions. Focusing on a narrow superconducting stripe atop a
two-dimensional electron gas, we identify regimes where the hybridization of
the chiral Andreev states at each side of the stripe leads to different phases
beyond the long sought $p$-wave superconducting one. These topological phases
exhibit distinctive transport signatures, including quantized nonlocal
conductance arising from electron cotunneling at filling factor $\nu=1$, which
can coexist with quantized crossed Andreev reflection at $\nu=2$. A combination
of numerical simulations and effective modelling reveals the role of spin-orbit
coupling and stripe geometry in controlling these transitions. Our findings
suggest new strategies for realizing and detecting topology in proximized

Abstract: Semiconductor spin qubits are a promising platform for quantum computing but
remain vulnerable to charge noise. Accurate, in situ measurement of charge
noise could enable closed-loop control and improve qubit performance. Here, we
propose a method for real-time detection of charge noise using a silicon
singlet-triplet qubit with one electron initialized in an excited valley state.
This valley excitation acts as a spectator degree of freedom, coupled to a
high-quality resonator via the exchange interaction, which is sensitive to
charge-noise-induced voltage fluctuations. Dispersive readout of the resonator
enables a continuous, classical measurement of exchange fluctuations during
qubit operation. Signal-to-noise analysis shows that, under realistic device
parameters, sub-microsecond measurement times are possible using a
quantum-limited amplifier. Even without such an amplifier, sub-millisecond
performance is achievable with appropriately engineered resonator parameters.
This approach allows the probe to monitor slow drift in exchange in real time,
opening the door to feedback and feedforward strategies for maintaining
high-fidelity quantum operations. Importantly, the protocol preserves spin
coherence and can be run concurrently with qubit logic gates.

Abstract: Anyonic interferometry is a direct probe of fractional statistics. We propose
an interferometry geometry that parallels an optical Mach-Zehnder
interferometer and offers several advantages over existing interferometry
schemes. In contrast to the currently studied electronic Mach-Zehnder
interferometer, our setup has no drain inside the device so that the trapped
topological charge is time-independent. In contrast to electronic Fabry-P\'erot
interferometry, anyons cannot go around the device more than once. Thus, the
interference signal has a straightforward interpretation in terms of anyonic
statistical phases. The proposed geometry suppresses the undesirable effects of
bulk-edge coupling. Moreover, the setup allows for simple exact solutions for
the electric current and noise for an arbitrary quasiparticle tunneling
strength in a broad range of conditions. The structure of the solutions is
similar to that for non-interacting electrons but reflects fractional charge
and statistics. We present results for electric current and noise in Jain
states and address thermal interferometry at zero voltage bias.

### [41] [Lattice-charge coupling in a trilayer nickelate with intertwined density wave order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13513)

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper discusses the role of spin correlations in charge and spin density waves (SDWs) in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, finding that phonon softening is absent despite electronic peaks at SDW wavevectors. This challenges the conventional view of lattice-charge coupling in unconventional superconductors.ovelimiting the conclusion to the key points without full details. The paper is exploring how the spin-dependent ordering affects superconductivity in these materials. They used inelastic X-ray scattering and electronic susceptibility calculations to show no phonon softening at the CDW wavevector but a peak at the SDW, unlike cuprates. This suggests that spin correlations play a more dominant role in these materials, which is different from previous assumptions about lattice coupling being crucial. The study provides a deeper understanding of the interplay between SDW and superconductivity in these oxides.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the role of spin correlations in unconventional superconductors, specifically in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates. The conventional understanding of lattice-charge coupling in cuprates is being questioned, and this study provides new insights into how spin degrees of freedom influence these materials. Understanding this could lead to better models for unconventional superconductivity.

Method: They used inelastic X-ray scattering and electronic susceptibility calculations to analyze phonon dispersions and electronic peaks in RE4Ni3O10, comparing it to cuprates.

Result: In RE4Ni3O10, there's no phonon softening at the CDW wavevector but an electronic peak at the SDW. This contradicts the typical lattice-charge coupling seen in cuprates, indicating spin correlations dominate. This suggests that SDW is more critical for the observed superconductivity.

Conclusion: The absence of phonon softening despite SDW electronic peaks points to spin-dominated ordering mechanisms in these materials. This re-evaluates the role of lattice coupling in unconventional superconductors, moving away from the previous assumption that lattice effects were crucial. The findings provide a new foundation for understanding how spin correlations in charge and spin density waves contribute to superconductivity in RP nickelates.

Abstract: Intertwined charge and spin correlations are ubiquitous in a wide range of
transition metal oxides and are often perceived as intimately related to
unconventional superconductivity. Theoretically envisioned as driven by strong
electronic correlations, the intertwined order is usually found to be strongly
coupled to the lattice as signaled by pronounced phonon softening. Recently,
both charge/spin density waves (CDW/SDW) and superconductivity have been
discovered in several Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates, in particular trilayer
nickelates RE4Ni3O10 (RE=Pr, La). The nature of the intertwined order and the
role of lattice-charge coupling are at the heart of the debate about these
materials. Using inelastic X-ray scattering, we mapped the phonon dispersions
in RE4Ni3O10 and found no evidence of phonon softening near the CDW wavevector
over a wide temperature range. Calculations of the electronic susceptibility
revealed a peak at the observed SDW ordering vector but not at the CDW
wavevector. The absence of phonon softening is in sharp contrast to that in
canonical oxide materials, notably cuprates. Our experimental and theoretical
findings highlight the crucial role of the spin degree of freedom and establish
a foundation for understanding the interplay between superconductivity and
density-wave transitions in RP nickelate superconductors and beyond.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了通过自旋系统与电子的相互作用，可以无需强磁或强自旋轨道效应导致特定系统展现出复杂的拓扑电导现象。这为开发无需复杂设备即可获得拓扑材料提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Topological electronic states such as topological insulators and quantum Hall
states typically require strong spin-orbit coupling or magnetic fields. In this
study, we consider an electron system coupled to a spin system, where electrons
interact with magnons, quasiparticles of spin waves. We show that the
interaction between electrons and magnons transfers the effect of symmetry
breaking in the spin system to the electron system, whereby a non-trivial
topological phase can be induced in the electron system that is otherwise
topologically trivial. Through this ``topology transfer'' mechanism, we
demonstrate the realization of various topological phases, including quantum
Hall and quantum spin Hall insulators, in simple ferromagnetic spin systems,
without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling or magnetic field for electron
systems.

Abstract: We unveil an interesting example of topological flat bands of Majorana
fermions in quantum spin liquids. We study the Kitaev model on a periodically
depleted honeycomb lattice, under a magnetic field within the perturbation
theory. The model can be straightforwardly extended while maintaining the exact
solvability, and its ground state is a quantum spin liquid as on the honeycomb
lattice. As fractionalized excitations, there are unpaired localized Majorana
fermions in addition to the itinerant Majorana fermions and $\mathbb{Z}_2$
fluxes. We show that in the absence of the magnetic field the Majorana fermions
have completely flat bands at zero energy, and by applying the magnetic field,
they turn into topological flat bands with nonzero Chern number. By varying the
anisotropy of the interactions and the magnitude of the magnetic field, we
clarify that the system exhibits a variety of topological phases that do not
appear in the original model. We emphasize that the topological flat bands that
give this rich topology come from the hybridization of the Majorana flat bands
and unpaired Majorana fermions, which is unique to the flat bands of
fractionalized excitations in quantum spin liquids. Our findings would
stimulate the exploration of a new type of Kitaev materials exhibiting rich
topology from topological Majorana flat bands.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper discusses a single crystal of quasi-2D chromium telluride system with distinct magnetic properties. The crystal exhibits a competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions, showing multiple temperature-driven magnetic transitions. The study suggests potential skyrmion behavior and strong spin-phonon coupling, which are promising for spintronics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation seems to be exploration of magnetic properties in 2D materials for spintronics and related applications.

Method: Synthesis via flux method, magnetization measurements, Raman spectra analysis, and Breit-Wigner-Fano fit parameters monitoring.

Result: Quasi-2D Cr1+xTe2 crystal with competing exchange interactions, magnetic transitions at different temperatures, possible skyrmions, and strong spin-phonon coupling. Anisotropy supports spintronics applications.

Conclusion: The system's magnetic and spin properties make it a promising candidate for spintronics applications, likely due to its unique structural and magnetic characteristics, which may support phenomena like skyrmions and strong spin-phonon coupling.

Abstract: Single crystals of quasi-2D chromium telluride system represented by Cr1+xTe2
(x = 0.22), which crystallizes in the trigonal structure with the c-axis as the
growth direction, are synthesized by the flux method. The magnetization
measurements revealed the coexistence and competition between ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic exchange interactions due to the presence of the intercalated
Cr-layers. A series of diverse magnetic transitions is exhibited by the
crystal. While cooling the crystal, it undergoes a paramagnetic to
antiferromagnetic transition at 190 K, followed by a transition into a
ferromagnetic state at around 160 K, and a spin-canting at a lower temperature
of 75 K. A possible lack of inversion symmetry in the crystal structure, along
with the observance of an unusual jump and loop opening in the isothermal
magnetization suggests that the crystals Cr1+xTe2 (x = 0.22) may host
skyrmions. Furthermore, concomitant to their magnetic transitions, anomalies
were observed in the derived Breit-Wigner-Fano fit parameters obtained from the
asymmetric temperature-dependent Raman spectra, evidencing a strong spin-phonon
coupling effect, intrinsic to the grown crystals. A strong perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy along with the robust spin-phonon coupling, makes the
system a promising candidate for prospective spintronics applications.

Conclusion: 三维情况下，精确解更稳定，提供研究量子退 frustration的新平台，可能有应用在量子稳定性与新相态研究中。

Abstract: Exact results in frustrated quantum many-body systems are rare, especially in
dimensions higher than one. The Shastry-Sutherland (SS) model stands out as a
rare example of a two-dimensional spin system with an exactly solvable dimer
singlet ground state. In this work, we introduce a three-dimensional analogue
of the SS lattice, constructed by deforming the pyrochlore lattice to preserve
the local SS geometry. Despite the dimensional increase and altered topology,
the ground-state phase diagrams of classical Ising and Heisenberg spins, remain
analytically tractable and closely follow their 2D counterparts, including the
existence of a 1/3 magnetization plateau and umbrella states. Most notably, for
quantum spins S = 1/2, the dimer singlet state survives as an exact ground
state over a finite region of the phase diagram. We argue, using exact
diagonalization, that the singlet phase is stabilized beyond its 2D
counterpart, suggesting enhanced robustness in three dimensions. These results
offer a rare, controlled platform to explore the impact of dimensionality on
quantum frustration, exact solvability, and potential spin liquid behavior in
3D, with relevance to emergent topological and magnetic phases.

Conclusion: 系统在有长距离库仑相互作用时，外兴相可能稳定，尽管有相分离的趋势。提供对二维材料中电子自旋性质的理论支持。

Abstract: We consider an extended spinless Falicov--Kimball model at an arbitrary
doping level, focusing on the range of parameter values where a uniform
excitonic insulator is stabilised at half-filling. We compare the properties of
possible uniform phases and construct the Hartree--Fock phase diagrams, which
include sizeable phase separation regions. It is seen that the excitonic
insulator can appear as a component phase in a mixed-phase state in a broad
interval of doping levels. In addition, in a certain range of parameter values
the excitonic metal (doped excitonic insulator) is identified as the
lowest-energy uniform phase. We suggest that this phase, which is unstable with
respect to phase separation, may be stabilised when the phase separation is
suppressed by the long-range Coulomb interaction. Overall, we find that
excitonic correlations can affect the behaviour of the system relatively far
away from half-filling.

Conclusion: CaCrO3是Heisenberg型的heAVM，Heisenberg交叉作用可能促进heAVM的Revivals。

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a newly discovered magnetic phase, has spurred growing
research activity. Studies from a perspective of dynamical electronic
correlation still remain scarce. Employing density functional theory plus
dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) that incorporates dynamical electronic
correlation, we demonstrate that CaCrO$_3$ is a strongly correlated
altermagnet. Our DFT+DMFT calculations successfully reproduce the correlated
metallic behavior of CaCrO$_3$ and quantitatively capture the incoherence state
observed experimentally. We also identify that the altermagnetic CaCrO$_3$ is a
Hund's metal with a non-Fermi liquid behavior. Moreover, we find that
altermagnetism can induce flat bands, and these incipient flat bands are
further promoted by the strong renormalization from Hundness, which drives a
heavy-fermion behavior. Hence, we propose that Hund's metals provide an ideal
platform for hosting novel strongly correlated altermagnetism. Our work will
promote the study of strongly correlated altermagnetism physics.

### [48] [Nonlinear management of the miscibility-immiscibility transition in binary Bose-Einstein condensates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13683)
*B. B. Baizakov,B. A. Malomed,M. Salerno*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of nonlinearity management on the miscibility of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate, both with and without linear mixing. They find that nonlinearity management can control domain wall structures, and apply it under the demixing transition. Results show that the control of nonlinearity allows for stabilization or management of the miscibility through specific frequencies and strengths, offering a theoretical basis for manipulating such systems in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates, especially how nonlinearity and linear mixing affect their miscibility, is crucial for both theoretical physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. This paper provides insights into managing these complex systems, which could have implications for designing devices that control quantum states.

Method: The researchers used a variational approximation, numerical solutions, and analytical estimates to study the system. They also employed exact solutions with the Piosis-Teller potential and studied the linear excitations to determine stability and critical parameters.

Result: The study reveals how nonlinearity management can shift the miscibility transition point and control the formation and stability of domain walls. The analytical findings align with numerical results, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior under varying conditions.

Conclusion: This work contributes to controlling the miscibility of BECs with nonlinearity management, offering strategies for experiments to achieve desired states through precise control of system parameters.

Abstract: We investigate application of the nonlinearity management (NM, i.e., periodic
variation of the strength of the inter-component repulsion) to the
miscibility-immiscibility (MIM) transition across the critical point of a
two-component BEC, both with and without the linear mixing (Rabi coupling, RC)
between the components. To this end, we first identify, by means of a
variational approximation and numerical solution, diverse stationary
domain-wall (DW) structures supported by the system in the absence of the
management. The approximate analytical solutions for the DWs are found to be in
excellent agreement with their numerical counterparts. An analytical estimate
is also produced for the upshift of the MIM transition caused by the pressure
of the trapping potential in the case of a confined system. An exact DW
solution is produced for the system including the P\"{o}schl-Teller potential,
which is stable (unstable) if the potential is repulsive (attractive). Further,
we find the spectrum of linear excitations in the spatially uniform mixed
state, and thus establish parameter regions where the system is stable/unstable
against demixing. In particular, RC upshifts the critical strength of the
inter-component repulsion for the onset of the MIM transition. Eigenfrequencies
of excitations on top of DW states are identified from numerical simulations
through monitoring the evolution of perturbed states. Weak NM applied at the DW
eigenfrequency reveals features of the nonlinear resonance. Stronger NM, under
which the system periodically crosses the MIM-transition point, restricts the
miscibility.

TL;DR: The study introduces a nonlinear model to quantify how external pressure affects capillary blood flow, comprising three pressure ranges with analytical expressions. It accounts for vascular elasticity and collapse, and preliminary validation shows its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: External pressure effects on blood flow are crucial for various medical applications, but existing studies are insufficient, prompting the need for a detailed quantitative model.

Method: The study uses a mathematical modeling approach, dividing the pressure-flow relationship into three distinct phases with analytical expressions for each.

Result: Preliminary validation shows the model effectively captures the mechanical aspects of blood flow under external pressure.

Conclusion: A novel nonlinear segmented model is proposed to understand and predict capillary flow under external pressure, with potential applications in medical therapies.

Abstract: External pressure significantly influences microcirculatory capillary blood
flow, yet current studies lack quantitative modeling. This work proposes a
nonlinear segmented coupling model between external pressure and capillary
flow, incorporating vascular elasticity and collapse effects. The pressure-flow
response is divided into three phases: elastic compression under low pressure
(less than 30 mmHg), elliptical collapse in the transition zone (30 to 40
mmHg), and closure-induced attenuation under high pressure (above 40 mmHg),
with explicit expressions derived for each. Parameter sensitivity analysis and
comparison with literature demonstrate the model's capability in capturing key
determinants. The proposed framework supports dose-response assessment and
individualized parameter tuning in pressure-based therapies such as tourniquets
and compression garments.

Conclusion: 该论文深入分析了SQUID在量子比特相互作用中的作用，特别是在不同光子情况下系统的退化情况，并提出了可以作为有效的人工原子的条件和模型，为量子比特的设计和实现提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We study the interactions mediated by symmetric superconducting quantum
interference device (SQUID), their renormalizations, and applicability of the
anharmonic oscillator model for a coupled phase qubit. The coupling SQUID can
switch between single- or two-photon interaction in situ. We consider a coupled
resonator and an rf SQUID. The latter dwells in the vicinity of its metastable
well holding a number of anharmonic energy states and acts as an artificial
atom known as the phase qubit. Apart from the linear and two-photon couplings,
interactions of optomechanical type and a cross-Kerr coupling arise. Near the
two-photon resonance, we calculate the renormalizations due to nonresonant
interactions, which are more prominent with the higher Josephson energy of the
coupler. We interpret the renormalizations by depicting some of the virtual
processes involved. That also allows us to determine the minimal amount of
metastable states in the phase qubit for the renormalization formulas to hold.

Abstract: Superconducting quantum computers have emerged as a leading platform for
next-generation computing, offering exceptional scalability and unprecedented
computational speeds. However, scaling these systems to millions of qubits for
practical applications poses substantial challenges, particularly due to
interconnect bottlenecks. To address this challenge, extensive research has
focused on developing cryogenic multiplexers that enable minimal wiring between

the viability of commercial microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switches for
cryogenic multiplexers in large-scale quantum computing systems. DC and RF
characteristics of the MEMS switches are evaluated at cryogenic temperatures (<

results demonstrate that MEMS switches exhibit improved on-resistance, lower
operating voltage, and superior RF performance at cryogenic temperatures, with
reliable operation over 100 million cycles. Furthermore, stable single-pole

*Asadullah Bhuiyan,Haining Pan,Chao-Ming Jian*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a comprehensive framework for classifying fermionic dynamical systems using symmetry and topology. It introduces two classification schemes, many-body evolution operator and single-particle transfer matrix, which are shown to correspond under free-fermion conditions. The authors demonstrate the application of their framework through Gaussian adaptive circuits, providing a method to stabilize topological states and study phase transitions. Numerical simulations and robustness analysis are included to validate their approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of fermionic dynamical systems and their topological classifications is a fundamental area in condensed matter physics and quantum information theory. Understanding how symmetry and topology influence the behavior of these systems is crucial for developing new materials and quantum technologies.

Method: The paper uses a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. It builds on the Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold way to develop two classification schemes, one for many-body systems and another for single-particle dynamics. Gaussian adaptive circuits are designed and numerically studied to realize and stabilize topological dynamical phases.

Result: The authors establish a correspondence between the two classification frameworks in the free-fermion limit, equivalent topological classifications, and demonstrate through simulations that their adaptive circuits can realize topological phases with robustness to coherent noise.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel framework for understanding and controlling fermionic dynamical systems through symmetry and topology, with practical applications in quantum computing and condensed matter physics.

Abstract: We develop a general framework for classifying fermionic dynamical systems
with measurements using symmetry and topology. We discuss two complementary
classification schemes based on the Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold way: (1) the
many-body evolution operator (mEO) symmetry class, which classifies fermionic
dynamics at the many-body level and generalizes to interacting dynamics, and
(2) the single-particle transfer matrix (sTM) symmetry class, which classifies
free-fermion dynamics at the single-particle level and connects to Anderson
localization physics. In the free-fermion limit, these two frameworks are in
one-to-one correspondence and yield equivalent topological classifications of
area-law entangled dynamical phases. This leads to a novel dynamical
bulk-boundary correspondence: the topology of the dynamical system's spacetime
\textit{bulk} determines the topology of the area-law entangled steady-state
ensemble living on its temporal \textit{boundary}. Building on this
correspondence, we provide a general realization of topological dynamical
phases using Gaussian adaptive circuits. They are designed to prepare and
stabilize free-fermion topological states as their steady states in
\textit{any} spatial dimension. While circuits with exponentially local
operations can stabilize a single topological steady state, those with
finite-range operations can reach a topological steady-state ensemble. As a
demonstration, we explicitly construct and simulate 2+1d adaptive circuits that
realize mEO-class-A topological dynamics. We show that the finite-range
versions converge to an ensemble of Chern insulators in $\mathcal{O}(1)$
circuit depth. We numerically study the topological phase transitions and
dynamical domain-wall modes between different topological dynamical phases in
this symmetry class. We also analyze the robustness of our adaptive circuit
protocol to coherent noise.

### [53] [Bipartite and tripartite entanglement in pure dephasing relativistic spin-boson model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13438)
*Kensuke Gallock-Yoshimura,Erickson Tjoa*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper studies entanglement generation in a relativistic spin-boson model, showing that two emitters require deep interactions for high entanglement, the field's mass improves it, tripartite entanglement is hard without special methods, and provides Fock state conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates entanglement in a quantum field theory context, which is relevant for understanding quantum gravity and quantum information in relativistic systems.

Method: It uses the Unruh-DeWitt model and non-perturbative methods to analyze entanglement generation over time.

Result: Key findings include the requirements for two, three emitters, and mass impact on two-body entanglement, with three-body entanglement being difficult without special techniques.

Conclusion: The results suggest the need for alternative techniques beyond standard perturbative methods to study genuine multipartite entanglement in relativistic frameworks.

Abstract: We study non-perturbatively the entanglement generation between two and three
emitters in an exactly solvable relativistic variant of the spin-boson model,
equivalent to the time-independent formulation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector
model. We show that (i) (highly) entangled states of the two emitters require
interactions very deep into the light cone, (ii) the mass of the field can
generically improve the entanglement generation, (iii) unlike the bipartite
case where it is possible to generate close to maximally entangled states via
the spin-boson interactions, the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement
is non-perturbatively hard even at sufficiently long times. Result (iii), in
particular, suggests that probing the multipartite entanglement of a
relativistic quantum field non-perturbatively requires either different
probe-based techniques or variants of the UDW model. Along the way we provide
the regularity conditions for the $N$-emitter model to have well-defined ground
states in the Fock space.

Abstract: We investigate qubits coupled to the boundary of a two dimensional photonic
lattice that supports dispersionless edge modes, unlike conventional edge modes
that sustain propagating photons. As a case study, we consider a honeycomb
lattice (photonic graphene) of coupled resonators with a zigzag edge, where the
edge modes form a flat band defined only over a restricted region of momentum
space. We show that light matter interactions are effectively captured by a
dissipative cavity QED model, wherein the emitter coherently couples to a
fictitious cavity mode emerging as a superposition of edge modes. This mode has
support on only one sublattice and, most notably, displays an unconventional
power law localization around the qubit, yet remaining normalizable in the
thermodynamic limit, with a spatial range that can be tuned by introducing
lattice anisotropy We predict occurrence of vacuum Rabi oscillations and
efficient state transfer between distant emitters. An experimental
demonstration using superconducting circuits is proposed.

TL;DR: Trapped-ion processors are leading candidates for scalable quantum computation but face challenges with motional heating.

Simulations with up to 55 qubits show significant error reduction, offering a practical route for large-scale quantum computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a critical issue in quantum computing, namely thermal noise, contributing to the development of fault-tolerant quantum processors.

Method: The authors analyzed the dependence of heating-induced infidelity on phase-space trajectories and developed a framework that involves various control pulse bases, ion numbers, and noise levels, focusing on efficiently computable cost functions to mitigate heating errors.

Result: Through numerical simulations of up to 55 qubits, the proposed framework achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction in infidelities, demonstrating robustness and scalability.

Conclusion: The framework based on phase-space trajectory analysis offers a practical solution for overcoming motional heating, paving the way for scalable trapped-ion quantum processors.

Abstract: Trapped-ion processors are leading candidates for scalable quantum
computation. However, motional heating remains a key obstacle to fault-tolerant
operation, especially when system size increases. Heating error is particularly
challenging to suppress due to is incoherence nature, and no general methods
currently exist for mitigating their impact even in systems with more than two
ions. In this work, based on a careful analysis about the dependence of
heating-induced infidelity on phase-space trajectories, we present a simple yet
comprehensive framework for suppressing heating errors in large trapped-ion
quantum processors. Our approach is flexible, allowing various control pulse
bases, ion numbers, and noise levels. Our approach is also compatible with
existing error-mitigation techniques, including those targeting laser phase and
frequency noise. Crucially, it relies on an efficiently computable cost
function that avoids the exponential overhead of full fidelity estimation. We
perform numerical simulations for systems with up to 55 qubits, demonstrating
up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in infidelities. These results offer a
practical route toward robust, large-scale quantum computation with trapped
ions.

Conclusion: 研究者提出了一种高效的方法，通过使用连接量子重复码和其他基本块构建高质量的量子纠错码。这一发现展示了模块化构建量子码的可能性，并为未来研究提供了新思路，帮助提高量子计算系统的可靠性和容错性。

Abstract: It is generally unclear whether smaller codes can be "concatenated" to
systematically create quantum LDPC codes or their sparse subsystem code cousins
where the degree of the Tanner graph remains bounded while increasing the code
distance. In this work, we use a slight generalization of concatenation called
conjoining introduced by the quantum lego formalism. We show that by conjoining
only quantum repetition codes, one can construct quantum LDPC codes. More
generally, we provide an efficient iterative algorithm for constructing sparse
subsystem codes with a distance guarantee that asymptotically saturates
$kd^2=O(n)$ in the worst case. Furthermore, we show that the conjoining of even
just two-qubit quantum bit-flip and phase-flip repetition codes is quite
powerful as they can create any CSS code. Therefore, more creative combinations
of these basic code blocks will be sufficient for generating good quantum
codes, including good quantum LDPC codes.

The architecture maps images to quantum states to maximize separability in Hilbert space.

Result: The model shows high performance on benchmark datasets and achieves higher classification accuracy than classical neural networks alone, suggesting the potential for practical quantum advantage.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid protocol demonstrates the potential of combining quantum and classical computational resources for practical applications in machine learning, outlining a promising direction for future advancements in quantum-enhanced computational techniques.

Abstract: The integration of quantum computing and machine learning has emerged as a
promising frontier in computational science. We present a hybrid protocol which
combines classical neural networks with non-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum
many-body system for image classification. This architecture leverages
classical neural networks to efficiently process high-dimensional data and
encode it effectively on a quantum many-body system, overcoming a challenging
task towards scaled up quantum computation. The quantum module further
capitalizes on the discriminative properties of many-body quantum dynamics to
enhance classification accuracy. By mapping images from distinct classes to
nearly-orthogonal quantum states, the system maximizes separability in the
Hilbert space, enabling robust classification. We evaluate the performance of
our model on several benchmark datasets with various number of features and
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate the key role of the quantum module in
achieving high classification accuracy which cannot be accomplished by the
classical neural network alone. This showcases the potential of our hybrid
protocol for achieving practical quantum advantage and paves the way for future

Conclusion: 这个新的向前时间模型等效于原模型，揭示了引导项的物理根源。这为验证模型的未来时反向因果性提供了新的方法。

Abstract: A recently proposed stochastic hidden variable model for quantum mechanics
has been claimed to involve "retrocausality" due to the appearance of equations
of motion with future-time boundary conditions. We formulate an equivalent
system of forward-time equations of motion that gives rise to the same
trajectories as solutions, but involves only initial-time boundary conditions.
The forward-time dynamics involves a guidance term for the dynamical variables,
determined by the phase-space distribution corresponding to a quantum
wavefunction. We show, however, that this particular guidance term can be
recovered as the mean-field limit of averaged pairwise interactions among an
ensemble of finitely many particles.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAQR-QC, a logic for scalable and approximate reasoning about quantum circuits, addressing the scalability issues of existing methods and enabling verification of complex quantum algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification of quantum programs is a fundamental challenge. Existing methods are impractical for large quantum circuits due to exponential scaling. This paper proposes a new logic to overcome these limitations by supporting approximate, scalable, and local reasoning.

Method: The paper presents SAQR-QC, a logic that incorporates deliberate precision loss, mechanisms to control accumulated precision loss, and local reasoning steps. The method is tested on GHZ circuits and quantum phase estimation.

Result: The case studies show that SAQR-QC effectively verifies GHZ circuits with non-Clifford gates and analyzes the quantum phase estimation algorithm, demonstrating the logic's applicability and effectiveness for complex quantum systems.

Conclusion: SAQR-QC provides a scalable approach for approximate verification of quantum circuits, addressing the limitations of existing methods and paving the way for practical quantum program verification.

Abstract: Reasoning about quantum programs remains a fundamental challenge, regardless
of the programming model or computational paradigm. Despite extensive research,
existing verification techniques are insufficient--even for quantum circuits, a
deliberately restricted model that lacks classical control, but still underpins
many current quantum algorithms. Many existing formal methods require
exponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of)
assertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with
many qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called
SAQR-QC. The logic supports Scalable but Approximate Quantitative Reasoning
about Quantum Circuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i)
some (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism
to help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps
remain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, all
reasoning steps are local--i.e., they each involve just a small number of
qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAQR-QC via two case studies: the
verification of GHZ circuits involving non-Clifford gates, and the analysis of
quantum phase estimation--a core subroutine in Shor's factoring algorithm.

Abstract: In this work we explore the limitations and robustness of thermal radiation
in dynamical Casimir systems serving as analogs for Hawking radiation. Through
detailed numerical analysis, we characterize particle production spectra in
cavities with moving boundaries under various configurations, including
expanding, collapsing, and rigidly accelerating scenarios. We find that thermal
signatures emerge in specific expanding cavity configurations but are highly
dependent on frequency bands and acceleration parameters. In those
configurations of the cavity where there is thermal production, we derive
fitting expressions that quantify deviations from idealized thermal spectra
through gray-body factors, revealing oscillatory behaviors tied to acceleration
duration. Our results identify which experimental setups can reliably simulate
gravitationally-induced phenomena and quantify how finite-size effects and
transient dynamics modify the expected thermal distributions, providing a
comprehensive framework for distinguishing genuine Hawking-like radiation from
experimental artifacts.

Abstract: Entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information science and
many-body physics, yet quantifying it in mixed quantum many-body systems has
remained a notoriously difficult problem. Here, we introduce families of
quantitative entanglement witnesses, constructed from partial transpose and
realignment moments, which provide rigorous bounds on entanglement monotones.
Our witnesses can be efficiently measured using SWAP tests or variants of Bell
measurements, thus making them directly implementable on current hardware.
Leveraging our witnesses, we present several novel results on entanglement
properties of mixed states, both in quantum information and many-body physics.
We develop efficient algorithms to test whether mixed states with bounded
entropy have low or high entanglement, which previously was only possible for
pure states. We also provide an efficient algorithm to test the Schmidt rank
using only two-copy measurements, and to test the operator Schmidt rank using
four-copy measurements. Further, our witnesses enable robust certification of
quantum circuit depth even in the presence of noise, a task which so far has
been limited to noiseless circuits only. Finally, we show that the entanglement
phase diagram of Haar random states, quantified by the partial transpose
negativity, can be fully established solely by computing our witness, a result
that also applies to any state 4-design. Our witnesses can also be efficiently
computed for matrix product states, thus enabling the characterization of
entanglement in extensive many-body systems. Finally, we make progress on the
entanglement required for quantum cryptography, establishing rigorous limits on
pseudoentanglement and pseudorandom density matrices with bounded entropy. Our
work opens new avenues for quantifying entanglement in large and noisy quantum
systems.

*Shantanav Chakraborty,Soonwon Choi,Soumik Ghosh,Tudor Giurgică-Tiron*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to generate computational deep thermalization using quantum states that are pseudorandom and require minimal resources. They demonstrate how to construct quantum states with low entanglement but appear random to any observer, even after taking many copies. This challenges the traditional view that high randomness comes from unstructured ensembles and opens new possibilities in quantum computing and cryptography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about quantum thermalization and how complex systems reach equilibrium. Thermalization is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, and this paper seeks to find simpler structures that mimic the behavior of fully random systems, which is important for both theoretical understanding and practical applications like quantum computing.

Method: The authors build a quantum circuit to create states that are computationally pseudorandom. The circuit has a depth that scales logarithmically with the number of qubits, resulting in states with low entanglement. These states are designed to mimic Haar random states, which are typically highly structured, but in this case, achieved through structured quantum circuits instead of random ones.

Result: The results show that these quantum states can pass computational tests for pseudorandomness despite being highly structured. They also suggest that these states are pseudoentangled, meaning they interfere with computational predictions in specific ways but appear random to observers. The low resource complexity implies that such states can be efficiently prepared on quantum computers, making deep thermalization more feasible.

Conclusion: This work opens a new avenue in quantum pseudorandomness by demonstrating that highly random-looking states can be constructed with minimal computational resources, which challenges existing paradigms and has implications for quantum simulation and cryptography.

Abstract: Deep thermalization refers to the emergence of Haar-like randomness from
quantum systems upon partial measurements. As a generalization of quantum
thermalization, it is often associated with high complexity and entanglement.
Here, we introduce computational deep thermalization and construct the fastest
possible dynamics exhibiting it at infinite effective temperature. Our circuit
dynamics produce quantum states with low entanglement in polylogarithmic depth
that are indistinguishable from Haar random states to any computationally
bounded observer. Importantly, the observer is allowed to request many copies
of the same residual state obtained from partial projective measurements on the
state -- this condition is beyond the standard settings of quantum
pseudorandomness, but natural for deep thermalization. In cryptographic terms,
these states are pseudorandom, pseudoentangled, and crucially, retain these
properties under local measurements. Our results demonstrate a new form of
computational thermalization, where thermal-like behavior arises from
structured quantum states endowed with cryptographic properties, instead of
from highly unstructured ensembles. The low resource complexity of preparing
these states suggests scalable simulations of deep thermalization using quantum
computers. Our work also motivates the study of computational quantum
pseudorandomness beyond BQP observers.

Result: New monotone measures and lower bounds are introduced, along with insights into different quantum resources and their behavior under external fields.

Conclusion: The framework provides a versatile tool for studying quantum resources, with practical applications in phase transition analysis and resource quantification.

Abstract: Building on the recently developed quantum state texture resource theory, we
exhibit that the difference between maximum and minimum textures is a valid
purity monotone in any dimension and provide a lower bound for existing purity
measures. We introduce a texture-based resource monotone applicable across
general convex resource theories, encompassing quantum coherence,
non-stabilizerness, and entanglement. In particular, we propose the notion of
non-local texture, which corresponds to the geometric measure of bipartite and
multipartite entanglement in pure states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
texture of the entire ground state or its subsystems can effectively signal
quantum phase transitions in the Ising chain under both transverse and
longitudinal magnetic fields, offering a powerful tool for characterizing
quantum criticality.

Abstract: We solve the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation in several scenarios using
the quantum annealer provided by the D-Wave systems within a pseudospectral
scheme, where its solution is encoded into certain set of suitable basis
functions. We assess the performance of different strategies of encoding based
on algebraic arguments and the adiabatic condition, and benchmark these against
the classical heuristic simulating annealing algorithm. In particular, we
compute the minimum energy gap, the so-called dynamic range and the mean
squared error to assess the numerical stability, consistency and accuracy of
the solutions returned by each strategy. Our work stresses out the importance
of developing custom embedded techniques ensuring well-conditioned algebraic
systems. In particular, we find out that encoding strategies retrieving
algebraic systems exhibiting full-rank and small dynamic ranges enhance the
performance of the quantum annealer even under polychromatic driving and for
intricate initial conditions. We further discuss the prospect of developing
hybrid quantum-classical schemes enable to meet suitable algebraic and
adiabatic conditions simultaneously.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that three quantum reference frame approaches for gauge symmetries—effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral—are equivalent when considering ideal quantum reference frames, differing only by their orientation. It also explores physical applications such as frame-dependent uncertainties, paving the way for non-ideal extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the equivalence of different QRF approaches is crucial for advancing quantum gravity and gauge theories, aiming to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity and other fundamental forces.

Method: The authors employ a comparative analysis of the three QRF frameworks, examining their mathematical formalisms and showing their equivalence under ideal conditions. They use tools from quantum algebra and symmetry theory, analyzing state spaces and transformations to highlight the relationship between the approaches.

Result: The study reveals that the three QRF methods are mathematically equivalent when dealing with ideal quantum reference frames, differing mainly by their focus on different aspects (phase space, algebraic states, etc.). This finding strengthens the foundation for using these approaches interchangeably in various physical scenarios.

Conclusion: By demonstrating the equivalence of these QRF approaches, the paper paves the way for a unified framework that can handle more realistic, non-ideal quantum reference frames, advancing our understanding of quantum gravity and gauge theories.

Abstract: The framework of internal quantum reference frames (QRFs) constitutes a
universal toolset for dealing with symmetries in quantum theory and has led to
new revelations in quantum gravity, gauge theories and foundational physics.
Multiple approaches have emerged, sometimes differing in scope and the way
symmetries are implemented, raising the question as to their relation. Here, we
investigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries,
namely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN)
approaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the
effective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by
expectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic
approach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical
algebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all
three formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that
these three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished
by sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two
approaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including
relativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF
transformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the
older effective approach, by which it was inspired. As a physical application,
we explore the QRF covariance of uncertainties and fluctuations, which turn out
to be frame-dependent. This is particularly well-suited for the effective and
algebraic approaches, for which these quantities form a natural basis. Finally,
we pave the way towards extending these two approaches to non-ideal QRFs by
studying the projection and gauge-fixing operations of the Page-Wootters
formalism, built into the PN framework, on algebraic states.

the case of an exactly solvable spin-boson model, where the system-environment
interaction, whose strength is encoded in the spectral density, induces pure
dephasing. By using artificial neural networks trained on the
Fourier-transformed time evolution of some observables of the system, we
perform both classification -- distinguishing sub-Ohmic, Ohmic, and super-Ohmic
spectral densities -- and regression -- thus estimating key parameters of the
spectral density function, when the latter is expressed through a power law.
Our results demonstrate high classification accuracy and robust parameter
estimation, highlighting the potential of machine learning as a powerful tool
for probing environmental features in quantum systems and advancing quantum
noise spectroscopy.

### [67] [Do mixed states exhibit deep thermalisation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14135)
*Alan Sherry,Sthitadhi Roy*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Abstract discusses deep thermalization and its failure for mixed states, introduces a new paradigm for mixed states, applies it to the self-dual kicked Ising chain, and finds exact emergence of the mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores thermalization in quantum systems, which is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of quantum states under unitary evolution. The problem of thermalization, especially for mixed states, is of great interest as it relates to the emergence of thermodynamic properties in isolated quantum systems.

Method: Mathematical analysis and theoretical framework development, specifically employing techniques from quantum statistical mechanics and the study of exactly solvable models like the kicked Ising chain.

Result:  demonstration of a new deep thermalization paradigm for mixed states, showing that such ensembles naturally emerge in chaotic systems, with an exact solution for the self-dual kicked Ising chain at finite times.

Conclusion: The work extends the understanding of thermalization beyond traditional pure state scenarios, showing that maximum entropy principles are manifest even in systems with finite entropy when evolved under unitary dynamics.

Abstract: The notion of $deep$ $thermalisation$, where ensembles of pure states on a
local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement,
approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles constrained only by conservation
laws, represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional
thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed
initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness.
To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed
states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our
formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees
of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with
the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial
state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic,
locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain,
which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we
find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at
finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how
maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in
unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.

Abstract: We consider distillation of ebits between a specified pair of subsystems from
pure tripartite states by local operations and classical communication. It is
known that, allowing an asymptotically vanishing error, the maximal rate is the
minimum of the von Neumann entropies of the two corresponding marginals, and
under asymptotic stochastic local operations and classical communication the
maximal rate is given by a minimization over a one-parameter family of
entanglement measures. In this paper, we determine the direct and strong
converse error exponents, and the optimal rate for deterministic
transformations.

Result: existence of different superradiant phases, notably a chirally frustrated superradiant phase with broken symmetries and unidirectional photon flow

Conclusion: synthetic gauge fields and ultra-strong coupling enable controlled engineering of frustrated quantum phases in JC systems

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of frustrated quantum phases in a
Jaynes-Cummings (JC) trimer with complex hopping amplitudes between the
cavities, which represents the smallest frustrated unit in light-matter
systems. The complex hopping amplitudes that can be engineered via synthetic
gauge fields introduce chiral effects and geometric frustration into the
system. We obtain analytic solutions in the semiclassical limit and map out the
phase diagram of this model, featuring one normal and three distinct
superradiant phases. Among these phases, a chirally frustrated superradiant
phase emerges, characterized by broken chiral and translational symmetries and
unidirectional photon flow. These results reveal how frustration and symmetry
breaking can arise in JC systems with synthetic gauge fields and ultrastrong
coupling.

Abstract: This article introduces the innovative Quantum Dining Information Brokers
Problem, presenting a novel entanglement-based quantum protocol to address it.
The scenario involves $n$ information brokers, all located in distinct
geographical regions, engaging in a metaphorical virtual dinner. The objective
is for each broker to share a unique piece of information with all others
simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, this protocol enables a fully
parallel, single-step communication exchange among all brokers, regardless of
their physical locations. A key feature of this protocol is its ability to
ensure both the anonymity and privacy of all participants are preserved,
meaning no broker can discern the identity of the sender behind any received
information. At its core, the Quantum Dining Information Brokers Problem serves
as a conceptual framework for achieving anonymous, untraceable, and massively
parallel information exchange in a distributed system. The proposed protocol
introduces three significant advancements. First, while quantum protocols for
one-to-many simultaneous information transmission have been developed, this is,
to the best of our knowledge, one of the first quantum protocols to facilitate
many-to-many simultaneous information exchange. Second, it guarantees complete
anonymity and untraceability for all senders, a critical improvement over
sequential applications of one-to-many protocols, which fail to ensure such
robust anonymity. Third, leveraging quantum entanglement, the protocol operates
in a fully distributed manner, accommodating brokers in diverse spatial
locations. This approach marks a substantial advancement in secure, scalable,
and anonymous communication, with potential applications in distributed
environments where privacy and parallelism are paramount.

Abstract: We study the aspects of quantum chaos in mushroom billiards introduced by
Bunimovich. This family of billiards classically has the property of mixed
phase space with precisely one entirely regular and one fully chaotic (ergodic)
component, whose size depends on the width w of the stem, and has two limiting
geometries, namely the circle (as the integrable system) and stadium (as the
fully chaotic system). Therefore, this one-parameter system is ideal to study
the semiclassical behavior of the quantum counterpart. Here, in paper I, we
study the spectral statistics as a function of the geometry defined by w, and
as a function of the semiclassical parameter k, which in this case is just the
wavenumber k. We show that at sufficiently large k the level spacing
distribution is excellently described by the Berry-Robnik (BR) distribution
(without fitting). At lower k the small deviations from it can be well
described by the Berry-Robnik-Brody (BRB) distribution, which captures the
effects of weak dynamical localization of Poincar\'e-Husimi functions. We also
employ the analytical theory of the level spacing ratios distribution P(r) for
mixed-type systems, recently obtained by Yan (2025), which does not require a
spectral unfolding procedure, and show excellent agreement with numerics in the
semiclassical limit of large k. In paper II we shall analyze the eigenstates by
means of Poincar\'e-Husimi functions.

Abstract: Collision models provide a simple and versatile setting to capture the
dynamics of open quantum systems. The standard approach to thermalisition in
this setting involves an environment of independent and identically-prepared
thermal qubits, interacting sequentially for a finite duration $\Delta t$ with
the system. We compare this to a two-bath scenario in which collisional qubits
are prepared in either their ground or excited states and the environment
temperature is encoded in system-environment couplings. The system reaches the
same thermal steady state for both settings as $\Delta t\to 0$, although even
in this limit they describe fundamentally different physical processes, with
the two-bath setup yielding a nonequilibrium state with finite heat currents.
Non-Markovian dynamics arise when intra-environment interactions in either
setting are introduced. Here, the system in the single-bath setup again reaches
a steady state at the canonical temperature of the bath, but the nonequilibrium
steady state of the two-bath setup tends to a different temperature due to the
generation of strong system-environment and intra-environment correlations. The
two-bath setting is particularly suited to studying quantum trajectories, which
are well-defined also for the non-Markovian case. We showcase this with a
trajectory analysis of the heat currents within a two-point measurement scheme.
Our results provide insights into the dynamics and thermodynamics of
thermalisation towards nonequilibrium steady states and the role of
non-Markovian interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding critical quantum states and quantum simulation capabilities is crucial. Quantum simulators rely on circuit structures, and this paper explores a new method to model such states using HVA.

Method: Variational quantum algorithm with Hamiltonian variational ans"atze. Circuit depth scales linearly with system size, and the number of blocks increases linearly with system size as well, allowing the algorithm to efficiently handle larger systems.

Result: The exploration of critical states and successful approximation using HVA suggests HVA is effective for targeting these rare quantum states.

Conclusion: Variational algorithms could become a new tool for studying complex critical states in quantum systems, especially approaching the thermodynamic limit.

Abstract: Characterizing quantum critical states towards the thermodynamic limit is
essential for understanding phases of matter. The power of quantum simulators
for preparing the critical states relies crucially on the structure of quantum
circuits and in return provides new insight into the critical states. Here, we
explore the critical states of the quantum Rabi model~(QRM) by preparing them
variationally with Hamiltonian variational ans\"atze~(HVA), in which the
intricated interplay among different quantum fluctuations can be parameterized
at different levels. We find that the required circuit depth scales linearly
with the effective system size, suggesting that HVA can efficiently capture the
behavior of critical states of QRM towards the thermodynamic limit. Moreover,
we reveal that HVA gradually squeeze the initial state to the target critical
state, with a number of blocks increasing only linearly with the effective
system size. Our work suggests variational quantum algorithm as a new probe for
the complicated critical states.

Abstract: Optical quantum memories are essential components for realizing the full
potential of quantum networks. Among these, rare-earth-doped crystal memories
stand out due to their large multimode storage capabilities. To maximize the
multimode capacity in the time domain, it is key to simultaneously achieve
large memory bandwidth and long optical storage time. Here, we demonstrate an
atomic frequency comb optical memory in Yb:YSO, with a memory bandwidth of
250~MHz and a storage time of up to 125 $\mu$s. The efficiency reaches 20 \% at
short storage times, and 5 \% at 125 $\mu$s. These results were enabled by an
optimized optical pumping scheme, guided by numerical modelling. Our approach
is specifically designed for future spin-wave storage experiments, with the
theoretical bandwidth limit set at 288 MHz by the hyperfine structure of
Yb:YSO. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method for synthesizing the
optical pumping waveforms required for generating combs with tens of thousands
of teeth, as well as a simple yet frequency-agile laser setup for optical
pumping across a 10 GHz bandwidth.

Abstract: We address the problem of optimal pumping strategies in quantum networks.
These networks enable secure communication by distributing entangled photon
pairs to user (or node) pairs. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols, like
BBM92, generate secret keys from entangled photons. While secure communication
and error correction are essential for any quantum communication channel,
resource contention, optimization, and fairness issues are critical for
networks. In this article, we analyze the performance of quantum networks,
proposing simple distributed algorithms for QKD networks generating secret
keys.
  There are significant advantages of pumping entangled photons in QKD
networks, but challenges arise in practical implementations. The underlying
channels are inherently time-varying, and thus data rates fluctuate between
nodes. Moreover, multiple edges (node pairs) can be pumped simultaneously,
albeit at the cost of a reduced secret key rate (SKR). These temporal and
spatial constraints yield a complex decision-making problem whose solutions may
favor a small set of user pairs to the detriment of overall, long-run network
performance.
  We design adaptive pumping strategies that address these challenges in QKD
networks. In particular, we find that a proportional fairness pumping strategy
(PF-PS) stands out by dynamically prioritizing users with lower average secret
key rates and optimally balancing fairness with throughput. The proposed
algorithm is a natural extension to quantum networks of the Proportional Fair
Scheduler deployed in 4G LTE and 5G mobile networks. Both theoretical analysis
and numerical simulations confirm that PF-PS is optimal for entangled state
distribution, and thus, when adapted appropriately, proportional fair pumping
is a strong candidate for efficient resource allocation in quantum networks.

Abstract: In recent years, non-Hermitian quantum systems (NHQS) have been actively
studied. In conventional quantum mechanics, Hermitisity is a fundamental
property of Hamiltonians. However, it is known that when a system interacts
with its environment, its time evolution can be effectively described by
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. NHQS are attracting attention because novel
physical phenomena not observed in Hermitian systems are predicted due to its
non-Hermitisity. In this study, I investigated the definition of current in
NHQS. In Hermitian systems, equation of continuity(EOC) holds between the
particle density and the current. However, in NHQS, there are cases where the
conventional definition of current does not satisfy EOC. Therefore, I
considered the definition of current that satisfies EOC in NHQS. As a result, I
derived current that satisfies EOC and behaves similarly to the current in
Hermitian systems with respect to physical quantities (electromagnetic fields).

TL;DR: The paper presents an all-optical method to reorient laser-written nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond substrates to enhance their performance for quantum magnetometry. They use femtosecond laser annealing to achieve deterministic alignment along specific crystallographic axes, enabling scalable quantum devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is likely to overcome the limitation of random defect orientations in nitrogen-vacancy centers, which limits their sensitivity and signal contrast in quantum sensing applications. The proposed all-optical method using femtosecond laser annealing offers a scalable solution for deterministic alignment of these centers, thus improving their utility for quantum magnetometry and other sensing applications.

Method: The method used in the paper involves using femtosecond laser annealing to reorient the defect axis of individually laser-written nitrogen-vacancy centers along specific crystallographic axes. The procedure is designed for both (100)- and (111)-oriented diamond substrates, achieving deterministic alignment along the optical axis.

Result: The result of this study is a technique that enhances the performance of nitrogen-vacancy centers by ensuring their crystallographic orientation, which leads to improved signal quality and sensitivity in quantum magnetometry. This enables the creation of spatially ordered arrays of NV centers suitable for scalable quantum devices.

Conclusion: The conclusion of this paper is that femtosecond laser annealing can effectively reorient nitrogen-vacancy centers, significantly improving their reliability and performance for solid-state quantum sensing devices, particularly in quantum magnetometry applications.

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are widely recognized as highly
promising solid-state quantum sensors due to their long room temperature
coherence times and atomic-scale size, which enable exceptional sensitivity and
nanoscale spatial resolution under ambient conditions. Ultrafast laser writing
has demonstrated the deterministic spatial control of individual NV$^-$
centers, however, the resulting random orientation of the defect axis limits
the magnetic field sensitivity and signal contrast. Here, we present an
all-optical approach for reorienting laser-written NV$^-$ centers to lie along
a specific crystallographic axis using femtosecond laser annealing. This
technique enables the creation of spatially ordered NV$^-$ arrays with uniform
orientation, for enhancing performance for quantum magnetometry. We achieve
deterministic alignment along the optical axis in both (100)- and
(111)-oriented diamond substrates, paving the way for scalable,
high-performance quantum devices based on orientation-controlled NV$^-$

Abstract: Spontaneous emission in dipole approximation is studied theoretically using
both source-field theory and a Schrodinger picture approach. Using source-field
theory we obtain formal equations for the Poynting vector and energy density
without making the rotating wave approximation (RWA) and Weisskopf-Wigner
approximation (WWA). The initial condition at t=0 is one in which the atom is
in an excited state and the field in the vacuum state. The source-field
expressions are evaluated within the the RWA and WWA and are found to satisfy
Poynting's theorem. To explore the consequences of not making the RWA and WWA,
the Poynting vector and energy density are calculated using perturbation
theory. We use a Schrodinger picture approach and essentially reproduce and
complement the results of Compagno, Passante, and Persico [J. Mod. Optics 37:8,
1377 (2007)] and those of Power and Thirunamachandran [Phys. Rev. A 45, 54
(1992)] obtained using a Heisenberg picture approach. The theory involves a sum
over field mode frequencies and both finite cutoffs and convergence factors are
used to carry out the sums. It is shown that the perturbation theory
calculation leads to unphysical values for atomic state populations for all
times when a sum over all field frequencies is taken, even if a convergence
factor is used. It is also proved that the fields calculated using source-field
theory always satisfy Poynting's theorem for ct not equal to R, where R is the
distance from the atom.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable variational method for simulating the dynamics of
interacting open quantum bosonic systems deep in the quantum regime. The method
is based on a multi-dimensional Wigner phase-space representation and employs a
Variational Multi-Gaussian (VMG) ansatz, whose accuracy is systematically
controlled by the number of Gaussian components. The variational equations of
motion are derived from the Dirac-Frenkel principle and evaluated efficiently
by combining the analytical structure of Gaussian functions with automatic
differentiation. As a key application, we study a driven-dissipative
two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard lattice with two-boson coherent driving and
two-body losses. Using our dynamical approach, we compute the finite-size
scaling of the Liouvillian spectral gap - extracted from the relaxation
dynamics - which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. Our results reveal
critical slowing down with dynamical exponents of the 2D quantum Ising
universality class, demonstrating the power of our method to capture complex

Abstract: We apply a graybox machine-learning framework to model and control a qubit
undergoing Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics from environmental noise. The
approach combines physics-informed equations with a lightweight transformer
neural network based on the self-attention mechanism. The model is trained on
simulated data and learns an effective operator that predicts observables
accurately, even in the presence of memory effects. We benchmark both
non-Gaussian random-telegraph noise and Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise and
achieve low prediction errors even in challenging noise coupling regimes. Using
the model as a dynamics emulator, we perform gradient-based optimal control to
identify pulse sequences implementing a universal set of single-qubit gates,
achieving fidelities above 99% for the lowest considered value of the coupling
and remaining above 90% for the highest.

### [82] [Quantum Boltzmann Machines using Parallel Annealing for Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14116)
*Daniëlle Schuman,Mark V. Seebode,Tobias Rohe,Maximilian Balthasar Mansky,Michael Schroedl-Baumann,Jonas Stein,Claudia Linnhoff-Popien,Florian Krellner*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to train Quantum Boltzmann Machines using improved parallel quantum annealing to reduce the number of qubits required, enabling real-world applications. The approach uses medical images from the MedMNIST dataset and yields similar accuracy to CNNs with fewer epochs, resulting in a significant speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are addressing the challenge of high qubit requirements for training QBMs on NISQ devices. They aim to leverage parallel quantum annealing and supervised learning to reduce computational costs and improve applicability for real-world tasks.

Method: The paper employs a modified parallel quantum annealing technique on the MedMNIST dataset for medical image classification, demonstrating that their approach reduces qubit usage compared to traditional methods, achieves performance on par with CNNs, and decreases training time by over 70%.

Result: The experiments show that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to CNNs but with fewer epochs, leading to a speed-up of nearly 70% compared to conventional quantum boltzmann machine executions.

Conclusion: This work advances the practical implementation of quantum boltzmann machines by introducing an efficient training method that reduces qubit consumption and accelerates the training process, paving the way for their deployment in real-world applications like medical imaging.

Abstract: Exploiting the fact that samples drawn from a quantum annealer inherently
follow a Boltzmann-like distribution, annealing-based Quantum Boltzmann
Machines (QBMs) have gained increasing popularity in the quantum research
community. While they harbor great promises for quantum speed-up, their usage
currently stays a costly endeavor, as large amounts of QPU time are required to
train them. This limits their applicability in the NISQ era. Following the idea
of No\`e et al. (2024), who tried to alleviate this cost by incorporating
parallel quantum annealing into their unsupervised training of QBMs, this paper
presents an improved version of parallel quantum annealing that we employ to
train QBMs in a supervised setting. Saving qubits to encode the inputs, the
latter setting allows us to test our approach on medical images from the
MedMNIST data set (Yang et al., 2023), thereby moving closer to real-world
applicability of the technology. Our experiments show that QBMs using our
approach already achieve reasonable results, comparable to those of
similarly-sized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with markedly smaller
numbers of epochs than these classical models. Our parallel annealing technique
leads to a speed-up of almost 70 % compared to regular annealing-based BM
executions.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 这个论文提出了一种基于乘法权重更新方法的量子和经典算法来近似求解第二阶锥规划（SOCP），展示了两者的时间复杂度。量子算法的复杂度为	ilde{O}(√r γ^5 + √m γ^4)，接近解决线性规划（LP）的复杂度，甚至在变量数远大于锥数时优于将SDP算法应用于SOCP的暴力方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOCP是一种比SDP更特殊的优化问题，研究如何更高效地解决SOCP对于量子计算有重要意义。

Method: 论文采用乘法权重更新框架，将SOCP的结构特性用于优化时间复杂度。他们分别设计了适用于量子和的经典算法，并测试了这些算法的性能。

Result: 量子算法在处理SOCP时比直接应用SDP算法效率更高，尤其当变量远超过锥数量时。经典算法在样本查询模型下表现出多项式复杂度。

Conclusion: 该研究为SOCP提供了一种更高效的方法，对量子优化有重要贡献。

Abstract: We give classical and quantum algorithms for approximately solving
second-order cone programs (SOCPs) based on the multiplicative weights (MW)
update method. Our approach follows the MW framework previously applied to
semidefinite programs (SDPs), of which SOCP is a special case. We show that the
additional structure of SOCPs can be exploited to give better runtime with
SOCP-specific algorithms. For an SOCP with $m$ linear constraints over $n$
variables partitioned into $r \leq n$ second-order cones, our quantum algorithm
requires $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{r}\gamma^5 + \sqrt{m}\gamma^4)$ (coherent)
queries to the underlying data defining the instance, where $\gamma$ is a
scale-invariant parameter proportional to the inverse precision. This nearly
matches the complexity of solving linear programs (LPs), which are a less
expressive subset of SOCP. It also outperforms (especially if $n \gg r$) the
naive approach that applies existing SDP algorithms onto SOCPs, which has
complexity $\widetilde{O}(\gamma^{4}(n + \gamma \sqrt{n} + \sqrt{m}))$. Our
classical algorithm for SOCP has complexity $\widetilde{O}(n\gamma^4 + m
\gamma^6)$ in the sample-and-query model.

Abstract: We motivate the use of a ladder of Rydberg atoms as an analog simulator for a
lattice gauge theory version of scalar electrodynamics also called the compact
Abelian Higgs model. We demonstrate that by using a few thousand shots from a
single copy of the ladder simulator it is possible to estimate the bipartite
quantum von Neumann entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. The estimation relies on
an optimized filtration of the mutual information associated with the
bitstrings obtained from public facilities of configurable Rydberg arrays named
Aquila. We discuss the limitations associated with finite sampling, sorting
fidelity, adiabatic preparation, ramp-down of the Rabi frequency before
measurement, and readout errors. We use cumulative probability distribution to
compare Aquila results with high accuracy density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) or exact results. The state preparation appears to be the main source of
error. We discuss the large volume behavior of the cumulative probability
distribution and show examples where for a finite number of shots, there
appears to be some large enough size for which any given state is seen at most
once with high probability. We show that the results presented can be extended
to multipartite entanglement. We briefly discuss the cost of the calculations
for large square arrays in the context of obtaining quantum advantage in the
near future.

### [85] [Spin-free Generalised Normal Ordered Coupled Cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13472)
*Nicholas Lee,David P. Tew*

TL;DR: The paper presents a new coupled cluster method that is spin-free, size-extensive, and size-consistent, offering competitive results with streamlined working equations compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of developing efficient and accurate coupled cluster methods for multireference systems, which are crucial for studying molecular systems with near-degeneracy issues.

Method: The authors introduce a generalised normal ordered exponential ansatz for coupled cluster theory, allowing for arbitrary spin states. They ensure size-extensivity and eliminate redundancies by selecting specific excitations. Localised orbitals enable size-consistent dissociation of open-shell fragments.

Result: Numerical tests on multireference systems show results comparable to existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: This new method provides a computationally efficient and accurate treatment of multireference systems, advancing the field of electronic structure theory.

Abstract: We present a spin-free, size-extensive, and size-consistent coupled cluster
method based on a generalised normal ordered exponential ansatz. This approach
is a natural generalisation of single-reference coupled cluster theory for
arbitrary spin eigenfunctions. The working equations are size-extensive through
the generalised normal order formalism, and made spin-free with the
spin-ensemble approach. Redundancies amongst excitations are eliminated by
selecting only those excitations that project the reference function onto the
first-order interacting space. Furthermore, by utilising localised orbitals,
the proposed method describes dissociation into open-shell fragments
size-consistently. Numerical results on prototypical multireference systems at
the singles and doubles level of theory are competitive with existing
multireference approaches, yet with more compact working equations.

### [86] [Robust Surface-Induced Enhancement of Exciton Transport in Magic-Angle-Oriented Molecular Aggregates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13755)
*Siwei Wang,Liang-Yan Hsu,Hsing-Ta Chen*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Exciton transport in magic-angle aggregates can be enhanced via light-matter coupling, with the enhancement originating from near-field photon-mediated interactions. Scaling laws vary near metallic surfaces compared to free space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores how light-matter interactions can enhance exciton transport, which is counterintuitive due to the suppression from dipole-dipole interactions. The motivation is to understand the mechanism behind this enhancement and its implications for controlling exciton transport.

Method: The researchers used macroscopic quantum electrodynamics (MQE) to simulate exciton transport in a magic-angle chromophore array near a silver surface. They employed numerical simulations and derived analytical expressions using the image-dipole method.

Result: The results show a significant enhancement of the exciton diffusion coefficient, particularly the scaling behavior near metallic surfaces, with analytical expressions aligning well with simulations.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the potential to control exciton transport through the design of coupled exciton-photon systems and by engineering dielectric environments, offering implications for both fundamental studies and applications in organic electronics.

Abstract: Exciton transport in molecular aggregates with magic-angle orientation is
expected to be strongly suppressed due to their negligible dipole-dipole
interactions. However, recent reports show that light-matter interactions can
significantly enhance exciton transport attributed to the effective long-range
coupling mediated by the photonic fields. To elucidate their interplay, we
employ the macroscopic quantum electrodynamics framework to simulate exciton
transport within a chromophore array arranged in a magic-angle configuration in
proximity to a silver surface. Our results show a significant enhancement of
the exciton diffusion coefficient that is robust across variations in
chromophore-surface separation, intermolecular distance, and molecular
transition frequency. Furthermore, based on the image-dipole method, we derive
analytical expressions that agree well with numerical simulations, revealing
the enhancement's origin in the near-field coupling term as induced by the
radiative scattering at the metallic surface. More importantly, we observe
non-trivial differences in the diffusion coefficient's scaling near metallic
surfaces compared to free space. Our findings highlight the potential to
control exciton transport by designing coupled exciton-photon systems and
engineering the dielectric environments.

### [87] [Harnessing multi-mode optical structure for chemical reactivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13897)
*Yaling Ke,Jakob Assan*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores how multi-mode optical cavities can enhance chemical reactions in polaritonic chemistry by introducing new mechanisms and providing experimental design insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper delves into the control of chemical reactivity using optical microcavities, a timely and interdisciplinary topic that bridges quantum optics and chemical dynamics.

Method: The authors performed a fully quantum-mechanical study of reactions within few-mode cavities, revealing two key scenarios involving resonance and anharmonicity enhancements.

Result: They found that multi-mode effects can enhance reaction pathways through resonance hybridization and multi-photon processes, leading to non-additive rate enhancements.

Conclusion: The study offers new strategies for tailoring chemical reactivity through multi-mode structural design, useful for optimizing polaritonic catalysts and experiments.

Abstract: The prospect of controlling chemical reactivity using frequency-tunable
optical microcavities has materialized over the past decade, evolving into a
fascinating yet challenging new field of polaritonic chemistry, a
multidisciplinary domain at the intersection of quantum optics, chemical
dynamics, and non-equilibrium many-body physics. While most theoretical efforts
to date have focused on single-mode cavities, practical implementations in
polaritonic chemistry typically involve planar optical cavities that support a
series of equally spaced photon modes, determined by the cavity geometry. In
this work, we present a numerically exact, fully quantum-mechanical study of
chemical reactions in few-mode cavities, revealing two key scenarios by which
multi-mode effects can enhance cavity-modified reactivity. The first scenario
emerges when the free spectral range is comparable to the single-mode Rabi
splitting. In such cases, hybridization between a rate-decisive molecular
vibration and a central resonant cavity mode reshapes the resonance landscape,
enabling additional reaction pathways mediated by adjacent cavity modes. The
second scenario exploits the intrinsic anharmonicity of molecular vibrations,
which gives rise to multiple dipole-allowed transitions with distinct energies.
Under multi-mode strong coupling, where different cavity modes individually
resonate with these distinct transitions, multi-photon processes involving
sequential absorption across multiple modes become accessible. This leads to a
nontrivial and non-additive rate enhancement via cascade-like vibrational
ladder climbing. Together, these findings offer new strategies for tailoring
chemical reactivity by harnessing the structural richness of multi-mode
structure, offering valuable insights for optimal experimental designs in
polaritonic catalysis.

vibron model framework, which has been shown to accurately describe critical
phenomena in molecular bending spectra within experimental precision. To
estimate the transition state energy barrier, we propose an improvement to a
phenomenological formula proposed by Baraban et al.[1] , introducing a new term
to capture the anharmonicity change that characterizes quasilinear molecules

*Indranil Ghosh,Hammed O. Fatoyinbo,Sishu S. Muni*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: The paper examines time series dynamics in small networks of neurons modeled after the Morris--Lecar model, varying coupling strengths to observe how network behavior changes. It finds chaos in inhibitory coupling with high temperatures, quasi-periodicity in weak coupling, and synchronized bursting in strong excitatory coupling. A causality test is also conducted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how coupling strength affects network dynamics is crucial in neural network studies, aiming to identify patterns in complex systems.

Method: The study uses time series analysis on small neural networks, employing various analytical techniques such as measuring persistence, irregularity, chaos, and synchronization. The Morris--Lecar model is used with different coupling strategies, and causality is tested.

Result: Chaos observed in inhibitory coupling with high thermal sensitivity, quasi-periodicity with weak coupling, synchronized bursting with strong excitatory coupling. Causality test results found in one case.

Conclusion: Coupling strength significantly impacts network dynamics, revealing chaos, quasi-periodicity, and synchronization, useful for understanding complex systems like neural networks.

Abstract: We perform time series analysis of small networks where every node is the
slow-fast version of the denatured Morris--Lecar neuron proposed by Schaeffer
and Cain. We choose popular coupling strategies from the literature and provide
a detailed account of how varying their strength drives the dynamics of the
small networks. Algorithms for time series analysis range from measuring their
persistence (ability to remember past values), irregularity, chaos and
quasiperiodicity, to synchronization between time series from every node within
a network. Chaos is observed for inhibitory coupling strengths and for
temperature higher than a reference temperature when the coupling is thermally
sensitive. We observe quasi-periodicity when the coupling is very weak and
synchronized bursting for highly excitatory coupling strength. In certain cases
we also observe decay oscillations. Finally, a causality test is performed to
detect whether the dynamics of one neuron is influencing the dynamics of the
other in the coupled system.

Abstract: In theoretical cosmology, symmetric teleparallel gravity or $f(Q)$ gravity
based on nonmetricity tensor Q has become an interesting alternative to General
relativity in recent years. The present research paper contains a rigorous
dynamical system analysis of coincident f (Q) gravity in the presence of a
generalized DBI essence scalar field. We have considered two different models
of coincident f(Q) gravity, such as power law model $f(Q) = Q + nQ^m$ and
exponential model $f(Q) = Q e^{\frac{\beta Q_0}{Q}}$ respectively, where n, m,
\b{eta} are constant parameter and Q is the nonmetricity component. In this
study, the generalized DBI essence scalar field acts as an additional dark
energy component. After obtaining the field equation for the corresponding
cosmological model, we employed several dynamical variables to form the
dynamical system. The critical points of these dynamical systems are influenced
by cosmological parameters and associated with particular epochs in the
cosmological timeline. For different combinations of cosmological parameters,
the critical points exhibit different cosmological eras, starting from the
accelerated stiff matter era to late-time acceleration phenomena. The stability
criteria of each critical point are studied by using linear stability theory,
and the physical constraints on the cosmological parameters are also considered
during this analysis. Furthermore, the current values of energy densities,
deceleration parameters, and equation of state parameters obtained from the
evolution diagram are compatible with observational data.

Abstract: Extensions of general relativity often predict modifications to gravitational
waveform morphology that depend functionally on source parameters, such as the
masses and spins of coalescing black holes. However, current analyses of
strong-field gravity lack robust, data-driven methods to infer such functional
dependencies. In this work, we introduce GRANITA, a non-perturbative,
theory-agnostic framework to characterize parameter-dependent deviations from
general relativity using Gaussian process regression. Leveraging the
flexibility of this method, we analyze both simulated data and real events from
the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA public catalog. We demonstrate the ability of our approach
to detect and quantify waveform deviations across the parameter space.
Furthermore, we show that the method can identify stochastic
(non-deterministic) deviations, potentially arising from environmental effects
or subdominant unmodeled physics. As gravitational-wave tests of strong gravity
advance in precision, our framework provides a principled approach to constrain
modified gravity and to mitigate contamination from astrophysical or
instrumental systematics.

Abstract: By studying the chameleon gravity on galaxy scales, we investigate the
effects of the chameleon dark matter. To perform this task, we consider the
dynamics of the chameleon scalar field in the region of galactic halos in
static spherically symmetric spacetimes that differ only slightly from
classical general relativity, but have similar symmetry behind this region.
Hence, we demonstrate its ability to act as dark matter. In fact, by obtaining
the expression for the tangential speed in this region, we apply this approach
to explain the issue of flat galactic rotation curves. We obtain that the mass
associated with the chameleon scalar field varies linearly with the radius of
galaxy, and hence, the tangential speed in that region is constant, which is
consistent with observational data without any need to introduce a mysterious
dark matter. Accordingly, we show that the presented chameleon gravity has a
well-defined Newtonian limit and can describe the geometry of spacetime in the
region of flat galactic rotation curves, and is consistent with the
corresponding results of the $ \Lambda CDM $ model with the NFW profile. We
also consider a test particle moving in a timelike geodesic and obtain the
fifth-force, which varies proportionally to the inverse of the radius of
galaxy. Moreover, we obtain the effects on the angle representing the
deflection of light and on the time representing the radar echo delay of
photons passing through the region of galactic halos. We show that as the
radius of galaxy increases, the effect on the angle of light passing through
the region around galactic halos decreases. Also, the obtained result indicates
that the relevant time delay decreases with increasing radius towards the end
of the galactic halo.

Abstract: In this study, we examine the impacts of black hole spin, Lorentz-violating
parameter, and the scalar field's mass on quasinormal modes (QNMs) of rotating
Einstein-Bumblebee black holes, including computations up to the second-order
expansion in rotation parameters. We investigate two classes of
Lorentz-violating rotating black holes: one constructed via the Newman-Janis
algorithm and the other obtained by solving the field equations through a
series expansion. Within the slow-rotation approximation framework, we derive
the master equations governing a massive scalar field and compute the
corresponding QNM frequencies numerically using both the continued fraction
method and the matrix method. The numerical results indicate that the QNM
frequencies exhibit increased sensitivity to negative $\ell$ variations, which
reduces the influence of the field mass parameter $\tilde{\mu}$. Meanwhile, the
spectral "cube" of NJA black holes shows slight compression for $m>0$ with $
\ell>0 $ and expansion for $m<0$ with $ \ell>0 $ compared to another black
holes, where $m$ is approximately proportional to the spin parameter at first
order, while richer structures and lifted degeneracy emerge at second order.

Abstract: The production site of heavy r-process elements, such as Gold and Uranium, is
uncertain. Neutron star mergers are the only astrophysical phenomenon in which
we have witnessed their formation. However, the amount of heavy elements
resulting from the merger remains poorly constrained, mainly due to
uncertainties on the mass and angular momentum of the disk formed in the merger
remnant. Matter accretion from the disk is also thought to power gamma
ray-bursts. We discover from numerical relativity simulations that the
accretion disk influences the ringdown gravitational-wave signal produced by
binaries that promptly collapse to black-hole at merger. We propose a method to
\emph{directly} measure the mass of the accretion disk left during black hole
formation in binary mergers using observatories such as the Einstein Telescope
or Cosmic Explorer with a relative error of 10\% for binaries at a distance of
up to 30~Mpc, corresponding to an event rate of 0.001 to 0.25 events per year.

### [95] [Apparent Horizons Associated with Dynamical Black Hole Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14105)
*Hideo Furugori,Kanji Nishii,Daisuke Yoshida,Kaho Yoshimura*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The abstract introduces entropic marginally outer trapped surfaces (E-MOTS) as a generalization of apparent horizons and demonstrates that a specific entropy formula can be expressed using Wall entropy, supporting the concept of dynamical entropy being robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to propose a new concept (E-MOTS) and show a connection between different entropy formulas in black hole physics to validate their interconnectedness and robustness.

Method: Mathematical derivation and perturbative analysis around black holes to establish the relationship between the entropy formulas.

Result: They derived a formula showing how Hollands-Wald-Zhang entropy equals Wall entropy under certain conditions, supporting the idea that dynamic entropy is consistent with stationary states.

Conclusion: The finding solidifies the understanding of dynamic entropy by linking it to the standard Wald entropy under perturbations, enhancing confidence in the entropy formulation's reliability in different black hole states.

Abstract: We define entropic marginally outer trapped surfaces (E-MOTSs) as a
generalization of apparent horizons. We then show that, under first-order
perturbations around a stationary black hole, the dynamical black hole entropy
proposed by Hollands, Wald, and Zhang, defined on a background Killing horizon,
can be expressed as the Wall entropy evaluated on an E-MOTS associated with it.
Our result ensures that the Hollands-Wald-Zhang entropy reduces to the standard
Wald entropy in each stationary regime of a dynamical black hole, thereby
reinforcing the robustness of the dynamical entropy formulation.

Abstract: In the field of high-energy particle detection, detectors operating in
high-radiation environments primarily face high costs associated with power
consumption and cooling systems. Therefore, the development of particle
detectors capable of stable operation at room temperature or even elevated
temperatures is of great significance. Silicon carbide (SiC) exhibits
significant potential for particle detector applications due to its exceptional
carrier mobility, radiation hardness, and thermal stability. Over the past
decade, significant breakthroughs in silicon carbide epitaxial growth
technology and device processing techniques have enabled the development of
SiC-based particle detectors, providing a new technological pathway for
particle detection in high-temperature environments.
  In this work, we fabricate a 4H-SiC PIN detector, named SIlicon CARbide
(SICAR) and characterize its leakage current, capacitance, and charge
collection across varying temperatures. The results indicate that the detector
maintains a very low leakage current (< 10 nA) at 90 C, with no degradation in
depletion capacitance or charge collection performance. Additionally, it
achieves a fast rise time of 333 ps at 90 C, confirming its potential for
high-temperature radiation detection applications.

Abstract: LiquidO is an innovative radiation detector concept. The core idea is to
exploit stochastic light confinement in a highly scattering medium to
self-segment the detector volume. In this paper, we demonstrate event-by-event
muon tracking in a LiquidO opaque scintillator detector prototype. The detector
consists of a 30 mm cubic scintillator volume instrumented with 64
wavelength-shifting fibres arranged in an 8$\times$8 grid with a 3.2 mm pitch
and read out by silicon photomultipliers. A wax-based opaque scintillator with
a scattering length of approximately 0.5 mm is used. The tracking performance
of this LiquidO detector is characterised with cosmic-ray muons and the
position resolution is demonstrated to be 450 $\mu$m per row of fibres. These
results highlight the potential of LiquidO opaque scintillator detectors to
achieve fine spatial resolution, enabling precise particle tracking and

TL;DR: This paper focuses on developing a flexible and self-powered UV detector using diamond and MoS2 materials.

The use of diamond is motivated by its superior UV absorption and mechanical robustness, making it ideal for these applications.

Conclusion: The proposed UV sensing technology offers a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solution for future applications, marking a significant step forward in UV detection for advanced technologies.

Abstract: The escalating demand for ultraviolet (UV) sensing in space exploration,
environmental monitoring, and agricultural productivity necessitates detectors
that are both environmentally and mechanically resilient. Diamond, featuring
its high bandgap and UV absorption, exceptional mechanical/chemical robustness,
and excellent thermal stability, emerges as a highly promising material for
next-generation UV detection in various scenarios. However, conventional
diamond-based UV detectors are constrained by rigid bulk architectures and
reliance on external power supplies, hindering their integration with curved
and flexible platforms and complicating device scalability due to auxiliary
power requirements. To tackle these challenges, herein, we firstly demonstrated
a large-scale, self-powered, and flexible diamond UV detector by
heterogeneously integrating a MoS$_2$ monolayer with an ultrathin, freestanding
diamond membrane. The fabricated device operates at zero external bias, and
simultaneously exhibits a high responsivity of 94 mA W$^{-1}$ at 220 nm, and
detectivity of 5.88 x 109 Jones. Notably, mechanical bending enables
strain-induced bandgap modulation of the diamond membrane, allowing dynamically
tunable photoresponse-a capability absent in rigid diamond counterparts. To
validate its practicality and scalability, a proof-of-concept UV imager with
3x3 pixels was demonstrated. This newly developed configuration will
undoubtedly open up new routes toward scalable, integrable, flexible, and
cost-effective UV sensing solutions for emerging technologies
