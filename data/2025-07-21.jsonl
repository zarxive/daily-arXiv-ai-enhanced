Over the past\ndecade, significant breakthroughs in silicon carbide epitaxial growth\ntechnology and device processing techniques have enabled the development of\nSiC-based particle detectors, providing a new technological pathway for\nparticle detection in high-temperature environments.\n  In this work, we fabricate a 4H-SiC PIN detector, named SIlicon CARbide\n(SICAR) and characterize its leakage current, capacitance, and charge\ncollection across varying temperatures.

While most theoretical efforts\nto date have focused on single-mode cavities, practical implementations in\npolaritonic chemistry typically involve planar optical cavities that support a\nseries of equally spaced photon modes, determined by the cavity geometry.

In such cases, hybridization between a rate-decisive molecular\nvibration and a central resonant cavity mode reshapes the resonance landscape,\nenabling additional reaction pathways mediated by adjacent cavity modes. The\nsecond scenario exploits the intrinsic anharmonicity of molecular vibrations,\nwhich gives rise to multiple dipole-allowed transitions with distinct energies.\nUnder multi-mode strong coupling, where different cavity modes individually\nresonate with these distinct transitions, multi-photon processes involving\nsequential absorption across multiple modes become accessible. This leads to a\nnontrivial and non-additive rate enhancement via cascade-like vibrational\nladder climbing. Together, these findings offer new strategies for tailoring\nchemical reactivity by harnessing the structural richness of multi-mode\nstructure, offering valuable insights for optimal experimental designs in\npolaritonic catalysis."}

To perform this task, we consider the\ndynamics of the chameleon scalar field in the region of galactic halos in\nstatic spherically symmetric spacetimes that differ only slightly from\nclassical general relativity, but have similar symmetry behind this region.\nHence, we demonstrate its ability to act as dark matter. In fact, by obtaining\nthe expression for the tangential speed in this region, we apply this approach\nto explain the issue of flat galactic rotation curves. We obtain that the mass\nassociated with the chameleon scalar field varies linearly with the radius of\ngalaxy, and hence, the tangential speed in that region is constant, which is\nconsistent with observational data without any need to introduce a mysterious\ndark matter. Accordingly, we show that the presented chameleon gravity has a\nwell-defined Newtonian limit and can describe the geometry of spacetime in the\nregion of flat galactic rotation curves, and is consistent with the\ncorresponding results of the $ \\Lambda CDM $ model with the NFW profile. We\nalso consider a test particle moving in a timelike geodesic and obtain the\nfifth-force, which varies proportionally to the inverse of the radius of\ngalaxy.

Many existing formal methods require\nexponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of)\nassertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with\nmany qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called\nSAQR-QC. The logic supports Scalable but Approximate Quantitative Reasoning\nabout Quantum Circuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i)\nsome (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism\nto help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps\nremain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, all\nreasoning steps are local--i.e., they each involve just a small number of\nqubits.

While most theoretical efforts\nto date have focused on single-mode cavities, practical implementations in\npolaritonic chemistry typically involve planar optical cavities that support a\nseries of equally spaced photon modes, determined by the cavity geometry. In\nthis work, we present a numerically exact, fully quantum-mechanical study of\nchemical reactions in few-mode cavities, revealing two key scenarios by which\nmulti-mode effects can enhance cavity-modified reactivity.

Here, we\ninvestigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries,\nnamely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN)\napproaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the\neffective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by\nexpectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic\napproach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical\nalgebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all\nthree formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that\nthese three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished\nby sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two\napproaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including\nrelativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF\ntransformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the\nolder effective approach, by which it was inspired. As a physical application,\nwe explore the QRF covariance of uncertainties and fluctuations, which turn out\nto be frame-dependent. This is particularly well-suited for the effective and\nalgebraic approaches, for which these quantities form a natural basis.
