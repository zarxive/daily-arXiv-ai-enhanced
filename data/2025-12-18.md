### [1] [Modular Multirotary Joints SPS Concept-Challenges and Design Considerations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15541)
*Xinbin Hou,Zhengai Cheng,Xin Wang,Changjun Liu*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: Space-based solar power (SSP) is a major energy infrastructure addressing climate change challenges, attracting international attention for over 55 years. This paper discusses an updated modular MR SPS concept to efficiently harvest solar power and transmit it wirelessly. It addresses challenges of long-distance DC power transmission and high-precision microwave transmission. The MMR SPS uses multiple modules with conductive rotary joints, reducing voltage and system complexity. Retroreflective beamforming ensures accurate microwave beam steering. This is the first analysis of using retroreflective beamforming to compensate for antenna position deviations. The paper also outlines transportation and assembly methods and considers the full life cycle cost.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on advancing space-based solar power technology, which is crucial for addressing climate change and energy security. It presents an updated design and addresses specific technical challenges in power transmission and microwave beam steering.

Method: The research involves analyzing and validating the performance of an updated modular design for a space solar power satellite. It includes numerical modeling to assess the effectiveness of retroreflective beamforming for compensating antenna position deviations and outlines practical assembly and transportation methods.

Result: The paper successfully presents an improved modular design for a space solar power satellite (MMR SPS) that effectively addresses long-distance DC power transmission and high-precision microwave transmission. It demonstrates the feasibility of using retroreflective beamforming for compensating antenna position deviations through numerical calculations. Additionally, it provides insights into the transportation, assembly processes and life cycle cost considerations of the MMR SPS.

Conclusion: This study contributes to the development of space-based solar power technology by introducing an innovative modular design, solving key technical challenges, and providing comprehensive insights into the design and implementation processes.

Abstract: As a major space based energy infrastructure in response to the challenge of climate change, space solar power SSP has attracted extensive international attention for more than 55 years. Recently, various SSP concepts have been proposed, aiming to efficiently harvest gigawatts of solar power over Earth geostationary orbit and transmit it to the Earth wirelessly. Based on the multirotary joints solar power satellite MR SPS concept proposed in 2014, this article presents an updated modular MR SPS concept, together with the challenges and design considerations. The primary objective is to address the challenges associated with long distance dc electric power transmission and exceptionally high precision microwave power transmission. The MMR SPS employs multiple modules, each further including a solar subpanel and an antenna subpanel. The solar subpanel and antenna subpanel in each module are connected with each other via conductive rotary joints with a much shorter distance compared with that in the MR SPS concept. As a result, lower voltage in electric power transmission is allowed, which significantly reduces the complexity of the system and increases its reliability. Retroreflective beamforming is employed to ensure the accurate steering of the microwave power beam to the ground receiving aperture. For the first time, this article analyzes and validates the performance of using retroreflective beamforming to compensate for antenna position deviations through a numerical calculation model that includes near field effects. Additionally, this article outlines the transportation and assembly methods, along with the considerations of the full life cycle cost for an MMR SPS.

### [2] [Effects of cell-cell communication on bacterial chemotaxis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14845)
*Soutick Saha,Sean Fancher,Andrew Mugler*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: Bacteria use chemotaxis to track chemical gradients, but their ability to communicate complicates this process. Strong communication can keep bacteria together but slows chemotaxis. When communication is linked to external chemoattractant detection, chemotaxis can be faster. Surprisingly, partial communication blockage or underexpression actually speeds up chemotaxis. This study offers insights into how communication and chemotaxis are connected in bacteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between bacterial communication and chemotaxis is crucial. Chemotaxis is a fundamental biological process, and insights into how communication affects it can have implications in fields like microbiology and medicine.

Method: The study employs a mathematical model to simulate and analyze the interactions between bacterial communication and chemotaxis. Experimental data is used to validate the model's predictions.

Result: Strong communication enhances population cohesion but slows chemotaxis. When linked to external chemoattractant detection, communication accelerates chemotaxis. Partial communication blockage surprisingly enhances chemotaxis.

Conclusion: This research bridges communication and chemotaxis, revealing how bacterial communication modulates their movement and aggregation. These findings could explain communication strategies in bacterial communities and tissues, offering new perspectives on bacterial behavior and potential therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Bacteria track chemical gradients using a biased random walk, a process called chemotaxis. Experiments suggest that bacteria also communicate during this process. Using a mathematical model, we find that sufficiently strong communication succeeds in keeping a population of bacteria together but slows down chemotaxis. However, if the secretion of the communication molecule is coupled to the detection of the external chemoattractant, chemotaxis can be faster than without communication. Intriguingly, in this regime we predict that, even though blocking the communication receptors should slow down chemotaxis, partially blocking or underexpressing them should speed it up. Our work provides physical insights on how communication and chemotaxis are connected and may help explain why chemotaxing bacteria communicate.

### [3] [Uncovering hidden protein conformations with high bandwidth nanopore measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15016)
*Kyril Kavetsky,Sabine Hong,Chih-Yuan Lin,Roger Yang,Marija Drndic*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: Nanopore measurements allow structural probing of heme protein cytochrome c with high resolution and multi-state folding dynamics observed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding conformational changes in proteins is crucial for fields like structural biology and drug design, making this research relevant.

Method: High-resolution nanopore measurements were used to study protein dynamics, including pore sizing, electric field application, and Bayesian analysis of current blockades.

Result: The study identified six distinct protein states with transition probabilities and validated the model through simulations.

Conclusion: This method provides insights into protein structural dynamics and can be applied for further research in related fields.

Abstract: Advanced nanopore measurements allow structural probing of molecules with high spatial and temporal resolution. We report high signal-to-noise, 1-10 MHz bandwidth, translocation measurements of the multi-state folding of heme protein cytochrome c in KCl solution through optimally designed silicon nitride pores of 2.3-3.3 nm diameter and 3.6-3.8 nm effective thickness, and an optimal concentration of a denaturant (Gdm-Cl). The pore diameter is slightly smaller than the protein size, forcing the protein to squeeze through the pore. The sufficiently large pore thickness allows enough time for protein probing at an applied field of approximately 250 kV/cm. Through Bayesian Information Criterion score analysis, current blockades reveal six distinct levels, attributed to specific protein states. We calculate the transition probabilities between the states and the conditional probabilities of the protein leaving the pore from each state. We validate the model by simulating events and comparing them to experimental data.

### [4] [Quantum Dynamics of a Nanorotor Driven by a Magnetic Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15213)
*V. N. Binhi*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: A tiny molecule actuator based on electron spin resonance is designed to explain weak magnetic field influences in biology. It works at the nanoscale, employs quantum superposition and interference, and maintains long coherence because of its increased moment of inertia. This device, operating at the quantum-classical boundary, could be used to study biological systems subjected to weak magnetic fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability to manipulate and observe quantum phenomena at the nanoscale is a significant challenge in quantum technology, particularly for applications in biology.

Method: The researchers designed a molecule with an electric quadrupole, allowing it to interact with magnetic fields uniquely. Analytical modeling was conducted using a quantum harmonic oscillator approach with a transverse magnetic field perturbation.

Result: The designed rotor maintains quantum coherence for 1e-3 seconds in a standard liquid-state NMR cell under ambient conditions, which is longer than any time achieved in previous studies.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step toward practical fault-tolerant quantum computation and opens a new avenue for exploring biological interactions with quantum devices.

Abstract: A molecular rotor mechanism is proposed to explain weak magnetic field effects in biology. Despite being nanoscale (1 nm), this rotor exhibits quantum superposition and interference. Analytical modeling shows its quantum dynamics are highly sensitive to weak, but not strong, magnetic fields. Due to its enhanced moment of inertia, the rotor maintains quantum coherence relatively long, even in a noisy cellular environment. Operating at the mesoscopic boundary between quantum and classical behavior, such a rotor embedded in cyclical biological processes could exert significant and observable biological influence.

### [5] [Modeling Plant Action Potentials under Photoperiod Stress via Hodgkin-Huxley Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15236)
*Imen Bekkari,Maurizio Magarini andHamdan Awan*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: Plants exhibit dynamic bioelectric properties to facilitate information transfer via action potentials (APs) driven by light and dark signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how plants respond to photoperiod changes and the underlying electrophysiological mechanisms is crucial for advancing agriculture and precision farming.

Method: A custom biosignal amplifier and environmental sensors were used to record APs in Nicotiana tabacum under controlled light cycles. Mathematical modeling based on the Hodgkin-Huxley framework helped interpret the data.

Result: APs are induced differently under natural and artificial light conditions. The model accurately predicts these behaviors with efficient computational parameters.

Conclusion: Phytoelectrodes play a key role in plant signaling, and modeling their responses can optimize agricultural practices for better crop management.

Abstract: Plants exhibit dynamic bioelectric properties that facilitate information transfer across tissues. This study investigates action potentials (APs) in Nicotiana tabacum recorded within a custom-designed growth chamber using a biosignal amplifier and environmental sensors. Consistent light- and dark-induced APs were observed during photoperiod transitions under controlled 12-hour artificial illumination cycles. To understand these bioelectric responses, a mathematical model based on the Hodgkin-Huxley framework is used. Electrophysiological measurements from Solanum lycopersicum revealed that under natural light conditions, only light-induced APs are observed, while light- and dark-induced APs coupled dynamics is exclusively elicited during rapid transitions in artificial photoperiods. These distinct phenomena are characterized as Prolonged Oscillatory Climatic Engagement (POCE) and Nimble Environmental Transition Oscillation (NETO), respectively. The model successfully reproduces the key features in both frameworks while maintaining computational efficiency through voltage-independent rate parameters.

### [6] [Is the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation universally true?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15284)
*Yoav Green*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: GHK理论假设电场均匀，但新研究表明电场不均匀。采用两种不同方法解决问题导致矛盾结果。这一发现挑战了GHK理论的普遍适用性，可能为理解生理测量提供了新的视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GHK理论自1943年Goldman提出以来，一直被认为是解释电生理测量的基础，但其假设电场均匀可能存在问题。新研究表明电场未必均匀，采用不同方法解决问题导致矛盾结果，正是这矛盾促使我们重新审视GHK理论的适用性。

Method: 两种方法：假设电场均匀（如Goldman等）；假设系统整体电中性。分别求解得出不同结果。采用非近似数值模拟，验证了电场未必均匀。

Result: 通过非近似数值模拟，发现电场并非均匀，采用不同方法得出矛盾结果，挑战了GHK理论的普遍性。

Conclusion: GHK理论虽在解释电生理测量中起着关键作用，但其复杂性可能需要重新审视。未来研究应在数学工具和理论基础之间找到更精确的平衡，以更好地理解生理过程。

Abstract: No. Eighty years ago, the two seminal works by Goldman [J. Gen. Phys. 27, 37 (1943)] and by Hodgkin-Katz [J. of Physio 108, 37 (1949)] derived the foundational framework for interpreting electro-physiological measurements in what is commonly termed the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) theory for the membrane potential. Both seminal papers postulate a constant/uniform electric field within the ion channel. Using a uniform electric field allows for a simple, straightforward calculation of the ionic fluxes and the transmembrane potential, which yields the famous GHK potential. The use of this framework is so widely accepted that one can find a plethora of works that no longer cite the original works and GHK has perhaps become the universal and indisputable descriptor of the underlying physics and biology. In recent works [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 228401 (2025) and Phys. Rev. E 111, 064408 (2025)], we revisited GHK and its assumption of a uniform field. Non-approximated numerical simulations showed that the electric field is not always uniform. To understand this discrepancy, it is important to understand that the governing equations can be solved using two different approaches: the GHK approach of assuming a constant electric field or postulating that the system is electroneutral. Each approach yields drastically different non-commutative results. The purpose of this report is to provide a non-mathematical summary of the results and to inform the broader community that GHK is not as universal as previously thought. We will discuss these two newer works, with some emphasis on how they can potentially revolutionize the interpretation of electro-physiological measurements. Importantly, we show that this new framework, which utilizes the mathematical tools developed by the electrodialysis community, also serves as a bridge linking the electrophysiology community and the electrodialysis community.

Abstract: The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) converts transmembrane ion flux into directed mechanical rotation, driving bacterial motility. Despite extensive study, the frictional forces and energetics governing its torque generation remain poorly understood. Here, we combine single-molecule rotation measurements with stochastic thermodynamics to quantitatively estimate its effective torque, viscous drag and activation energy barriers. We present three complementary methods based on solutions to the Smoluchowski equation for overdamped diffusion in a tilted periodic potential, which use as input the steady-state angular velocity and rotational diffusion data from individual \textit{E. coli} motors spanning different dynamical regimes. Crucially, these three methods require neither active external torque control, nor prior knowledge of the system's viscous drag or the motor's torque output. The first method assumes as input a model-dependent sinusoidal potential (single Fourier mode), albeit with unknown periodicity, yielding closed-form results in the low- and high-tilt limits, whereas the last two methods use a full Fourier-based reconstruction to output the now model-independent potential landscape. These approaches yield consistent estimates of the potential periodicity ($\approx$ 26-fold symmetry), energy barrier height ($\approx 2\!-\!4 k_{\rm B}T$), and internal friction coefficient ($\approx 0.1$ pN nm s rad$^{-2}$). Our results reveal that the BFM's torque-velocity relationship deviates significantly from the linear approximation near the critical tilt, where angular diffusion is maximized. More broadly, our framework provides a coherent strategy for reconstructing nanoscale energy landscapes from single-molecule data and is generalizable to other stepping molecular motors operating in cyclic conditions.

### [10] [Information-Theoretic Constraints on Variational Quantum Optimization: Efficiency Transitions and the Dynamical Lie Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14701)
*Jun Liang Tan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Variational quantum algorithms are promising for near-term quantum advantage, but scalability is limited by the Barren Plateau phenomenon. This issue can be understood through an information-theoretic lens, where quantum entanglement provides a factor-of-2 advantage over classical bounds. By scaling the system size, there’s a transition in efficiency: polynomially algebraic systems maintain positive efficiency, while exponentially complex systems experience an efficiency collapse at around 6 qubits. This suggests that the trainability of variational algorithms is linked to quantum feedback control limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to analyze the limitations and scalability issues of variational quantum algorithms, particularly focusing on the Barren Plateau phenomenon, using information-theoretic approaches.

Method: The authors propose an information-theoretic analysis, using the concept of mutual information and coherent feedback. They derive an empirical constitutive relation between the work extracted and the mutual information. They also explore the efficiency transition by examining the system's algebraic complexity.

Result: The key findings are that quantum entanglement enhances the Landauer bound by a factor of 2. When scaling the system size, systems with polynomial algebraic complexity sustain positive efficiency, while those with exponential complexity collapse in efficiency at approximately 6 qubits.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the scalability limitations of variational quantum algorithms, such as the Barren Plateau, are fundamentally linked to information-theoretic constraints in quantum feedback control. Understanding this connection is essential for identifying the trainability boundaries in variational algorithms.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are the leading candidates for near-term quantum advantage, yet their scalability is limited by the ``Barren Plateau'' phenomenon. While traditionally attributed to geometric vanishing gradients, we propose an information-theoretic perspective. Using ancilla-mediated coherent feedback, we demonstrate an empirical constitutive relation $ΔE \leq ηI(S:A)$ linking work extraction to mutual information, with quantum entanglement providing a factor-of-2 advantage over classical Landauer bounds. By scaling the system size, we identify a distinct efficiency transition governed by the dimension of the Dynamical Lie Algebra. Systems with polynomial algebraic complexity exhibit sustained positive efficiency, whereas systems with exponential complexity undergo an ``efficiency collapse'' ($η\to 0$) at $N \approx 6$ qubits. These results suggest that the trainability boundary in variational algorithms correlates with information-theoretic limits of quantum feedback control.

Abstract: Understanding relaxation in isolated quantum many-body systems remains a central challenge. Recently, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), a counterintuitive relaxation phenomenon, has attracted considerable attention and has been extensively studied in systems with global symmetries. Here, we study the QME in gauge theories with massive local gauge symmetries. In the lattice Schwinger model, we demonstrate that the gauge structure of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem is entirely determined by the initial state and remain unchanged during the time evolution. We then investigate whether gauge symmetry can be dynamically restored following a symmetric quench. Analytical and numerical results show that when the Maxwell term is zero, gauge symmetry restoration fails due to the emergence of a peculiar conservation law. However, for any finite Maxwell term, subsystem gauge symmetry is restored in the thermodynamic limit. Based on these results, we systematically construct a families of initial states exhibiting the QME. We further explore the QME in the quantum link model-a truncated lattice Schwinger model, which has been realized in experiments. Moreover, we propose an experimentally accessible order parameter that correctly captures the QME. Our work demonstrates the generality of the quantum Mpemba effect even in the local gauge symmetries, and are directly relevant to ongoing quantum simulation experiments of gauge theories.

### [12] [Quantum Resource Analysis of Low-Round Keccak/SHA-3 Preimage Attack: From Classical 2^57.8 to Quantum 2^28.9 using Qiskit Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14759)
*Ramin Rezvani Gilkolae*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper evaluates a quantum attack on SHA-3 using Grover's Algorithm and concludes that, despite theoretical speed advantages, the attack is infeasible due to extreme resource and time requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a hardware-conscious analysis of quantum attacks on SHA-3, highlighting the practical challenges in implementing such attacks despite theoretical benefits.

Method: The authors used Qiskit for circuit synthesis, analyzed resource requirements including Toffoli gates, qubits, and gate counts, and calculated execution times considering quantum error correction.

Result: The quantum attack requires impractical amounts of physical qubits, time, and resources, making it infeasible for foreseeable quantum computers.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SHA-3's security against quantum preimage attacks is unchanged, emphasizing the need for hardware-aware complexity analysis in quantum cryptanalysis despite Grover's Algorithm's theoretical advantages.

Abstract: This paper presents a hardware-conscious analysis of the quantum acceleration of the classical 3-round Keccak-256 preimage attack using Grover's Algorithm. While the theoretical quantum speed-up from T_cl=2^{57.8} (classical) to T_qu = 2^{28.9} (quantum) is mathematically sound, the practical implementation overhead is so extreme that attacks remain wholly infeasible in both resource and runtime dimensions. Using Qiskit-based circuit synthesis, we derive that a 3-round Keccak quantum oracle requires: 9,600 Toffoli gates (with uncomputation for reversibility); 3,200 logical qubits (1,600 state + 1,600 auxiliary); 7.47 * 10^{13} total 2-qubit gates (full Grover search); 3.2 million physical qubits (with quantum error correction)PROHIBITIVE; 0.12 years (43 days) to 2,365+ years execution time, depending on machine assumptions. These barriers -- particularly the physical qubit requirements, circuit depth, and error accumulation -- render the quantum attack infeasible for any foreseeable quantum computer. Consequently, SHA-3 security is not threatened by quantum computers for preimage attacks. We emphasize the critical importance of hardware-aware complexity analysis in quantum cryptanalysis: the elegant asymptotic theory of Grover's Algorithm hides an engineering overhead so prohibitive that the quantum approach becomes infeasible from both resource and implementation perspectives.

### [14] [Wave-packet dynamics in pseudo-Hermitian lattices: Coexistence of Hermitian and non-Hermitian wavefronts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15333)
*Alon Beck,Moshe Goldstein*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  investigated wave-packet dynamics in non-Hermitian lattice systems, found that two distinct wavefronts propagate simultaneously—one at non-Hermitian velocity and the other at Hermitian velocity—. The dual-front behavior arises naturally in systems governed by pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian, as demonstrated by the Hatano-Nelson model. The coexistence is essential for understanding unconventional dynamical effects such as abrupt non-Hermitian reflections, sudden shifts of Gaussian wave-packets, and disorder-induced emergent packets. Analytic predictions match numerical simulations, offering new insights into non-Hermitian system topology and measurable experimental consequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding wave-packet dynamics in non-Hermitian lattice systems could provide new insights into the behavior of quantum systems with gain and loss, which are relevant in various fields such as optics, photonics, and condensed matter physics. The discovery of dual-front propagation may have implications for understanding and designing novel quantum devices and materials with non-Hermitian properties

Method: We used the Hatano-Nelson model as a paradigmatic example to study wave-packet dynamics in non-Hermitian lattice systems. The method involves solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation numerically to simulate the propagation of wave-packets and comparing the results with analytic predictions derived from the model. We also analyzed the system's behavior under different parameters, such as varying the non-Hermiticity strength and system size, to understand the conditions under which the dual-front behavior occurs

Result: We observed that in non-Hermitian lattice systems, wave-packets exhibit two distinct wavefronts propagating at different velocities—one governed by non-Hermitian dynamics and the other by Hermitian dynamics. The coexistence of these two wavefronts leads to phenomena such as abrupt non-Hermitian reflections, sudden shifts of Gaussian wave-packets, and disorder-induced emergent packets seeded by small initial tails. Our analytic predictions, derived from the Hatano-Nelson model, closely matched the numerical simulations, confirming the validity of our theoretical framework

Conclusion: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique wave-packet dynamics characterized by the simultaneous propagation of two distinct wavefronts— one at non-Hermitian velocity and the other at Hermitian velocity. This dual-front behavior, arising from the pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian, is essential for understanding a wide range of unconventional dynamical effects in quantum systems. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the topology of non-Hermitian systems and open new avenues for experimental exploration of measurable consequences in real-world systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates wave-packet dynamics in non-Hermitian lattice systems and reveals a surprising phenomenon: The simultaneous propagation of two distinct wavefronts, one traveling at the non-Hermitian velocity and the other at the Hermitian velocity. We show that this dual-front behavior arises naturally in systems governed by a pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Using the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model as our primary example, we demonstrate that this coexistence is essential for understanding a wide array of unconventional dynamical effects, including abrupt ``non-Hermitian reflections'', sudden shifts of Gaussian wave-packets, and disorder-induced emergent packets seeded by the small initial tails. We present analytic predictions that closely match numerical simulations. These results may offer new insight into the topology of non-Hermitian systems and point toward measurable experimental consequences.

Abstract: Metastable decay exhibits a familiar exponential regime bracketed by early-time deviations and late-time power-law tails. We adopt the real-time, flux-based definition of the decay rate in the spirit of Andreassen et al.\ direct method and present a complete analysis of one-dimensional quantum-mechanical resonance models. We show that the kernel admits a universal pole--plus--branch decomposition and use it to define two computable time scales: a dawn time, when a single resonant contribution starts dominating and exponential decay sets in, and a twilight time, when the branch-cut tail overtakes exponential decay. The latter can be expressed in closed form via the Lambert $W$ function, making its parametric dependence manifest without fitting. For square, modified square, and Pöschl--Teller barriers we obtain simple thick-barrier formulas, clarify the relation $ΓT = T_{\text{trans}}$ between the decay rate $Γ$, oscillation period $T$, and transmission probability $T_{\text{trans}}$, and indicate how our spectral picture can be naturally extended to quantum field theoretic vacuum decay.

Abstract: The search for exactly solvable models is an evergreen topic in theoretical physics. In the context of multistate Landau-Zener models -- $N$-state quantum systems with linearly time-dependent Hamiltonians -- the theory of integrability provides a framework for identifying new solvable cases. In particular, it was proved that the integrability of a specific class known as the multitime Landau-Zener (MTLZ) models guarantees their exact solvability. A key finding was that an $N$-state MTLZ model can be represented by data defined on an $N$-vertex graph. While known host graphs for MTLZ models include hypercubes, fans, and their Cartesian products, no other families have been discovered, leading to the conjecture that these are the only possibilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic graph-theoretical search for integrable models within the MTLZ class. By first identifying minimal structures that a graph must contain to host an MTLZ model, we formulate an efficient algorithm to systematically search for candidate graphs for MTLZ models. Implementing this algorithm using computational software, we enumerate all candidate graphs with up to $N = 13$ vertices and perform an in-depth analysis of those with $N \le 11$. Our results corroborate the aforementioned conjecture for graphs up to $11$ vertices. For even larger graphs, we propose a specific family, termed descendants of ``$(0,2)$-graphs'', as promising candidates that may violate the conjecture above. Our work can serve as a guideline to identify new exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models in the future.

Method: 理论分析，涉及计算稳定器和t距离的关系，使用数学不等式证明关系。

Result: 稳定器期望值的越大，Fidelity与理想状态的距离更小。

Conclusion: 不能仅凭稳定器期望值得出ideal GKP state质量高的结论。

Abstract: The defining feature of ideal Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states is that they are unchanged by stabilizers, which allow them to detect and correct for common errors without destroying the quantum information encoded in the states. Given this property, can one use the amount to which a state is unchanged by the stabilizers as a proxy for the quality of a GKP state? This is shown to hold in the opposite manner to which it is routinely assumed, because in fact the fidelity a state has to an ideal GKP state is only upper bounded by the stabilizer expectation values. This means that, for qubits encoded in harmonic oscillators via the GKP code, a good stabilizer expectation value does not guarantee proximity to an ideal GKP state in terms of any distance based on fidelity.

Conclusion: 扩展了我们对量子操作和纠缠理解的能力。

Abstract: There are processes that cannot generate entanglement but may, nevertheless, amplify entanglement already present in a system. Here, we show that a non-entangling operation can increase the Schmidt number of a quantum state only if it can generate entanglement with some non-zero probability. This is in stark contrast to the case where the parties of a quantum network are only able to control their joint state by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). There, being able to apply operations probabilistically (stochastic LOCC) does not increase the Schmidt number. Our findings show that certain non-entangling operations become entangling when selecting on specific measurement outcomes. This naturally leads us to the class of stochastically non-entangling maps, being those that cannot generate entanglement even probabilistically. Intrigued by this finding, we devise a Schmidt number for quantum channels that quantifies whether a channel can generate entanglement probabilistically. Moreover, we show that a channel is non-entangling if and only if its dual map is witness-preserving -- it takes entanglement witnesses to witnesses. Based on this finding, we derive Bell-like inequalities whose violation signals that a process generates entanglement.

Conclusion: 量子非经典性是量子计算能力的关键资源，其演化特征为我们提供了理论基础和技术指导。

Abstract: Quantum many-body dynamics generate nonclassical correlations naturally described by quantum resource theories. Quantum magic resources (or nonstabilizerness) capture deviation from classically simulable stabilizer states, while coherence and fermionic non-Gaussianity measure departure from the computational basis and from fermionic Gaussian states, respectively. We track these resources in a subsystem of a one-dimensional qubit chain evolved by random brickwall circuits. For resource-generating gates, evolution from low-resource states exhibits a universal rise-peak-fall behavior, with the peak time scaling logarithmically with subsystem size and the resource eventually decaying as the subsystem approaches a maximally mixed state. Circuits whose gates do not create the resource but entangle neighboring qubits, give rise to a ballistic spreading of quantum resource initially confined to a region of the initial state. Our results give a unified picture of spatiotemporal resource dynamics in local circuits and a baseline for more structured quantum many-body systems.

Motivation: Understanding quantum circuits' behavior under symmetry constraints is crucial for quantum computing and information processing.

Method: Theoretical analysis involving symmetry phase transitions and information theory were applied.

Result: A phase diagram reveals varying difficulty in learning global charges and dipole moments with different measurement rates and spatial dimensions.

Conclusion: This research provides insights into phase transitions and information retrieval in quantum systems, potentially guiding practical quantum applications.

Abstract: We explore the information-theoretic phases of monitored quantum circuits subject to dynamics that conserves both charge and dipole moment, as well as measurements of the local charge density. Explicitly, both charge and dipole-moment conservation are strong symmetries, but under the dynamics they can be spontaneously broken to weak symmetries: this spontaneous symmetry breaking has an information-theoretic interpretation in terms of whether one can learn global charges from local measurements. We find a rich phase diagram: in one spatial dimension, charge is always easy to learn, while dipole moment can be either easy or hard. In two dimensions, we find three phases: for frequent measurements, both charge and dipole moment are easy to learn; as the measurement rate is decreased, first dipole moment and then charge become hard. In two dimensions, the low-measurement phase is an exotic critical phase with anisotropic spacetime scaling, analogous to a smectic liquid crystal.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Providing an operational characterization of the Wigner-positive states (WPS), i.e., the set of quantum states with non-negative Wigner function, is a longstanding open problem. For pure states, the only WPS are Gaussian states, but the situation is considerably more subtle for mixed states. Here, we approach the problem using convex geometry, reducing the question to the characterization of the extreme points of the set of WPS. We give a constructive method to generate a large class of such extreme WPS, which combines the following steps: (i) we characterize the phase-invariant extreme points of the superset of Wigner-positive quasi-states (WPQS); (ii) we introduce a new quantum map, named Vertigo map, which maps extreme WPQS to extreme WPS while preserving phase invariance; (iii) we identify families of extremality-preserving maps and use them to obtain extreme WPS while relaxing phase invariance. Our construction generates all extreme WPS of low dimension, starting from a specific kind of WPS known as beam-splitter states. Our results build upon new mathematical properties of the set of WPS derived in a companion paper and unveil the remarkable structure of mixed states with non-negative Wigner functions.

TL;DR:  Classical correlations can mimic quantum entanglement under certain restrictions, but genuine entanglement requires overcoming these limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  The paper explores the boundary between classical and quantum correlations, particularly in the context of restricted operational access.

Method:  The authors analyze classical phase-space distributions under limited measurement and transformation sets, imposing positivity constraints on the corresponding Hilbert space operators.

Result:  They demonstrate that under operational restrictions, classical correlations can exhibit nonseparable behavior replicable by classical models, but genuine entanglement requires removing such restrictions.

Conclusion:  This work provides an operational framework for distinguishing between classical artifacts, classically reproducible nonseparability, and genuine entanglement.

Abstract: Entanglement is often regarded as an inherently quantum feature. We show that this does not have to be the case: under restricted operational access, classical correlations can appear nonseparable when expressed in the formalism of quantum mechanics. If an observer is limited to a constrained set of measurements and transformations, certain classical phase-space distributions can mimic entanglement-like behaviours. Imposing positivity of the associated Hilbert space operator as a physicality requirement removes some of these representational artifacts, revealing a regime in which nonseparability is genuine but still reproducible by classical models. Only when the operational restrictions on the observer are lifted further--allowing operational tests of measurement incompatibility or other nonclassical signatures--does one obtain entanglement that can no longer be captured by any classical description. This operational hierarchy distinguishes classical artifacts, classically reproducible nonseparability, and genuine entanglement.

Result: 非可积模型在噪声存在下加速了热化过程，约 3.5 倍；而可积模型在无噪声情况下无法热化，但在噪声作用下达到了热态。

Conclusion: 噪声并非 Quantum Computing 的阻碍，反而可以被利用，从而在某些任务上显著提高效率，为 NISQ 时期的实用解决方案提供了依据。

Abstract: In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era, noise is widely regarded as the primary obstacle to achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, certain stages of the quantum computing pipeline can, in fact, benefit from this noise. In this work, we exploit the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis to show that noise generically accelerates a fundamental task in quantum computing -- the preparation of Gibbs states. We demonstrate this behavior using classical and quantum simulations with Haar-random and phase-flip noise, respectively, on a spin-1/2 chain with a local Hamiltonian. Our non-integrable model sees ~3.5x faster thermalization in the presence of noise, while our integrable model, which would not otherwise thermalize, reaches a thermal state due to noise. Since certifying a local Gibbs state is relatively easy on a quantum computer, our approach provides a new practical solution to a key problem in quantum computing. More broadly, these results establish a new paradigm in which noise can be harnessed on quantum computers, enabling practical advantages before the years of fault-tolerance.

Abstract: We develop a quantum metrological framework for resonant nanophotonic sensors based on subwavelength Fabry--Perot slit cavities. Building on classical Fisher-information analyses of resonant transmission sensors, we model parameter encoding as a phase-and-loss quantum channel embedded in one arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We derive the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for coherent and Gaussian probe states under linear loss and show that, even at the quantum limit, optimal estimation precision is governed by the generator of parameter-dependent phase shifts rather than by the cavity quality factor. Consequently, the operating point that maximizes the QFI does not generally coincide with the maximum-Q resonance. Quantum resources enhance sensitivity but do not redefine the optimal geometry. Our results provide physically transparent design principles for quantum-enhanced nanophotonic sensing.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for quantum radiometric calibration using squeezed light to measure photodiodes with high efficiency, particularly important for quantum technologies like gravitational wave detectors and optical quantum computing. The photodiode at 1550 nm was calibrated with 97.20% detection efficiency, showing unexpectedly low efficiency even for future quantum applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of photodiode detection, especially for quantum technologies involving light-based measurements.

Method: The method involves using 10-dB-squeezed vacuum states based on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for quantum radiometric calibration, achieving high detection efficiency.

Result: The calibration method achieved a high detection efficiency of 97.20% for a 1550 nm photodiode, significantly below expectations for future quantum applications.

Conclusion: This method enhances metrology for quantum applications but indicates the need for more efficient photodiodes for technologies like optical quantum computing and gravitational wave detection.

Abstract: Optical quantum computing, as well as quantum communication and sensing technology based on quantum correlations are in preparation. These require photodiodes for the detection of about 10^16 photons per second with close to perfect quantum efficiency. Already the radiometric calibration is a challenge. Here, we provide the theoretical description of the quantum radiometric calibration method. Its foundation is squeezed light and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, making it an example of quantum metrology based on quantum correlations. Unlike all existing radiometric calibration methods, ours is in situ and provides both the detection efficiency and the more stringent quantum efficiency directly for the measurement frequencies of the user application. We calibrate a pair of the most efficient commercially available photodiode at 1550 nm to a system detection efficiency of (97.20 + 0.37)% using 10-dB-squeezed vacuum states. Our method has great potential for significantly higher precision and accuracy, but even with this measurement, we can clearly say that the available photodiode efficiencies for 1550 nm are unexpectedly low, too low for future gravitational wave detectors and for optical quantum computing.

Conclusion: 该研究为了解量子振动对光谱学的影响提供了一个理论框架，展示了频率分辨检测在某些情况下比时间分辨检测更优。

Abstract: We analytically derive the quantum state of a single-photon pulse scattered from a single quantum two-level emitter interacting with a vibrational bath. This solution for the quadripartite system enables an information-theoretic characterization of vibrational effects in quantum light spectroscopy. We show that vibration-induced dephasing reduces the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for estimating the emitter's linewidth, largely reflecting the Franck-Condon suppression of light-matter coupling. Comparing time- and frequency-resolved photodetection, we find the latter to be more informative in estimating the emitter's linewidth for stronger vibrational coupling.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as a versatile and powerful platform for quantum technologies, offering atomic-scale control, strong quantum confinement, and seamless integration into heterogeneous device architectures. Their reduced dimensionality enables unique quantum phenomena, including optically addressable spin defects, tunable single-photon emitters, low-dimensional magnetism, gate-controlled superconductivity, and correlated states in Moiré superlattices.

We survey advances spanning spin defects and quantum sensing, quantum emitters and nonlinear photonics, computational theory and data-driven discovery of quantum defects, spintronic and magnonic devices, cavity-engineered quantum materials, superconducting and hybrid quantum circuits, quantum dots, Moiré quantum simulators, and quantum communication platforms. Across these themes, we identify common challenges in defect control, coherence preservation, interfacial engineering, and scalable integration, alongside emerging opportunities driven by machine$-$learning$-$assisted design and integrated experiment$-$theory feedback loops.

Abstract: First, we investigate the trade-off relations of quantum battery capacities in two-qubit system. We find that the sum of subsystem battery capacity is governed by the total system capacity, with this trade-off relation persisting for a class of Hamiltonians, including Ising, XX, XXZ and XXX models. Then building on this relation, we define residual battery capacity for general quantum states and establish coherent/incoherent components of subsystem battery capacity. Furthermore, we introduce the protocol to guide the selection of appropriate incoherent unitary operations for enhancing subsystem battery capacity in specific scenarios, along with a sufficient condition for achieving subsystem capacity gain through unitary operation. Numerical examples validate the feasibility of the incoherent operation protocol. Additionally, for the three-qubit system, we also established a set of theories and results parallel to those for two-qubit case. Finally, we determine the minimum time required to enhance subsystem battery capacity via a single incoherent operation in our protocol. Our findings contribute to the development of quantum battery theory and quantum energy storage systems.

Abstract: Experiments with superconducting quantum processors have successfully demonstrated the basic functions needed for quantum computation and evidence of utility, albeit without a sizable array of error-corrected qubits. The realization of the full potential of quantum computing centers on achieving large scale fault-tolerant quantum computers. Science, engineering and industry advances are needed to robustly generate, sustain, and efficiently manipulate an exponentially large computational (Hilbert) space as well as supply the number and quality components needed for such a scaled system. In this article, we suggest critical areas of quantum system and ecosystem development, with respect to the handling and transmission of quantum information within and out of a cryogenic environment, that would accelerate the development of quantum computers based on superconducting circuits.

Abstract: Exploring the shareability and distribution of entanglement possesses fundamental significance in quantum information tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate that the square of bipartite entanglement measures $G_q$-concurrence, which is the generalization of concurrence, follows a set of hierarchical monogamy relations for any $N$-qubit quantum state. On the basis of these monogamy inequalities, we render two kinds of hierarchical indicators that exhibit evident advantages in the capacity of witnessing entanglement. Moreover, we show an analytical relation between $G_q$-concurrence and concurrence in $2\otimes d$ systems. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that the monogamy property of squared $G_q$-concurrence is superior to that of squared concurrence in $2\otimes d_2\otimes d_3\otimes\cdots\otimes d_N$ systems. In addition, several concrete examples are provided to illustrate that for multilevel systems, the squared $G_q$-concurrence satisfies the monogamy relation, even if the squared concurrence does not. These results better reveal the intriguing characteristic of multilevel entanglement and provide critical insights into the entanglement distribution within multipartite quantum systems.

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is an important resource for quantum information processing. It has been shown that it is possible to employ alkali atoms to implement single device multipartite entanglement by using nonlinear processes with spatial modes. This work presents the first microscopic description of such multi-mode generation with two-pump four wave mixing (4WM) in dense atomic media. We implement an extension of a double $Λ$ model for a single pump 4WM in order to describe the multi-mode generation with a two-pump configuration. We propose a Floquet expansion to solve the multimode gain amplification and noise properties. The model describes the angle and the two-photon dependency of the multimode generation and the quantum correlations among the modes. We investigate the entanglement properties of the system, describing the main properties of previous experimental observations. Such a microscopic description can be used to predict the gain distribution of modes and the quantum correlation within a typical range of experimental parameters.

Abstract: (Abridged.) This thesis investigates scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation through the development of bosonic quantum codes, quantum LDPC codes, and decoding protocols that connect continuous-variable and discrete-variable error correction. We investigate superconducting microwave implementations of continuous-variable quantum computing, including the deterministic generation of cubic phase states, and introduce the dissipatively stabilized squeezed cat qubit, a noise-biased bosonic encoding with enhanced error suppression and faster gates. The performance of rotation-symmetric and GKP codes is analyzed under realistic noise and measurement models, revealing key trade-offs in measurement-based schemes. To integrate bosonic codes into larger architectures, we develop decoding methods that exploit analog syndrome information, enabling quasi-single-shot decoding in concatenated systems. On the discrete-variable side, we introduce localized statistics decoding, a highly parallelizable decoder for quantum LDPC codes, and propose quantum radial codes, a new family of single-shot LDPC codes with low overhead and strong circuit-level performance. Finally, we present fault complexes, a homological framework for analyzing faults in dynamic quantum error correction protocols. Extending the role of homology in static CSS codes, fault complexes provide a general language for the design and analysis of fault-tolerant schemes.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种切实可行的 QB 实现方案，基于成熟的双频谐振腔平台，有望推动量子电池的实际应用，为量子能量存储与传输铺平道路。

Abstract: With intensive studies of quantum thermodynamics, the quantum batteries (QBs) have been proposed to store and transfer energy via quantum effects. Despite many theoretical models, decoherence remains a severe challenge and practical platforms are still rare. Here we propose the QB based on the degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO), using the signal field as the energy-storage unit. We carefully separate the ergotropy into coherent and incoherent components and find that the coherent part decays roughly half as slowly as the incoherent part. More importantly, the coherent ergotropy and the average charging power reach their respective maxima at essentially the same moment, i.e., $γ_s t \approx 10$. This coincidence defines the optimal instant to switch off the pump. Finally, coupling the QB to a two-level system (TLS) as the load, we demonstrate an efficient discharge process of the QB. Our work establishes a realistic and immediately-implementable QB architecture on a mature optical platform.

Abstract: Microwave storage and retrieval are essential capabilities for superconducting quantum circuits. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip multimode resonator in which strong parametric modulation induces a large and tunable normal-mode splitting that enables microwave storage. When the spectral bandwidth of a short microwave pulse covers the two dressed-state absorption peaks, part of the pulse is absorbed and undergoes coherent energy exchange between the modes, producing a clear time-domain beating signal. By switching off the modulation before the beating arrives, we realize on-demand storage and retrieval, demonstrating an alternative approach to microwave photonic quantum memory. This parametric-normal-mode-splitting protocol offers a practical route toward a controllable quantum-memory mechanism in superconducting circuits.

Abstract: We consider the discrimination of two-party quantum states and provide a quantum data-hiding scheme using two-qubit separable states. We first provide a bound on the optimal local discrimination of two-party quantum states, and establish a sufficient condition under which a two-party quantum state ensemble can be used to construct a data-hiding scheme. We illustrate this condition with examples of two-qubit state ensembles consisting of two orthogonal separable states. As our data-hiding scheme can be implemented with separable states of the lowest possible dimension, its practical realization becomes significantly more attainable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving efficient quantum search despite limitations in Grover's algorithm, particularly the sensitivity to the number of solutions.

Method: Used ancilla qubits to absorbs the initial state, converting into a 'reservoir' and eliminations oscillatory dynamics through a process called 'trotterizing' the algorithm to optimize the circuit.

Result: The modified algorithm performs with the same quadratic quantum speedup as the original Grover's algorithm.

Conclusion: This advancement provides a more robust method for quantum search without requiring prior knowledge of the number of solutions.

Abstract: Grover's search algorithm is the cornerstone of many applications of quantum computing, providing a quadratic speed-up over classical methods. One limitation of the algorithm is that it requires knowledge of the number of solutions to obtain an optimal success probability, due to the oscillatory dynamics between the initial and solutions states (the ``soufflé problem''). While various methods have been proposed to solve this problem, each has their drawbacks in terms of inefficiency or sensitivity to control errors. Here, we modify Grover's algorithm to eliminate the oscillatory dynamics, such that the search proceeds as an exponential decay into the solution states. The basic idea is to convert the solution states into a reservoir by using ancilla qubits such that the initial state is nonreflectively absorbed. Trotterizing the continuous algorithm yields a quantum circuit that gives equivalent performance, which has the same quadratic quantum speedup as the original algorithm.

Conclusion: 该协议为通用盲量子计算提供了新的实现方式，在资源受限的NISQ设备上实现实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Blind Quantum Computation lets a limited-capability client delegate its complex computation to a remote server without revealing its data or computation. Several such protocols have been proposed under varied quantum computing models. However, these protocols either rely on highly entangled resource states (in measurement-based models) or are based on non-parametric resource sets (in circuit-based models). These restrictions hinder the practical applicability of such an algorithm in the NISQ era, especially concerning the hybrid quantum-classical infrastructure, which depends on parametric gates. We present a protocol for universal blind quantum computation based on recursive decryption of parametric rotation gates, which does not require a highly entangled state at the server side and substantially reduces the communication rounds required for practical prototyping of secure variational algorithms.

Abstract: Transport and localization in isolated quantum systems are typically attributed to spatially-extended disorder, leaving the influence of a few controllable defects largely unexplored despite their relevance to engineered quantum platforms. We introduce an analytic framework showing how a single defect profoundly reshapes wave-function spreading on a finite isolated and periodic tight-binding lattice. Adapting the defect technique from classical random-walk studies, we obtain exact time-resolved site-occupation probabilities and several observables of interest. Even one defect induces striking nonlinear and nonlocal effects, including non-monotonic suppression of transport, enhanced localization at distant sites, and strong sensitivity to the initial particle position at long times. These results demonstrate that minimal perturbations can generate unexpected long-time transport signatures, establishing a microscopic defect-driven mechanism of quantum localization.

Abstract: We develop a composite operational architecture for sequential quantum measurements that (i) gives a tight bipartite order-effect bound with an explicit equality set characterized on the Halmos two-subspace block, (ii) upgrades Doeblin-type minorization to composite instruments and proves a product lower bound for the operational Doeblin constants, yielding data-driven exponential mixing rates, (iii) derives a diamond-norm commutator bound that quantifies how serial and parallel rearrangements influence observable deviations, and (iv) establishes a monitored Lindblad limit that links discrete look-return loops to continuous-time GKLS dynamics under transparent assumptions. Building on the GKLS framework of Gorini, Kossakowski, Sudarshan, Lindblad, Davies, Spohn, and later work of Fagnola-Rebolledo and Lami et al., we go beyond asymptotic statements by providing finite-sample certificates for the minorization parameter via exact binomial intervals and propagating them to rigorous bounds on the number of interaction steps required to attain a prescribed accuracy. A minimal qubit toy model and CSV-based scripts are supplied for full reproducibility. Our results position order-effect control and operational mixing on a single quantitative axis, from equality windows for pairs of projections to certified network mixing under monitoring. The framework targets readers in quantum information and quantum foundations who need explicit constants that are estimable from data and transferable to device-level guarantees.

Abstract: Quantum indistinguishability of non-orthogonal quantum states is a valuable resource in quantum information applications such as cryptography and randomness generation. In this article, we present a sequential state-discrimination scheme that enables multiple parties to share quantum uncertainty, in terms of the max relative entropy, generated by a single party. Our scheme is based upon maximum-confidence measurements and takes advantages of weak measurements to allow a number of parties to perform state discrimination on a single quantum system. We review known sequential state discrimination and show how our scheme would work through a number of examples where ensembles may or may not contain symmetries. Our results will have a role to play in understanding the ultimate limits of sequential information extraction and guide the development of quantum resource sharing in sequential settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding decoherence mechanisms of qubits is crucial for quantum computing, as decoherence can lead to errors during quantum operations.

Method: The authors use an analytical approach within the spin-boson model, focusing on correlation functions and their dependence on coupling strength and bath parameters.

Result: The study reveals that a non-Hermitian bath can suppress decoherence more effectively than a Hermitian bath, particularly at specific integer values of coupling strength and bath exponent.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that non-Hermitian environments could be a promising method for controlling and reducing decoherence in qubit systems, which is essential for improving the reliability of quantum information processing devices.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the decoherence of qubit due to its coupling to a Hermitian or a non-Hermitian bath within the pure dephasing spin-boson model. First, using this model, we analytically establish the previously anticipated similarity between the non-equilibrium and the equilibrium correlation functions $P_x(t)$ and $C_x(t)$. Then, in the short/long time asymptotic behaviors of $P_x(t)$, we find singular dependence on $A$ (coupling strength) and $s$ (bath exponent) at their integer values. Finally, we find that the non-Hermitian bath tends to suppress the decoherence of qubit for all values of $A$ and $s$, in contrast to the conclusion of Dey et al. . Our results show the potential of non-Hermitian environment engineering in suppressing the decoherence of qubit.

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enables two remote parties to establish information-theoretically secure keys and offers high practical feasibility due to its compatibility with mature coherent optical communication technologies. However, as CV-QKD systems progress toward digital implementations, device nonidealities drive the optical field from a single-mode to a continuous-mode region, thereby underscoring the mismatch between theoretical models and practical systems. Here, we introduce temporal modes to construct an entanglement-based scheme that more accurately captures device nonidealities and develop a corresponding secret key rate calculation method applicable to continuous-mode scenarios. We demonstrate that optimizing the pulse-shaping format can significantly improve performance under detector-bandwidth-limited conditions. Experimental results also confirm that the proposed model effectively describes the impact of sampling-time deviations. We further analyze a linear weighted-reconstruction digital signal processing method,which improves the secret key rate by approximately 50% in a 30-km fiber experiment without requiring additional hardware, demonstrating a substantial performance enhancement at metropolitan distances. The proposed theoretical framework accommodates a broader range of experimental conditions and can guide the optimization of digital CV-QKD systems.

Abstract: Quantum computers pose a fundamental threat to widely deployed public-key cryptosystems, such as RSA and ECC, by enabling efficient integer factorization using Shor's algorithm. Theoretical resource estimates suggest that 2048-bit RSA keys could be broken using Shor's algorithm with fewer than a million noisy qubits. Although such machines do not yet exist, the availability of smaller, cloud-accessible quantum processors and open-source implementations of Shor's algorithm raises the question of what key sizes can realistically be factored with today's platforms. In this work, we experimentally investigate Shor's algorithm on several cloud-based quantum computers using publicly available implementations. Our results reveal a substantial gap between the capabilities of current quantum hardware and the requirements for factoring cryptographically relevant integers. In particular, we observe that circuit constructions still need to be highly specific for each modulus, and that machine fidelities are unstable, with high and fluctuating error rates.

### [45] [A Quantum Bluestein's Algorithm for Arbitrary-Size Quantum Fourier Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15349)
*Nan-Hong,Kuo,Renata Wong*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a quantum version of Bluestein's algorithm that can perform exactly N-point Quantum Fourier Transform for any N. It decomposes the N-dimensional QFT into three diagonal quadratic-phase gates and two standard radix-2 QFT subcircuits of size M = 2^m (where M ≥ 2N - 1). This approach achieves a gate complexity of O(("log N)^2) and uses O("log N) qubits, matching the performance of a power-of-two QFT while eliminating the need for embedding into a larger Hilbert space. The algorithm's correctness is validated through a Qiskit implementation and classical simulation, confirming it produces the exact N-point discrete Fourier transform for arbitrary-length inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is the need for efficient quantum algorithms to handle non-power-of-two sizes in quantum computing. Traditional quantum Fourier transform implementations are limited to power-of-two sizes, which can be a significant barrier for certain applications. By extending Bluestein's algorithm, which is well-known in classical signal processing for handling arbitrary-length transforms, to the quantum domain, the authors aim to bridge this gap and enable more versatile quantum computing applications.

Method: The method used in the paper involves constructing a quantum version of Bluestein's algorithm (QBA) that factors the N-dimensional Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) unitary into three diagonal quadratic-phase gates and two standard radix-2 QFT subcircuits of size M = 2^m, where M is at least 2N - 1. This decomposition allows the algorithm to maintain the efficiency and qubit efficiency of the radix-2 QFT while handling arbitrary N. The authors achieve an asymptotic gate complexity of O(("log N)^2) and use O("log N) qubits, which is comparable to the power-of-two QFT. The correctness of the algorithm is verified through implementation in Qiskit and classical simulation.

Result: The results show that the proposed Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm using QBA successfully implements the exact N-point Quantum Fourier Transform for arbitrary N. The implementation in Qiskit and classical simulation confirms the algorithm's ability to produce the exact N-point discrete Fourier transform on arbitrary-length inputs. The performance metrics, such as gate complexity and qubit usage, align with theoretical expectations, demonstrating the algorithm's efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper successfully adapts Bluestein's algorithm, a classical method for handling arbitrary-length transforms, into the quantum domain. By doing so, it provides a versatile and efficient method for performing Quantum Fourier Transforms on arbitrary N without the need for embedding into a larger Hilbert space. This advancement is significant for expanding the range of quantum computing applications that can handle non-power-of-two sizes effectively.

Abstract: We propose a quantum analogue of Bluestein's algorithm (QBA) that implements an exact $N$-point Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) for arbitrary $N$. Our construction factors the $N$-dimensional QFT unitary into three diagonal quadratic-phase gates and two standard radix-2 QFT subcircuits of size $M = 2^m$ (with $M \ge 2N - 1$). This achieves asymptotic gate complexity $O((\log N)^2)$ and uses $O(\log N)$ qubits, matching the performance of a power-of-two QFT on $m$ qubits while avoiding the need to embed into a larger Hilbert space. We validate the correctness of the algorithm through a concrete implementation in Qiskit and classical simulation, confirming that QBA produces the exact $N$-point discrete Fourier transform on arbitrary-length inputs.

Abstract: The detection and characterization of quantum coherence is of fundamental importance both in the foundations of quantum theory as well as for the rapidly developing field of quantum technologies, where coherence has been linked to quantum advantage. Typical approaches for detecting coherence employ {\it coherence witnesses} -- observable quantities whose expectation value can be used to certify the presence of coherence. By design, coherence witnesses are only able to detect coherence for some, but not all, possible states of a quantum system. In this work we construct protocols capable of detecting the presence of coherence in an {\it unknown} pure quantum state $|ψ\rangle$. Having access to $m$ copies of an unknown pure state $|ψ\rangle$ we show that the sample complexity of any experimental procedure for detecting coherence with constant probability of success $\ge 2/3$ is $Θ(c(|ψ\rangle)^{-1})$, where $c(|ψ\rangle)$ is the geometric measure of coherence of $|ψ\rangle$. However, assuming access to the unitary $U_ψ$ which prepares the unknown state $|ψ\rangle$, and its inverse $U_ψ^\dagger$, we devise a coherence detecting protocol that employs amplitude-amplification {\it a la} Grover, and uses a quadratically smaller number $O(c(|ψ\rangle)^{-1/2})$ of samples. Furthermore, by augmenting amplitude amplification with phase estimation we obtain an experimental estimation of upper bounds on the geometric measure of coherence within additive error $\varepsilon$ with a sample complexity that scales as $O(1/\varepsilon)$ as compared to the $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ sample complexity of Monte Carlo estimation methods. The average number of samples needed in our amplitude estimation protocol provides a new operational interpretation for the geometric measure of coherence. Finally, we also derive bounds on the amount of noise our protocols are able to tolerate.

Main category: quant-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and accessible QKD solutions that overcome the limitations of physical hardware infrastructure while maintaining security is a primary motivation for research in this field.

Method: The study introduces Quditto, an open-access emulation platform that combines high-fidelity quantum-channel modeling with a standardized key-delivery API.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers information-theoretic security by leveraging quantum mechanics, yet the cost and complexity of dedicated hardware and fiber infrastructure have so far limited large-scale deployment and experimentation. In this paper, we introduce Quditto, an automated open-access emulation platform that combines high-fidelity quantum-channel modeling with a standardized key-delivery API, enabling users to interact with the emulated network exactly as they would with real QKD hardware. Quditto modular design supports pluggable protocol implementations, complex key management schemes and detailed channel models, including variable attenuation and decoherence. We validate Quditto by deploying networks of various sizes and demonstrate its flexibility through two proof-of-concept scenarios featuring eavesdropper attacks and heterogeneous channel conditions.

Conclusion: 提供了测量过程的重新解读，为量子反馈操控提供了理论基础和方法，未来可能应用在量子计算和信息处理中。

Abstract: We introduce a framework that unifies quantum measurement dynamics, Hamiltonian dynamics, and double-bracket gradient flows. We do so by providing explicit expressions for stochastic Hamiltonians that produce state dynamics identical to those that happen during continuous quantum measurements. When such dynamical processes are integrated over sufficiently long time intervals, they yield the same results and statistics as during wavefunction collapse. That is, wavefunction collapse can be interpreted as coarse-grained (stochastic) Hamiltonian dynamics. Alternatively, wavefunction collapse can be interpreted as double-bracket gradient flows determined by derivatives of (stochastic) potentials defined in terms of observables with direct physical interpretations. The gradient flows minimize the variance of the monitored observable. Our derivations hold for general monitoring described by non-Hermitian jump processes. We show that such reinterpretations of measurement dynamics facilitate the design of feedback processes. In particular, we introduce feedback processes that yield deterministic double-bracket flow equations, which prepare ground states of a target Hamiltonian, and feedback processes for state preparation. We conclude by re-interpreting feedback processes as gradient flows with tilted fixed points.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper establishes a link between informationally complete measurements and quantum parameter estimation, providing bounds on the Fisher information ratio using operator frame theory. This leads to understanding fundamental tradeoffs in quantum state reconstruction, which is crucial for advancing quantum technologies and metrology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum state reconstruction and parameter estimation are fundamental tasks in quantum information science. Understanding the interplay between measurement schemes and parameter encoding is essential for optimizing quantum technologies.

Method: The authors use operator frame theory to analyze single informationally complete measurements. They derive bounds on the ratio of classical to quantum Fisher information based on the spectral decomposition of the frame operator. These bounds are then related to optimal and least optimal encoding directions.

Result: Explicit mathematical bounds are derived that link the Fisher information metrics of classical and quantum systems. The results provide insights into the limitations and possibilities of quantum parameter estimation under informationally complete measurements.

Conclusion: This work gains practical relevance for experimentalists designing quantum measurements and theorists exploring the fundamental limits of quantum metrology. It contributes to the theoretical framework that underpins quantum information processing tasks.

Abstract: Informationally complete measurements form the foundation of universal quantum state reconstruction, while quantum parameter estimation is based on the local structure of the manifold of quantum states. Here we establish a general link between these two aspects, in the context of a single informationally complete measurement, by employing a suitably adapted operator frame theory. In particular, we bound the ratio between the classical and quantum Fisher information in terms of the spectral decomposition of the associated frame operator, and connect these bounds to the optimal and least optimal directions for parameter encoding. The geometric and operational characterization of information extraction thus obtained reveals the fundamental tradeoff imposed by informational completeness on local quantum parameter estimation.

Abstract: The recently available high-intensity quantum light pulses provide novel tools for controlling light-matter interactions. However, the rigor of the theoretical frameworks currently used to describe the interaction of strong quantum light with atoms and molecules remains unverified. Here, we establish a rigorous benchmark by solving the fully quantized time-dependent Schrödinger equation for an atom exposed to bright squeezed vacuum light. Our \textit{ab initio} simulations reveal a critical limitation of the widely used $Q$-representation: although it accurately reproduces the total photoelectron spectrum after tracing over photon states, it completely fails to capture the electron-photon joint energy spectrum. To overcome this limitation, we develop a general theoretical framework based on the Feynman path integral that properly incorporates the electron-photon quantum entanglement. Our results provide both quantitative benchmarks and fundamental theoretical insights for the emerging field of strong-field quantum optics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Cloud-based quantum computers do not provide users with access to hardware-level information such as the underlying Hamiltonians, which obstructs the characterization of their physical properties. We propose a method to infer the energy scales of gate Hamiltonians in such black-box quantum processors using only user-accessible data, by exploiting quantum speed limits. Specifically, we reinterpret the Margolus-Levitin and Mandelstam-Tamm bounds as estimators of the energy expectation value and variance, respectively, and relate them to the shortest time for the processor to orthogonalize a quantum state. This shortest gate time, expected to lie on the nanosecond scale, is inferred from job execution times measured in seconds by employing gate-time amplification. We apply the method to IBM's superconducting quantum processor and estimate the energy scales associated with single-, two-, and three-qubit gates. The order of estimated energy is consistent with typical drive energies in superconducting qubit systems, suggesting that current gate operations approach the quantum speed limit. Our results demonstrate that fundamental energetic properties of black-box quantum computers can be quantitatively accessed through operational time measurements, reflecting the conjugate relationship between time and energy imposed by the uncertainty principle.

Conclusion: QuantGraph 提供了一种结合量子计算与经典控制的高效解决方案，为图优化问题提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Dynamic programming is a cornerstone of graph-based optimization. While effective, it scales unfavorably with problem size. In this work, we present QuantGraph, a two-stage quantum-enhanced framework that casts local and global graph-optimization problems as quantum searches over discrete trajectory spaces. The solver is designed to operate efficiently by first finding a sequence of locally optimal transitions in the graph (local stage), without considering full trajectories. The accumulated cost of these transitions acts as a threshold that prunes the search space (up to 60% reduction for certain examples). The subsequent global stage, based on this threshold, refines the solution. Both stages utilize variants of the Grover-adaptive-search algorithm. To achieve scalability and robustness, we draw on principles from control theory and embed QuantGraph's global stage within a receding-horizon model-predictive-control scheme. This classical layer stabilizes and guides the quantum search, improving precision and reducing computational burden. In practice, the resulting closed-loop system exhibits robust behavior and lower overall complexity. Notably, for a fixed query budget, QuantGraph attains a 2x increase in control-discretization precision while still benefiting from Grover-search's inherent quadratic speedup compared to classical methods.

For the thermal-loss and thermal amplification channels, our results demonstrate the optimality, within the constraints of our analysis, of previously proposed protocols, while also providing a significantly simplified formula for their performance evaluation. For the added noise channel, our rate provides a better lower bound than any previously known.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses how environmental decoherence affects quantum systems like the compass state, which has unique phase-space features that go below the Planck scale. While using these states for quantum sensing can provide detailed information about sub-Planck structures, excessive decoherence can diminish their effectiveness. Methods include theoretical analysis and interaction with a heat reservoir. Results highlight a trade-off between the precision of sub-Planck features and decoherence. The findings suggest that increasing parameters enhances precision but also increases fragility. Conclusion: Decoherence poses a challenge for maintaining quantum states with sub-Planck features, necessitating strategies to mitigate this issue.ique quantum properties over time, especially during experimental implementation. The effect of decoherence varies depending on the phase-space features of quantum states, which are theoretically characterized by the Wigner phase space and appear at different scales. We explore the compass state and its photon-added and photon-subtracted variants, each of which exhibits phase-space features with dimensions beyond the Planck scale, making them suitable for quantum sensing applications. We investigate the interaction of these states with a heat reservoir by employing a range of well-established theoretical techniques, revealing a clear trade-off between the degree of fineness in the smallest features, such as the sub-Planck structure, and the extent of decoherence. Specifically, increasing the parameters enhances sub-Planck precision in phase space, concomitantly amplifying the fragility of these compass states to undesired decoherence. Our general illustration, validated through these compass states, also applies to any pure quantum state interacting with the considered heat reservoir, exhibiting enhanced sustainability of features at larger phase-space extensions.

Motivation: The motivation behind this research is likely to explore how quantum states can be used for sensing despite the challenges posed by environmental decoherence, particularly in maintaining sub-Planck scale features which are crucial for detailed quantum information processing. The study aims to find a balance between the precision of these features and their susceptibility to decoherence to optimize quantum sensing applications.

Method: The method used in this paper likely involves theoretical analysis of quantum states, specifically the compass state and its variants, under the influence of environmental interactions such as a heat reservoir. Various theoretical techniques are employed to study the trade-off between sub-Planck precision and decoherence effects.

Result: The result of this study indicates a clear trade-off between the ability to resolve sub-Planck scale features in phase space and the degree of decoherence experienced by these quantum states. Increasing parameters to enhance precision leads to an amplified fragility, suggesting that maintaining these states for reliable quantum sensing requires careful management of decoherence.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this research demonstrates that environmental decoherence significantly impacts the maintenance of sub-Planck scale features in quantum states like the compass state. The findings highlight the need for strategies to mitigate decoherence to ensure the sustainability of these features for quantum sensing applications, emphasizing the balance between precision and robustness in quantum systems.

Abstract: Environmental decoherence occurs when a quantum system interacts with its surroundings, progressively reducing quantum interference and coherence, complicating the preservation of critical quantum properties over time, especially during experimental implementation.

Abstract: We demonstrate a quadratic enhancement of power in a battery consisting of $N$ two-level systems or spins interacting with two photonic cavity modes, where one of the modes is in the dispersive regime. In contrast to Dicke batteries, the power enhancement arises from a $N^2$ scaling of both quantum correlations and speed of evolution, thus highlighting genuine quantum advantage. Moreover, this hybrid setup is experimentally realizable and ensures that power enhancement is not achieved at significant cost to energy efficiency, while allowing for greater tunability and stable operation in the presence of noise.

Abstract: Molecular spin qudits based on lanthanide complexes offer a promising platform for quantum technologies, combining chemical tunability with multi-level encoding. However, experimental demonstrations of their envisaged capabilities remain scarce, posing the difficulty of achieving precise control over coherences between qudit states in long pulse sequences. Here, we implement in 173Yb(trensal) qudit the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), a core component of numerous quantum algorithms, storing quantum information in the phases of coherences. QFT provides an ideal benchmark for coherence manipulation and an unprecedented challenge for molecular spin qudits. We address this challenge by embedding a full-refocusing protocol for spin qudits in our algorithm, mitigating inhomogeneous broadening and enabling a high-fidelity recovery of the state. Complete state tomography demostrates the performance of the algorithm, while simulations provide insight into the physical mechanisms behind inhomogeneous broadening. This work shows the feasibility of quantum logic on molecular spin qudits and highlights their potential.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses the detection of nonclassicality in generalized coherent states (GCS) used in quantum information processing and metrology. While traditional intensity measurements fail to reveal their nonclassical features, a normalized biphoton coincidence measurement (intensity-field correlation) effectively detects nonclassical behavior. The authors derive analytical results for Kerr-generated GCS states and extend detection methods to statistical mixtures. This simplified approach enhances practicality for advancing nonlinear optics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The realization of non-Gaussian quantum states is crucial for quantum technologies, particularly for leveraging quantum advantages in metrology and computation. Traditional methods often fall short in detecting the nonclassical properties of these states, necessitating innovative techniques to assess and utilize them effectively.

Method: The researchers utilize a normalized intensity-field correlation function to detect nonclassicality. They apply this method to generalized coherent states resulting from Kerr medium evolution, demonstrating its effectiveness through analytical results and extension to statistical mixtures, which adds practicality for experimental setups.

Result: A single-parameter correlation measurement can reliably detect nonclassicality in GCS states. The analytical framework is extended, and the approach is experimentally feasible, suggesting potential broad applications in nonlinear optics and quantum metrology.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a straightforward and experimentally implementable method using normalized intensity-field correlation to detect nonclassicality in generalized coherent states. This breakthrough provides a practical tool for evaluating non-Gaussian states beneficial for quantum information processing and precision metrology.

Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states of light are essential resources for quantum information processing and precision metrology. Among them, generalized coherent states (GCS), which naturally arise from the evolution of a coherent state with a nonlinear medium, exhibit useful quantum features such as Wigner negativity and metrological advantages [Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013165 (2023)]. Because these states remain coherent to all orders, their nonclassical character cannot be revealed through standard intensity-intensity correlation measurements. Here, we demonstrate that the intensity-field correlation function alone provides a simple and experimentally accessible witness of nonclassicality. For GCSs, any deviation of this normalized correlation from unity signals nonclassical behavior. We derive analytical results for Kerr-generated states and extend the analysis to statistical mixtures of GCSs. The proposed approach enables real-time, low-complexity detection of quantum signatures in non-Gaussian states, offering a practical tool for experiments across a broad range of nonlinear regimes.

Motivation: Understanding the behavior of entangled states in distributed systems and the relationship between entanglement and Bell nonlocality.

Method: Proof-based analysis using quantum theory and operational definitions of nonlocality.

Result: All entangled states are broadcast nonlocal, implying a fundamental connection between quantum entanglement and nonlocal distributed effects.

Conclusion: This work bridges the concepts of entanglement and Bell nonlocality in the context of quantum communication networks, opening new avenues for quantum information processing and protocol design.

Abstract: Entanglement and Bell nonlocality are known to be inequivalent: there exist entangled states that admit a local hidden-variable model for all local measurements. Here we show that this gap disappears in a minimal broadcast extension of the Bell scenario. Assuming only the validity of quantum theory, we prove that for every entangled state $ρ_{AB}$ there exist local broadcasting maps and local measurements such that the resulting four--partite correlations cannot be reproduced by any broadcast network whose source is separable across the $A|B$ cut. Thus, all entangled states are broadcast nonlocal in quantum theory. In addition, we show that all (also mixed) multipartite states can be broadcast-self-tested, according to a natural operational definition.

Abstract: Demonstrating quantum advantage in machine learning tasks requires navigating a complex landscape of proposed models and algorithms. To bring clarity to this search, we introduce a framework that connects the structure of parametrized quantum circuits to the mathematical nature of the functions they can actually learn. Within this framework, we show how fundamental properties, like circuit depth and non-Clifford gate count, directly determine whether a model's output leads to efficient classical simulation or surrogation. We argue that this analysis uncovers common pathways to dequantization that underlie many existing simulation methods. More importantly, it reveals critical distinctions between models that are fully simulatable, those whose function space is classically tractable, and those that remain robustly quantum. This perspective provides a conceptual map of this landscape, clarifying how different models relate to classical simulability and pointing to where opportunities for quantum advantage may lie.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Graph-theoretic structures play a central role in the description and analysis of quantum systems. In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum states, called $A_α$-graph states, which are constructed from either unweighted or weighted graphs by taking the normalised convex combination of the degree matrix $D$ and the adjacency matrix $A_G$ of a graph $G$. The constructed states are different from the standard graph states arising from stabiliser formalism. Our approach is also different from the approach used by Braunstein et al. This class of states depend on a tunable mixing parameter $α\in (0,1]$. We first establish the conditions under which the associated operator $ρ_α^{A_G}$ is positive semidefinite and hence represents a valid quantum state. We then derive a positive partial transposition (PPT) condition for $A_α$-graph states in terms of graph parameters. This PPT condition involves only the Frobenius norm of the adjacency matrix of the graph, the degrees of the vertices and the total number of vertices. For simple graphs, we obtain the range of the parameter $α$ for which the $A_α$-graph states represent a class of entangled states. We then develop a graph-theoretic formulation of a moments-based entanglement detection criterion, focusing on the recently proposed $p_3$-PPT criterion, which relies on the second and third moments of the partial transposition. Since the estimation of these moments is experimentally accessible via randomised measurements, swap operations, and machine-learning-based protocols, our approach provides a physically relevant framework for detecting entanglement in structured quantum states derived from graphs. This work bridges graph theory and moments-based entanglement detection, offering a new perspective on the role of combinatorial structures in quantum correlations.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computers use decoders to monitor for errors and find a plausible correction. A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate the logical error probability (LEP) in a decoding window. We explore ways to use this to mitigate the LEP in entire circuits. For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to trillions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood inference. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements.

Abstract: The random purification channel maps n copies of any mixed quantum state to n copies of a random purification of the state. We generalize this construction to arbitrary symmetries: for any group G of unitaries, we construct a quantum channel that maps states contained in the algebra generated by G to random purifications obtained by twirling over G. In addition to giving a surprisingly concise proof of the original random purification theorem, our result implies the existence of fermionic and bosonic Gaussian purification channels. As applications, we obtain the first tomography protocol for fermionic Gaussian states that scales optimally with the number of modes and the error, as well as an improved property test for this class of states.

Abstract: Multiply charged actinide molecules provide a unique platform to study fundamental physics and the chemical bond under extreme conditions. Beyond the inherently large relativistic effects associated with a high proton number $Z$, an increased molecular charge can further enhance the electronic sensitivity to symmetry-violating nuclear effects, including nuclear Schiff moments. Experimental investigations of multiply charged actinide molecules are challenging because the high charges severely destabilize chemical bonds, leading to spontaneous Coulomb explosion. We demonstrate a method to systematically generate and detect molecular ions at the edge of chemical stability. By applying high-fluence laser ablation to a depleted uranium metal foil, we produce atomic uranium ions U$^{z+}$ and uranium monoxide cations UO$^{z+}$ with $z = 1$--4. Among them, we observe UO$^{3+}$ and UO$^{4+}$, which exhibit comparatively simple electronic structures and are therefore promising for precision spectroscopy. The experiments are supported by relativistic density functional theory calculations of equilibrium bond lengths, charge distributions, and binding energies of all observed molecules. Calculations of symmetry-violating properties suggest a pronounced sensitivity of UO$^{3+}$ to hadronic $CP$ violation. This approach opens a pathway for high-precision investigations of fundamental symmetries and the exploration of relativistic actinide chemistry in previously inaccessible regimes.

Abstract: Accurately and efficiently describing strongly correlated electronic systems is a central challenge in quantum computational chemistry, with classical and quantum computers. The localized active space self-consistent field method (LASSCF) uses a product of fragment active spaces as a variational space, with the Schrödinger equation solved exactly in each fragment and the fragment active-space orbitals defined in a self-consistent manner. LASSCF is accurate for systems with strong intra-fragment and weak inter-fragment correlation, and its computational cost is combinatorial with respect to the size of the individual fragment active spaces, rather than their product. However, exactly solving the Schrödinger equation in each fragment remains a substantial bottleneck. Here, we address the possibility of solving the fragment active space Schrödinger equation with approximate methods, particularly sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD). SQD is a technique that uses a quantum computer to sample configurations from a chemically motivated quantum circuit and a classical computer to mitigate errors and solve the Schrödinger equation in a subspace of the configuration space. We apply the proposed method, LASSQD, to the [Fe(H$_2$O)$_4$]$_2$bpym$^{4+}$ compound and the [Fe$^{\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\mathrm{II}}$($μ$$_3$-O)-(HCOO)$_6$] complex for calculating the intermediate-spin ground state energies. We observe that LASSQD can tackle fragment sizes intractable by LASSCF, achieves within 1kcal/mol agreement to LASSCF, and delivers results that are competitive with alternative classical methods to solve the Schrödinger equation, and thus can be used as a starting point for a perturbative treatment (LASSQD-PDFT) to recover correlation external to the active space.

Abstract: Modeling plasmonic catalysis by applying femtosecond laser pulses of high intensity ($10^{13}-10^{15}$ W cm$^{-2}$), although justified by the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) time-scale limitations, can lead to a dissociation mechanism that is completely unrelated to the plasmon excitation created under low-intensity continuous light in experiments (on the order of 1 W cm$^{-2}$). In this study, we examine the dissociation of H$_2$ on a large octahedral Ag nanoshell under varying field intensity, frequency, and duration, and we explore the possibility of identifying optimal modeling conditions accessible with current TDDFT simulations. We show that using this large nanoshell that consists in the outer layer of the Ag$_{231}$ cluster, it is still possible to disentangle the role of the plasmon from strong-field effects at applied field intensities as high as $(2-8) \times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. In particular, although strong-field effects are always present at these intensities, we find that the excited plasmon dominates the dissociation process at the lowest applied intensity of $2 \times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, at the highest intensity, at which strong-field effects become dominant, the plasmon contributes to accelerating the dissociation of the molecule. Overall, our simulations pave the way to bridge the intensity gap between TDDFT modeling and experiments in plasmonic catalysis.

Abstract: Thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries is strongly influenced by the state of charge (SOC). Existing predictive models typically infer scalar kinetic parameters at a full SOC or a few discrete SOC levels, preventing them from capturing the continuous SOC dependence that governs exothermic behavior during abuse conditions. To address this, we apply the Kolmogorov-Arnold Chemical Reaction Neural Network (KA-CRNN) framework to learn continuous and realistic SOC-dependent exothermic cathode-electrolyte interactions. We apply a physics-encoded KA-CRNN to learn SOC-dependent kinetic parameters for cathode-electrolyte decomposition directly from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. A mechanistically informed reaction pathway is embedded into the network architecture, enabling the activation energies, pre-exponential factors, enthalpies, and related parameters to be represented as continuous and fully interpretable functions of the SOC. The framework is demonstrated for NCA, NM, and NMA cathodes, yielding models that reproduce DSC heat-release features across all SOCs and provide interpretable insight into SOC-dependent oxygen-release and phase-transformation mechanisms. This approach establishes a foundation for extending kinetic parameter dependencies to additional environmental and electrochemical variables, supporting more accurate and interpretable thermal-runaway prediction and monitoring.

### [68] [Achromatic, spin-odd Kerr EVPA as a null Frenet--Serret torsion integral on the photon ring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14773)
*M. Baran Ökten*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper calculates the achromatic gravitational imprint of Kerr spacetime's linear polarization on the photon ring, revealing a unique pattern depending on spin and inclination. They measure around 0.5–2° amplitudes for a/M≳0.8 and i≳60°. They confirm via multiple methods and define a parity-odd ring estimator for mm/sub-mm polarimetry of objects like M87* and Sgr A*.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to understand gravitational effects on photon polarization and to achieve precise measurements for polarimetry in astronomical sources like black holes.

Method: Utilized null Frenet--Serret frames, parallel transport, and multiple validation techniques, including Levi--Civita transport and Walker--Penrose constants.

Result: The polarization patterns are strictly odd under spin reversal and inclination, with amplitudes increasing with higher spin and inclination. The methods achieve high convergence and measure small, significant polarization angles, enabling either detection of frame dragging effects or providing robust upper limits.

Conclusion: This approach ensures high-accuracy measurements with minimal systematics, making it ideal for monitoring frame dragging effects and polarimetry of compact objects.

Abstract: We compute the achromatic gravitational imprint that Kerr spacetime leaves on linear polarization at the photon ring. Recasting parallel transport in a null Frenet--Serret frame yields a single scalar evolution law for the electric-vector position angle. On the observer's screen, the Kerr-minus-Schwarzschild pattern on the direct critical curve is nonzero, strictly odd under spin reversal after a half-turn azimuth relabelling, and tightly confined to a thin annulus. Using backward-shot, Carter-separated geodesics with midpoint RK2 transport, we achieve second-order convergence and degree-scale amplitudes that grow monotonically with spin and inclination (RMS $\simeq 0.5$--$2^\circ$ for $a/M\gtrsim 0.8$, $i\gtrsim 60^\circ$). Three independent constructions -- Frenet--Serret line integral, explicit Levi--Civita transport of the polarization vector, and the phase of the Walker--Penrose constant -- agree ray by ray. We then define a parity-odd ring estimator that is intrinsically achromatic after standard wavelength-squared regression, symmetry-protected against common even-parity systematics, and compressed into low azimuthal modes. This yields a minimal two-parameter template (spin and inclination) for mm/sub-mm polarimetry of horizon-scale rings in sources such as M87$^\ast$ and Sgr~A$^\ast$. The pipeline enables either a detection of the strong-field parallel-transport phase induced by frame dragging or informative upper limits.

Abstract: The stability of geodesic orbits around a regular hairy black hole, in the gravitational decoupling setup, is investigated by employing Lyapunov exponents, which quantify the divergence rate of nearby trajectories in dynamical systems. Both timelike and null geodesics are addressed, probing the effect of the hair parameter on orbital stability. Deviations from the Schwarzschild solution have a significant influence on orbit stability, potentially providing observational signatures. Quasinormal modes of regular hairy black holes are calculated, and their thermodynamic properties are discussed. Both the Rényi and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropies are reported, deepening our understanding of gravitational dynamics in the strong-field regime, contributing to ongoing approaches to modified gravity.

Abstract: We review a novel scenario for the emergence of spin-polarisation entangled squeezed graviton states from superradiant axionic clouds in the neighborhood of astrophysical rotating black holes (BHs). The entangled squeezed graviton states are produced by both, conventional General-Relativity (GR) type axion-gravity interactions, and gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) anomalous terms coupled to axions, which are non-trivial in the presence of rotating BHs. The two kinds of terms have different-symmetry contributions to the entangled squeezed states. The squeezing parameter is estimated in a weak-quantum-gravity framework. Some phenomenology with respect to current and future interferometric detection devices is discussed. Importantly, current data from LIGO/Virgo Experiments can impose upper-bound constraints on the value of the squeezing parameter and, thus, on the lifetime of the axionic clouds. In addition to the above rather direct-detection possibility of squeezed gravitons, there is also the possibility of indirect detection of quantum gravitons in Cosmology, given that chiral quantum gravitational-wave (GW) perturbations in the primordial Universe may imply condensation of gCS terms. This, in turn, leads to inflation of running vacuum type, with in principle observable patterns in the profile of the GW produced during the post-inflationary early radiation era, as well as the potential of alleviating cosmic tensions in the current era.

Abstract: This thesis investigates late-time cosmic acceleration using modified gravity theories with a focus on $f(Q)$ gravity, as an alternative to the $Λ$CDM model. The standard cosmological model attributes the acceleration to a cosmological constant, but it faces issues like the unexplained nature of dark matter and dark energy and discrepancies with certain observations. Modified gravity including $f(Q)$ gravity, offers a potential solution by incorporating dynamic dark energy or changes to gravitational interactions, avoiding the need for a constant cosmological term. Also, thesis evaluates the viability of $f(Q)$ gravity by analyzing observational data from Type Ia Supernovae, Hubble parameter measurements and other cosmological datasets. Using statistical tools like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, this work constrains the parameters of $f(Q)$ gravity and compares it to the $Λ$CDM model.....

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Gravitational waves from binary black holes may be lensed, and this can help constrain cosmological parameters. This work predicts that with enhanced LIGO, we might detect enough lensed events to do some cosmology, but previous studies ignored detection bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational waves are a promising probe of cosmology, and lensing offers a way to detect events that would otherwise be too faint. This research aims to improve our ability to perform cosmography using lensed GW events.

Method: The researchers analyzed data from upcoming LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA detectors. They considered the number of detectable lensed GW events and the distribution of time delays. They also accounted for selection effects in detector networks, which previous studies had ignored.

Result: Adding up the expected number of lensed events with better detectors could provide new constraints on the universe's parameters, especially at intermediate redshifts. This method could complement other cosmological probes, but more precise measurements may be required to get meaningful results.

Conclusion: Gravitational wave lensing offers a new way to study the universe. This research suggests that with better detectors, such as the upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network, we could start using lensed GW events to set cosmological constraints. However, the current estimates show that the number of events might be too small to provide strong constraints unless more events are detected.

Abstract: A small fraction of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black holes (BBHs) will be gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies and galaxy clusters. Strong lensing will produce multiple identical copies of the GW signal arriving at different times. Jana et al.~\cite{Jana_2023} recently proposed a method to constrain cosmological parameters using strongly lensed GW events detected by next-generation (XG) detectors. The idea is that the number of strongly lensed GW events and the distribution of their lensing time delays encode imprints of the cosmological parameters. From the observed number of lensed GW events (tens of thousands) and their time delay distribution, this method can provide a new probe of cosmology, obtaining information at intermediate redshifts. In this work, we explore the possibility of doing lensing cosmography using upcoming observations of the upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. This requires incorporating the detector network selection effects in the analysis, which was neglected earlier. We expect dozens of lensed GW events to be detected by upgraded LVK detectors, potentially enabling modest constraints on cosmological parameters. Even with relatively modest numbers of lensed detections, we demonstrate the potential of lensing cosmography. For XG detectors, our revised forecasts are consistent with with the earlier forecasts that neglected the selection effects.

Abstract: A pulsar, i.e., a spinning neutron star, with a deformation could emit gravitational waves continuously. Such continuous waves, which have not been detected yet, will be very useful to study gravitational physics and to probe the extreme physics of neutron stars. While typically such waves from a pulsar are estimated considering an overall stellar ellipticity, there can be multiple irregularities or mountains in the stellar crust that the gravity of the star cannot smooth. In this paper, we consider this realistic situation and compute the strain, power, torque and the pulsar spin-down rate due to multiple mountains supported by the stellar crust. Here, we consider astronomically motivated mountain distributions and use the Brans-Dicke theory of gravity which has three polarization states: two tensors dominated by the time-varying quadrupole moment and one scalar dominated by the time-varying dipole moment. We also give the limiting results for general relativity.

Abstract: Noncommutative gravity, based on a twist-deformation of the differential geometry of spacetime and a first-order formulation of the dynamics, requires additional gravitational degrees of freedom as well as an enlargement of the gauge group of Lorentz transformations of the tetrad frame. As such, it offers a theoretical playground to build fundamentally motivated extension to general relativity. The dynamical degrees of freedom include a ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ gauge connection and two independent tetrads. The theory allows for interaction terms between the two tetrads, whose structure displays some similarities with ghost-free bigravity. The extra gravitational degrees of freedom survive in the commutative limit. We show the effective action obtained in this limit, discuss its symmetries, and compare it with other bigravity theories. The dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions split into two branches. One is characterized by a constant and purely spatial curvature two-form. The other displays a richer gauge freedom, and the Hamiltonian analysis of the dynamics reveals three extra first-class constraints in addition to the generator of time reparametrizations.

Abstract: We investigate quartically self-interacting massive boson stars by constructing equilibrium sequences and performing dynamical evolutions. The mass curve $M(|φ_c|)$ along these sequences develops multiple extrema, yet stability changes only at the first maximum; configurations beyond it become highly compact and collapse under numerically induced perturbations, with near-critical models displaying a short-lived double-dive behaviour. Head-on collisions of equal-mass stars yield three distinct outcomes - boson star remnants, black hole formation at contact, and collapse of each star to a black hole prior to contact. The associated gravitational-wave energies reflect the competition between increasing compactness and decreasing tidal deformability, and at large self-interaction strengths the collapse-before-contact branch exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic structure. The simulations reported here constitute a substantial catalogue of initial conditions and waveforms, providing a natural basis for neural-network techniques aimed at improving boson star initial data and constructing surrogate models capable of rapidly predicting gravitational-wave signals across an extended parameter space.

Abstract: We incorporate non-local gravitational self-energy, motivated by string-inspired T-duality, into the Schrödinger-Newton equation. In this framework spacetime has an intrinsic non-locality, rendering the standard linear superposition principle only an approximation valid in the absence of gravitational effects. We then invert the logic by assuming the validity of linear superposition and demonstrate that such superpositions inevitably become unstable once gravity is included. The resulting wave-function collapse arises from a fundamental tension between the equivalence principle and the quantum superposition principle in a semiclassical spacetime background. We further show that wave functions computed in inertial and freely falling frames differ by a gravitationally induced phase shift containing linear and cubic time contributions along with a constant global term. These corrections produce a global phase change and lead to a spontaneous, model-independent collapse time inversely proportional to the mass of the system.

Abstract: We investigate the thermal Casimir effect for a massless scalar field in the curved spacetime of a neutron star within the Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) formalism. Starting from the renormalized energy-momentum tensor, we generalize the Stefan-Boltzmann law to include gravitational redshift and curvature corrections governed by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) metric. Finite temperature and spatial compactification are introduced simultaneously, allowing a unified and consistent treatment of both vacuum and thermal contributions inside and outside the star. Analytical expressions are derived for the high- and low-temperature limits, showing explicitly how curvature and redshift modify the characteristic $T^4$ dependence of thermal radiation. The results reveal that strong gravity significantly alters the local energy density and pressure, demonstrating the nontrivial interplay between quantum vacuum fluctuations and compact astrophysical geometries. A polytropic model is considered to perform numerical analyses, highlighting the influence of the spacetime background on vacuum fluctuations.

Abstract: We carry out the deepest and broadest search for continuous gravitational-wave signals with frequencies between 20-1500 Hz, from three neutron stars at the center of the supernova remnants Cassiopeia A, Vela Jr., and G347.3-0.5. This search was made possible by the computing power shared by thousands of Einstein@Home volunteers. After the initial Einstein@Home search, we perform a multi-stage follow-up of the most promising $\approx$ 45 million signal candidates. In the last stages, we use independent data to further investigate the remaining candidates from the previous stages. We set the most stringent constraints to date on the gravitational-wave amplitude, equatorial ellipticity, r-mode saturation amplitude, and -- for the first time -- the neutron-star crustal anisotropy. For spin periods lower than 2 ms we constrain the ellipticity to be smaller than $4\times 10^{-7}$ for all targets. We exclude the crustal anisotropy to be smaller than $5\times 10^{-3}$ for spin periods between 1.3-100 ms. Only one candidate -- from the low frequency G347.3 search -- survives all follow-ups. We illustrate properties of this candidate. Investigations on new data will aid in clarifying its nature. Such ``new" data exists and would be optimal for this purpose, but they are not publicly accessible at the time of writing.

### [81] [An introduction to nonlinear fiber optics and optical analogues to gravitational phenomena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15695)
*Dimitrios Kranas,Andleeb Zahra,Friedrich König*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of optical fibers in analogue gravity experiments, providing a detailed analysis of light propagation in fibers and its applications in analogue spacetime models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is likely to explore gravitational phenomena using accessible analogue laboratory setups, such as optical fibers, to study concepts like black holes and spacetime effects.

Method: The paper presents a theoretical analysis starting from the structure of a step-index fiber, deriving linear-optics propagation of modes, incorporating nonlinear effects, and arriving at the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. It then applies this framework to model spacetime effects using intense light and explores applications in black hole physics.

Result: The key results include showing how optical fibers can simulate spacetime effects like black hole Hawking radiation and quasinormal modes, providing a foundation for studying gravitational phenomena with optical setups.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates optical fibers as a valuable tool for analogue gravity experiments, offering a guided journey from fiber optics to advanced spacetime models.

Abstract: The optical fiber is a revolutionary technology of the past century. It enables us to manipulate single modes in nonlinear interactions with precision at the quantum level without involved setups. This setting is useful in the field of analogue gravity (AG), where gravitational phenomena are investigated in accessible analogue lab setups. These lecture notes provide an account of this AG framework and applications. Although light in nonlinear dielectrics is discussed in textbooks, the involved modelling often includes many assumptions that are directed at optical communications, some of which are rarely detailed. Here, we provide a self-contained and sufficiently detailed description of the propagation of light in fibers, with a minimal set of assumptions, which is relevant in the context of AG. Starting with the structure of a step-index fiber, we derive linear-optics propagating modes and show that the transverse electric field of the fundamental mode is well approximated as linearly polarized and of a Gaussian profile. We then incorporate a cubic nonlinearity and derive a general wave envelope propagation equation. With further simplifying assumptions, we arrive at the famous nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which governs fundamental effects in nonlinear fibers, such as solitons. As a first application in AG, we show how intense light in the medium creates an effective background spacetime for probe light akin to the propagation of a scalar field in a black hole spacetime. We introduce optical horizons and particle production in this effective spacetime, giving rise to the optical Hawking effect. Furthermore, we discuss two related light emission mechanisms. Finally, we present a second optical analogue model for the oscillations of black holes, the quasinormal modes, which are important in the program of black hole spectroscopy.

Conclusion: 文章为二次引力波理论提供了一个可靠的计算框架，确定了在牛顿切片下的引力波应变定义。

Abstract: There is currently no rigorous definition of gravitational wave strain at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. The usual association of gravitational waves with transverse and traceless fluctuations of the metric on spatial hypersurfaces becomes ambiguous at second order, as it inherently depends on the spacetime slicing. While this poses no practical issues in linearized gravity, it presents a fundamental problem for secondary gravitational waves, especially notorious for gravitational waves induced by primordial fluctuations. We compute, for the first time, the physical effects of gravitational waves at second order, as measured by geodesic observers that emit and receive electromagnetic signals, thereby settling the debate on gauge ambiguities. We find that the measured gravitational wave strain coincides with the transverse-traceless components in the Newton gauge.

TL;DR: Strange stars can have a maximum mass up to 3.11 solar masses in quadratic curvature gravity with non-minimal matter coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating the maximum mass of strange stars under alternative gravitational theories to better understand their physical properties and potential astrophysical implications.

Method: Derived modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, employed the MIT bag model equation of state within the framework of quadratic curvature gravity with non-minimal matter coupling.

Result: Maximum mass of strange stars exceeds the general relativistic limit, reaching up to 3.11 solar masses.

Conclusion: The findings open new possibilities for understanding counterparts of gravitational wave events, such as GW190814, potentially allowing for compact objects that are more massive than previously considered limits in general relativity.

Abstract: We explore the maximum mass limit of strange stars in quadratic curvature gravity with the non-minimal matter coupling. The characteristic parameters of the quadratic curvature coupling and the non-minimal matter coupling imply the contributions from higher-order curvature terms and the coupling between matter and geometry, respectively. We explicitly demonstrate that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor can be modified, and that in the vanishing limit of the non-minimal matter coupling, the formalism of general relativity is recovered. By deriving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations from the gravitational field equations and applying the MIT bag model equation of state, we obtain the corresponding mass-radius relationships for strange stars. Furthermore, we show that the maximum mass limit of strange stars can exceed the general relativistic counterpart. Specifically, we find that a maximum mass up to 3.11 solar mass is achievable, suggesting that the lighter companion of GW190814 could plausibly be a strange star.

TL;DR: A simple solution for in-situ RF reflectometry with a mk-STM using SIN tunnel junctions and RF best practices to measure coherence peaks and rf losses, coupled with impedance matching for sensitivity. This setup enables size mapping of island features down to 5 nm².


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a practical and sensitive method for in-situ RF reflectometry using a mk-STM, which can be applied in various materials science and quantum information science contexts, particularly for studying surface features at the nanoscale.

Method: The method involves creating a superconductor-insulator-normal metal (SIN) tunnel junction with a Niobium STM tip. RF losses and electron temperature fluctuations are measured by tracking the evolution of coherence peaks at the superconducting gap edge. Impedance matching is achieved by adjusting the tip-sample capacitance as a function of the approach distance to enhance sensitivity.

Result: The demonstrated capability allows for imaging island sizes as small as 5 nm² based on position-dependent reflectometry losses, showing the effectiveness of the method in achieving high sensitivity in RF reflectometry.

Conclusion: This work presents a straightforward yet effective approach for RF reflectometry using a mk-STM, which paves the way for studying dynamic surface phenomena and island structures with sub-nanometer resolution.

Abstract: We present a simple home made solution enabling in-situ RF reflectometry measurements with a millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope (mk-STM). The additions described below were made using RF best practices following similar detection schemes commonly employed in the quantum information science (QIS) community. Using a Niobium STM tip to form a superconductor-insulator-normal metal (SIN) tunnel junction, the evolution of coherence peaks at the SC-gap edge are carefully measured to characterize the RF losses and electron temperature. We further identify impedance matching as a crucial factor to achieve high sensitivity in the reflectometry by tuning the tip-sample capacitance as a function of approach distance. As a demonstration of this capability, we measure a 50x50 nm$^2$ area of island features that have been condensed onto the surface of a gold single crystal. Position dependent reflectometry losses allow us to image island sizes down to a total surface area of 5 nm$^2$ given our current sensitivity.

Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO or JUNO-TAO) is a satellite observatory for the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), located 44 meters away from the No.1 reactor of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant. TAO can measure the reactor antineutrino energy spectrum with excellent energy resolution (better than 2\% at 1 MeV) using state-of-the-art Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) operated at low temperature. To achieve this goal, the SiPMs (together with their readout electronics) must be well calibrated. This paper presents the channel-level calibration methods for the dark count rate (DCR), relative photon detection efficiency (PDE), time offset, gain, and internal optical crosstalk (IOCT) of the SiPMs based on charge and time information of the collected events. For the calibration of the external optical crosstalk (EOCT), in terms of its rate and emission angle distribution, a novel method is proposed by switching on and off different groups of SiPMs with an LED placed in the detector. Using one million simulated events, the expected calibration biases are evaluated for all the aforementioned parameters: relative PDE (2.1\%), IOCT (1.4\%), DCR (0.4\%), EOCT Rate ($<0.1\%$), gain ($<0.1\%$), time offset (0.027 ns). The emission angle distribution of the EOCT photons could be measured with a bias of less than 4\% in main angular range.

Abstract: Detecting fast and thermal neutrons plays a crucial role in neutrino experiments and reactor physics. In this study, we propose a plastic scintillator detector which demonstrates the ability to clearly distinguish fast neutrons, thermal neutrons, and gamma rays within mixed radiation fields, offering a practical approach for multi-radiation detection. Two plastic scintillator assemblies: EJ200+EJ426 and EJ276+EJ426 were setup, and the system energy response was calibrated using three gamma sources(137Cs, 22Na and 60Co). An Am-Be neutron source was employed, and pulse shape discrimination(PSD) was used to separate fast neutrons, thermal neutrons and gamma rays. Using a three-sigma discrimination criterion, the EJ200+EJ426 configuration was found to reliably distinguish thermal neutrons from gamma rays, while the EJ276+EJ426 configuration can effectively discriminate fast neutrons, thermal neutrons and gamma rays at gamma-equivalent energies above 1 MeV.

Abstract: The Zitterbewegung phenomenon in multiband electronic systems is known to be subtly related to the charge conductivity, Berry curvature and the Chern number. Here we show that some spin-dependent properties as the optical spin conductivity, and intrinsic spin Hall conductivity are also entangled with the Zitterbewegung amplitudes. We also show that in multiband Dirac-type Hamiltonians, a direct link between the Zitterbewegung and the spin textures and spin transition amplitudes can be established. The later allow us to discern the presence or not of the Zitterbewegung oscillations by simply analyzing the spin or pseudo-spin textures. We provide examples of the applicability of our approach for Hamiltonian models that show the suppression of specific Zitterbewegung oscillations.

Abstract: Fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, a lattice analogue of fractional quantum Hall effect, offers a unique pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation and deep insights into the interplay of topology and strong correlations. The exploration has been successfully guided by the paradigm of ideal flat Chern bands, which mimic Landau levels in both band topology and local quantum geometry. Yet, given the near-infinite possibilities for Bloch bands in lattices, it remains a major open question whether FQAH states can emerge in scenarios fundamentally different from this paradigm. Here we turn to a class of gapless flat bands, featuring divergent quantum geometry at singular band touching, non-integer Berry flux threading the Brillouin zone (BZ), and ill-defined band topology. Our exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations unambiguously demonstrate FQAH phase that is virtually independent of the interaction strength, persisting from the weak-interaction to the strong-interaction limit. We find the stability of the FQAH states does not uniquely correlate with the singularity strength or the BZ-averaged quantum geometric fluctuations. Instead, the many-body topological order can adapt to the singular and fluctuating quantum geometric landscape by spontaneously developing an inhomogeneous carrier distribution, while its quenching accompanies the drop in the occupation-weighted Berry flux. Our work reveals a profound interplay between quantum geometry and many-body correlation, and significantly expands the design space for exploring FQAH effect and flat-band correlation phenomena in general.

Abstract: All-optical switching in a ferromagnetic spin valve is studied here using atomistic spin drift-diffusion dynamics, which includes contributions from spin pumping and superdiffusive transport. The switching is governed by two main sources of current transients: i) spin currents pumped by the reference layer, and ii) spin-polarized currents due to non-equilibrium hot electrons excited by the laser pulse. In particular, an initial superdiffusive forward flow of electrons, polarized by the free layer, is generated. This drives parallel to antiparallel switching of the free layer through accumulation of minority spins at the reference layer. A diffusive backward flow of electrons, repolarized by the reference layer, follows the initial superdiffusive flow as the charge distribution re-equilibrates. Due to the pulse width-dependent asymmetric amplitudes of the forward and backward transients, the latter can drive antiparallel to parallel switching, and create multi-domain structures at higher laser fluences and longer pulses. The results obtained here are in agreement with experimental observations, providing a framework for self-consistent modelling of all-optical switching in metallic heterostructures.

Abstract: We develop a quantum kinetic theory of two-dimensional electron gases in which exchange is treated self-consistently at the Hartree-Fock level and enters as a nonlocal, momentum-dependent field in phase space. By starting from the Coulomb Hamiltonian, we derive a Hartree-Fock-Wigner equation for the electronic Wigner function and obtain a closed fluid model with exchange-corrected pressure, force, and current. For a single layer, we show that exchange renormalizes the Fermi velocity and can drive a long-wavelength plasmonic instability at low densities. In coupled layers, the same framework predicts acoustic-optical mode coupling, and an instability forming long-lived charge-imbalance patterns that are not predicted by classical Vlasov and Boltzmann models. Finally, we apply the kinetic model to the Coulomb drag problem and show how exchange substantially enhances the drag resistivity in dilute GaAs double wells, quantitatively matching experimental observations.

Abstract: Kapitza-Dirac scattering, the diffraction of matter waves from a standing light field, is widely utilized in ultracold gases, but its behavior in the strongly interacting regime is an open question. Here we develop a numerically-exact two-body description of Kapitza-Dirac scattering for two contact-interacting atoms in a one-dimensional harmonic trap subjected to a pulsed optical lattice, enabling us to obtain the numerically exact dynamics. We map how interaction strength, lattice depth, lattice wavenumber, and pulse duration reshape the diffraction pattern, leading to an interaction-dependent population redistribution in real and momentum-space. By comparing the exact dynamics to an impulsive sudden-approximation description, we delineate the parameter regimes where it remains accurate and those, notably at strong attraction and small lattice wavenumber, where it fails. Our results provide a controlled few-body benchmark for interacting Kapitza-Dirac scattering and quantitative guidance for Kapitza-Dirac-based probes of ultracold atomic systems.

Abstract: We investigate holographic Krylov complexity in fully top-down AdS$_3$ and AdS$_2$ supergravity backgrounds dual to two-dimensional linear-quiver SCFTs and one-dimensional conformal quantum mechanics. In these geometries, the warp factors, dilaton and other fields depend non-trivially on the 'quiver coordinate' (denoted by $η$ in this paper). This $η$-coordinate encodes the color and flavor data of the dual theories. As a consequence, a massive probe following a holographic geodesic necessarily moves simultaneously in the radial AdS direction and along the 'quiver direction'. This produces new contributions to the proper momentum and hence to the rate of Krylov complexity growth, which is absent in bottom-up AdS models. We show that the $η$-motion is generically damped, with a time-scale governed by the UV cutoff of the geodesic problem, and modifies the early-time evolution of complexity in a quiver-dependent way. At late times, the $η$-dynamics freezes and the growth becomes universal, matching pure Poincare AdS predictions. Studying Abelian and non-Abelian T-dual backgrounds of AdS$_3\times S^3\times T^4$, quivers with localized flavor groups, and quivers with smeared flavor groups, we quantify how quiver parameters shape the operator-spreading dynamics. Our results provide a systematic characterization of Krylov complexity in top-down AdS$_3$/AdS$_2$ duals and reveal a holographic mechanism through which complexity probes both ultraviolet quiver structure and emergent infrared universality.

Abstract: We study the birational geometry (i.e., Kähler moduli space) of Calabi--Yau (CY) threefold hypersurfaces in toric varieties arising from four-dimensional reflexive polytopes. In particular, it has been observed that the birational classes of these geometries are not exhausted by toric hypersurfaces arising from fine, regular, star triangulations (FRSTs). We begin by introducing a classification problem: enumeration of birational classes of toric varieties, which is equivalent to enumeration of certain triangulations/fans. We consider this problem from the complementary perspectives of triangulation theory and toric geometry, reviewing both theories in detail; this culminates in an explanation of how to generate all fine regular triangulations of a vector configuration (i.e., fine regular simplicial fans). We then apply this theory to the Kreuzer--Skarke (KS) database, where we encounter both FRSTs and vex triangulations. We study the non-weak-Fano toric varieties arising from vex triangulations, along with their CY hypersurfaces. In particular, we show that all fine regular triangulations of a fixed 4D reflexive polytope give rise to smooth birational CY hypersurfaces, extending Batyrev's result from FRSTs to vex triangulations. We exhaustively enumerate all $24,023,940$ fine regular triangulations in the KS database with $h^{1,1}\leq 7$, of which over $70\%$ are vex triangulations, and provide an upper bound of $10^{979}$ for fine regular triangulations in the entire KS database. We conclude that vex triangulations of four-dimensional reflexive polytopes give rise to a large number of smooth Calabi--Yau threefolds and importantly provide toric descriptions for novel regions in the Kähler moduli space.

Abstract: We adapt the Hamilton-Jacobi method of holographic renormalization to scalar field theories in Minkowski spacetime with scattering boundary conditions. The approach yields a flat-space holographic dictionary in which the expectation value of a dual operator is given by the renormalized canonical momentum. The source of the operator is imposed as a Dirichlet condition in a radial timelike foliation of the bulk theory and corresponds to the scattering data appearing in the Arefeva-Faddeev-Slavnov generating functional. We initiate a study of massive scalars and interacting fields within this formalism and we comment on extensions to different bulk theories and backgrounds.

Abstract: We consider Einstein-Maxwell gravity in diverse dimensions and construct the small charge perturbation to the extremal rotating black holes with all equal angular momenta in odd $D=2n+1$ dimensions. Exact solutions exist at the next-to-leading order (NLO), and they are analytic, allowing us to obtain the charge corrections to thermodynamic quantities at this order. Irrational exponents in the near-horizon power-series expansion emerge at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). We show, by numerical computation, that these horizon geometries can indeed be integrated out to asymptotic Minkowski spacetime, thereby proving the existence of the unusual singular horizon behavior of the extremal charged rotating black holes.

Abstract: We propose a new class of holographic dualities between certain, generically non supersymmetric, defect conformal field theories (dCFTs) and their gravity duals. Our construction interpolates between the 1/2-BPS D3-D3 system and its field theory dual at one end, and the holographic duality presented in arXiv: 2506.14505 at the other. On the gravity side, the defect is realised by a novel D5 probe brane embedded in the $AdS_5\times S^5$ geometry. The symmetry of the induced on the D5 brane metric is $AdS_3\times S^1\times S^2$. At a certain limit the D5 brane becomes singular and resembles the D3-D3 system. Consistency requires the presence of two D7 branes on which the D5 brane terminates. The existence of boundaries induces a gauge anomaly for the D5 brane which is cancelled through anomaly inflow from the D7 branes. The full system of the D5 and D7 branes is, thus, anomaly free. Also it does not have any tachyonic instabilities for a certain range of its parameters. On the field theory side, we determined the classical solution of the ${\cal N}=4$ SYM equations of motion which we conjecture to describe the defect dual to the D5-D7 system and comment on the identification of the parameters appearing at the two sides of the duality.

TL;DR:  papers study cluster algebras for symbols in conformal cosmological correlators, showing that tree-level n-site ladder correlators correspond to A_{2(n-1)} cluster algebras, while one-loop bubble correlators involve unions of two A_3 cluster algebras. These algebras' relations aid in bootstrap methods for analytic correpators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mathematical structure of cosmological correlators is crucial for developing analytic bootstrap methods in conformal field theories. By linking cluster algebras to the symbols of these correlators, the paper provides a powerful tool for future research.

Method: The authors use algebraic geometry and cluster algebra techniques to analyze the symbol letters of conformal cosmological correlators at tree and one-loop levels. They derive general formulas for the symbol alphabets and study their algebraic structures.

Result: Tree-level n-site ladder correlators have symbols determined by A_{2(n-1)} cluster algebras, and one-loop bubble correlators involve unions of two A_3 cluster algebras. These results establish a direct connection between cluster algebras and the mathematical structure of cosmological correlators.

Conclusion: This work bridges cluster algebras with cosmological correlators in conformal field theories, offering a new framework for bootstrap methods. Future research can explore similar connections for higher-loop corrections and more complex correlators.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the cluster algebras for symbol letters or singularities of cosmological correlators in a conformally coupled scalar field theory. We show that the symbol letters for tree-level n-site ladder cosmological correlators are governed by A_{2(n-1)} cluster algebras. Additionally, we demonstrate that the symbol letters for one-loop bubble cosmological correlator are an union of two A_3 cluster algebras. The algebras relations of letters will provide an important tool to bootstrap analytic cosmological correlators.

Abstract: In this paper we explore the mathematical properties of wavefunction coefficients in power-law FRW cosmologies, and establish their relation to cluster algebras. We focus on the particular contributions to the wavefunction coefficient coming from the path Feynman graphs, and show that the singularities of the wavefunction associated with a $n$-site path graph are related to the $\mathcal{X}$-coordinates of the cluster algebra $A_{2n-2}$. To establish this relation, we consider the symbol of the de Sitter wavefunction coefficients and show that the letters appearing there are the region variables associated to tubings on the path graph. These variables can be rewritten as simplicial coordinates of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{0,2n+1}$ and therefore identified with the $\mathcal{X}$-coordinates of type-$A_{2n-2}$ cluster algebras. We use this result to compute the wavefunction coefficients in terms of cluster functions.

Abstract: We formulate the quantum version of non-projectable Hořava gravity as a Lagrangian theory with a path integral in the configuration space with an ultra-local in time, but non-local in space, field-dependent measure. Using auxiliary fields, we cast the measure into a local form satisfying several bosonic and fermionic symmetries. We perform an explicit one-loop computation in the theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions, using for the case study the divergent part of the action on a background with non-trivial shift vector; the background spatial metric is taken to be flat and the background lapse function is set to 1. No truncations are assumed at the level of perturbations, for which we develop a diagrammatic technique and a version of the heat-kernel method. We isolate dangerous linear-in-frequency divergences in the two-point function of the shift, which can lead to spatial non-localities, and explicitly verify their cancellation. This leaves a fully local expression for the divergent part of the quadratic effective action, from which we extract the beta functions for the Newton constant and the essential coupling $λ$ in the kinetic term of the metric. We formulate the questions that need to be addressed to prove perturbative renormalizability of the non-projectable Hořava gravity.

Abstract: Nielsen's geometric approach offers a powerful framework for quantifying the complexity of unitary transformations. In this formulation, complexity is defined as the length of the minimal geodesic in a suitably constructed geometric space associated with the Lie group of relevant operators. Despite its conceptual appeal, determining geodesic distances on Lie group manifolds is generally challenging, and existing treatments often rely on perturbative expansions in the structure constants. In this work, we circumvent these limitations by employing a finite-dimensional matrix representation of the generators, which enables an exact computation of the geodesic distance and hence a precise determination of the complexity. We focus on the $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ Lie algebra, relevant for quantum scalar fields evolving on homogeneous and isotropic cosmological backgrounds. The resulting expression for the complexity is applied to de Sitter spacetime as well as to asymptotically static cosmological models undergoing contraction or expansion.

Conclusion: 这篇论文提出了一种适用于多场系统的新极点穿刺方法，并通过超流体系统的研究结果说明了这一方法的有效性。

Abstract: The pole-skipping is a universal property of Green's functions at strong coupling found by the AdS/CFT duality. There is a conventional formalism of the pole-skipping, but it relies on the existence of a "master variable." Namely, it is applicable to a system with a single field. We propose an alternative formalism that does not rely on a master variable. As an example, we study the pole-skipping of holographic superfluids. A "hydrodynamic" pole such as the diffusion pole is usually regarded as a pole-skipping point. But we point out that not all hydrodynamic poles are pole-skipping points.

Abstract: A dispersion integral representation of the Heisenberg-Euler QED effective lagrangian is derived, with Faddeev's quantum dilogarithm as a generalized Borel kernel. The nonperturbative imaginary part of the effective lagrangian is expressed as the quantum dilogarithm, while the real part has the form of a dispersion integral involving both the quantum dilogarithm and its modular dual, a manifestation of electromagnetic duality. The Heisenberg-Euler effective lagrangian generates all one-loop QED scattering amplitudes in a constant external field, with the Lorentz invariants of the constant background electromagnetic field playing the role of the Mandelstam variables in conventional QED dispersion theory.

Abstract: We investigate the analytic structure of thermal spectral function of holographic CFTs, synthesizing recent developments into a set of observations about its asymptotics. Specifically, for a class of scalar primaries with integral dimension, we demonstrate factorization of the exact spectral function into a polynomial piece, which captures the vacuum dynamics, and a non-perturbative piece, which controls its asymptotics. Using exact WKB techniques, we derive a transseries expression for the latter. We use this information to deduce the singular loci of a spatially averaged thermofield double correlator in the complex time plane. Such singularities have been argued to encode information regarding the black hole singularity in the dual spacetime. Our results give a refinement of these statements by capturing the momentum dependence.

As a by-product, we also find a novel Nahm sum formula for the vacuum character of $(3,8)$ $W_3$ minimal model, from which we find another Chern--Simons matter theory describing the R-twisted $S^1$-reduction of the $(A_2,A_4)$ theory.

Abstract: We show that a generalized Polyakov mechanism can lead to confinement at weak coupling in $3+1$ dimensions when the theory is placed in a non-trivial, spatially varying magnetic field background. Depending on the magnitude of the field and the length scale of its spatial variation, the "dual" Schwinger mechanism for monopole-antimonopole pair creation may or may not be operative. At the threshold, monopole loops in the Euclidean description develop an almost flat direction. In this regime, confinement arises in a way similar to the $2+1$ dimensional Polyakov mechanism and the monopoles and antimonopoles are effectively replaced by deconfined "bits" of a monopole loop.

Abstract: For the combined field-theoretic system of the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) Abelian 3-form and 1-form gauge theories, we show the existence of a unique bosonic symmetry transformation that is constructed from the four infinitesimal, continuous and off-shell nilpotent symmetry transformations which exist for the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantized versions of the coupled (but equivalent) Lagrangian densities (that describe the present 4D field-theoretic system). The above off-shell nilpotent symmetry transformations are nothing but the BRST, co-BRST, anti-BRST and anti-co-BRST, under which, the Lagrangian densities transform to the total spacetime derivatives. The proof of the uniqueness of the above bosonic symmetry transformation operator crucially depends on the validity of all the four Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions that exist on our theory. We highlight the importance of these CF-type restrictions, at various levels of our theoretical discussions, in the context of the unique bosonic transformation. We compare this observation against the backdrop of the three CF-type restrictions that appear in the requirements of the absolute anticommutativity of the specific set of nilpotent symmetries.

Abstract: We show how to construct 2d field theories with holomorphic integrability from defect setups in 4d holomorphic BF. In a simple example setup, we explicitly construct the 2d theory and perform an initial classical analysis. Making use of the symmetries, we are able to write down an infinite family of solutions to the equations of motion. Comparing with more typical integrable systems, we explain how 2d holomorphic integrability sits between the standard notions of integrability in one and two dimensions. These 2d theories are designed as toy models for integrable theories in three and four dimensions, many of which can be understood as partially or totally holomorphic. We comment on the implications for higher-dimensional integrability and aspects of quantization in the concluding remarks.

Abstract: The scalar, vector and tensor spherical harmonics on three-dimensional de Sitter spacetime are defined and analyzed. Each harmonic defines two sets of asymptotic data on the two sphere in the asymptotic expansion close to both the past and the future of de Sitter spacetime. For each case, we explicit the antipodal relationship of both sets of asymptotic data between past and future infinity, which can be non-local. A procedure is defined to extract these asymptotic data in the presence of sources. This provides for each class of propagating field on de Sitter the relationship between two independent sets of data defined on the sphere in the asymptotic future with the corresponding data defined in the asymptotic past. We also provide several theorems on the decomposition of vector and tensors on de Sitter such as one proving that a large class of tensors obeying an inhomogeneous wave equation can be expressed locally in terms of a symmetric transverse traceless tensor. These results are instrumental in the description of interacting four-dimensional asymptotically flat fields at spatial infinity.

Abstract: We revisit the numerical solution of the mirror TBA equations for pure--Ramond-Ramond strings on $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ in the tensionless limit. Our analysis uses the recently-proposed modification of the dressing factors which account for non-trivial exchange relations of the massless modes. At leading order in the tension, the dynamics is driven by the massless excitations associated to $T^4$ modes and their superpartners, but it is non-relativistic and interacting unlike what happens in the symmetric-product orbifold CFT of $T^4$.

Abstract: We study the generalized cusp anomalous dimension, or quark-antiquark potential on the three-sphere, in the presence of a large $R$-charge $L$ and at strong coupling. Considering the insertion of a local scalar operator of charge $L$ on a cusped Wilson loop, we investigate the general solution of the dual string configuration for any value of cusp angles, paying particular attention to the different ranges of the physical parameters and obtaining a unified description that simultaneously captures the near BPS, the antiparallel lines and the large-$L$ regimes. We observe, in the limit of small separation between the lines, a non-analytic change in the behavior of the cusp anomaly at a critical value of $L$: one crosses from a region dominated by the familiar Coulomb-like singularity to a ``deconfined" situation describing the leading Lüscher corrections at large $L$ of the generalized cusp anomalous dimension. We derive the equations for small fluctuations around the classical string solution, generalizing previous analysis of the uncharged case, and we study the behavior of the spectrum near the transition region. Finally, we speculate on the field theory origin of the transition and on its implications for the fusion of Wilson lines.

Abstract: Accelerator control systems often represent relatively complex and safety-sensitive human-machine interfaces within process control industries. These systems are technically robust and reflect the cumulative integration of solutions built and adapted across decades. One of the regular, unfortunate casualties of provisional accelerator control system updates is their human-system interfaces (HSIs) which often lag behind modern usability and design standards. An additional challenge is that although there is a multitude of established human factors (HF), and user experience (UX) principles for everyday digital applications, there are very few (if any) established principles for complex and safety-critical applications for an accelerator. This paper argues for the importance of established HF and UX principles (herein referred to as human-centered design principles) into the development of accelerator HSIs, emphasizing the need for clarity, consistency, responsiveness, and cognitive accessibility. Drawing from HF/UX best practices and human-centered design, this paper discusses how these approaches can enhance operator performance, reduce human error, and improve accelerator personnel collaboration. Case studies from Accelerator Control Operations Research Network (ACORN) at Fermilab are explored to demonstrate how interfaces built with human-centered design principles can scale with system complexity while remaining intuitive and efficient for diverse user roles including operators, machine experts, and engineers. By bridging the gap between traditional control system design and modern human-centered design methods, this paper provides a roadmap for evolving accelerator HSIs into more usable, maintainable, and effective tools.

Abstract: Magnet errors in storage rings significantly degrade beam performance, impacting the brightness and stability of the light source. Therefore, beam-based correction is crucial for the safe operation of machines and the stability of radiated photons. Unlike traditional correction methods such as linear optics from closed orbit, this paper proposes a machine learning (ML) framework to directly predict quadrupole/sextupole gradient errors and misalignment from beam position monitor-measured optics functions and closed-orbit distortion data. Based on a four-bend achromat storage ring lattice, we generate training datasets through ELEGANT numerical simulations and compare regression performance of Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Radial Basis Function Neural Network and Densely Connected Convolutional Network. Results demonstrate that ML models can effectively predict magnet errors and reconstruct ideal optics. This approach offers a novel strategy for accelerating storage ring commissioning and optimization, online diagnostics, and dynamic compensation for next-generation diffraction-limited rings.

Abstract: A simple theoretical model is developed to describe spin reorientation (SR) transitions in rare-earth orthoferrites and orthochromites RFeO3 and RCrO3. Within a ``single-doublet'' approach, the free energy includes anisotropy contributions from the 3d-sublattice and the splitting of the lower doublet of 4f-ions. The model predicts various types of SR transitions - first-order, second-order, and mixed - depending on anisotropy parameters. Effects of non-magnetic dilution, heat capacity anomalies, and behavior of the rare-earth magnetic moment in the SR region are analyzed.

Abstract: Decisive experimental confirmation of the $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid phase in quantum spin ice remains an outstanding challenge. In this work, we propose stray-field magnetometry as a direct probe of the emergent photons -- the gapless excitation of the emergent electrodynamics in quantum spin ice. The emergent photons are transverse magnetization waves, which, in a finite sample, form discrete modes governed by one of two sets of natural boundary conditions: ``insulating'' or ``superconducting''. Considering cavity and thin film geometries, we find that the spectrum and spatial structure of the stray magnetic noise provide a sharp qualitative signature of the underlying electrodynamics. The predicted stray-field noise power lies comfortably within the detection range of present-day solid-state defect magnetometry.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We assess the accuracy of the cumulant expansion (CE) method, combined with the independent-particle approximation (IPA), for calculating charge mobility in electron-phonon systems. As representative testbeds, we consider the Peierls and Fröhlich models, which serve as simplified frameworks where accurate or numerically exact benchmarks are available. These are used to compare the CE results with those obtained using the Boltzmann formalism, the Migdal approximation, and its self consistent extension-approaches that are presently the most commonly employed alternatives for transport calculations. Supported by analytical arguments based on spectral sum rules and by our previous results for the Holstein model, we argue that, for weak to moderate coupling strengths and not-too-low temperatures, the CE within the IPA framework yields accurate results. In the case of the Peierls model, the role of vertex corrections is also discussed.

Abstract: The recent experimental observations of high temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate have attracted lots of attentions. Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states. Here, we show that breaking this mirror symmetry via an applied displacement field can stabilize a pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductor, which is similar to the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but at zero magnetic field. Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry. Our results establish bilayer nickelate as a tunable platform for realizing finite-momentum pairing and for exploring generalized disorder effects.

TL;DR:  paper studies the magnetic properties of cobalt vanadate Na2SrCo(VO4)2, showing room-temperature ferromagnetic behavior in distorted triangular layers, with spin-1/2 states evidenced below Tc ~3.4K. Binding interactions of TO4 tetrahedra influence the magnetic structure compared to similar trigonal compounds like Na2BaCo(VO4)2 and Na2BaCo(PO4)2. Neutron diffraction at low T confirms canted ferromagnetic order. entropy recovery supports spin-1/2 state. sister compounds exhibit different magnetic ground states. study highlights the role of tetrahedral geometry in tuning exchange and magnetic interactions.

Motivation:  studies of geometrically constrain magnetic moments are central to understanding quantum magnetism and complex spin states in solid-state physics. this material serves as a model system for studying spin interactions, phase transitions, and entropy recovery in low-dimensional ordered systems. exploring its unique spin state and comparison with other compounds contributes to broader discussions on magnetic order in structured materials.

Method:  x-ray and neutron diffraction were employed to probe structural and magnetic ordering. magnetization measurements revealed ferromagnetic transition and specific heat anomaly. entropy recovery calculations informed the spin-1/2 characterization. neutron diffraction at low temp provided orientation details for ferromagnetic order.

Result:  in glaserite-stilblate Co vanadates, room temp exhibits ferrimagnetism. at low temp, effective spin-1/2 state confirmed via entropy recovery. canted lattice of Co^2+ in ac plane with moment ~2.6 μB. comparison to other compounds shows distinct magnetic responses tied to their structure, emphasizing TO4 tetrahedra's role in exchange and magnetic tuning.

Conclusion:  naive2srco(VO4)2 offers a prism for understanding how prosthetic tetrahedra shapes and chemistry drive spin interactions and magnetic order. the combination of distorted layers and spin-1/2 states makes for interactions consistent with entropic contributions in low-dimensional systems. sister compounds provide a framework for more comprehensive classification of magnetic order in these classes of materials.

Abstract: Triangular-lattice cobaltates with glaserite-type $X_2Y$Co($T$O$_4)_2$ structure provide an ideal platform to investigate intriguing quantum magnetism. Here we report a comprehensive study of the structural and magnetic properties of a triangular-lattice cobalt vanadate $\rm Na_2SrCo(VO_4)_2$. Room-temperature x-ray and neutron powder diffraction confirm that $\rm Na_2SrCo(VO_4)_2$ crystallizes in the monoclinic $P2_1/c$ space group with slightly distorted triangular layers of $\rm Co^{2+}$ ions. Magnetization measurements reveal a ferromagnetic transition at $T\rm_C \approx 3.4~{\rm K}$, where a sharp $λ$-type anomaly is observed in the specific heat. The magnetic entropy recovered up to 55 K approaches 90$\%$ of $R{\rm ln}2$, supporting an effective spin-1/2 state of Co$^{2+}$ ions at low temperature. Neutron diffraction at 2.3 K (below $T_{\rm C}$) further confirms a long-range canted ferromagnetic order with the Co$^{2+}$ moments aligned in the $ac$ plane and the ordered moment size of $\sim$ 2.6 $μ\rm_{B}$. Comparing with its sister compounds with a trigonal symmetry, $\rm Na_2BaCo(VO_4)_2$ with a collinear ferromagnetic structure and the recently discovered spin supersolid candidate $\rm Na_2BaCo(PO_4)_2$ with a distinct Y-like antiferromagnetic ground state, this study indicates the decisive role of the $T{\rm O_4}$ tetrahedra in tuning exchange interactions and contrasting magnetic behaviors of these glaserite-structure compounds.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper explores the formation and properties of spin-charge stripes in high-temperature superconductors using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. They study long, isolated stripes in an 18-leg cylindrical strip geometry and find good agreement with established results. The study reveals two distinct regimes of stripe formation, depending on the doping level. One regime is dominated by high-filling behavior, while the other involves low-filling and individual dopant pairs. The research provides insights into the microscopic mechanisms behind the striped phase and its relevance for quantum simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding low-temperature quantum phases in high-temperature superconductors is crucial for advancing the field of condensed matter physics. Spin-charge stripes are a promising candidate for additional orders beyond superconductivity, and studying their properties is therefore important.

Method: The authors employ the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm on an 18-leg cylindrical strip geometry. They compute the ground states and analyze the stripe filling fractions, doping sides, and structure of dopant pairs. Their approach allows them to identify two distinct regimes in stripe formation.

Result: The study confirms the established understanding of spin-charge stripe properties. Two distinct forms of stripe formation are identified: a high-filling regime described by a simplified model and a low-filling regime characterized by individual dopant pairs. These findings highlight the importance of microscopic constituents in the striped phase and the challenges of observing these regimes in quantum simulations.

Conclusion: The research contributes to the understanding of spin-charge stripe formation in high-temperature superconductors by providing a detailed analysis of the microscopic mechanisms involved. The findings offer new perspectives on the study of phase diagrams and phase coexistence in quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Spin-charge stripes belong to the most prominent low-temperature orders besides superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors. This phase is particularly challenging to study numerically due to finite-size effects. By investigating the formation of long, isolated stripes, we offer a perspective complementary to typical finite-doping phase diagrams. We use the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm to extract the ground states of an 18-leg cylindrical strip geometry, making the diameter significantly wider than in previous works. This approach allows us to map out the range of possible stripe filling fractions on the electron versus hole-doped side. We find good agreement with established results, suggesting that the spread of filling fractions observed in the literature is governed by the physics of a single stripe. Taking a microscopic look at stripe formation, we reveal two separate regimes - a high-filling regime captured by a simplified squeezed-space model and a low-filling regime characterized by the structure of individual pairs of dopants. Thereby, we trace back the phenomenology of the striped phase to its microscopic constituents and highlight the different challenges for observing the two regimes in quantum simulation experiments.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of several quasiperiodic disorders and their continuous interpolation with the Aubry-Andre (AA) potential on the Hofstadter butterfly using mean field approximation at zero temperature for a two-dimensional square lattice. Weak disorder mildly smears the fractal spectrum, while strong quasiperiodic potentials destroy the butterfly and generate multiple energy gaps. The AA potential produces the strongest spectral restructuring, creating prominent gaps near half-filling. Interpolating AA with other quasiperiodic potentials reveals competing gap-opening mechanisms, ranging from AA-dominated gaps at small interpolation parameters to a robust half-filling gap generated by the competing disorders at large parameters. Entanglement entropy follows the area law at low and high magnetic fields but shows pronounced deviations at intermediate fields, with opposite trends for strong AA versus other quasiperiodic potentials. Localization analysis using IPR and NPR confirms enhanced localization with increasing disorder; the AA potential yields the largest IPR, with notable field dependence. Interpolation produces smooth crossovers between distinct localization regimes.

Abstract: Narrow-gap Mott insulators promise exceptional opportunities for voltage-controlled magnetic textures in low-dissipation spintronics, although their prediction remains challenging. Here we employ a density functional theory-guided approach to predict a narrow charge-transfer gap (127 meV) in the chiral cubic frustrated oxide Co$_5$TeO$_8$. Comprehensive neutron scattering and magnetometry reveal proper-screw Bloch-type helices with field- and temperature-tunable pitch of 5.7-10 nm embedded in a complex phase diagram with eight distinct phases. Ab initio wavefunction calculations demonstrate site-dependent single-ion anisotropy exceeding Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions by an order of magnitude, establishing the anisotropy-frustration interplay as the stabilization mechanism, contrasting starkly with DM-dominated cubic helimagnets. Sharp capacitance anomalies at phase boundaries confirm intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling throughout the phase diagram. Co$_5$TeO$_8$ thus provides a platform for voltage-tunable sub-10 nm magnetic textures, demonstrating effective theory-guided discovery of functional magnetic materials in correlated oxides.

Abstract: Intrinsically topologically ordered phases can host anyons. Here, we take the view that entanglement between anyons can give rise to an emergent geometry resembling Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. We analyze the entanglement structure of fractionalized anyons using mutual information and interpret the results within this emergent geometric framework. As a concrete example, we consider pairs of $e/2$-charged semions that arise from instanton configurations in a disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbon. These fractional charges, located on opposite zigzag edges, show long-range quantum entanglement despite being spatially separated. We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry. In this setup, the entanglement structure defines minimal surfaces in the bulk, providing a geometric view of the edge correlations. This gives a holographic picture of fractionalized degrees of freedom in quasi-one-dimensional systems and shows how quantum entanglement can generate emergent geometry even without conformal symmetry.

Abstract: At strong on-site repulsion $ U $, the fermionic Hubbard model realizes an extremely correlated electron system. In this regime, it is natural to derive the low-energy physics with the help of non-canonical operators acting on a projected Hilbert space without double occupancies. Using a strong-coupling functional renormalization group technique, we study the physics of such extreme correlations in the strict $ U = \infty $ limit, where only kinematic interactions due to the Hilbert space projection remain. For nearest-neighbor hopping on a square lattice, we find that the electronic spectrum is significantly renormalized, with bandwidth and quasi-particle residue strongly decreasing with increasing electron density. On the other hand, damping and particle-hole asymmetry increase, while a polaronic continuum forms in the hole sector, below the single-particle band. Fermi liquid phenomenology applies only at low densities, where the system remains paramagnetic. At higher densities, we find a bad metal with strong magnetic correlations, indicating that the ground state is the Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities and a stripe antiferromagnet at intermediate densities. Both in the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic regimes, we observe a violation of Luttinger's theorem.

Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium driven dynamics at topologically nontrivial quantum critical points (QCPs),and find that topological edge modes at criticality give rise to anomalous universal dynamical scaling behavior. By analyzing the driven dynamics of bulk and boundary order parameters at topologically distinct Ising QCPs, we demonstrate that, while the bulk dynamics remain indistinguishable and follow standard Kibble Zurek (KZ) scaling, the anomalous boundary dynamics is unique to topological criticality, and its explanation goes beyond the traditional KZ mechanism. To elucidate the unified origin of this anomaly, we further study the dynamics of defect production at topologically distinct QCPs in free-fermion models and demonstrate similar anomalous universal scaling exclusive to topological criticality. These findings establish the existence of anomalous dynamical scaling arising from the interplay between topology and driven dynamics, challenging standard paradigms of quantum critical dynamics.

Abstract: Magnetic octupole (MO) currents have recently attracted significant attention as a driving force for the Neel vector dynamics in d-wave altermagnets, a new class of antiferromagnets that exhibit nonrelativistic spin-split band structures. From a symmetry perspective, the MO includes an axial-dipole component analogous to that of the spin, making it essential to clarify how MO currents differ from spin currents. We here investigate the correspondence between MO conductivities and electronic multipoles, which provide a unified and powerful framework for symmetry analysis. We derive the multipole representation of the rank-five MO conductivity tensor and classify its symmetry-allowed components for all crystallographic point groups, in direct comparison with spin conductivity. We show that time-reversal-even electric-type multipoles give rise to the dissipationless MO current, whereas time-reversal-odd magnetic-type multipoles generate dissipative MO current under an applied electric field. Complementing this macroscopic analysis, the linear-response calculations for a microscopic tight-binding model demonstrate how MO conductivities are activated by symmetry lowering, exemplified by the symmetry reduction from Oh to Th. Our results elucidate the symmetry distinctions between MO currents and spin currents, and provide insights into their experimental identification.

Abstract: We present an ultrasensitive technique for probing transient optical changes in atomically thin molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) layers integrated onto silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) ring resonators. The MoS$_2$ is illuminated by a femtosecond laser, while a tunable near-infrared (NIR) continuous-wave laser probes the microresonator resonance. The NIR light polarization can be adjusted to either transverse electric (TE, parallel to the 2D material) or transverse magnetic (TM, perpendicular), a configuration that is impossible to achieve with conventional normal-incidence pump-probe techniques. By capturing the transmitted signal on a fast oscilloscope, we detect transient optical shifts with unprecedented sensitivity, observing phenomena over time scales ranging from picoseconds to microseconds. Our results reveal both a rapid, carrier-induced nonlinear optical shift in the resonance, and a slower thermo-optic transient. The ability to simultaneously measure these fast and slow dynamics offers new insight into the complex optoelectronic behavior of 2D materials when integrated with microresonators. This method provides a significant advance over traditional pump-probe approaches, enabling the detection of exceedingly small transient signals and opening new avenues for exploring the optical properties of atomically thin materials. Our findings highlight the potential of this approach for investigating polarization-dependent nonlinear effects, with applications in photonics, sensing, and optoelectronics.

Motivation:  room temperature spintronic Poisson bolometers are promising for infrared detection, hence the study. 

Method:  experimental study of statistical properties, including transition rates and interarrival times under illumination. 

Result:  Transitions exhibit Poissonian behavior; count rate increased 153%, interarrival time reduced 70% under light. 

Conclusion:  Spintronic Poisson bolometers are suitable for probabilistic, high-speed, and sensitive infrared detection at room temp. 

Abstract: Analog bolometers based on temperature-dependent phase-transition materials such as vanadium oxide (VOx) and barium titanate (BTO) represent the state of the art in uncooled infrared detectors. Recently, the first room-temperature spintronic Poisson bolometer based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) was proposed and demonstrated as a promising infrared detector. Unlike conventional bolometers, the spintronic Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, where the response is governed by resistance fluctuations arising from thermally activated magnetization transitions. Spontaneous transitions between two metastable magnetic states occur even in the absence of incident light, and the transition probability increases under illumination. In this work, we experimentally study the statistical properties of the optical response of the spintronic Poisson bolometer under illumination. We demonstrate that transitions in spintronic Poisson bolometers, both in the absence and presence of light, exhibit Poissonian behavior, with transition rates and interarrival times modulated by incident radiation. Under illumination, we observe a 153% increase in the count rate accompanied by a 70% reduction in interarrival time. These results establish spintronic Poisson bolometers as a promising platform for probabilistic, high-speed, and high-sensitivity infrared detection at room temperature.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian point gap (NHPG) is a unique phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems and induces non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). In photonic crystals, NHPG and the NHSE have previously been explored mainly through material loss, where the typically low $Q$ factors make direct observation of complex frequencies challenging. Here, we demonstrate the direct experimental observation of an NHPG by using a radiation-loss-based non-Hermitian photonic crystal. Radiation loss can be engineered through structural design, enabling control of the imaginary part of the complex frequency and allowing relatively high $Q$ factors. This approach is compatible with widely used absorption-free silicon-slab photonic crystals. We developed a measurement system that can measure photonic bands along arbitrary lines in $k$-space. Our measurements demonstrated direct observation of the NHPG in photonic crystals, and the reversal of non-Hermitian topology through the flip of loop rotation in a complex plane. Our platform, which requires neither gain media nor synthetic dimensions, establishes radiation-loss engineering as a simple and versatile route for photonic functionality using an NHSE in nanophotonic systems.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of Rayleigh scattering for creating structural colors in materials like porcelains, paintings, and modern compositions. It explores the relationship between material parameters and colors in different observation conditions, presents a method for creating composite materials with desired colors, and validates these findings experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the aesthetic and historical significance of structural colors in art and nature, aiming to bridge the gap between material science and artistic applications through scientific understanding.

Method: The researchers used Monte Carlo simulations to analyze disordered colloids, combined with experimental optical measurements on Yttria-stabilized Zirconia nanoparticles and borosilicate clays.

Result: The study found that Rayleigh scattering allows tuning of colors based on material parameters, achieved blue coloration in both diffuse reflection and transmission without opaque base materials, and validated these through experiments and composite material designs.

Conclusion: The findings open new possibilities for integrating material science with art and design, enabling controlled structural colors through easily accessible materials and methods.

Abstract: Structural coloration by Rayleigh scattering is widespread in nature and holds a prominent place in various art objects over a broad period of time, from ancient Chinese porcelains to Renaissance paintings. Beyond the common statement that Rayleigh scattering is the primary mechanism behind the multiple colored appearances of the sky, it appears that the relationship between material parameters and the colors that appear in different observation conditions has not been thoroughly explored so far. The present study aims to offer a general overview of the structural colors accessible by Rayleigh scattering as a function of the material parameters, alongside a scalable and environment-friendly process to realize solid composite materials with targeted structural colors in reflection and transmission. Monte Carlo light transport simulations are performed to compute the structural color palette of disordered colloids -- dielectric particles in a nonscattering matrix -- in different observation modes. In particular, we provide a range of physical parameters in which the materials exhibit the same blue color in diffuse reflection and transmission. We also show that, as may be counterintuitive at first, the addition of black absorbents to the matrix of a white (opaque) material can lead to the emergence of a blue coloration in diffuse reflection, thanks to the interplay between multiple light scattering and light absorption. These predictions are validated by optical experiments on colloidal suspensions of Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (ZrO$_2$:Y$_2$O$_3$) nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The potential of Rayleigh-scattering materials for visual arts and design is further supported by realizing solid-state composites based on abundant materials, namely borosilicate clays and hybrid silica-based glasses, using soft chemistry at room temperature.

TL;DR: The paper presents a scalable quantum photonic platform using van der Waals vanes, which consists of strain-engineered bilayer WSe2 quantum emitters integrated with optimized multimode WS2 waveguides. They achieve efficient on-chip single-photon sources, observing high-purity emission with near-zero second-order coherence in both on-chip and off-chip setups. The single-photon emission rate reaches 1.7 MHz under continuous-wave excitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of scalable photonic quantum technologies is crucial for advancing quantum information processing. Current methods often rely on bulky setups or incompatible materials, which limits scalability. This work addresses these limitations by integrating quantum emitters and waveguides using van der Waals vanes, enabling a more compact and efficient platform.

Method: The researchers developed a van der Waals platform by integrating strain-engineered bilayer WSe2 quantum emitters with multimode WS2 waveguides. They optimized the waveguides with grating couplers to enhance light emission and coupling. The study employs dual Hanbury Brown-Twiss configurations for measuring photon emission quality and rates.

Result: The system demonstrates high-quality single-photon emission, with second-order coherence values indicating sub- Poissonian emission. They achieve a single-photon count rate of 320 kHz at the output lens, corresponding to a waveguide-coupled rate of 1.7 MHz. This straightforward integration paves the way for scalable quantum photonic applications.

Conclusion: This work provides a proof-of-concept for a scalable quantum photonic platform using van der Waals vanes, which could pave the way for future developments in quantum information processing and quantum technologies.

Abstract: Scalable photonic quantum information technologies require a platform combining quantum light sources, waveguides, and detectors on a single chip. Here, we introduce a van der Waals platform comprising strain-engineered bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, integrated on multimode WS$_2$ waveguides with optimized grating couplers, enabling efficient on-chip quantum light sources. The emitters exhibit bright, highly polarized emission that couples efficiently into WS$_2$ waveguides. Under resonant p-shell excitation, we observe high-purity, waveguide-coupled single-photon emission, measured using both an off-chip Hanbury Brown-Twiss configuration ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.003^{+0.030}_{-0.003}$) and an on-chip configuration ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.076\pm0.023$). For a single output, the out-coupled single-photon count rate at the first lens reaches approximately 320 kHz under continuous-wave p-shell excitation, corresponding to an estimated waveguide-coupled rate of 1.7 MHz. These results demonstrate an efficient, integrated single-photon source and establish a pathway toward scalable photonic quantum information processing centered around nanoengineered van der Waals materials.

### [136] [Orientation-dependent high harmonic generation in ZnO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15370)

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Orientation-dependent high-harmonic generation in ZnO under femtosecond mid-infrared laser pulses was studied. The research shows that the generated harmonics' spectra are significantly influenced by the crystal orientation relative to the laser polarization direction. Theoretical calculations align well with experimental results, revealing the crucial role of the material's anisotropic band structure in high-harmonic generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding orientation-dependent high-harmonic generation (HHG) in ZnO is key to advancing nonlinear optical applications and ultrafast laser technology. This research provides insights into the interplay between material structure and HHG dynamics under intense laser pulses, which is vital for optimizing devices and applications in nanophotonics and solid-state physics.

Method: A combination of theoretical modeling and experimental investigation was employed. Theoretical work focused on calculating the angular modulation of harmonic yields based on the hexagonal lattice symmetry of ZnO, while experimental analysis involved measuring harmonic spectra under various crystal orientations relative to the laser beam.

Result: The experimental results showed a three-fold angular modulation of the intensity of odd-order harmonics in the (0001)-plane, which could be explained by the hexagonal lattice symmetry. However, a four-fold symmetry was observed experimentally, indicating additional factors affecting the electron-hole pair excitation dynamics and HHG processes in the material.

Conclusion: The orientation-dependent HHG in ZnO is primarily influenced by the material's anisotropic band structure. Theoretical and experimental results together suggest that lattice symmetry plays a significant role, but additional material-specific factors also contribute to the observed harmonic angular modulations.

Abstract: We theoretically and experimentally investigate orientation-dependent high-harmonic generation (HHG) in zinc oxide subjected to intense femtosecond mid-infrared (MIR) laser pulses. In agreement with past measurements from literature, we observe non-perturbative harmonic spectra with harmonics extending beyond the material band gap. The spectra depend sensitively on the orientation of the crystal with respect to the laser polarization direction. To benchmark the measurements, we performed detailed theoretical calculation of the orientation-dependent harmonic yields. The theory predicts a three-fold angular modulation of the intensity of odd-order harmonics in the (0001)-plane, which can be deduced from the symmetry of the hexagonal lattice alone, in contrast a four-fold symmetry is observed in the experiment. The theory points out the essential role of the anisotropy of the multiple band structure affecting the dynamics of electron-hole pair excitation and solid-state HHG.

Abstract: By means of the variational method and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the existence of stable 3D nonlinear modes, viz. vortex ``bullets'', in the form of pulsed beams carrying orbital angular momentum, that can self-trap in a 2D waveguiding structure. Despite the attractive self-interaction, which is necessary for producing the bullets (bright solitons), and which readily leads to the collapse in the 3D setting as well as to spontaneous splitting of vortex modes, we find a critical value of the trapping depth securing the stabilization of the vortex bullets. We identify experimental conditions for the creation of these topological modes in the context of coherent optical and matter waves. Collisions between the bullets moving in the unconfined direction are found to be elastic. These findings contribute to the understanding of self-trapping in nonlinear multidimensional systems and suggest new possibilities for the stabilization and control of 3D topological solitons.

Abstract: Polariton condensation is a potential system state for performing analog computations, given that it exhibits quantum behavior at macroscopic scales readily probed with low-cost optical methods. Current methods of fabricating devices in polariton microcavities largely involve patterning the devices via e-beam lithography before the cavity is completed, which offers less flexibility in device creation and reduces the maximum possible refractive index contrast. Moreover, the momentum and spatial distributions of the condensate are highly dependent on the host platform, and it has been difficult to preserve the desired behavior when modifying a given cavity. Here we introduce a method that addresses both of these challenges with the creation of polaritonic circuits of arbitrary forms etched via Focused Ion Beam into an organic microcavity based on Rhodamine 3B Perchlorate within a Small Molecule Ionic Isolation Lattices complex. We demonstrate room temperature condensation and propagation of polaritons in rectangular and trapezoidal waveguides by analyzing spatial and angle-resolved photoluminescence. We also discuss the blue-shifting and non-zero momentum of the condensate and show that it is strongly confined up to several higher energy levels. As an example, we report the spatial profiles of condensation in custom devices, such as a ring waveguide, a Y-splitter, and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. This work represents a first step towards the realization of more complex, fully integrated, coherent polaritonic circuits operating at room temperature.

Result: The method successfully retrieves amplitude and phase information, revealing domain structures and orientations in materials like ferroelectrics.

Conclusion: This approach offers high spatial and temporal resolution for lensless X-ray imaging, providing a pathway beyond traditional spectroscopy for quantum materials and biological systems.

Abstract: The advent of nonlinear X-ray processes like sum-frequency generation and four-wave mixing raises the possibility of non-linear X-ray imaging, combining the high-resolution and elemental specificity of X-ray imaging with the state selectivity and sensitivity of non-linear optical imaging. While scanning imaging methods may be feasible, for linear X-ray processes coherent diffractive imaging has emerged as a key approach, enabling lensless reconstruction of nanoscale structure and dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this work, we propose a coherent diffractive approach to imaging using X-ray nonlinear processes, introducing an analysis method to isolate the nonlinear component from the overall diffraction pattern by leveraging the property of mutual incoherence between different wavelengths. For examples such as sum-frequency generation in ferroelectrics, this method reveals both domain structure and orientation through the retrieved amplitude and phase of the nonlinear signal. We discuss the feasibility of the proposed method in the presence of experimental noise, most relevantly shot noise. This analysis method is applicable in both static and dynamic imaging, offering a pathway beyond traditional spectroscopy toward XUV/X-ray coherent imaging of spatio-temporal dynamics in quantum materials and biological systems.

Abstract: Ultrashort-pulse propagation in graded-index multimode fibers is a highly nonlinear phenomenon driven by several physical processes. Although conventional numerical solvers can reproduce this behavior with high fidelity, their computational cost limits real-time prediction, rapid parameter exploration, experimental feedback, and especially inverse retrieval of input fields from measured outputs. In this work, we introduce an operator learning framework that learns both the forward and inverse propagation operators within a single unified architecture. By combining spectral filters for spatio-temporal representations with Fourier-embedded conditioning on physical parameters, the model functions as a fast surrogate capable of accurately predicting complex field evolution on previously unseen cases. To our knowledge, this represents one of the first demonstrations of a bidirectional operator-learning framework applied to ultrashort-pulse multimode fiber propagation. The resulting architecture enables orders-of-magnitude speedup over numerical solvers, paving the way for real-time beam diagnostics, data-driven design of complex input fields, and closed-loop spatio-temporal control. Moreover, the same framework can potentially be applied to a wide variety of wave systems exhibiting analogous nonlinear and dispersive effects in optics and beyond.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can effectively reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral data while maintaining strong predictive performance for estimating soil moisture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by the high dimensionality and feature correlations in hyperspectral data, especially when limited ground-truth datasets are available.

Method: The method involves applying PCA as a dimensionality reduction technique to a hyperspectral dataset with 150 spectral bands. The optimal number of principal components (two) was determined based on the variance retained (>99%), covariance matrix analysis, eigenvalue distribution, and scree plot. The PCA-transformed data was then used to train a Random Forest regression model to estimate soil moisture.

Result: The result is that PCA-based feature reduction improves computational efficiency and model performance. The Random Forest model achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) of 94.7%.

Conclusion: The study concludes that PCA is a viable and effective method for dimensionality reduction in hyperspectral machine learning workflows, balancing computational efficiency with predictive capability.

Abstract: Hyperspectral optical imaging provides rich spectral information for estimating continuous environmental and material parameters; however, its high dimensionality and strong feature correlation pose significant challenges for machine learning models, especially when ground-truth datasets are limited. In this study, we investigate a hyperspectral dataset composed of 150 spectral bands with soil moisture as the target variable. To address the curse of dimensionality, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed as a baseline dimensionality reduction technique. The optimal number of principal components was determined to be two, retaining more than 99% of the total variance. This selection was supported by the analysis of the covariance matrix, eigenvalue distribution, and the scree plot. Projecting the data onto the first two principal components enabled improved visualization and interpretability compared to the original high-dimensional feature space. The reduced representation also revealed a clearer separation of target values, effectively decreasing data complexity. To evaluate the impact of dimensionality reduction on predictive performance, a Random Forest regression model was trained to estimate soil moisture from the PCA-transformed data. The model achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) of 94.7 %, demonstrating that PCA-based feature reduction can enhance computational efficiency while preserving strong predictive capability in hyperspectral machine learning workflows.

Abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in terahertz (THz) metamaterials relies on the coherent coupling between a radiative (bright) mode and a subradiant (dark) mode. Understanding the dynamic interplay between the bright and dark modes holds the key to manipulate the mutual interference and hence the transparency. Here, we use nonlinear 2D-THz spectroscopy to scrutinize the dynamics through nonlinearities of the EIT-like phenomenon in a metamaterial platform that comprises of two coupled resonators. From the temporal profiles of the nonlinear pump-probe and photon-echo signals, we found that the bright mode relaxation time is almost twice the time for the coherent exchange of energy between the two coupled resonators. The multi-peak nature of photon-echo signal and the corresponding temporal signatures further provides a direct visualization of the interference between the dressed states that drives the transparency window in our THz metamaterial. A time-resolved density matrix model accurately describes the observed features, including the cross-peak behavior and the temporal dynamics, establishing the coherent mode coupling as the origin of the transparency window.

Abstract: Photonics can offer a hardware-native route for machine learning (ML). However, efficient deployment of photonics-enhanced ML requires hybrid workflows that integrate optical processing with conventional CPU/GPU based neural network architectures. Here, we propose such a workflow that combines photonic positional embeddings (PEs) with advanced graph ML models. We introduce a photonics-based method that augments graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with PEs derived from light propagation on synthetic frequency lattices whose couplings match the input graph. We simulate propagation and readout to obtain internode intensity correlation matrices, which are used as PEs in GCNs to provide global structural information. Evaluated on Long Range Graph Benchmark molecular datasets, the method outperforms baseline GCNs with Laplacian based PEs, achieving $6.3\%$ lower mean absolute error for regression and $2.3\%$ higher average precision for classification tasks using a two-layer GCN as a baseline. When implemented in high repetition rate photonic hardware, correlation measurements can enable fast feature generation by bypassing digital simulation of PEs. Our results show that photonic PEs improve GCN performance and support optical acceleration of graph ML.

Abstract: This study presents a self-consistent, quantum-informed model for the decay dynamics of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in spherical metal nanoparticles (NPs), described as plasmonic quasi-particles (PQPs). By bridging classical electrodynamics description for quasi-normal modes (retardation effects included) with a quantum emitter perspective, this framework provides an analytically tractable description of the damping of the dissipative confined plasmonic systems. In addition to its significance for emission control, the model emphasizes the bosonic characteristics of plasmonic quasi-particles, which are coherent many-electron excitations of the states of quasi-normal modes. Unlike conventional cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED), where the emitter and cavity exist as separate systems, a plasmonic quasi-particle functions as a quantum emitter embedded within a self-created resonant near-field nano-cavity of confined radial fields, sharing the spectral characteristics of the surface transverse-magnetic (TM) modes, which include nonradiative damping effects resulting from, e.g., ohmic losses in a metal. This work extends Fermi's Golden Rule to include the coupling between the emission process and the self-generated cavity impact. The derived self-consistent formulation offers analytical expressions for the total damping rates, which demonstrate a size-dependent suppression displayed in higher multipolarity modes attributed to the impact of the self-quenching effect resulting from the coaction of radiative and non-radiative channels.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding dynamic neuronal activity is crucial for advancing neuroscience, but traditional techniques like calcium imaging have limitations in temporal resolution and direct measurements.

Method: This review discusses techniques such as random-access scanning, spatiotemporal multiplexing, and computational optical imaging to overcome the challenges of high-speed voltage imaging.

Result: These methods have achieved kilohertz-level imaging, significantly enhancing the speed and resolution of voltage-based optical imaging.

Conclusion: The development of high-speed optical microscopy for voltage imaging holds transformative potential for faster and more comprehensive analysis of neuronal activity.

Abstract: High-speed optical imaging of dynamic neuronal activity is essential yet challenging in neuroscience. While calcium imaging has been firmly established as a workhorse technique for monitoring neuronal activity, its limited temporal resolution and indirect measurement restrict its ability to capture rapid inhibitory and excitatory events and subthreshold voltage oscillations. In contrast, voltage imaging directly measures membrane potential fluctuations, providing a comprehensive and precise representation of neuronal circuit dynamics. Recent advancements in voltage-sensitive dyes and, particularly, genetically encoded voltage indicators have significantly enhanced the feasibility of voltage imaging, prompting the development of advanced fluorescence microscopy methods optimized for high-speed acquisition. However, achieving millisecond-scale temporal resolution remains challenging due to inherent trade-offs among imaging speed, spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio. Conventional raster-scanning approaches, including confocal microscopy, are fundamentally limited by their slow frame rates, precluding the capture of rapid neuronal events from multiple neurons simultaneously. Alternative techniques such as random-access scanning, spatiotemporal multiplexing, and computational optical imaging have successfully addressed these constraints, enabling kilohertz-level imaging of neuronal activity in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional contexts. This review summarizes recent progress in high-speed optical microscopy for voltage imaging and discusses its transformative potential for neuroscience research.

Abstract: Metasurfaces, typically realized as arrays of nanopillars, transform electromagnetic (EM) fields depending on their geometry and spatial arrangement. For solving the inverse problem of designing new metasurfaces that transform EM fields in a desirable manner, it is often necessary to explore large design spaces through full-wave simulations that can be computationally demanding. In this work, we demonstrate that neural operators, which are artificial neural network architectures designed to learn operators between function spaces, can effectively approximate the differential operators underlying Maxwell's equations, enabling their use as fast and accurate 3D surrogate models that can predict 3D EM fields transformed by metasurfaces. To calibrate neural operators, we generate synthetic training data consisting of 3D metasurface geometries together with their associated 3D EM fields obtained by numerically solving Maxwell's equations. Using the generated synthetic data, we train physics-informed neural operators to minimize physical inconsistencies of predicted EM fields by incorporating residuals that capture deviations from Maxwell's equations. We observe that a training dataset consisting of fewer than 5000 examples already suffices to achieve reasonable results. In particular, our experiments show that the resulting 3D surrogate model achieves high predictive performance across a wide range of metasurface geometries, including types of structures not encountered during training. Notably, it predicts diffraction efficiencies with relative errors of 3.9 % and provides a 67-fold speedup compared to conventional 3D simulations. Overall, once trained, our 3D surrogate model can rapidly predict EM fields for previously unseen metasurface geometries, which can facilitate efficient gradient-based design of nanostructured materials for EM wave control.

### [147] [Learning the climate of dynamical systems with state-space systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15530)
*Louw James Murray,Ortega Juan-Pablo*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: State-space systems can learn the long-term behavior of a time series with high accuracy under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the long-term behavior of dynamic systems is crucial for accurate forecasting.

Method: The study rigorously proves that if the system meets structural stability and certain mixing properties, state-space systems can accurately forecast long-term behavior.

Result: Under specified conditions, state-space systems can achieve arbitrarily high accuracy in learning the system's statistical behavior over time.

Conclusion: This provides a theoretical foundation for the feasibility of using state-space systems for long-term forecasting of dynamic processes.

Abstract: State-space systems encompass a broad class of algorithms used for modeling and forecasting time series. For such systems to be effective, two objectives must be met: (i) accurate point forecasts of the time series must be produced, and (ii) the long-term statistical behaviour of the underlying data-generating process must be replicated. The latter objective, often referred to as learning the climate, is closely related to the task of producing accurate distribution forecasts. Empirical evidence shows that distribution forecasts are far more stable than point forecasts, which are sensitive to initial conditions. In this work, we rigorously study this phenomenon for state-space systems. The main result shows that, if the underlying data-generating process is structurally stable and possesses a mixing or an attracting measure, then a sufficiently regular initial probability distribution remains close to the true future distribution at arbitrarily long time horizons when forecasted by a $C^1-$close state-space proxy. Thus, under these conditions, learning the climate of a dynamic process with a universal family of state-space systems is feasible with arbitrarily high accuracy.

Abstract: We consider complex rational vector fields in dimension $n>2$ (equivalently, differential forms of degree $n-1$ in $n$ variables) which admit a Liouvillian first integral. Extending a classical result by Singer for $n=2$, our main result states that there exists a first integral which is obtained by two successive integrations from one-forms with coefficients in a finite algebraic extension of the rational function field. The proof uses Puiseux series in a novel way to simplify computations. We also apply this method to give elementary proofs of Singer's theorem for rational one-forms, and of the Prelle-Singer theorem on elementary integrability of rational vector fields.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce a BiHom-type skew-symmetric bracket on $\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ built from two commuting inner automorphisms $α=Ad_ψ$ and $β=Ad_φ$ with $ψ,φ\in \mathfrak{gl}(V)$ and integers $i,j$. We prove that $(\mathfrak{gl}(V),[\cdot,\cdot]^{(i,j)}_{(ψ,φ)},α,β)$ is a BiHom--Lie algebra, and we study the Lax equation obtained by replacing the commutator in the finite nonperiodic Toda lattice by this bracket. For the symmetric choice $φ=ψ$ with $(i,j)=(0,0)$, the deformed flow is equivariant under conjugation and becomes gauge-equivalent, via $\widetilde L=ψ^{-1}Lψ$, to a Toda-type Lax equation with a conjugated triangular projection. In particular, scalar deformations amount to a constant rescaling of time. On embedded $2\times2$ blocks, we derive explicit trigonometric and hyperbolic formulas that make symmetry constraints (e.g. tracelessness) transparent. In the asymmetric hyperbolic case, we exhibit a trace obstruction showing that the right-hand side is generically not a commutator, which amounts to symmetry breaking of the isospectral property. We further extend the construction to the weakly coupled Toda lattice with an indefinite metric and provide explicit $2\times2$ solutions via an inverse-scattering calculation, clarifying and correcting certain formulas in the literature. The classical Toda dynamics are recovered at special parameter values.
