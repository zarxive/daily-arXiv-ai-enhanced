One of the key steps for proving classical\nhardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one\ncan ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of\nHaar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove\nthe hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed\nstates, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen\net al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states\nthat a $o(\\sqrt{M})\\times o(\\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\\times M$ circular\northogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex\nGaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\\to\\infty$. This is the first\nrigorous proof of the hiding property for GBS in the experimentally relevant\nregime, and puts the argument for hardness of classically simulating GBS with a\nmaximal number of squeezed states on a comparable level to that of the\nconventional boson sampling of [Aaronson and Arkhipov, Theory Comput. 9, 143\n(2013)].", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9ad8\u65afboson\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u7684\u63a9\u76d6\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5927\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6001\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u9ad8\u65afboson\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u70b9\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u9ad8\u65afboson\u91c7\u6837\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u9700\u8981\u88ab\u4e25\u683c\u8bc1\u660e\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u660e\u63a9\u76d6\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u6982\u7387\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u6784\u9020\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u5143\u7d20\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u7387\u6781\u9650\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f53M\u8d8b\u5411\u65e0\u7a77\u5927\u65f6\uff0cm\u00d7m\u7684\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\uff08m\u662fM\u7684\u4f4e\u9636\u51fd\u6570\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u9ad8\u65af\u77e9\u9635\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7528\u6700\u5927\u6570\u91cf\u538b\u7f29\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587etically\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9ad8\u65afboson\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5927\u6570\u91cf\u538b\u7f29\u6001\u65f6\u7684\u63a9\u76d6\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u7565\u5fae\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u51fa\u5927\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u4e0e\u5c0f\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Applying the density\nmatrix approach, we consider transitions between the coherent, partially\nincoherent, and fully incoherent states of the Bose gas. We show how, due to\nthe presence of weak interactions, collisional decoherence causes the Josephson\noscillations to decay with time.

Such confinement governs\nphenomena including charge localization, transport anisotropy, band structure\nmodulation, and light matter interaction strength. However, realizing clean and\nwell defined nanostructures remains technically challenging, as fabrication\ntechniques such as focused ion beam (FIB) milling and electron beam lithography\nfrequently introduce structural disorder, residual contamination, or\ndetrimental interactions with the underlying substrate. Here, we develop a\nfemtosecond laser direct writing technique to create sub 10 nm wide dielectric\nnanochannels with smooth, continuous boundaries on hexagonal boron nitride\n(hBN) substrates, without using resists or chemical etchants. As a\ndemonstration, these nanochannels are employed to define programmable\ndielectric landscapes in monolayer molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), forming\nexcitonic energy funnels that suppress scattering and significantly extend the\nexciton transport distance. Transport is reshaped from isotropic diffusion with\nsubmicron range to directional super diffusion exhibiting quasi ballistic\ntransport exceeding 5 um, more than 20 times longer than in unpatterned\nsystems. The smooth dielectric boundaries further enable precise control over\nexciton trajectories, allowing for programmable transport pathways.

These\nresults establish the quantum observability of gravitational gauge structures\nand provide theoretical support for experimental verification via atom\ninterferometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u7684Aharonov-Bohm\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u66f2\u7387\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u79fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u77e2\u91cf\u4e1b\u548c\u83b1\u7ef4-\u5951\u7ef4\u5854\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u4f4d\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u5168\u5e73\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u725b\u987f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0b\u5229\u7528\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u573a\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4f4d\u79fb\u4e0e\u7535\u78c1\u5b66\u76f8\u4f4d\u79fb\u6570\u5b66\u7b49\u540c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7528\u539f\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u5b9e\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5f15\u529b\u89c2\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u4e2d\u7ea61925\u5e74\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Aharonov-Bohm\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u56db\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u77e2\u91cf\u4e1b\u548cSpacetime manifolds equipped with Levi-Civita connections\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5e73\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5f97\u5230\u76f8\u4f4d\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u725b\u987f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u573a\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4f4d\u79fb\u4e0e\u7535\u78c1\u5b66\u76f8\u4f4d\u79fb\u6570\u5b66\u7b49\u540c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7528\u539f\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u5b9e\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5f15\u529b\u89c2\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u529bAharonov-Bohm\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u56db\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this method, the MC samplings for the initial distribution\nand stochastic noises incorporate quantum fluctuations, and thus, we can go\nbeyond the mean-field approximation. However, description using SDEs is\npossible only when the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation has a\npositive-semidefinite diffusion matrix. In this work, we analytically derive\nthe SDEs for arbitrary Hamiltonian and jump operators based on the\npath-integral formula, independently of the derivation of the Fokker-Planck\nequation (FPE). In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral\nrepresentation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability,\nwhich systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by\nchanging the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that\nwe employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral,\nand its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition\nof the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness\ncondition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE. In the benchmark calculations, we\nconfirm that the MC simulations of the obtained SDEs well reproduce the exact\ndynamics of physical quantities and non-equal time correlation functions of\nnumerically solvable models, including the Bose-Hubbard model.

Three distinct yet complementary\ntopological invariants have been employed to characterize black hole phases,\nspinodal curves, and critical points in black hole thermodynamics. In this\nwork, we develop a unified framework that integrates these three topological\napproaches and introduce the concept of extended thermodynamical topology,\nproviding a clear physical interpretation. As a first step, we apply this\nframework to black holes in Einstein gravity, systematically elucidating their\nphase structure in terms of topological invariants.

When the hopping integral and the on-site\npotential of the fermions depend on the direction of the link spins, the\nlow-energy effective theory predicts that the link spins behave as a dynamical\naxion field in 1+1 dimensions. The axion field $\\theta$ is coupled to the\nelectric field $E$ as $\\theta E$, through which the link spins rotate in\nresponse to the applied electric field or the chemical potential gradient for\ncharge-neutral fermions. This is the inverse phenomenon of Thouless pumping in\nthe Rice-Mele model. After analyzing the dynamics by approximating the link\nspins with the classical ones and utilizing the axion Lagrangian, we show the\nfull-quantum dynamics using the tensor network method.

Main text: 5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.\n  Supplemental material: 10.5 pages", "summary": "Over the years, Berry curvature, which is associated with the imaginary part\nof the quantum geometric tensor, has profoundly impacted many branches of\nphysics. Recently, quantum metric, the real part of the quantum geometric\ntensor, has been recognized as indispensable in comprehensively characterizing\nthe intrinsic properties of condensed matter systems. The intrinsic\nsecond-order nonlinear conductivity induced by the quantum metric has attracted\nsignificant recent interest. However, its expression varies across the\nliterature. Here, we reconcile this discrepancy by systematically examining the\nnonlinear conductivity using the standard perturbation theory, the wave packet\ndynamics, and the Luttinger-Kohn approach. Moreover, inspired by the Dirac\nmodel, we propose a toy model that suppresses the Berry-curvature-induced\nnonlinear transport, making it suitable for studying the quantum-metric-induced\nnonlinear conductivity. Our theory can be further extended to include disorder\neffects and higher-order quantum geometric contributions, paving the way for a\nmore comprehensive and systematic understanding of nonlinear transport.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86berry\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u5ea6\u91cf\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a toy \u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6291\u5236berry\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u6df7\u4e71\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7528 toy \u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u6270urbation \u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6ce2\u5305\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548cLuttinger-Kohn\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eDirac\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 toy \u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6291\u5236berry\u66f2\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u7684 toy \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u5c40\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u5e94\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6563\u5c04\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u91cf\u5b50\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002"}}

In many theoretical studies for FE in quantum\nsystems, researchers have used the Floquet theory for closed (isolated) quantum\nsystems, that is based on the Schr\\\"odinger equation. However, if we consider\nthe FE in materials driven by an oscillating field like a laser, a weak but\nfinite interaction between a target system and an environment (bath) is\ninevitable. In this article, we describe these periodically driven dissipative\nsystems by means of the quantum master (GKSL) equation. In particular, we show\nthat a nonequilibrium steady state appears after a long driving due to the\nbalance between the energy injection by the driving field and the release to\nthe bath. In addition to quantum systems, if we try to simply apply Floquet\ntheory to periodically driven classical systems, it failed because the equation\nof motion (EOM) is generally nonlinear, and the Floquet theorem can be applied\nonly to linear differential equations. Instead, by considering the distribution\nfunction of the classical variables (i.e., Fokker-Planck equation), one can\narrive at the effective EOM for the driven systems. We illustrate the essence\nof the Floquet theory for classical systems.

Based on\nthe findings of [1], which demonstrated the feasibility of detecting GIE in\noptomechanical systems under quantum control, we further demonstrate that\nsqueezed input light can reduce the optical noise in the mechanical conditional\nstate and enhance GIE. Furthermore, we estimate the systematic and statistical\nerrors in the measurement of GIE using the Fourier transformation over a finite\nmeasurement time. Based on the error estimations using the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) in GIE detection, we find that a total measurement time of 10^6 s\nis required to achieve SNR=1 when using squeezed input light, whereas 10^{6.8}\ns is needed without squeezed input light.

An analytical formulation based on the Rayleigh-Ritz\nprinciple is developed to relate radial mass loading to modal frequency shifts.\nFinite element simulations are performed in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the\nshifts in the resonance frequency of vibrational modes under varying\ngeometrical configurations of annular rings. By processing these frequency\nshifts through a transformation matrix, we estimate the concomitant mass\ndistributions of annular rings.

This framework enabled a partition function for the\nAbelian-projected ensemble of vortex worldsurfaces, previously formulated as a\nwavefunctional peaked at center-vortex loops. In particular, we showed how an\nAbelian ensemble can account for $N$-ality while supporting a ``dual\nsuperconductor'' model for confinement.

We consider a situation in which the maximum flow\ntime can be set to a small value, as occurs when WV-HMC is applied to the doped\nHubbard model using a nonphysical redundant parameter. An optimal choice of\nthis parameter significantly reduces the sign problem on the original\nintegration surface and allows the maximum flow time to remain small, a feature\nthat facilitates increasing the system size while keeping the computation time\nmodest. However, as the worldvolume becomes a thin layer, it becomes\nincreasingly difficult to explore it efficiently, leading to potential\nergodicity issues. To overcome this limitation, we propose embedding the\nGeneralized-thimble HMC (GT-HMC) into the WV-HMC framework. GT-HMC performs HMC\nupdates on a deformed surface at a fixed flow time. Although it suffers from\nergodicity issues due to infinitely high potential barriers at the zeros of the\nBoltzmann weight, it enables more efficient exploration within the allowed\nregion.

In this work, we investigate the transport\nproperties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm,\nusing first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green\nfunction formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an\neffective gate model. Our simulations reveal a classical-to-quantum crossover\nin electron transport during transistor downscaling, governed by two critical\ntemperatures: Tc, which marks the crossover from thermionic emission to quantum\ntunneling, and Tt, beyond which thermionic emission dominates and the\nsubthreshold swing approaches its classical limit. The shortest 3 nm junction\nexhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold\nswing superior to the Boltzmann tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence\nof the transmission coefficient. This quantum-tunneling-enhanced switching\nbehavior demonstrates the potential of ultra-scaled 2D FETs to surpass\nclassical efficiency constraints, offering a promising route toward\nenergy-efficient, quantum-enabled computing technologies.

In this work we\naddress this issue and carefully map out the emerging properties of multifold\nexceptional structures in three and four dimensions under the influence of one\nor multiple generalized similarities, revealing diverse combinations of EP$m$s\nin direct connection to EP$n$s. We find that simply counting the number of\nconstraints defining the EP$n$s is not sufficient in the presence of\nsimilarities; the constraints can also be satisfied by the EP$m$-manifolds\nobeying certain spectral symmetries in the complex eigenvalue plane, reducing\ntheir dimension beyond what is expected from counting the number of\nconstraints. Furthermore, the induced spectral symmetries not always allow for\nany EP$m$-manifold to emerge in $n$-band systems, making the plethora of\nexceptional structures deviate further from naive expectations. We illustrate\nour findings in simple periodic toy models.

They tested this with toy models and suggest broad applications in physics and experiments.", "motivation": "Generalized exceptional points ( EPns ) in multiband systems and their spectral dependencies under similarity transformations are crucial for understanding complex quantum and classical systems. The study aims to unravel how these structures emerge and their topological properties, which could have applications in designing future devices and systems. Understanding the behavior of EPs beyond simple pairwise cases adds complexity and depth to the field.

The analytical approach involved examining the conditions under which generalized similarities lead to certain spectral symmetries in the complex plane.

Simulations were likely conducted to verify the theoretical predictions and visualize the emergence of these structures in specific scenarios.", "result": "The number of constraints for EPns isn't sufficient on their own because generalized symmetries in the eigenvalue plane can make these points align with lower-dimensional manifold structures. This led to the discovery that certain spectral symmetries can allow for higher connectivity of EPs in multiband systems, forming specific types of EP clusters. Additionally, the emergence of EPs is influenced by how thoseEPms are embedded into the n-band system. The findings revealed that while similarity transformations impose constraints, they also lead to deviations from naive expectations, providing a more nuanced understanding which leads to richer and more complex structures than previously thought. ", "conclusion": "The paper explains how non-Hermitian exceptional points in multiband systems form intricate networks due to generalized similarity transformations and specific spectral symmetries. These networks aren't isolated but are interconnected, with centers at EPns. Topological properties emerge from these connections, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding the structure and behavior of EPs in larger systems. These findings augment existing knowledge in quantum mechanics and open up new possibilities for applications in designs where EPs are advantageous, such as in optics, topological circuits, and open quantum systems. The results should help in the design of future systems that leverage these unique properties of EPs in multiband scenarios."}}

These\nphases belong to the broader class of average crystalline symmetry-protected\ntopological (ACSPT) states and include numerous examples of intrinsic ACSPTs --\ntopological phases that arise only in the presence of disorder or decoherence.\nUnlike conventional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, which require\nexact symmetry protection, average SPT (ASPT) phases remain robust as long as\nthe symmetry is restored on average across disorder realizations or mixed-state\nensembles. To classify these phases, we extend the real-space block state\nconstruction framework to account for average crystalline symmetries. In this\ngeneralized setting, lower-dimensional cells are decorated with ASPT phases,\nand the obstruction-free conditions are reformulated to incorporate the\nconstraints imposed by average symmetry at block intersections.

Reducing the system symmetry greatly affects three-wave\nscattering, which, in this case, goes beyond the simple momentum conservation\nlaw. In this study, we examine three-magnon scattering at the edge of a thin\nferromagnetic film, when a bulk spin wave interacts with an edge-localized\npropagating spin-wave upon the reflection. This creates new bulk spin waves at\nmixed frequencies by means of three-magnon confluence or stimulated splitting\nprocesses. Using our developed analytical theory, which has been confirmed by\nfull micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that the amplitude of the wave\ngenerated in the stimulated splitting process is several times larger than that\ngenerated in the confluence process, primarily due to the lower group velocity.\nFurthermore, intensity of inelastically scattered waves exhibit a pronounced\ndependence on the incidence angle and frequency of the edge spin wave that goes\nbeyond existing qualitative models. We show that the observed behaviors can\nonly be explained by taking into account, that the scattered waves are created\nby several elementary three-magnon processes involving the incident and\nreflected waves.

The classical component enumerates all simplices,\nand this combinatorial structure is subsequently processed by a quantum\nalgorithm to estimate the Betti numbers. We analyze the performance of our\napproach and identify regimes where it potentially achieves polynomial to\nexponential speedups over existing quantum methods, at the trade-off of using\nmore ancilla qubits. We further demonstrate the utility of normalized Betti\nnumbers in concrete applications, highlighting the broader potential of hybrid\nquantum algorithms in topological data analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1d\u8482\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u679a\u4e3e\u6240\u6709\u5355\u7b80\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u4f30\u7b97\u8d1d\u8482\u6570\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u81f3\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u727a\u7272\u4e00\u4e9b ancilla qubits\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8d1d\u8482\u6570\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u5230\u6765\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u63d0\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86 powerful \u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u800c\u8d1d\u8482\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f captures \u6570\u636e\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982 simulating \u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6216\u52a0\u901f\u7279\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8d1d\u8482\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7ecf\u5178-\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6765\u679a\u4e3e\u6240\u6709\u5355\u7b80\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u8482\u6570\u7684\u4f30\u7b97\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u679a\u4e3e\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d1d\u8482\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u81f3\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u591a\u7684ancilla qubits\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8d1d\u8482\u6570\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u88ab\u51f8\u663e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d1dDepth numbers\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4e8eancilla qubits\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Above-threshold ionization (ATI) is a strong-field-driven process where\nelectrons absorb more photons than required for ionization. While ATI dynamics\nand outputs are well-understood when driven by classical, perfectly coherent\nlight, the recent development of non-classical light sources for strong-field\nphenomena has spurred interest in their effect on the involved electron\ndynamics. In this work, we present a microscopic quantum optical theory\ndescribing ATI under the influence of strong squeezed light. We observe that\nsqueezed light significantly enhances the coupling between light and matter,\nmaking their mutual backaction more important than under classical driving.\nThis backaction profoundly impacts the electronic ionization times, as well as\nthe non-classical properties of the joint electron-light state. This results in\npronounced entanglement features, both immediately after ionization, and at\nlater times. These entanglement features are reflected in the properties of the\nquantum optical state of the driving field revealing notable non-Gaussian\nfeatures that depend on both, the amount of squeezing, and the number of\nionization events occurring during the interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d85\u9608\u503c\u7535\u79bb\uff08ATI\uff09\u5728\u5f3a press\u00e9outine \u566c\u5149\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50 effects\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5bbd\u57df\u5149\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5149\u548c\u7269\u8d28\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u5b50\u7535\u79bb\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6001\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5f3a\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8d85\u9608\u503c\u7535\u79bb\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5149\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u590d\u6742\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u548c\u5206\u5b50 Excitation\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5fae\u89c2\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u9608\u7535\u79bb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5bbd\u57df\u5149\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u7535\u79bb\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5bbd\u57df\u5149\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 coupling\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7535\u5b50\u7535\u79bb\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u6001\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d85\u9608\u503c\u7535\u79bb\u5728\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5448\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5bbd\u57df\u5149\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u548c\u63ed\u793a\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To begin with, we probe the undriven static Hamiltonian in\nthe dressed-state basis to identify and define distinct coupling regimes and\ncritical points associated with both cavity modes. Furthermore, to investigate\nthe dynamical QPTs in this system, we incorporate a periodic modulation across\ntwo atomic states (denoted by $|3\\rangle_{at}$ and $|2\\rangle_{at}$) out of the\nthree available energy levels. By performing necessary transformations and\napproximations, we reduce the overall Hamiltonian, which contains static and\ndynamic modulation terms, into an effective 3L-JC Hamiltonian whose system\nparameters are dependent on the driving parameters.

For the small-spin case, the precession angle of the\nspin components in the equatorial plane along circular orbits is found, and\nperpendicular component is shown to be a constant of motion. For the\nspin-orbital plane parallel case, it is shown that in general the orbital and\nspin motions generally do not affect each other, and the spin precession angle\nis calculated using the post-Newtonian method to an arbitrarily high order of\nthe orbital semi-latus rectum p. The precession angles in both cases are\nanalyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively in the Kerr-Newman spacetime to\nelucidate their features. For large orbital radii, it is shown that the leading\norder of the precession angle series is generally proportional to the spacetime\nmass while the Lense-Thirring effect always appears from the subleading order.\nThese precession results are then applied to various astronomical systems to\ndetermine their spin precession rates.

Our interest mainly stems from two considerations: (i) the photon ring\nstructure in black hole images produces strong and universal interferometric\nsignatures on long baselines, enabling precision measurements of black hole\nparameters and testing gravitational theory; (ii) the hSBH describes the\ndeformation of standard Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) induced by additional\nsources, and they can feature double photon spheres within certain parameter\nregimes. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that for a hSBH\nwith a single photon sphere, the complex visibility amplitude of the image\nexhibits damped oscillations. A similar behavior appears in the double photon\nsphere case when the inner photon sphere has lower effective potential than the\nouter one, as the photons near the inner photon sphere remain trapped by\ngravity. However, when the inner potential is higher, a beat pattern rises. Our\nfindings reveal that the complex visibility amplitude can encode the signature\nof the photon sphere structure of the central black hole.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hairy Schwarzschild black holes show specific interferometric signals in their photon sphere configurations, which can encode black hole parameters and test gravitational theory.", "motivation": "The paper's motivation is to leverage the strong interferometric signatures produced by photon rings to enhance the precision of black hole parameter measurements and to test gravitational theory.", "method": "The study uses a combination of analytical and numerical methods to investigate the visibility patterns of photon spheres in single and double photon sphere scenarios.", "result": "Single photon spheres exhibit damped oscillations, while double photon spheres show varying behaviors depending on the relative photon sphere potentials.

By incorporating a non-zero redshift function and a\ndirect coupling between the Ricci scalar and the Yang-Mills field strength\ntensor, the work examines the influence of the non-minimal coupling constant\n$\\xi$ and the magnetic charge $Q$ on the wormhole geometry. The analysis\ndemonstrates that suitable choices of these parameters can satisfy the\nflare-out and throat conditions, allowing for physically viable traversable\nwormholes without requiring exotic matter. The study further evaluates the\nArnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass, showing that quantum corrections, which are\nmodeled through Euler-Heisenberg-type contributions, reduce the total\ngravitational mass and may stabilize the structure. The energy conditions are\nanalyzed, revealing localized violations of the null and weak energy conditions\nat the wormhole throat, while the strong energy condition remains satisfied.\nAdditionally, light deflection in the presence of the wormhole is calculated,\nindicating positive deflection angles and confirming the overall attractive\nnature of the gravitational field. These findings highlight the role of\nnon-minimal gauge-gravity couplings in constructing observationally\ndistinguishable wormhole configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9759\u6001\u3001\u7403\u9762\u5bf9\u79f0\u53ef\u7a7f\u884c\u866b\u6d1e\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u7684\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u6768\u7c73\u65af\uff08EYM\uff09\u5f15\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u573a\u7eaf\u78c1\uff0c\u5e76\u9075\u5faaSU(2)\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u96f6\u7ea2\u79fb\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u7684Ricci\u6807\u91cf\u4e0e\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u573a\u5f3a\u5f20\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u5e38\u6570\u03be\u548c\u78c1\u8377Q\u5bf9\u866b\u6d1e\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u9009\u62e9\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3 flare-out \u548c throat \u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5141\u8bb8\u53ef\u7a7f\u884c\u866b\u6d1e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u7269\u6027\u7269\u8d28\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86ADM\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\uff08Euler-Heisenberg \u7c7b\u578b\u8d21\u732e\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u603b\u5f15\u529b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u663e\u793a\u5728\u866b\u6d1e throat \u5904\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u7684 null \u548c\u5f31\u80fd\u6761\u4ef6\u8fdd\u80cc\uff0c\u800c strong \u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5149\u7684\u504f\u8f6c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u6b63\u7684\u504f\u8f6c\u89d2\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5f15\u529b\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u7684\u89c4\u8303-\u5f15\u529b\u8026\u5408\u5728\u6784\u9020\u53ef\u533a\u522b\u7684\u866b\u6d1e\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u866b\u6d1e\u89e3\u5728\u975e\u6781\u5c0fEYM\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5f15\u529b couple with Yang-Mills field \u7684\u7269\u7406\u6548\u5e94\u4ee5\u53ca\u866b\u6d1e\u7684\u6784\u9020\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u7684EYM\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7ea2\u79fb\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u5e38\u6570\u03be\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3 flare-out \u548c throat \u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86ADM\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5149\u504f\u8f6c\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u4e0b\u866b\u6d1e\u662f\u53ef\u7a7f\u884c\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u964d\u4f4eADM\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5149\u504f\u8f6c\u4e3a\u6b63\uff0c\u5f15\u529b\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u6781\u5c0fEYM\u5f15\u529b\u5141\u8bb8\u6784\u9020\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u884c\u866b\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u6765\u6784\u9020\u6709\u7269\u6027\u533a\u522b\u7684\u866b\u6d1e\u914d\u7f6e\u3002"}}

This work proves that quantum LDPC codes such as\nBB codes can maintain their performance in a distributed setting while using\nsolely one simple connector: a cyclic shift. We propose two strategies to\nperform quantum error correction on a $2 \\times L$ module array: (i) The cyclic\nlayout which applies to any stabilizer codes, whereas previous results for\nqubit arrays are limited to CSS codes. (ii) The sparse cyclic layout, specific\nto bivariate bicycle (BB) codes. For the $[[144,12,12]]$ BB code, using the\nsparse cyclic layout we obtain a quantum memory with $12$ logical qubits\ndistributed over $12$ modules, containing $12$ physical qubits each. We propose\nphysical implementations of this architecture using flying qubits, that can be\nfaithfully transported, and include qubits encoded in ions, neutral atoms,\nelectrons or photons. We performed numerical simulations when modules are long\nion chains and when modules are single-qubit arrays of ions showing that the\ndistributed BB code achieves a logical error rate below $2 \\cdot 10^{-6}$ when\nthe physical error rate is $10^{-3}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6a21\u5757\u9635\u5217\u5206\u5e03\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u98de\u8d8a\u6027\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5faa\u73af\u79fb\u4f4d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7ea0\u9519\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u98de\u8d8a\u6027\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\uff08\u5982BB\u7801\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6a21\u5757\u9635\u5217\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u98de\u8d8a\u6027\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u5b8c\u6210\u5faa\u73af\u79fb\u4f4d\u3002\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8eBB\u7801\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u5faa\u73af\u5e03\u5c40\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u5faa\u73af\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u7684BB\u7801\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u957f\u79bb\u5b50\u94fe\u548c\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u957f\u79bb\u5b50\u94fe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u5faa\u73af\u5e03\u5c40\u7684BB\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8612\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u5206\u5e03\u572812\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u4e0a\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5305\u542b12\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6bcf\u6bd4\u7279\u9519\u8bef\u738710^-3\u65f6\uff0c\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc72\u00d710^-6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u79bb\u5b50\u3001\u4e2d\u6027\u539f\u5b50\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u5149\u5b50\u7b49\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u7b80\u4fbf\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u79fb\u4f4d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The standard operational formulation, widely used in\nquantum information, imposes a definite, acyclic causal order on agents'\noperations, contrasting with time-symmetric dynamics.

Scalable solid-state\nplatforms offer promising routes to this goal. However, environmental\ndisorders, including dephasing, spectral diffusion, and spin-bath interactions,\ninfluence the emitters' spectra and deteriorate the coherence. Using\nstatistical theory, we identify correlations in spectral diffusion from slowly\nvarying environmental coupling, revealing predictable dynamics extendable to\nother disorders. Importantly, this could enable the development of an\nanticipatory framework for forecasting and decoherence engineering in remote\nquantum emitters. To validate this framework, we demonstrate that a machine\nlearning model trained on limited data can accurately forecast unseen spectral\nbehavior. Realization of such a model on distinct quantum emitters could reduce\nthe spectral shift by factors $\\approx$ 2.1 to 15.8, depending on emitter\nstability, compared to no prediction. This work presents, for the first time,\nthe application of anticipatory systems and replica theory to quantum\ntechnology, along with the first experimental demonstration of internal\nprediction that generalizes across multiple quantum emitters.
