Popular\nchain-of-states methods require hundreds if not thousands of \\textit{ab initio}\ncalculations to generate initial guesses for local quasi-Newton optimizers,\nwith persistent risk of collapse to an alternative stationary point on the\npotential energy surface (PES). Here, we show that high-quality guess\nstructures for transition state optimization can be obtained by constructing\nthe geodesic path between reactant and product structures on the PES generated\nby machine learning potentials (MLPs). We present an algorithm for optimization\nof such geodesic paths, as well as the associated codebase. We demonstrate\neffectiveness of this approach using the recent eSEN-sm-cons MLP. On average,\nthe highest-energy point along these MLP geodesics requires 30\\% fewer\nquasi-Newton optimization steps to converge to the transition state compared to\nguesses from the fully \\textit{ab initio} frozen string method. Our approach\ntherefore completely eliminates the need for \\textit{ab initio} calculations\nfor generation of transition state guesses and considerably speeds up\nsubsequent structural optimization.

We compare the\ncase of memory and memoryless processes, which reflect different short-time\nbehaviors and, in some cases, can lead to different stationary distributions of\nthe average system state. Focusing on the use of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck coloured\nnoise driving the dynamics, in the same fashion as the white noise is the\nformal derivative of a Wiener process, we shed light on how different\ndissipative terms of a generic QME arise depending on the nature of the\nstochastic potential involved, and their effect on the short and long time\nevolution of the system. We rationalize the emergence of the different terms in\nterms of the time- and frequency-dependent coefficients Redfield QME. Within\nthis framework, we explicitly derive a closure model for the open terms in the\nQME derived from the SSE approach, and clarify how colored noise impacts the\ncoherence relaxation time scales", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u8272\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4e24\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u968f\u673aSchr\u00f6dinger\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8272\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5229\u7528Redfield\u91cf\u5b50\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c01\u95ed\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u9879\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8272\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u76f8\u5e72\u677e\u5f1b\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5e72\u6270\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5e26\u6709\u8272\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u968f\u673aSchr\u00f6dinger\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08SSE\uff09\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08QME\uff09\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u5e26\u6709\u8272\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4e24\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u91c7\u7528Redfield\u91cf\u5b50\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8272\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c01\u95ed\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u5f00\u653e\u9879\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8272\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u76f8\u5e72\u677e\u5f1b\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u8272\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4e24\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Redfield\u91cf\u5b50\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5c01\u95ed\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8272\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u76f8\u5e72\u677e\u5f1b\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u8272\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4e24\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acbQB\u6a21\u62df\u548cRedfield\u91cf\u5b50\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5c01\u95ed\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8272\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u76f8\u5e72\u677e\u5f1b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u989c\u8272\u566a\u58f0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Experimental advances in\nnanobeam, trampoline, phononic bandgap, and soft-clamping structures all rely\non conventional nanofabrication involving e-beam or photolithography, followed\nby various etching steps. These techniques are typically time-consuming,\nrelatively inflexible, and often result in spurious residual SiN overhang that\ncan degrade mechanical quality factors. In contrast, recent work has shown that\nsimple resonant structures, such as nanobeams, can be prototyped by direct\nlaser ablation of free-standing SiN membranes using a spatially distributed\nsequence of microholes that limits stress concentration. However, these early\ndemonstrations were restricted to basic shapes, created by manually combining\nablation routines for circles and straight lines. Here, we demonstrate the\nfabrication of arbitrarily complex geometries using an open-source software\ntoolset--released with this publication--that automatically generates\nlaser-ablated hole sequences directly from standard semiconductor layout files\n(i.e., GDSII). The software includes a layout alignment tool that compensates\nfor the membrane orientation and dimensional variations, limiting material\noverhang to ~2 um.

This\nbehavior depends only on the geometry and the long-ranged nature of the Coulomb\ninteraction, and is largely insensitive to layer details. At larger $q$, the\nresponse reflects the microscopic properties of individual layers. For the\nstrange metal, calculations based on IR data predict a highly damped plasmon\nwith weak dispersion and no distinct surface mode.

We demonstrate that topological chiral\nsuperconducting phases (including a spin-unpolarized state) can be\nenergetically favored over the spin-valley polarized Fermi liquid above the\ndensity of Wigner crystal phase. Our results show that the preference for\nchiral superconductivity is strongest when $c_2$ lies between zero and a\nnegative value, corresponding to a system on the verge of forming a hole pocket\naround $k=0$.

However, existing\nelectrical or photonic-assisted wireless communication solutions see\nsignificant challenges in meeting this demand due to the limited bandwidths of\nindividual devices and the intrinsically rigid nature of their system\narchitectures. Here, we demonstrate adaptive wireless communications over an\nunprecedented frequency range spanning over 100 GHz, driven by a universal\nthin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic wireless engine. Leveraging the\nstrong Pockels effect and excellent scalability of the TFLN platform, we\nachieve monolithic integration of essential functional elements, including\nbaseband modulation, broadband wireless-photonic conversion, and reconfigurable\ncarrier/local signal generation. Powered by broadband tunable optoelectronic\noscillators, our signal sources operate across a record-wide frequency range\nfrom 0.5 GHz to 115 GHz with high frequency stability and consistent coherence.\nBased on the broadband and reconfigurable integrated photonic solution, we\nrealize, for the first time, full-link wireless communication across 9\nconsecutive bands, achieving record lane speeds of up to 100 Gbps. The\nreal-time reconfigurability further enables adaptive frequency allocation, a\ncrucial capability to ensure enhanced reliability in complex spectrum\nenvironments.

The answer to this\nsimple question has important implications for the dynamic properties of the\ncrystal, such as the frequency of its cyclotron motion, and its phonon\nspectrum. In this work we introduce a precise definition of a sliding crystal\nand compute the corresponding current $\\mathbf{j}_c$ for topological electron\ncrystals in the presence of magnetic field. Our result is fully\nnon-perturbative, does not rely on Galilean invariance, and applies equally to\nWigner crystals and (anomalous) Hall crystals. In terms of the electron density\n$\\rho$ and magnetic flux density $\\phi$, we find that $\\mathbf{j}_c =\ne(\\rho-C\\phi)\\mathbf{v}$. Surprisingly, the current receives a contribution\nfrom the many-body Chern number $C$ of the crystal. When $\\rho = C\\phi$,\nsliding crystals therefore carry zero current. The crystalline current fixes\nthe Lorentz force felt by the sliding crystal and the dispersion of low-energy\nphonons of such crystals. This gives us a simple counting rule for the number\nof gapless phonons: if a sliding crystal carries nonzero current in a magnetic\nfield, there is a single gapless mode, while otherwise there are two gapless\nmodes. This result can also be understood from anomaly-matching of emanant\ndiscrete translation symmetries -- an idea that is also applicable to the\ndispersion of skyrmion crystals.

The geometrical sector becomes a one-dimensional mechanical\nsystem, with the Misner-Sharp mass and lapse as canonically conjugate\nvariables, and a vanishing Hamiltonian for pure gravity. Coupling classical or\nquantum matter fields, or introducing (quantum) corrections to general\nrelativity, then generate a non-vanishing effective Hamiltonian, leading to\nnon-trivial evolutions of the mass and lapse. We illustrate this mechanism\nthrough various examples of classical matter fields and identify Hamiltonians\ndescribing the effective dynamics of gravity coupled to perfect fluids with\nlinear barotropic equation of state. Finally, we derive effective Hamiltonians\nthat reproduce the gravitational semi-classical dynamics coupled to\nrenormalized quantum matter fields and discuss the conditions for which the\nsingularity at $r=0$ is resolved. In particular, we find a singularity-free\nblack-hole-like solution, stabilized by quantum matter, smoothly transitioning\nfrom a bulk with constant negative Ricci scalar to the standard outside\nSchwarzschild metric. This opens new possibilities for the modeling of both\nsemi-classical corrections and deep quantum effects on the interior structure\nof self-gravitating compact objects and black holes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u9759\u6001\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7814\u7a76 motivation \u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e0b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7d27\u81f4\u7269\u4f53\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165 Misner-Sharp \u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u91cf\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7684\u7269\u8d28\u573a\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6709\u6548\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u63cf\u8ff0\u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5947\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u89e3\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86singularity-free\u9ed1body\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 Quantum corrections\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5947\u70b9\u5f97\u5230\u5149\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7d27\u81f4\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f53\u5f15\u5165\u9002\u5f53\u7684 Quantum corrections \u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6784\u9020\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7d27\u81f4\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u5916\u5c42\u7684\u89e3\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e8e Schwarzschild metric\uff0c\u800c\u5185\u90e8\u5219\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e38\u6570\u8d1f Ricci \u6807\u91cf\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdThese\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5bfb\u627e\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5149\u6ed1\u5185\u90e8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5f0f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e0b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7269\u8d28\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a2\u7d22\u672a\u6765\u7684\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Specifically, it is known that at the foam\nlevel, topologically non-trivial solutions such as instantons appear. In the\nparticular case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain an effective\ndynamical dark energy term proportional to the instanton density, and the\nlatter can be easily calculated through standard techniques. Hence, we can\nimmediately extract the differential equation that determines the evolution of\nthe topologically induced effective dark energy density. Significantly, this\nTDE scenario allows for changing sign of dark energy during the cosmic\nevolution and also exhibits Dark Energy interaction with Dark Matter.

Beyond the standard Michelson configuration, a variety of\nsecond-generation TDI schemes have been proposed, each utilizing different\ncombinations of inter-spacecraft laser links. In this work, we conduct a\ncomparative study of several representative TDI configurations with varying\ntime spans and demonstrate that their (quasi-)orthogonal channels are highly\ncorrelated, indicating substantial redundancy among these schemes. In the\nlow-frequency regime, the performance of different TDI configurations are\nnearly identical. Their distinctions emerge primarily at high frequencies,\nwhere the GW wavelength becomes comparable to the arm length. In this regime,\nshorter TDI time spans with minimal null frequencies facilitate more accurate\nwaveform modeling and parameter recovery in frequency domain.

They evaluated the performance of these configurations across various frequencies, particularly focusing on high-frequency regimes where GW wavelengths become comparable to arm lengths. The analysis included both frequency domain assessments, such as noise suppression and null frequencies, and time domain evaluations, considering the impact on waveform modeling and parameter recovery.", "result": "Various TDI configurations for space-based GW missions were compared. In high-frequency regimes, shorter time span TDI schemes with fewer null frequencies performed better, achieved more accurate waveform modeling and parameter recovery. In contrast, longer time span configurations, like the Michelson interferometer, were more susceptible to frequency aliasing and waveform modulation effects, affecting inference accuracy. This difference is less pronounced in the time domain where all configurations perform similarly.", "conclusion": "The study concludes that the PD4L TDY scheme with a short time span is the optimal choice for future space-based gravitational wave missions. Its superior high-frequency performance ensures better noise suppression, accurate waveform modeling, and improved parameter recovery, making it more reliable than longer time span configurations especially in challenging high-frequency environments."}}

However, controlling their emission directionality has been\nhindered by the complexities of lasing mode engineering and fabrication. Here,\nwe demonstrate spatially-engineered far-field emission from vertically emitting\nInP NW lasers by establishing precise control over the optical coupling between\nsite-selective NWs, without relying on post-epitaxy transfer and alignment\nprocesses. Leveraging this process capability, we design and grow NW pairs and\ntriplets that lase in the TE01 waveguide mode. We then demonstrate the ability\nto modify their far-field emission profiles from the signature doughnut-like\nemission to a double-lobed emission profile by changing their optical coupling\ngap, evidenced by closely matching simulation and experimental profiles.\nMoreover, through numerical simulations, we show further enhancement in the\nfar-field directionality by arranging the NW laser pairs in a periodic array,\ndemonstrating the feasibility of a directional lasing metasurface.

In this study, we utilise a lattice representation of a\n(2+1)D massive gravity toy model interacting with Dirac fermions that can\nsupport specific spacetime fluctuations.

To monitor their\ndynamics a minimal model is required that comprises two bosonic modes\ndescribing spacetime geometry fluctuations coupled with the spin of the\nfermion.

Full quantum state\ntomography achieves this, but it implies observing the Wigner function\nnegativity, which requires efficient detection. Certifying non-Gaussianity\nthrough directly measurable parameters is a simpler alternative, typically\nachieved by measuring photon-number probabilities - either directly using\nphoton-number resolving detectors or through Hanbury Brown-Twiss type\nmeasurements with single-photon detectors. Here, we demonstrate theoretically\nand experimentally that optical parametric amplification combined with\nconventional intensity detectors can effectively replace this approach without\nthe need for photon-number resolution.

The uniqueness of the Fisher--Rao metric and the\nduality of these connections is at the heart of classical information geometry.\nHowever, these features do not carry over straightforwardly to quantum systems,\nwhere a Hermitian inner product structure on the Hilbert space induces a metric\non the complex projective space of pure states -- the Fubini-Study tensor,\nwhich is preserved under the unitary evolution. In this work, we explore how\nmodifying the Hermitian tensor structure on the projective space may affect the\ngeometry of pure quantum states, and whether such generalisations can be used\nto define dual connections with a direct correspondence to classical\nprobability distribution functions, modified by the presence of a non-trivial\nphase.

This hybrid architecture provides a\nversatile platform for quantum control by integrating nonlinear interactions\nand multiple control parameters. Operating in the strong coupling regime, we\nstudy the transient dynamics resulting from a time-dependent external drive\nthat has a boxcar profile. Starting from coherent states in both the mechanical\nand cavity subsystems, we show that this drive protocol, combined with\ntime-independent interaction and frequency configurations, leads to the\nemergence of highly non-Gaussian quantum states in the intermediary mechanical\ndegree of freedom. These states are characterized by a pronounced negative\nvolume in the Wigner quasi-probability distribution and enhanced quantum Fisher\ninformation, indicative of their quantum utility. We systematically analyze the\nimpact of the qubit phase, interaction strengths, and drive parameters on the\ndegree of non-Gaussianity.
