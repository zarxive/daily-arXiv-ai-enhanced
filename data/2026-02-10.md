### [1] [Asymptotic Freedom and Vacuum Polarization Determine the Astrophysical End State of Relativistic Gravitational Collapse: Quark--Gluon Plasma Star Instead of Black Hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07004)
*Herman J. Mosquera Cuesta,Fabián H. Zuluaga Giraldo,Wilmer D. Alfonso Pardo,Edgardo Marbello Santrich,Guillermo U. Avendaño Franco,Rafael Fragozo Larrazabal*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper presents a model of a hypermassive, extremely magnetized, ultra-compact quark--gluon plasma (QGP) object supported against gravitational collapse by vacuum polarization and QCD asymptotic freedom. The object could be the final remnant of stellar core collapse and could collapse into a hybrid hypermassive neutron star (HHMNS) through hypercritical accretion, leading to a first-order hadron-to-quark phase transition. The paper discusses the mass spectrum, radii, and magnetic fields of these QGP stars, which may emulate black hole gravitational effects. The paper also suggests that these stars could potentially be detected through gravitational-wave emission or lensing phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the behavior of quark--gluon plasma under extreme astrophysical conditions, such as those near black holes or during stellar collapse. The motivation is to understand the fundamental physics of these objects and their potential observational signatures.

Method: The study uses a general relativistic model based on nonlinear electrodynamics and QCD. It solves the TOV equation to analyze the structure of the QGP stars. Observational effects such as gravitational wave emission and lensing are considered for detection.

Result: The model predicts a wide range of possible masses, radii, and magnetic fields for QGP stars. It also suggests observable phenomena such as gravitational wave emission and lensing that could confirm the existence of these compact objects.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical framework for understanding the final stages of stellar collapse and the properties of quark--gluon plasma stars. It also offers potential observational methods to detect these exotic objects.

Abstract: A general relativistic model of an astrophysical hypermassive extremely magnetized ultra-compact self-bound quark--gluon plasma object that is supported against its ultimate gravitational implosion by the simultaneous action of the vacuum polarization driven by nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED: light-by-light scattering) and the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) asymptotic freedom, is presented. These QCD stars can be the final figures of the equilibrium of collapsing stellar cores. Post-supernova fallback material pushes the nascent remnant beyond its stability to collapse into a hybrid hypermassive neutron star (HHMNS). Hypercritical accretion can unbind the whole HHMNS's baryons to spontaneously break away color confinement, powering a first-order hadron-to-quark phase transition to a sea of ever-freer quarks and gluons. This core is hydro-stabilized by the steady, endlessly compression-admitting asymptotic freedom state, possibly via gluon-mediated enduring exchange of color charge among bound states. The nonlinear TOV equation indicates the occurrence of hypermassive QGP/QCD stars with a wide mass spectrum ($0\lesssim$ M$^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}}\lesssim$\,7\,M$_\odot$ and beyond), for star radii ($0\lesssim R^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}}\lesssim 24$\,km and beyond) with B-fields ($10^{14} \leq$ B$^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}} \leq 10^{16}$\,G and beyond). Such QCD stars can emulate what the true black holes are supposed to gravitationally do in most astrophysical settings. This color quark star could be found through a search for its eternal ``yo-yo'' state gravitational-wave emission, or via lensing phenomena like gravitational rainbows, as in this scenario it is expected that the light deflection angle, directly influenced by the larger effective mass/radius and magnetic field of the deflecting object, increases as the incidence angle decreases for impact parameter lower values.

Conclusion: 量子模拟结果为信息如何从黑洞中逃离提供了新的视角，有助于理解黑洞信息悖论。

Abstract: The complete evaporation of black holes, as a natural endpoint of Hawking radiation, gives rise to the black hole information paradox, which fundamentally challenges the principles of unitarity and information conservation in quantum mechanics. Although the AdS/CFT correspondence indicates that information is preserved during black hole evaporation, the precise mechanism by which it is recovered from the Hawking radiation remains an open question. To explore a potential resolution, we investigate information transfer in an analog black hole spacetime realized through position-dependent coupling in an XY spin chain. We derive and demonstrate Page curve-like behavior, and analyze the transmission of quantum resources, such as entanglement and coherence, across the effective horizon. Our results show that quantum resources initially localized within an interior subsystem can be transferred to the exterior via particle radiation through the horizon. This study provides a novel perspective from quantum simulation on how information may escape from black holes, thereby contributing to the further understanding of the black hole information paradox.

Abstract: We derive the general relativistic linear tidal response of a neutron star modeled as a barotropic perfect fluid. From the covariant fluid effective action, we linearize about equilibrium and obtain the action for fluid displacements coupled to metric perturbations. Splitting the latter into external and induced parts and integrating out the induced field yields a Hermitian operator and a discrete gapped spectrum of driven modes. Projecting the displacement onto this eigenbasis and integrating out the spatial dependence over the stellar radius reduces the dynamics to tidal-driven oscillators, with couplings set by relativistic inner products and overlap integrals. Matching to the quadrupolar worldline effective action gives a mode-sum response function and analytic dynamical tidal deformabilities from mode frequencies, normalizations, and overlaps.

Abstract: The article deals with the gravitational energy associated with axial perturbations of regular black holes. We review the stability of the geometry under odd-parity perturbations and the corresponding quasinormal modes, previously obtained for this class of spacetimes. The perturbative functions describing the metric fluctuations are reconstructed from the master equation. To evaluate the energy content of these perturbations, we employ the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), which provides a well-defined expression for gravitational energy. The gravitational energy is computed up to second order in the perturbation parameter and expressed in terms of the quasinormal mode functions. Our results establish a direct connection between the dynamical response of regular black holes and the energy carried by their gravitational perturbations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Rindler's metric is an interesting way to incorporate a set of uniformly accelerated observers into space-time coordinates; this is consistent with special and general relativity. It is known that such an acceleration gives rise to the famous Unruh effect. Interestingly, its Galilean limit already shows the appearance of quantized modes for particles in free space, given by Airy functions. This happens when a wall or boundary condition is moving in an accelerated trajectory in free space and in the presence of a field. Here we show that such a boundary, when viewed as a material obstacle in motion, gives rise to quantized modes for the Klein-Gordon and Maxwell fields, as long as the boundary does not touch the singularity at the Rindler wedge. This corresponds to a quantum-mechanical problem with an anomalous fall-to-the-origin potential $-1/x^2$ supplemented with a Dirichlet condition. We provide further mathematical analysis regarding the completeness of the solutions in terms of Hankel functions $H^{(1)}$ of imaginary index and argument, and clarify the nature of the corresponding Sobolev spaces when the boundary condition disappears for the accelerated observer. A detailed interpretation of the transition amplitudes is given in connection with particle production obtained from a Bogoliubov transformation.

Abstract: We study both primordial GWs and scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in a class of the parity-violating scalar-tensor (PVST) theory, of which the Lagrangian is the linear combination of seven ghost-free parity-violating scalar-tensor monomials dubbed the ``Qi-Xiu'' Lagrangians. At linear order, we obtain the quadratic action for tensor perturbations and show that parity-violating terms associated with $\mathcal{L}_{1,2,5,6,7}$ render the tensor propagation polarization dependent, leading to chiral primordial spectra and a nonvanishing degree of circular polarization. At second order, we derive the EOM for SIGWs and identify the explicit parity-violating source terms. In particular, $\mathcal{L}_3$ and $\mathcal{L}_4$ enter exclusively through the source term for SIGWs, allowing parity violation to arise even when the linear GWs propagation remains effectively GR-like. During the radiation-dominated era, we compute the fractional energy density of SIGWs for both monochromatic and lognormal curvature power spectra. We find that, around the peak frequency, SIGWs in PVST gravity exhibit characteristic deviations from those in GR, resulting in a nonzero degree of circular polarization.

### [7] [Probing Quantum Gravity effects with Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals around Rotating Hayward Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07436)

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the detectability of quantum gravity effects on extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) using LISA, finding that LISA has the potential to probe quantum gravity through high-precision observations of EMRI waveforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the interest in quantum gravity effects and their detectability using space-based gravitational wave detectors like LISA.

Method: The authors use numerical simulations with the FastEMRIWaveforms package, augmented with a Quantum Parameter α0, to model EMRI waveforms. They incorporate the time-delay interferometry (TDI) to suppress noise and apply the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to analyze LISA's sensitivity.

Result: The study reveals that after one year of observation, the quantum gravity effects cause detectable dephasing in EMRI waveforms. Additionally, LISA's use of TDI significantly improves noise suppression and phase stability, demonstrating its potential to detect deviations from general relativity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the advanced modeling and detector techniques employed suggest LISA is well-suited to probe quantum gravity effects in the future through high-precision EMRI observations.

Abstract: We investigate extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) around a rotating Hayward black hole to assess the detectability of signatures arising from quantum gravity.The quantum parameter $α_0$, which encodes deviations from general relativity (GR), introduces extra correction terms in both the orbital frequency and the fluxes. Our results show that after one year of accumulated observation, these corrections induce a detectable dephasing in the EMRI waveform. Using the modified orbital evolution driven by $α_0$, we generate waveforms via the augmented analytic kludge (AAK) model implemented in the \texttt{FastEMRIWaveforms} package. Furthermore, we utilize the time-delay interferometry (TDI) to suppress the laser noise and phase fluctuations induced by spacecraft motion, and then employ the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to test the sensitivity of LISA in detecting deviations from GR. Our results demonstrate the potential of LISA to probe quantum-gravity effects through high-precision observations of EMRIs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We formulate a model of gravitationally induced decoherence for photons starting from Maxwell theory coupled to linearised gravity, expressed in terms of Ashtekar-Barbero variables and treated as an open quantum field theoretic system. In contrast to quantum mechanical models, the interaction between the system (Maxwell field) and the environment (gravitational field) is not postulated phenomenologically, but is instead dictated by the underlying action in a post-Minkowskian approximation. This framework extends earlier models for a scalar field and enables a more detailed analysis of the role of dynamical reference fields (clocks) within the relational formalism. We show that, for a suitable choice of geometrical clocks together with a U(1)-Gauss clock, and by employing an appropriate combination of the observable map and its dual, the resulting Dirac observables are given directly by the transverse components of the photon field as well as the symmetric-transverse-traceless degrees of freedom of gravitational waves on the linearised phase space of the coupled system. In addition we also compare different choices of Dirac observables and their dynamics. Upon applying a Fock quantisation to the reduced system, we derive the time convolutionless (TCL) master equation, truncated at second order, and analyse its structural properties. These results provide a foundation for further investigations of the decoherence model, including its renormalisation and a detailed study of its one-particle sector, and are found to be structurally consistent with former master equations for photons derived using ADM variables and a specific gauge fixing.

Abstract: We investigate the possibility of photon halos (stable photon orbits) forming outside Schwarzschild-$f(R)$ black holes by analyzing null geodesics in these spacetimes. Using methods inspired by studies of spherical photon orbits around Kerr-Newman black holes, we derive conditions for the existence of such halos. We examine several f(R) gravity models, including quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, cubic, power-law, and hyperbolic forms, and find that multiple photon orbits -- both stable and unstable -- can appear outside the event horizon for certain parameter ranges. These additional orbits (halos) provide new insights into spacetime geometry and potential observational signatures of black holes in modified gravity. We present analytical expressions for the orbital radii, perform a numerical stability analysis, and discuss possible observational implications for black hole shadows. Our results indicate that while the standard Schwarzschild black hole admits only a single unstable light ring, Schwarzschild-$f(R)$ black holes can support an additional outer stable photon orbit (a halo) without triggering a black-hole bomb instability. This work deepens the understanding of photon-orbit structures in alternative theories of gravity and highlights how such effects could be detected through deviations in black hole shadow size or morphology.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Interpreting horizon-scale black hole images currently relies on computationally intensive General Relativistic Ray Tracing (GRRT) simulations, which pose a significant bottleneck for rapid parameter exploration and high-precision tests of strong-field gravity. We demonstrate that physically accurate black hole images, synthesized from magnetized accretion flows, inherently reside on a low-dimensional manifold-encoding the essential features of spacetime geometry, plasma distribution, and relativistic emission. Leveraging this structure, we introduce a physics-conditioned diffusion model that operates in a compact latent space to generate high-fidelity black hole imagery directly from physical parameters. The model accurately reproduces critical observational signatures from full GRRT simulations-such as shadow diameter, photon-ring structure, and relativistic brightness asymmetry-while achieving over a fourfold reduction in computational expense. Compared with the previous generation of denoising diffusion models, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in image quality, reconstruction fidelity, and parameter estimation accuracy, while reducing the average inference time per black hole image from 5.25 seconds to 1.15 seconds. Our work establishes diffusion-based latent models as efficient and scalable substitutes for traditional radiative transfer solvers, offering a practical framework toward real-time modeling and inference for next-generation black hole imaging.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the optical properties of a spherically symmetric Mod(A)Max black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter, focusing on key features such as the photon sphere radius, shadow, photon trajectories, and the effective radial force experienced by photons. We also study the dynamics of massive particles around the black hole, deriving the effective potential and, from it, the specific energy and angular momentum of particles moving in circular orbits of fixed radii is discussed. The conditions for marginally stable circular orbits are analyzed, highlighting how the geometric parameters that modify the spacetime curvature influence both the optical and dynamical features. Furthermore, we explore the thermodynamic behavior of the black hole by examining its temperature, Gibbs free energy, and heat capacity, as well as its thermodynamic topology. Finally, scalar field perturbations are considered through the massless Klein-Gordon equation, and the quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the eikonal regime are computed, illustrating how the geometric parameters affect the potential and the QNM spectra.

### [12] [Signatures of the Israel Junction II: Double Photon Rings in Slowly Rotating Kerr Spacetime with Thin Shell](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07923)
*Long-Yue Li,Li-Ming Cao,Yungui Gong,Xia-Yuan Liu,Wenting Zhou*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Analyzing the paper, the too long summary would include key aspects: Applying the junction conditions to a slowly rotating Kerr spacetime with a thin shell reveals that a ray’s angular momentum L and Carter constant C remain unchanged, while its energy E and hence impact parameters η=L/E and ξ=C/E² are discontinuous at the shell. The study involves investigating the shadow of this spacetime and corresponding images from an equatorial thin accretion disk. The shell introduces distinctive features in the observed images, such as double photon rings that can merge into a single ring, and a lack of one-to-one correspondence between shadow boundaries and photon rings. Additionally, abrupt changes in the redshift factor and truncated photon regions produce features like step-like structures in the images. These findings suggest potential implications for evaluating the Israel junction condition and shell models in real astrophysical systems. The primary takeaway is that the shell’s influence on photon trajectories and image features could be useful in testing theoretical models against observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper deals with the junction conditions in a rotating black hole spacetime with a thin shell, likely within the context of black hole thermodynamics or modified gravity theories. The analysis of photon trajectories, especially in the presence of a shell, could contribute to understanding how spacetime singularities or exotic matter configurations influence observed phenomena such as black hole shadows. The study’s motivation is to explore theoretical implications that might be tested through future astronomical observations of black hole images.

Method: The authors likely employed analytical methods by applying junction conditions in general relativity to derive how photon parameters like E, η, and ξ behave across the shell. They may have used numerical simulations or approximations to model the shadow formation and image generation for an equatorial thin accretion disk. Observational data could have been used to compare theoretical predictions with real-world black hole images.

Result: The study finds that angular momentum L and Carter constant C of a ray remain constant upon crossing the shell, whereas its energy E and associated impact parameters η and ξ are discontinuous. This leads to distinctive features in the observed images, such as double photon rings, their merger, and a lack of one-to-one correspondence between shadow boundaries and photon rings. The redshift factor’s abrupt changes and truncated photon regions result in step-like structures in the images. These findings suggest that the shell’s influence on photon trajectories and image features could be used to evaluate the Israel junction condition and shell models in real astrophysical systems.

Conclusion: The inclusion of a thin shell in a slowly rotating Kerr spacetime introduces observable features in the images of black holes, such as double photon rings and step-like structures, which could aid in validating theoretical models concerning junction conditions and shell models against future astronomical observations.

Abstract: Applying the junction conditions to the slowly rotating Kerr spacetime with a thin shell, we find that while the angular momentum $L$ and Carter constant $C$ of the ray remain unchanged upon crossing the shell, its energy $E$ does not. Consequently, the impact parameters $η=L/E$ and $ξ=C/E^2$ of the ray are discontinued at the shell. Utilizing this transformation, we study the shadow of this spacetime and the corresponding images from an equatorial thin accretion disk. The presence of the shell gives rise to distinctive features in the observed images. Notably, we observe distinct double photon rings in the images, which can gradually merge into a single ring. Moreover, the shadow boundaries and the photon rings do not exhibit a one-to-one correspondence. The abrupt changes in redshift factor and the truncated photon regions profoundly influence the image, producing distinctive features such as the step-like structures. These features in shell-equipped spacetimes can help evaluate, through future astronomical observations, the applicability of the Israel junction condition and the shell model in real astrophysical systems.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method called PI-DEF for reconstructing the dynamic 3D gas distribution around black holes using radio measurements. This method improves upon previous approaches by incorporating physical constraints and is validated through experiments showing better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The success of static black hole imaging has inspired researchers to aim for dynamic and 3D imaging. The ability to image the surrounding gas could reveal new physics and insights into the universe.

Method: The method PI-DEF uses differentiable neural rendering to fit a 4D emissivity field (including time) from radio measurements. It jointly reconstructs the 3D velocity field and enforces velocity as a soft constraint on the dynamics of the emissivity field.

Result: Experiments on simulated data show that PI-DEF significantly outperforms both BH-NeRF and a physics-agnostic approach in reconstructing the gas distribution and estimating black hole parameters like spin.

Conclusion: PI-DEF represents a promising advancement in modeling the dynamic behavior of black hole surroundings, offering a computationally efficient and accurate solution to the dynamic 3D reconstruction problem.

Abstract: With the success of static black-hole imaging, the next frontier is the dynamic and 3D imaging of black holes. Recovering the dynamic 3D gas near a black hole would reveal previously-unseen parts of the universe and inform new physics models. However, only sparse radio measurements from a single viewpoint are possible, making the dynamic 3D reconstruction problem significantly ill-posed. Previously, BH-NeRF addressed the ill-posed problem by assuming Keplerian dynamics of the gas, but this assumption breaks down near the black hole, where the strong gravitational pull of the black hole and increased electromagnetic activity complicate fluid dynamics. To overcome the restrictive assumptions of BH-NeRF, we propose PI-DEF, a physics-informed approach that uses differentiable neural rendering to fit a 4D (time + 3D) emissivity field given EHT measurements. Our approach jointly reconstructs the 3D velocity field with the 4D emissivity field and enforces the velocity as a soft constraint on the dynamics of the emissivity. In experiments on simulated data, we find significantly improved reconstruction accuracy over both BH-NeRF and a physics-agnostic approach. We demonstrate how our method may be used to estimate other physics parameters of the black hole, such as its spin.

Conclusion: 发现微观量子泡的不可探测性，并为观察到黑洞回声的显著偏差提供了证据，表明视界结构必须是宏观共轭的。

Abstract: We examine the robustness of black hole ringdown to stochastic horizon-scale structure within an effective field framework. Consistent with the understanding that the spectral instability of quasinormal modes does not necessarily imply observational breakdown, our results demonstrate that the macroscopic gravitational waveform remains robust. We identify the phase averaging mechanism as the physical origin of this stability, demonstrating that the spatial integration of the wave equation efficiently attenuates ultraviolet geometric details below the resolution limit of the probing wavelength. Building on the scaling law $\mathcal{M} \propto ε^2$ and the characteristic mismatch profile with respect to $L_c$, we propose a geometric selection rule for observability: a detectable signal imposes a strict dual constraint requiring both macroscopic spatial coherence ($L_c \sim M$) and classical-level intensity ($ε\gtrsim 10^{-4}$). This criterion quantitatively rules out the observability of incoherent, high-entropy quantum foam, suggesting that any significant ringdown deviation would serve as definitive evidence for macroscopically coherent horizon structures.

Abstract: Black hole perturbation theory beyond second order is not well understood because typically one defines the meaning of gauge invariance order by order which is ambiguous. In this series of works we therefore developed a new approach which disentangles the meaning of gauge invariance from the perturbative order. It is based on the reduced phase space approach to the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity and constructs a non-perturbative, albeit implicit, formulation of the dynamics of only observables that are gauge invariant to all orders. To obtain explicit expressions, perturbation theory is then employed, but now only perturbations are considered that are gauge invariant to all orders. There are both spherically symmetric and non-symmetric observables and the formulation takes the (perturbative) backreaction between those fully into account. The formulation has access to both the exterior and interior of the dynamical horizon.
  In previous papers of this series we have introduced the general formalism and performed consistency checks with second order results obtained in other approaches. The real virtue of our approach starts emerging at higher than second order where we expect differences from previous works both due to backreaction effects and because we work with observables that are gauge invariant to all orders, not only up to a given order. In this paper, we consider the third order. Also new to our approach is that we start from a non-perturbative, namely polynomial, version of the constraints which therefore are finite polynomials in all degrees of freedom before reducing, rather than an infinite series. This allows for an exact and non-perturbative, while implicit, solution of the constraints which does not need to truncate the series and thus is of tremendous technical advantage.

Abstract: It has traditionally been believed that fermionic entanglement generally outperforms bosonic entanglement in relativistic frameworks, and that bosonic entanglement experiences sudden death in extreme gravitational environments. In this study, we analyze the genuine N-partite entanglement, measured by negativity, of bosonic and fermionic GHZ states, focusing on scenarios where a subset of $m$ ($m<N$) constituents interacts with Hawking radiation generated by a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Surprisingly, we find that quantum entanglement between the non-gravitational and gravitational modes for the bosonic field is stronger than that in the same modes for the fermionic field within dilaton spacetime. This study challenges the traditional belief that ``fermionic entanglement always outperforms bosonic entanglement" in the relativistic framework. However, quantum entanglement between the gravitational modes and the combined gravitational and non-gravitational modes is weaker for the bosonic field than for the fermionic field in the presence of a dilaton black hole. Finally, the connection between the global N-partite entanglement in the bosonic field and that in the fermionic field is influenced by the gravitational field's intensity. Our study reveals the intrinsic relationship between quantum entanglement of bosonic and fermionic fields in curved spacetime from a new perspective, and provides theoretical guidance for selecting appropriate field-based quantum resources for relativistic quantum information tasks under extreme gravitational conditions.

Here, following the Penrose idea of combinatorial spacetime we reformulate loop quantum gravity theory solely in terms of the matter fields.

Abstract: We consider the embedding of regular black holes in an expanding universe and study how the ultraviolet modifications to the Schwarzschild geometry that regularize the black hole singularity affect the exterior universe's expansion rate. We consider several proposals for the regular black hole geometry and obtain the corresponding Friedmann equations for a universe filled only with dust and black holes. We show that different proposals have different implications which may be distinguished. We then test the hypothesis that the UV corrections to the black hole geometry may be responsible for the current phase of accelerated expansion. To this aim we constrain the value of the regular black hole UV cutoff parameter from observations. Interestingly we find that the best fit is obtained by values of the parameter corresponding to regular horizonless compact objects.

Abstract: Modified gravity theories have been extensively studied recently as viable substitutes for general relativity to deal with cosmological issues like dark energy and late-time cosmic acceleration. In the present work, we investigate the dynamical behavior of the $f(R,L,T)$ gravity model with a scalar field utilizing exponential potential, where $R$ represents the Ricci scalar, $L$ is the Lagrangian density and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We concentrate on a specific type of modified gravity characterized by $f(R,L,T) =R+αL+βT$, where $α$ and $β$ are positive constants. We study the dynamical behavior and late-time evolution of a cosmological model using a thorough phase-space analysis. We assess important cosmological parameters at the critical places, such as the density parameters corresponding to various cosmic components, the deceleration parameter, and the effective equation of state parameter. The nature of the cosmic phases such as matter-dominated, radiation-dominated, and accelerated expansion eras, described using these quantities.

Abstract: We present the conservative dynamics of compact binaries to third order in the post-Minkowskian approximation in a theory that extends general relativity by a massless scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. We employ the effective field theory approach to construct the effective action of binary systems by integrating out the metric and scalar degrees of freedom that mediate the gravitational interactions between the two bodies. We derive analytical expressions for the scattering impulse and the deflection angle to third order in the post-Minkowskian expansion. Our results are found to be in agreement, in the overlapping regimes, with state-of-the-art calculations in the post-Newtonian/post-Minkowskian theory.

Abstract: We investigate the relativistic modeling of spacecraft motion in Mercury's post-Newtonian local coordinates. This investigation is motivated by the fact that Mercury's post-Newtonian gravitational field (as well as that of any other planet) admits an expansion in terms of multipole moments, which are most appropriately defined in the local reference system. The equations of motion in the Mercury-centric local frame include relativistic local perturbations, given by the Schwarzschild term, Lense-Thirring precession, and the acceleration due to the quadrupole moment, and relativistic third-body perturbations, which are the gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic accelerations, along with a coupling term between Mercury and other solar system bodies. The relativistic third-body perturbations are usually neglected in all practical applications. In this study, we analyze the magnitude of the post-Newtonian terms of the equations of motion formulated in the Mercury-centric frame, evaluating them along the trajectories of the two BepiColombo spacecrafts. Based on this analysis, we provide a practical approach for constructing a high-accuracy relativistic orbital model suitable for a Mercury orbiter.

Abstract: We study the motion of test particles around Kerr--Bertotti--Robinson (KBR) black hole (BH) and explore how the three defining parameters the mass $M$, rotation parameter $a$, and magnetic parameter $B$ influence their dynamics. We derive analytical expressions for the energy and angular momentum of stable equatorial circular orbits, along with the corresponding radial and latitudinal oscillation frequencies, as functions of $M$, $a$, and $B$. We also examine the key features of the quasi-periodic oscillations of test particles near stable circular orbits, including the precession effects such as periastron precession and the Lense-Thirring effect. Finally, we compare our results with those corresponding to the Kerr BH. We find that particle motion is strongly shaped by the BH parameters. Using a WKB approach, we also study scalar quasinormal modes of a rotating KBR BH in an external magnetic field and show that the magnetic field increases damping, while rotation and angular momentum mainly set the oscillation frequencies. Alternatively, general relativistic modelling of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion onto a rapidly rotating KBR BH shows that two distinct physical structures emerge and cyclically transform into one another over time. These processes produce either a strongly oscillating flip-flop shock cone or a nearly stationary toroidal structure, with their formation governed by the black hole spin and magnetic curvature. Power spectral analysis shows that these configurations give rise to low and high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations, offering a unified explanation for the multiple quasi-periodic oscillations observed in rapidly spinning X--ray binaries.

Abstract: We introduce a new factorized and resummed waveform for circularized, nonspinning, compact binaries that leverages on the solution of the Teukolsky equation once mapped into a confluent Heun equation. The structure of the solution allows one to identify new resummed factors that completely absorb all test-mass logarithms and transcendental numbers via exponentials and $Γ$-functions at any post-Newtonian (PN) order. The corresponding residual relativistic and phase corrections are thus polynomial with rational coefficients, that are in fact PN-truncated hypergeometric functions. Our approach complements the recent proposal of Ivanov et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135 (2025) 14, 141401], notably recovering the corresponding renormalization group scaling of multipole moments from first principles and fixing the scaling constant. In the test mass limit, our approach (pushed up to 10PN) yields waveforms and fluxes that are globally more accurate than those obtained using the standard factorized approach of Damour et al. [Phys. Rev. D 79 (2009), 064004]. The method generalizes straightforwardly to comparable mass binaries implementing the new concept of universal anomalous dimension of multipole moments and might be eventually useful to improve current state of the art effective-one-body waveform models for coalescing binaries.

Abstract: We investigate a non-singular cosmological scenario in which uniform-rate inflation is realised on an anisotropic Shtanov-Sahni braneworld. The model naturally resolves the initial singularity resulting in an infinite number of smooth non-singular bounces, while accommodating a phase of accelerated expansion driven by a scalar field rolling at a constant rate. The presence of a timelike extra dimension induces high-energy corrections to the effective Friedmann dynamics, allowing anisotropic shear to be dynamically suppressed near the bounce and rendering the background evolution stable. We derive the full background dynamics analytically and demonstrate that uniform-rate inflation can be consistently embedded within an anisotropic braneworld framework. Primordial scalar and tensor perturbations are analysed using the $δN$ formalism, ensuring that only physically relevant modes exiting the horizon during inflation contribute to observable quantities. Remarkably, we find that observational consistency can be achieved with different levels of anisotropy in the two different scenarios we consider, without compromising the smoothness or stability of the bounce. Our results establish uniform-rate inflation on an anisotropic braneworld as a robust and observationally viable alternative to standard inflationary cosmology, offering a compelling framework in which non-singular early-universe dynamics and precision cosmology can be consistently unified.

Abstract: Spin resonance phenomena are conventionally described using transition probabilities formulated in a rotating frame, whose physical meaning implicitly depends on the choice of quantum reference standard. In this Colloquium, we show that a spin in a rotating magnetic field constitutes a configuration involving two quantum descriptions that share a common quantization operator but differ in their kinematic and dynamical roles. The transition probability therefore emerges as a relational quantity between quantum reference standards rather than an intrinsic property of a single evolving spin state. By incorporating the kinematic motion of the spin vector together with the dynamical evolution, this framework restores consistent energy accounting and reveals the dual-reference structure underlying spin dynamics in rotating magnetic fields.

Abstract: The linearity inherent in quantum mechanics limits current quantum hardware from directly solving nonlinear systems governed by nonlinear differential equations. One can opt for linearization frameworks such as Carleman linearization, which provides a high dimensional infinite linear system corresponding to a finite nonlinear system, as an indirect way of solving nonlinear systems using current quantum computers. We provide an efficient data access model to load this infinite linear representation of the nonlinear system, upto truncation order $N$, on a quantum computer by decomposing the Hamiltonian into the weighted sum of non-unitary operators, namely the Sigma basis. We have shown that the Sigma basis provides an exponential reduction in the number of decomposition terms compared to the traditional decomposition, which is usually done in a linear combination of Pauli operators. Once the Hamiltonian is decomposed, we then use the concept of unitary completion to construct the circuit for the implementation of each weighted tensor product component $\mathcal{H}_{j}$ of the decomposition.

Abstract: Quantum networks, integrating quantum communication, quantum metrology, and distributed quantum computing, could provide secure and efficient information transfer, high-resolution sensing, and an exponential speed-up in information processing. Deterministic entanglement distribution over long distances is a prerequisite for scalable quantum networks, enabling the utilization of device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) and quantum teleportation to achieve secure and efficient information transfer. However, the exponential photon loss in optical fibres prohibits efficient and deterministic entanglement distribution. Quantum repeaters, incorporating entanglement swapping and entanglement purification with quantum memories, offer the most promising means to overcome this limitation in fibre-based quantum networks. Despite numerous pioneering efforts toward realizing quantum repeaters, a critical bottleneck remains, as remote memory-memory entanglement suffers from decoherence more rapidly than it can be established and purified over long distances. We overcome this by developing long-lived trapped-ion memories, an efficient telecom interface, and a high-visibility single-photon entanglement protocol. This allows us to establish and maintain memory-memory entanglement over a 10 km fibre within the average entanglement establishment time for the same distance. As a direct application, we demonstrate metropolitan-scale DI-QKD, distilling 1,917 secret keys out of 4.05*10^5 Bell pairs over 10 km. We further report a positive key rate over 101 km in the asymptotic limit, extending the achievable distance by more than two orders of magnitude. Our work provides a critical building block for quantum repeaters and marks an important step toward scalable quantum networks.

Abstract: In recent years, the traditional notion of symmetry in quantum theory was expanded to so-called generalised or categorical symmetries, which, unlike ordinary group symmetries, may be non-invertible. This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\mathcal{C}$ being unitary. We illustrate our proposal through several examples that include Tambara-Yamagami, Fibonacci, and Yang-Lee as well as higher categorical symmetries.

Abstract: We present a microscopic calculation of spontaneous photon emission by twisted (paraxial) electrons propagating through inhomogeneous, axisymmetric magnetic fields. We construct exact electron states that incorporate transverse mode structure and wavefront curvature by combining the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation with a geometric framework based on Lewis-Ermakov invariants and metaplectic transformations. We show that the evolution of such structured states corresponds to an open path in the space of quadratic forms, giving rise to a geometric contribution to the emission amplitude that cannot be eliminated by gauge choice or adiabatic arguments. The inverse radius of curvature of the electron wavefront emerges as an effective geometric field that enables radiation even in regions where the external magnetic field vanishes locally. This mechanism generalizes Landau-level radiation to nonasymptotic, structured electron states and establishes a direct connection between noncyclic geometric evolution and photon emission.

Abstract: We study entanglement harvesting in general $d$-dimensional conformal field theories using pointlike Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to scalar primary operators. This extends standard harvesting protocols beyond free fields to interacting conformal theories and arbitrary spatial dimensions. We find that increasing the operator scaling dimension suppresses both negativity and mutual information, reflecting the faster decay of correlations. For holographic CFTs, we show that bulk effective field theory enables a separation between field-harvested and communication-mediated entanglement. We also derive asymptotic, closed-form approximations that agree well with numerical results.

Motivation: This research aimed to evaluate the performance of quantum receiver systems in demodulating phase-modulated signals, with the goal of advancing quantum communication technologies.

Method: The study developed a generalized cumulant expansion model for noisy quantum receivers and compared various quantum demodulation protocols using BEP and channel capacity metrics.

Additionally, strategies were identified to enhance data recovery fidelity in noisy environments, and practical limits were determined for such systems using NV-diamond as the sensor platform.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for leveraging quantum sensors in advanced quantum communication systems, highlighting their potential to outperform traditional methods under specific conditions.

Abstract: Quantum sensors are an ideal candidate for detecting weak electromagnetic signals because of their exceptional sensitivity and compact form factor. In this work, we analyze the performance of a quantum-sensor-based receive chain for demodulating information encoded in phase-modulated electromagnetic waves. We introduce a generalized cumulant expansion to model a noisy quantum receiver and use it to compare the performance of various quantum demodulation protocols. Employing bit error probability (BEP) and channel capacity as quantitative performance metrics, we compare the capabilities of ensembles of quantum sensors - both unentangled and entangled - using Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK) as a representative example of phase modulation. We identify conditions when the channel capacity of an ensemble of quantum sensors may surpass the limits of a classical electrically small antenna. Additionally, we discuss modifications to the quantum protocol that enables high-fidelity data recovery even in the presence of sensor noise and channel distortions. Finally, we explore practical performance limits of such a quantum receive chain, with a focus on NV-diamond as the quantum sensor platform.

Abstract: Quantum computers are expected to become a powerful tool for studying physical quantum systems. Consequently, a number of quantum algorithms for studying the physical properties of such systems have been developed. While qubit-based quantum computers are naturally suited to the study of spin-1/2 systems, systems containing other degrees of freedom must first be encoded into qubits. Transformations to and from fermionic degrees of freedom have long been an important tool in physics and, now the simulation of fermionic systems on quantum computers based on qubits provides yet another application. In this perspective, we review methods for encoding fermionic degrees of freedom into qubits and attempt to dispel the persistent notion that fermionic systems beyond one dimension are fundamentally more difficult to deal with.

Conclusion: 扩展了束缚态在连续谱中的概念，具有重要物理学和光子学意义。

Abstract: On the contrary to the common intuition that a steep expulsive potential makes quantum states widely delocalized, we demonstrate that one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) Schrödinger equations, which include expulsive potentials that are \emph{steeper than the quadratic} (anti-harmonic-oscillator) ones, give rise to \emph{normalizable} (effectively localized) eigenstates. These states constitute full continuous spectra in the 1D and 2D cases alike. In 1D, these are spatially even and odd eigenstates. The 2D states may carry any value of the vorticity (alias magnetic quantum number). Asymptotic approximations for wave functions of the 1D and 2D eigenstates, valid far from the center, are derived analytically, demonstrating excellent agreement with numerically found counterparts. Special exact solutions for vortex states are obtained in the 2D case. These findings suggest an extension of the concept of bound states in the continuum, in quantum mechanics and paraxial photonics. Gross-Pitaevskii equations are considered as the nonlinear extension of the 1D and 2D settings. In 1D, the cubic nonlinearity slightly deforms the eigenstates, maintaining their stability. On the other hand, the quintic self-focusing term, which occurs in the photonic version of the 1D model, initiates the dynamical collapse of states whose norm exceeds a critical value.

Abstract: We investigate a constant-time, fusion measurement-based scheme to create AKLT states beyond one dimension. We show that it is possible to prepare such states on a given graph up to random spin-1 `decorations', each corresponding to a probabilistic insertion of a vertex along an edge. In investigating their utility in measurement-based quantum computation, we demonstrate that any such randomly decorated AKLT state possesses at least the same computational power as non-random ones, such as those on trivalent planar lattices. For AKLT states on Bethe lattices and their decorated versions we show that there exists a deterministic, constant-time scheme for their preparation. In addition to randomly decorated AKLT states, we also consider random-bond AKLT states, whose construction involves any of the canonical Bell states in the bond degrees of freedom instead of just the singlet in the original construction. Such states naturally emerge upon measuring all the decorative spin-1 sites in the randomly decorated AKLT states. We show that those random-bond AKLT states on trivalent lattices can be converted to encoded random graph states after acting with the same POVM on all sites. We also argue that these random-bond AKLT states possess similar quantum computational power as the original singlet-bond AKLT states via the percolation perspective.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of a dressed qubit implemented by a spinless fermion hopping between two lattice sites with each site strongly coupled to a bath of phonons. We employ Lang-Firsov transformation to make the problem tractable perturbatively. Applying time-convolutionless master equation within the polaron frame, we investigate decoherence dynamics of the dressed qubit within the singlet-triplet basis of the system for a wide range of bath spectral densities. It is shown that the coherence persists for longer time scales for large coupling values and shows non-monotonic behaviour reflecting the presence of non-Markovianity in the dynamics. Non-Markovianity, characterized by coherence revivals and non-monotonic decay patterns, emerges distinctly depending on the bath spectrum and coupling strengths. Systems coupled to sub-Ohmic baths, whether both or in combination with another type, display pronounced memory effects at relatively small values of couplings. In contrast, combinations involving Ohmic and super-Ohmic baths exhibit noticeable non-Markovianity only at higher couplings.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-Hermiticity plays a fundamental role in open quantum systems and describes a wide variety of effects of interactions with environments, including quantum measurement. However, understanding its consequences in strongly interacting systems is still elusive due to the interplay between non-perturbative strong correlations and non-Hermiticity. While the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) method has been applied to tackle this problem, its foundation, based on the existence of the partition function, is ill-defined. In this paper, we establish a microscopic foundation of the non-Hermitian RG method from a few-body perspective. We show that the invariance of the scattering amplitude under RG transformations enables us to rigorously derive the non-Hermitian RG equation, giving a physically transparent interpretation of RG flows. We discuss a detailed structure of such RG flows in a non-relativistic two-body system with inelastic two-body loss, and show its relation to a non-Hermitian quantum scale anomaly. Our analysis suggests that non-Hermitian complex potentials often used in high-energy physics can be interpreted as being caused by quantum measurement, where the detection of elastically scattered particles updates the observer's knowledge, resulting in a nonunitary state change of the system. We apply our formalism to nuclear physics, find the emergence of a critical semicircle, and show that several nuclei are located near the critical semicircle in the coherent neutron-nucleus scattering. We also propose that the localized dineutron in two-neutron halo nuclei can be interpreted as the quantum measurement effect on the imaginary potential associated with absorption into the core nucleus. Our result bridges different contexts of non-Hermitian systems in high-energy and atomic, molecular, and optical physics, opening an interdisciplinary playground of non-Hermitian few-body physics.

Motivation: Understanding the impact of different QUBO formulations on quantum algorithms’ scalability and performance is crucial for advancing quantum computing applications.

Method: The research explores QUDO's potential by comparing its performance with binary QUBO using the qudit QAOA and exact classical solutions.

Result: QUDO demonstrated higher approximation ratios and less computational burden, suggesting it's a viable alternative for quantum optimization.

Conclusion: QUDIO should be considered for optimizing quantum solutions beyond QUBO's limitations.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are typically formulated using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), where constraints are enforced through penalty terms that introduce auxiliary variables and rapidly increase Hamiltonian complexity, limiting scalability on near term quantum devices. In this work, we systematically study Quadratic Unconstrained D-ary Optimization (QUDO) as an alternative formulation in which decision variables are encoded directly in higher dimensional Hilbert spaces. We demonstrate that QUDO naturally captures structural constraints across a range of problem classes, including the Traveling Salesman Problem, two variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem, graph coloring, job scheduling, and Max-K-Cut, without the need for extensive penalty constructions. Using a qudit-level implementation of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (qudit QAOA), we benchmark these formulations against their binary QUBO counterparts and exact classical solutions. Our study show consistently improved approximation ratios and substantially reduced computational overhead at comparable circuit depths, highlighting QUDO as a scalable and expressive representation for quantum combinatorial optimization.

Motivation: The paper aims to critically analyze and correct misunderstandings surrounding the ABL rule in quantum theory.

Method: The authors review historical context, identify category errors, and critique methodologies used in interpreting the ABL rule.

Result: The authors identify specific flaws in the ABL rule's application and misuse of experimental data.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the ABL rule's foundational issues render its application questionable in quantum theory analyses.

Abstract: In 1964, Aharonov, Bergmann, and Lebowitz introduced their well-known ABL rule with the intention of providing a time-symmetric formalism for computing novel kinds of conditional probabilities in quantum theory. Later papers attached additional significance to the ABL rule, including assertions that it supported violations of the uncertainty principle. The present work challenges these claims, as well as subsequent attempts to salvage the original interpretation of the ABL rule. Taking a broader view, this paper identifies a subtle category error at the heart of the ABL rule that consists of confusing observables that belong to a single system with emergent observables that arise only for physical ensembles. Along the way, this paper points out other problems and fallacious reasoning in the research literature surrounding the ABL rule, including the misuse of post-selection, a reliance on pattern matching to classical formulas, and a posture of measurementism that takes experimental data as providing answers to interpretational questions.

Conclusion: DOCI-QSCI方法显著扩大了量子微扰计算的轨道空间，结合后续的 AFQMC 处理，显著提高了计算结果的精确性。

Abstract: We propose doubly occupied configuration interaction-quantum selected configuration interaction (DOCI-QSCI), which samples from the seniority-zero space. While the use of this space effectively doubles the qubit budget, equaling the number of spatial orbitals, this sector restriction can compromise quantitative accuracy. To compensate for this, we expand sampled bitstrings via their Cartesian product into a larger space that includes seniority-breaking determinants. The resulting wave function is also proposed using the trial state in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) to recover dynamical correlations across the full orbital space (DOCI-QSCI-AFQMC). We evaluate the proposed methods on the H6 chain, N2 dissociation, and the addition of singlet O2 to a BODIPY dye. For the H6 chain, DOCI-QSCI-AFQMC reproduces the accuracy of the level of the complete-active-space counterpart with the quantum device ibm kobe. For N2 and BODIPY-O2, with (14e, 28o) and up to (20e, 20o) active spaces, it yields reasonable results, whereas single-reference CCSD(T) fails qualitatively. These results demonstrate that the DOCI-QSCI doubles the orbital space accessible to conventional QSCI and subsequent ph-AFQMC post-processing delivers reasonably high accuracy.

Abstract: Localized electron states induced by various disorders,including defects and impurities,usually exist in solids.Their optical properties,especially their luminescence properties,are of both scientific and technological significance.But a microscopic theory has not yet been established for such localized-state ensemble (LSE) luminescence.In this Letter,we attempt to fill this void via developing a quantum many-body (MB) luminescence theory taking into account both electron-phonon (e-p) and electron-electron (e-e) interactions.By using the developed MB-LSE theory,abnormal thermal behaviors such as redshift and subsequent blueshift of peak position,narrowing and succeeding broadening of linewidth,decline in intensity,and variation in lifetime can be quantitatively interpreted.The roles of electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions in the variable-temperature LSE luminescence are thus elucidated. Within the framework of the MB-LSE theory, moreover, Varshni's empirical formula for bandgap temperature dependence and Huang-Rhys factor for e-p coupling are further derived and discussed.

Abstract: A family of double-quantum excitation schemes is described for the solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of near-equivalent spin-1/2 pairs. These new methods exploit the spinor behaviour of 2-level systems, whose signature is the change of sign of a quantum state upon a $2π$ rotation. The spinor behaviour is used to manipulate the phases of single-quantum coherences, in order to prepare a double-quantum precursor state which is rapidly converted into double-quantum coherence by a straightforward $π/2$ rotation. One set of spinor-based methods exploits symmetry-based pulse sequences, while the other set exploits SLIC (spin-lock-induced crossing), in which the nutation frequency under a resonant radiofrequency field is matched to the spin-spin coupling. A variant of SLIC is introduced which is well-compensated for deviations in the radiofrequency field amplitude. The methods are demonstrated by performing double-quantum-filtered $^{19}$F NMR on a molecular system containing a pair of diastereotopic $^{19}$F nuclei. The new methods are compared with existing techniques.

Method: The authors propose a modified SLIC (compensated-SLIC, cSLIC) sequence that uses a repetitive sequence with two different radiofrequency field amplitudes in the repeated element. The method aims to compensate for deviations in the radiofrequency field amplitude without increasing the overall duration of the sequence.

Conclusion: This work presents a novel sensing scheme for weak anharmonicities using a three-mode anti-PT symmetric cavity-magnon-waveguide system, demonstrating good sensitivity and potential applications in various physical systems.

Abstract: We propose a scheme for enhanced sensing of weak anharmonicities based on a three-mode anti-parity-time (anti-PT) symmetric cavity-magnon-waveguide system. By tuning the optical gain to the active cavity mode, the linewidth suppression point for the anti-PT symmetric Hamiltonian can be flexibly controlled even when the two dissipative magnonic modes experience strong intrinsic decay. This essential characteristic is utilized for detecting weak nonlinearities in both the cavity and magnonic modes, with both demonstrating similar high levels of sensitivity. Moreover, the sensitivity can be greatly improved with a detuned laser drive. Based on the integrated passive-active three-mode anti-PT symmetric system, the sensing scheme can be generalized to various physical systems with anharmonicities.

Abstract: Discrete radio resource management problems in dense wireless networks are naturally cast as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) programs but are difficult to solve at scale. We investigate a quantum-classical approach based on the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA), which interleaves shallow QAOA layers with variable elimination guided by measured single- and two-qubit correlators. For interference-aware channel assignment, we give a compact QUBO/Ising formulation in which pairwise interference induces same-channel couplings and one-hot constraints are enforced via quadratic penalties (or, optionally, constraint-preserving mixers). Within RQAOA, fixing high-confidence variables or relations reduces the problem dimension, stabilizes training, and concentrates measurement effort on a shrinking instance that is solved exactly once below a cutoff. On simulated instances of modest size, including a four-user, four-channel example, the method consistently returns feasible assignments and, for the demonstrated case, attains the global optimum. These results indicate that recursion can mitigate parameter growth and feasibility issues that affect plain QAOA, and suggest a viable pathway for near-term quantum heuristics in wireless resource allocation.

Abstract: We report an implementation of spin-acoustic resonance in pentacene thin films integrated on a high-quality-factor (high-Q) surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator on a lithium niobate substrate. Heterogeneous optically detected spin-acoustic resonance (HODSAR) is an optically detected spin-resonance measurement in which the resonant drive is delivered mechanically by a surface acoustic wave (SAW). By leveraging the photo-excited triplet state of pentacene at room temperature, we demonstrate coherent spin manipulation via acoustic driving under zero externally applied magnetic field. The heterogeneously integrated device, referred to as HODSAR, utilizes spin-phonon coupling to achieve mechanically driven, zero-field spin resonance, opening avenues for room-temperature mechanically addressable spin control and device integration. We show that the high-Q multimode response of the SAW resonator enables spectrally selective acoustic addressing of triplet transitions near 105 MHz. Coherent control is evidenced by Rabi oscillations, with a Rabi frequency that increases linearly with the square root of the applied RF input power over the measured drive range, consistent with driven two-level dynamics under acoustic excitation. These results establish spin-acoustic resonance in a heterogeneously integrated molecular thin-film platform and provide a quantitative basis for benchmarking mechanically mediated spin control.

Motivation: Maintaining stable qubits is critical for quantum processors; understanding what causes instability helps design better systems.

Method: Engineered frequency-dependent relaxation spectroscopy and a new metric, T_1 Spectral Topography Fidelity.

Result: Qubit intrinsic parameters are stable, but external factors change drastically after thermal cycles; thermal cycling introduces noise equivalent to long-term cooling.

Conclusion: Recalibration strategies needed for large-scale quantum systems due to distinct noise per thermal cycle, despite preserved fabrication quality.

Abstract: The temporal stability and reproducibility of qubit parameters are critical for the long-term operation and maintenance of superconducting quantum processors. In this work, we present a comprehensive longitudinal characterization of 27 frequency-tunable transmon qubits spanning over one year across four thermal cycles. Our results establish a distinct hierarchy of stability for superconducting hardware. We find that the intrinsic device parameters determining the qubit frequency and the baseline energy relaxation times ($T_1$) exhibit high robustness against thermal stress, characterized by frequency deviations typically confined within 0.5\% and non-degraded coherence baselines. In stark contrast, the environmental variables, specifically the background magnetic flux offsets and the microscopic landscape of two-level system (TLS) defects, undergo a significant stochastic reconfiguration after each cycle. By employing frequency-dependent relaxation spectroscopy and a quantitative metric, the $T_1$ Spectral Topography Fidelity, we demonstrate that thermal cycling acts as a ``hard reset'' for the local defect environment. This process introduces a level of spectral randomization equivalent to thousands of hours of continuous low-temperature evolution. These findings confirm that while the fabrication quality is preserved, the specific noise realization is statistically distinct for each thermal cycle, necessitating automated recalibration strategies for large-scale quantum systems.

Abstract: A photoluminescence (PL) and magnetic resonance investigation of a defect in chlorine-implanted 4H-SiC is presented. This Cl-related center emits light at telecom wavelengths with zero-phonon lines in the range 1350-1540 nm. Its four configurations exhibit stable PL spectra characterized by narrow zero-phonon lines. For the two configurations that emit light at the C-band, a Debye-Waller factor in the range 22-25% is estimated. Optically detected magnetic resonance confirms that the Cl-related center is spin active and stable at room temperature with the zero-field splitting in the range of 1.0-1.4 GHz. The combined optical and spin properties suggest this center to be a highly promising candidate for scalable quantum networks.

Abstract: Cooling the center-of-mass (CM) motion of a macroscopic oscillator to its quantum ground state is a fundamental prerequisite for testing quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales. However, achieving this goal is currently hindered by the stringent requirement for an ultrahigh mechanical quality factor ($Q_c$). Here, we propose a dual-channel cooling scheme based on squeezing-enhanced quantum interference within a hybrid levitated cavity-magnomechanical system to overcome this limitation.
  By synergizing squeezing effects with quantum interference between the magnon-CM and cavity-CM channels, our scheme simultaneously suppresses Stokes (heating) scattering while enhancing anti-Stokes (cooling) scattering.~We demonstrate that this cooling mechanism reduces the critical $Q_c$ required for ground-state cooling by three orders of magnitude, making it achievable in the experimentally accessible regime of $Q_c \sim 10^4$. Furthermore, the net cooling rate is enhanced by nearly 180-fold compared to that of conventional single-channel cooling. This improvement is accompanied by a two orders of magnitude reduction in both the steady-state CM occupancy and the cooling time. Importantly, this enhanced performance remains robust even deep within the unresolved-sideband regime. Our results provide a feasible path toward preparing macroscopic quantum states by actively controlling the cooling dynamics, thereby relaxing the constraints on intrinsic material properties.

Abstract: In recent years, growing attention has been devoted to the possibility that theories with deformed symmetries, associated with certain models of non-commutative spacetime, may encode a fundamental form of decoherence. This effect should be described by a Lindblad-like evolution governed by the non-trivial Hopf algebra structure of the time-evolution generators. In this work we provide a detailed analysis of such possibility for similar Hopf algebra deformations of the Hamiltonian of a qubit. Starting from a critical examination of the very definition of time evolution through the generalized adjoint action, we explore whether a coherent and physically viable framework can be established. In particular, our analysis shows that a more general combination of adjoint actions always guarantees a von Neumann dynamics and, also in the case of deformed spacetime symmetries considered in the literature, a physically viable Lindblad evolution cannot be established.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum sensing, particularly using diamond NV centers, benefits from miniaturization and light control provided by optical fibers. However, spectral interference complicates signal accuracy, motivating this study.

Method: The study examines optical fiber spectra, considering material dependencies and physical factors, to evaluate fluorescence and scattering effects in relation to NV center signals.

Result: The research identifies specific fiber types with reduced spectral overlap, enhancing their utility for NV-based quantum sensing.

Conclusion: Selecting optical fibers with minimal fluorescence and scattering is crucial for improving the sensitivity of diamond NV center quantum sensors.

Abstract: Optical fibers are crucial for guiding light in various sensing applications. Especially for quantum sensors such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, they enable light control and device miniaturization. However, fluorescence and scattering within the fiber, often referred to as fiber background, autofluorescence, or autoluminescence, can overlap spectrally with the NV centers' fluorescence, degrading the signal-to-noise ratio and thus limiting sensor sensitivity. Here, we investigate the optical spectra of standard optical fibers, considering material dependencies, physical influences, and their fluorescence scaling with excitation power and wavelength. Our results identify spectral components and fiber types with minimal unwanted background signals, guiding the selection of optimal fibers for NV-based quantum sensing.

Abstract: We investigate operator growth in a Brownian spin Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model with random all-to-all interactions, focusing on the full operator-size distribution. For Hamiltonians containing interactions of order two up to $L$, we derive a closed master equation for the Pauli-string expansion coefficients and recast their dynamics into a generating-function formulation suitable for the large-$N$ limit. This approach allows us to diagonalize the leading-order evolution operator explicitly and obtain exact solutions for arbitrary initial operator distributions, including the effects of decoherence. Going beyond leading order, we develop a systematic $1/N$ expansion that captures higher-order corrections to the operator-size dynamics and the late-time behavior. Our results demonstrate that higher-order effects play a crucial role in operator scrambling and that the full operator-size distribution provides a more refined probe of quantum chaos in Brownian and open quantum systems.

Abstract: Erasure qubits reduce overhead in fault-tolerant quantum error correction (QEC) by converting dominant faults into detectable errors known as erasures. They have demonstrated notable improvements in thresholds and scaling in surface and Floquet code memories. In this work, we use erasure qubits on Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes from the quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) regime. Owing to their sparse structure and favorable rate-distance trade-offs, BB codes are practical candidates for QEC. We introduce BiBiEQ, a novel framework that compiles a given BB code into an erasure-aware memory circuit C_E. This erasure circuit C_E comprises erasure checks (ECs), resets, and erasures spread over a user-specified erasure check schedule (2EC, 4EC). BiBiEQ converts this erasure circuit C_E into the stabilizer circuit C for general-purpose decoding. BiBiEQ provides two engines for this conversion, BiBiEQ-Exact and BiBiEQ-Approx. BiBiEQ-Exact preserves the joint-erasure correlations and serves as our accuracy benchmark, while BiBiEQ-Approx uses an independence approximation to accelerate large sweeps and expose accuracy-throughput trade-offs. Using BiBiEQ, we decode the stabilizer circuits to get a per-round logical error rate (LER) for the BB codes and quantify the effect of the EC schedules on the correctable operating region below the pseudo-threshold. The 4EC schedule keeps the accuracy of both engines close to one another, making BiBiEQ-Approx a reliable proxy for BiBiEQ-Exact for faster sweeps. Below the pseudo-threshold, the code distance (d) hop from distance (d) 6 to 10 yields a drop in LER by 10-17x larger than distance (d) 10 to 12, showing that most gains are realized by d=10.

Abstract: A linear radio-frequency Paul trap is traditionally driven with one diagonal pair of electrodes grounded and the other connected to a high-voltage radio-frequency source. This method simplifies impedance matching of the voltage source to the trap. However, for several architectures it leads to increasing the axial micromotion amplitude, for example, when the capacitance between radio-frequency and end-cap electrodes is not negligible. Here, we present a technique to generate two high-voltage radio-frequency signals \SI{180}{\degree} out of phase to drive a linear Paul trap with opposite voltages between neighbouring electrodes. Using this, we have successfully trapped and cooled a chain of Ytterbium ions in a linear radio-frequency Paul trap.

Abstract: Multipartite entangled states of continuous variables are fundamental resources for scalable quantum information processing. We study the correlation hierarchy in a tripartite state engineered by mixing a two-mode squeezed vacuum with a coherent state on a tritter, a key linear optical element for multimode state generation. Using the covariance matrix formalism, we comprehensively analyze the entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering among the output modes. The strength of both correlations is governed solely by the squeezing parameter and is independent of the coherent amplitude. We further examine the impact of inevitable optical losses in various channel configurations. The results show that while losses degrade correlations, EPR steering remains monogamous and exhibits stricter resilience thresholds than entanglement. Our analysis, supported by parameter extension techniques, confirms that the steering condition is more stringent than the inseparability criterion, clearly demonstrating that steering forms a strict subset of entanglement. These results elucidate the correlation structure in a readily generated multimode state and offer practical insights for developing asymmetric quantum protocols, such as one-sided device-independent tasks, where EPR steering serves as a critical resource.

Abstract: When the photonic mode in the Jaynes-Cummings model is driven by an external classical field, the system can undergo the photon-blockade breakdown phase transition at a critical point. Such a phase transition has been detailedly investigated, but the critical properties of the eigenstates remain largely unexplored so far. We here study the geometric criticality associated with these eigenstates. The amplitude and phase of the drive serve as the control parameter of the governing Hamiltonian. We find the quantum metric and Berry curvature tensors for each eigenstate display divergent behaviors in the critical region. More importantly, the divergence associated with bright eigenstates is much more pronounced than that for the unique dark state. Our theoretical results can be experimentally confirmed in circuit quantum electrodynamics systems, where the driven Jaynes-Cummings model has been realized.

Abstract: Certifying high-dimensional quantum channels is essential for ensuring the reliability of quantum communication protocols. Existing certification schemes often rely on fully trusted internal devices, which is difficult to achieve in realistic scenarios. Here, we propose a semi-device-independent framework for certifying channel properties directly from observed statistics, assuming only that the system dimension is known. By explicitly incorporating the full set of structural constraints inherent to Choi states, our approach exploits the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism for rigorous certification of quantum channels. The entanglement dimensionality of quantum channels is first certified by introducing a witness and numerically determining its Schmidt-number-dependent bounds. This certification method reproduces known analytical benchmarks and is applied to dephasing and depolarizing noise channels, thereby confirming its validity. To provide a more complete assessment of channel performance, the entanglement fidelity of quantum channels is also certified using a hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations based on localizing matrices. Lower bounds on the entanglement fidelity are obtained that are compatible with either the full set of observed statistics or a single witness value.

Abstract: A systematic understanding of integrability breaking in translationally invariant spin chains with genuine three-site interactions remains lacking. In this work, we introduce and classify minimal nonintegrable spin-$1/2$ Hamiltonians, defined as models that saturate injectivity while admitting no nontrivial local conserved charges beyond the Hamiltonian. We first rigorously establish the nonintegrability of the deformed Fredkin spin chain with periodic boundary conditions by mapping it to a nearest-neighbor composite-spin representation and excluding all admissible $3$-local conserved charges. Guided by its structure, we then construct five classes of spin-$1/2$ models with genuine three-site interactions. One class is integrable, while the remaining four contain exactly two interaction terms and constitute the minimal nonintegrable three-site models. Our results delineate a sharp boundary between integrability and nonintegrability beyond the nearest-neighbor paradigm.

Abstract: While photoelectric detection of magnetic resonance (PDMR) can be applied to miniaturize nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center-based quantum sensors, the real demonstration of PDMR-based magnetic field sensing remains as a distinctive challenge. To tackle this challenge, in this article, we fabricate diamond samples with electrodes and microwave antenna on the surface, and realize PDMR by detecting photocurrent in nanoampere range via various lock-in amplifying modes. Importantly, we obtain a theoretical and experimental sensitivity 397 nT/Hz and 921 nT/Hz of magnetic field detection in DC-10 Hz range with a laser intensity and microwave frequency modulated mode, respectively, and demonstrate for the first time, a real-time tracking of alternating magnetic field with a standard deviation of 1.5 uT. Furthermore, we investigate systematically the dependence of the PDMR contrast, linewidth and the sensitivity on the laser and microwave power, and find a perfect agreement with a master equation based theoretical model, which accounts for not only the optically induced charge switch of neutral and negative NV centers, but also the interaction with microwave field.

Motivation: Understanding and utilizing the Schmidt decomposition of spatiotemporally entangled states, particularly those generated via SPDC, is crucial for advancing quantum imaging and spectroscopy. The challenge lies in the computational complexity of the Schmidt decomposition for high-dimensional states. This study aims to overcome this obstacle by leveraging the symmetry of the states.

Method: Rotational symmetry is exploited to reduce computational complexity in performing the Schmidt decomposition. The decomposition is carried out for spatiotemporally entangled states generated from SPDC, revealing the precise forms of the Schmidt modes and the Schmidt spectrum.

Result: The Schmidt decomposition reveals that the Schmidt modes exhibit a phase profile with a transverse spatial vortex structure, conferring each mode with orbital angular momentum across all frequencies. In the high-gain regime, the Schmidt modes broaden, and the Schmidt spectrum becomes narrower with increasing pump strength.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel approach for the Schmidt decomposition of high-dimensional spatiotemporally entangled states, with significant implications for quantum imaging and spectroscopy. The study paves the way for new applications utilizing entangled states produced via SPDC.

Abstract: The full Schmidt decomposition of spatiotemporally entangled states generated from spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) has not been carried out until now due to the immense computational complexity arising from the large dimensionalities of the states. In this Letter, we utilize the rotational symmetry of the states to reduce the complexity by at least four orders of magnitude and carry out the decomposition to reveal the precise forms of the spatiotemporal Schmidt modes and the Schmidt spectrum spanning over 10^4 modes. We show that the Schmidt modes have a phase profile with a transverse spatial vortex structure that endows them with orbital angular momentum at all frequencies. In the high-gain regime, these Schmidt modes broaden and the Schmidt spectrum narrows with increasing pump strength. Our work can spur novel applications at the intersection of quantum imaging and spectroscopy that utilize entangled states produced from SPDC.

Abstract: One examines the infinitely deep quantum cavity, also known as the quantum infinite square well, within the framework of the real Hilbert space. The solutions are considered in terms of complex wave functions, and also in terms of quaternionic wave functions. The complex results reproduce the usual achievements established in the complex Hilbert space, but also extend them to non-stationary solutions, as well as to distorted stationary solutions, different energy spectra, and dislocated observed position. The quaternionic cases further admit the incidence of self-interaction, something that cannot be observed in complex solutions. Therefore, both the complex and quaternionic solutions are more general than previous cases, thus opening the way to further one-dimensional solutions to be researched in the non-relativistic theory.

Abstract: Quantum gates are the essential block for quantum computer. High-dimensional quantum gates exhibit remarkable advantages over their two-dimensional counterparts for some quantum information processing tasks. Here we present a family of entanglement-based optical controlled-SWAP gates on $\mathbb{C}^{2}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}$. With the hybrid encoding, we encode the control qubits and target qudits in photonic polarization and spatial degrees of freedom, respectively. The circuit is constructed using only $(2+3d)$ ($d\geq 2$) linear optics, beating an earlier result of 14 linear optics with $d=2$. The circuit depth 5 is much lower than an earlier result of 11 with $d=2$. Besides, the fidelity of the presented circuit can reach 99.4\%, and it is higher than the previous counterpart with $d=2$. Our scheme are constructed in a deterministic way without any borrowed ancillary photons or measurement-induced nonlinearities. Moreover, our approach allows $d>2$.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study addresses the issue of verifying quantum resources when their state or process deviates significantly, leading to non-independent and non-identically distributed trials. It constructs a method for efficiently verifying performance using limited spot-checks on a sequence of potentially adversarially altered trials, ensuring asymptotic tightness of the confidence intervals derived.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification of quantum resources is fundamental for secure quantum communication and reliable quantum computation. This paper introduces a practical approach to handle scenarios where traditional assumptions of independent and identically distributed trials may not hold.

Method: The method proposed in the paper leverages statistical analysis and hypothesis testing applied to a limited number of spot-checked trials within a sequence of potentially non-i.i.d. trials. It derives asymptotically tight confidence bounds for the overall resource performance.

Result: The method demonstrated in the paper allows for efficient determination of the confidence intervals for resource performance with only a constant number of spot-checked trials, regardless of the total number of trials. As the number of trials grows, the average number of spot-checks required remains constant, ensuring the method's scalability.

Conclusion: The paper provides a novel framework for verifying quantum resources in challenging scenarios where trials are not i.i.d., offering a practical and scalable solution with rigorous theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In practical situations, the reliability of quantum resources can be compromised due to complex generation processes or adversarial manipulations during transmission. Consequently, the trials generated sequentially in an experiment may exhibit non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) behavior. This non-i.i.d. behavior can introduce security concerns and result in faulty estimates when performing information tasks such as quantum key distribution, self-testing, verifiable quantum computation, and resource allocation in quantum networks. To certify the performance of such tasks, one can make a random decision in each trial, either spot-checking some desired property or utilizing the quantum resource for the given task. However, a general method for certification with a sequence of non-i.i.d. spot-checking trials is still missing. Here, we develop such a method. This method not only works efficiently with a finite number of trials but also yields asymptotically tight certificates of performance. Our analysis shows that even as the total number of trials approaches infinity, only a constant number of trials needs to be spot-checked on average to certify the average performance of the remaining trials at a specified confidence level.

Abstract: We study the estimation of repeatedly nested expectations (RNEs) with a constant horizon (number of nestings) using quantum computing. We propose a quantum algorithm that achieves $\varepsilon$-error with cost $\tilde O(\varepsilon^{-1})$, up to logarithmic factors. Standard lower bounds show this scaling is essentially optimal, yielding an almost quadratic speedup over the best classical algorithm. Our results extend prior quantum speedups for single nested expectations to repeated nesting, and therefore cover a broader range of applications, including optimal stopping. This extension requires a new derandomized variant of the classical randomized Multilevel Monte Carlo (rMLMC) algorithm. Careful de-randomization is key to overcoming a variable-time issue that typically increases quantized versions of classical randomized algorithms.

We demonstrate the efficiency of the witnesses to detect genuine multipartite entanglement by applying it to families of paradigmatic quantum states, such as Dicke states, singlet states and W-like states. The detection is not only robust to noise, but also applies to mixed entangled states. Our findings open up possibilities for the detection of entanglement without local measurements in systems of multilevel emitters such as superconducting qubits, Rydberg atoms or quantum dots.

Abstract: Bosonic modes constitute a central resource in a wide range of quantum technologies, providing long-lived degrees of freedom for the storage, processing, and transduction of quantum information. Such modes naturally arise in platforms including circuit quantum electrodynamics, quantum acoustodynamics, and trapped-ion systems. In these architectures, coherent control and high-fidelity readout of the bosonic degrees of freedom are achieved via coupling to an auxiliary qubit. When operated in the strong dispersive regime, this interaction enables parity measurements of the mode which, in combination with phase-space displacements, constitute a standard experimental tool for full Wigner-function tomography. Here, we propose a protocol based on displaced parity measurements that allows for the preparation of a variety of bosonic quantum states. As a first example, we demonstrate the generation of squeezed states, achieving up to ~9 dB of squeezing after only three parity measurements, and show that the protocol is robust against experimental imperfections. Finally, we generalize our approach to the preparation of other paradigmatic bosonic states, including cat and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to optimize quantum circuits for teleportation, which is crucial for advancing quantum information processing tasks by reducing resource requirements and improving efficiency.

Method: The method involves designing quantum circuits based on different entangled channels (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger, two-qubit-cluster, three-qubit-cluster, Brown, Borras, and entanglement-swapping) and systematically optimizing the gate counts, costs, and depths to achieve the presented reductions.

Conclusion: The research conclusively shows that simplified and compressed quantum teleportation schemes can greatly reduce resource requirements and improve the fidelity of quantum information processing tasks, paving the way for more efficient quantum technologies.

Abstract: It is crucial to design quantum circuits as small as possible and as shallow as possible for quantum information processing tasks. We design quantum circuits with simplified gate-count, cost, and depth for implementing quantum teleportation among various entangled channels. Here the gate-count/cost/depth of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 10/6/8 to 9/4/6, the two-qubit-cluster-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 9/4/5 to 6/3/5, the three-qubit-cluster-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 12/6/7 to 8/4/5, the Brown-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 25/15/17 to 18/8/7, the Borras-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 36/25/20 to 15/8/11, and the entanglement-swapping-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 13/8/8 to 10/5/5. Note that, no feed-forward recover operation is required in the simplified schemes. Moreover, the experimentally demonstrations on IBM quantum computer indicate that our simplified and compressed schemes can be realized with good fidelity.

Abstract: Response functions are key observables for probing the structure and dynamics of many-body systems. We introduce and demonstrate a quantum-classical framework for computing response functions of general many-fermion systems that also provides the full bound-state spectrum. The framework employs the Lorentz integral transform and a new Hamiltonian input scheme that enables practical and scalable circuit constructions for general many-fermion Hamiltonians. Within this framework, we develop a hybrid strategy to evaluate the Lorentz integral and propose three protocols to extract response functions and bound-state structural information. As a demonstration, we apply the method to \({}^{19}\mathrm{O}\) with realistic internucleon interactions, computing both the bound-state spectrum and the response function. We envision that our approach will open new avenues for exploring the structure and dynamics of a broad class of many-body systems across diverse fields.

Conclusion: 该算法为量子增强信号处理提供了新工具，可应用于零穿越分析、带限噪声估计和特征提取等场景。

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for estimating the amplitude content of user-specified sequency bands in quantum-encoded signals. The method employs a sequency-ordered Quantum Walsh-Hadamard Transform (QWHT), a comparator-based oracle that coherently marks basis states within an arbitrary sequency range, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) to estimate the total probability mass in the selected band. This enables the detection of structured signal components, including both high- and low-sequency features, as well as the identification of rapid sign-change behavior associated with noise or anomalies. The proposed method can be embedded as a module within a larger quantum algorithm; in this setting, both the input and output remain fully quantum, enabling seamless integration with upstream and downstream quantum operations. We show that the sequency-ordered QWHT can be implemented with circuit depth $O(\log_2 N)$ (equivalently $O(n)$ for $N=2^n$) when acting on an amplitude-encoded quantum state, whereas computing the full Walsh-Hadamard spectrum of an explicit length-$N$ classical signal requires $O(N\log_2 N)$ operations via the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform. This results in an exponential quantum advantage when the QWHT is used as a modular block within a larger quantum algorithm, relative to classical fast Walsh-Hadamard transform-based approaches operating on explicit data. From an application perspective, the proposed sequency band-energy estimation may be interpreted as a structure-based anomaly indicator, enabling the detection of unexpected high-sequency components relative to a nominal low-sequency signal class. The algorithm is applicable to quantum-enhanced signal processing tasks such as zero-crossing analysis, band-limited noise estimation, and feature extraction in the Walsh basis.

Abstract: Linear optical quantum computation (LOQC) offers a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, but its scalability is fundamentally constrained by the probabilistic nature of non-local entangling gates. Qudit circuit compression schemes mitigate this issue by encoding multiple qubits onto qudits. However, these schemes become inefficient when only a subset of the encoded qubits is required to participate in the non-local entangling gate, leading to an exponential increase in the number of non-local gates. In this Letter, we address this bottleneck by demonstrating the existence of multi-level control-Z (CZ) gates for qudits encoded in multiple spatial modes in LOQC. Unlike conventional two-level CZ gates, which act only on a single pair of modes, multi-level CZ gates impart a conditional phase shift for an arbitrarily chosen subset of the spatial modes. We present two explicit linear optical schemes that realize such operations, illustrating a fundamental trade-off between prior information about the input quantum state and the physical resources required. The first scheme is realized with a constant success probability of $1/8$ independent of the qudit dimension using a single non-local entangling gate, at the cost of state dependence, which is significantly better than the current success probability of $1/9$. Our second scheme provides a fully state independent realization reducing the number of non-local gates to $\mathcal{O}(2^{r_1}+2^{r_2})$ as compared to the existing bound of $\mathcal{O}(2^{r_1+r_2})$ where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the number of qubits to be removed as control in the qudits. The success probability of the realization is $\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^{2^{r_1}+2^{r_2}}$. When combined with qudit circuit compression schemes, our results improve upon a key scalability limitation and significantly improve the efficiency of LOQC architectures.

Abstract: Using a finite geometric framework for studying the pentagon and heptagon codes we show that the concepts of quantum secret sharing and contextuality can be studied in a nice and unified manner. The basic idea is a careful study of the respective $2+3$ and $3+4$ tensorial factorizations of the elements of the stabilizer groups of these codes. It is demonstrated in detail how finite geometric structures entailing a specific three-qubit (resp. four-qubit) embedding of binary symplectic polar spaces of rank two (resp. three), corresponding to these factorizations, govern issues of contextuality and entanglement needed for a geometric understanding of quantum secret sharing. Using these results for the $(3,5)$ and $(4,7)$ threshold schemes explicit secret breaking protocols are derived. Our results hint at a novel geometric way of looking at contextual configurations.

Abstract: Grover's search algorithm is one of the basic building block in the world of quantum algorithms. Successfully applying it to combinatorial optimization problems is a subtle challenge. As a quadratic speedup is not enough to naively search an exponentially large space, the search has to be complemented with a state preparation routine which increases the amplitudes of promising states by exploiting the problem structure. In this paper, we build upon previous work by Baertschi and Eidenbenz to construct heuristic state preparation routines for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), mimicking the well-known classical Lin-Kernighan heuristic. With our heuristic, we aim to achieve a reasonable approximation ratio with only a polynomial number of Grover iterations. Further, we compare several algorithmic settings relating to termination criteria and the choice of Grover iterations when the number of marked solutions is unknown.

Motivation: The paper addresses an important open problem in mathematics and computer science by establishing that certain multiplicities lie in #BQP, unifying and extending prior work.

Method: The result is obtained using the Schur transform, which is applied multiple times. The local dimension is crucially accounted for by recent improvements.

Result: The paper proves that plethysm coefficients and a broad class of multiplicities are in #BQP, improving upon known results and providing a unified framework for previous findings.

Conclusion: This work advances our understanding of multiplicative complexity in representation theory and its applications in quantum information and complexity theory.

Abstract: Some representation-theoretic multiplicities, such as the Kostka and the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, admit a combinatorial interpretation that places their computation in the complexity class #P. Whether this holds more generally is considered an important open problem in mathematics and computer science, with relevance for geometric complexity theory and quantum information. Recent work has investigated the quantum complexity of particular multiplicities, such as the Kronecker coefficients and certain special cases of the plethysm coefficients.
  Here, we show that a broad class of representation-theoretic multiplicities is in #BQP. In particular, our result implies that the plethysm coefficients are in #BQP, which was only known in special cases. It also implies all known results on the quantum complexity of previously studied coefficients as special cases, unifying, simplifying, and extending prior work. We obtain our result by multiple applications of the Schur transform. Recent work has improved its dependence on the local dimension, which is crucial for our work. We further describe a general approach for showing that representation-theoretic multiplicities are in #BQP that captures our approach as well as the approaches of prior work. We complement the above by showing that the same multiplicities are also naturally in GapP and obtain polynomial-time classical algorithms when certain parameters are fixed.

Abstract: Noise forms a central obstacle to effective quantum information processing. Recent experimental advances have enabled the tailoring of noise properties through Pauli twirling, transforming arbitrary noise channels into Pauli channels. This underpins theoretical descriptions of fault-tolerant quantum computation and forms an essential tool in noise characterization and error mitigation. Pauli-Lindblad channels have been introduced to aptly parameterize quasi-local Pauli errors across a quantum register, excluding negative Pauli-Lindblad parameters relying on the Markovianity of the underlying noise processes. We point out that caution is required when parameterizing channels as Pauli-Lindblad channels with nonnegative parameters. For this, we study the effects of Pauli twirling on Markovianity. We use the notion of Markovianity of a channel (rather than that of an entire semigroup) and prove a general Pauli channel is non-Markovian if and only if at least one of its Pauli-Lindblad parameters is negative. Using this, we show that Markovian quantum channels often become non-Markovian after Pauli twirling. The Pauli-twirling induced non-Markovianity necessitates the use of negative Pauli-Lindblad parameters for a correct noise description in experimentally realistic scenarios. An important example is the implementation of the $\sqrt{X}$-gate under standard Markovian noise. As such, our results have direct implications for quantum error mitigation protocols that rely on accurate noise characterization.

Abstract: Bell inequalities reveal the fundamentally nonlocal character of quantum mechanics. In this regard, one of the interesting problems is to explore all possible Bell inequalities that demonstrate a gap between local and nonlocal quantum behaviour. This is useful for the geometric characterisation of the set of nonlocal correlations achievable within quantum theory. Moreover, it provides a systematic way to construct Bell inequalities that are tailored to specific quantum information processing tasks. This characterisation is well understood in the simplest $(2,2,2)$ scenario, namely two parties performing two binary outcome measurements. However, beyond this setting, relatively few Bell inequalities are known, and the situation becomes particularly scarce in scenarios involving a greater number of outcomes. Here, we consider the $(2,2,3)$ scenario, or two parties performing two three-outcome measurements, and characterise all Bell inequalities that can arise from the simplest sum-of-squares decomposition and are maximally violated by the maximally entangled state of local dimension three. We then utilise them to self-test this state, along with a class of three-outcome measurements.

Result: The findings offer guidance on observable selection, influencing quantum machine learning model development for multiclass tasks.

Conclusion: This work enhances understanding of multiclass quantum machine learning models, particularly in choosing effective observables for classification tasks.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have gained attention as early applications of quantum computers for learning tasks. In the context of supervised learning, most of the works that tackle classification problems with parameterized quantum circuits constrain their scope to the setting of binary classification or perform multiclass classification via ensembles of binary classifiers (strategies such as one versus rest). Those few works that propose native multiclass models, however, do not justify the choice of observables that perform the classification. This work studies two main classification criteria in multiclass quantum machine learning: maximizing the expected value of an observable representing a class or maximizing the fidelity of the encoded quantum state with a reference state representing a class. To compare both approaches, sets of Pauli strings and sets of projectors into the computational basis are chosen as observables in the quantum machine learning models. Observing the empirical behavior of each model type, the effect of different observable set choices on the performance of quantum machine learning models is analyzed in the context of Barren Plateaus and Neural Collapse. The results provide insights that may guide the design of future multiclass quantum machine learning models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a noise-tolerant framework for generating symmetric Dicke states in quantum systems using repeated interactions, addressing the central challenge of scaling and noise resistance in quantum technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum technologies rely heavily on scalable and noise-tolerant methods for generating entangled states, making the development of robust control protocols critical.

Method: The authors introduce an intelligent, constraint-aware control framework using excitation-preserving partial-SWAP collisions between qubit registers and shuttle qubits. They formulate the Dicke-state preparation as a closed-loop design problem, employing a two-parameter optimization with L-BFGS-B method to maximize fidelity under practical constraints.

Result: The proposed method successfully generates symmetric Dicke states with high fidelity even in imperfect collisional dynamics, including stochastic interaction dropouts and decoherence. The optimized controller exhibits resilience to noise, requiring only a limited increase in collision rounds when faced with errors.

Conclusion: This work advances the field of quantum control by providing a scalable and noise-tolerant framework for Dicke-state preparation, demonstrating practical applicability under realistic conditions.

Abstract: Designing scalable, noise-tolerant control protocols for multipartite entanglement is a central challenge for quantum technologies, and it naturally calls for \emph{algorithmic} synthesis of interaction parameters rather than handcrafted gate sequences. Here we introduce an intelligent, constraint-aware control framework for deterministic generation of symmetric Dicke states $|D_n^{(m)}\rangle$ in repeated-interaction (collision-model) architectures. The protocol employs excitation-preserving partial-SWAP collisions between two disjoint qubit registers, mediated by $m$ ancillary ``shuttle'' qubits, and poses Dicke-state preparation as a \emph{closed-loop design} problem: given the target $(n,m)$, automatically infer collision strengths that maximize fidelity under practical constraints. Concretely, we formulate a two-parameter, bound-constrained optimization over intra-register and shuttle--register collision angles and solve it using a multi-start strategy with L-BFGS-B, yielding a reproducible controller prescription (optimized $γ_{\mathrm{in}}$, $γ_{\mathrm{sh}}$, and minimal-round convergence points) for each target. This removes the need for projective measurements and extends collisional entanglement generation beyond the single-excitation (W-state) sector to arbitrary $m$. Crucially, we optimize \emph{within} imperfect collisional dynamics where errors act throughout the sequence, including stochastic interaction dropouts (missing collisions) and standard decoherence channels. Strikingly, across wide error ranges the optimized controller preserves high preparation fidelity; imperfections manifest primarily as a modest increase in the required number of collision rounds. This behavior reflects a tunable competition in which noise suppresses correlations while properly chosen collisions continuously replenish them, allowing the control algorithm to trade time for fidelity.

Abstract: The Rayleigh criterion is a widely known limit in the resolution of incoherent sources with classical measurements in the spatial domain. Unsurprisingly the estimation of the time delay between two weak incoherent signals is afflicted by an analogue problem. In this work, we show the emergence of two-photon quantum beats in the frequency domain from the interference at a beam splitter of a photon emitted by a reference source and one from the two incoherent weak signals. We demonstrate, based on this phenomena, that with a relatively low number of measurements of the frequencies of the interfering photons either bunching or antibunching at the beam splitter output one can achieve a precision amounting to half of the quantum limit, independently of both the temporal shape of the photonic wavepacket and the time delay to be estimated. The feasibility of the technique makes it applicable in astronomy, microscopy, remote clocks synchronization and radar ranging

### [81] [Representation theory of inhomogeneous Gaussian unitaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08611)
*Jingqi Sun,Joshua Combes,Lucas Hackl*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Gaussian unitaries are essential in quantum optics and continuous-variable computing, and their structures are linked to symplectic and orthogonal groups. However, their physical realizations introduce phase and sign ambiguities. Recent work has extended the understanding of inhomogeneous Gaussian unitaries, parameterized by \((M,z,Ψ)\), using the Baker-Campbel-Hausdorff formula to factor them into squeezing and displacement transformations. This provides a clearer group multiplication law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding Gaussian unitaries is critical for advancing quantum optics and continuous-variable quantum computing. The introduction of phase and sign ambiguities complicates the implementation of these unitaries, and resolving them is essential for realistic applications. The extension of the parameterization to inhomogeneous Gaussian unitaries represents a significant step forward in this goal. The use of the Baker-Campbel-Hausdorff formula to factor these unitaries into more manageable transformations provides a promising approach to simplifying their implementation and improving their utility in quantum technologies. This work could lead to more efficient and practical quantum optical devices and computing architectures.

Method: The authors employ the Baker-Campbel-Hausdorff (BCH) formula to factor any Gaussian unitary into a squeezing and a displacement transformation. This method leverages the algebraic properties of Gaussian operations to decompose complex unitaries into simpler, well-understood components. By establishing the group multiplication law, they provide a systematic framework for combining these transformations, which is essential for building up more intricate quantum optical circuits and algorithms.

Result: The authors present a novel parameterization for inhomogeneous Gaussian unitaries, generalizing the previously established framework for homogeneous cases. By applying the BCH formula, they demonstrate that any Gaussian unitary can be decomposed into squeezing and displacement transformations. This decomposition allows for the derivation of the group multiplication law, which facilitates the systematic construction of quantum optical operations. This result provides a solid theoretical foundation for implementing Gaussian unitaries, addressing phase and sign ambiguities, and advancing quantum optics and computing.

Conclusion: In this paper, the authors have extended the understanding of Gaussian unitaries by providing a comprehensive parameterization for inhomogeneous cases. Using the BCH formula, they have shown that any Gaussian unitary can be expressed as a composition of squeezing and displacement transformations. This breakthrough not only resolves theoretical ambiguities but also paves the way for practical applications in quantum optics and continuous-variable computing. Their work represents a significant advancement in the field of quantum information processing and opens new possibilities for the design and implementation of quantum optical devices and algorithms.

Abstract: Gaussian unitaries, generated by quadratic Hamiltonians, are fundamental in quantum optics and continuous-variable computing. Their structures correspond to symplectic (bosons) and orthogonal (fermions) groups, but physical realizations give rise to their respective double covers, introducing phase and sign ambiguities. The homogeneous (quadratic-only) case has been resolved through a parameterization constructed in a recent work [arXiv:2409.11628]. We extend the previous framework to inhomogeneous Gaussian unitaries parameterized by $(M,z,Ψ)$. The Baker-Campbel-Hausdorff formula allows us then to factor any Gaussian unitary into a squeezing and a displacement transformation, from which we derive the group multiplication law.

Abstract: Physics-informed (PI) methodologies have surged to become a pillar route to solve Differential Equations (DEs), sustained by the growth of machine learning methods in scientific contexts. The main proposition of PI is to minimise variationally a loss function, formally ensuring that a neural surrogate of the solution has the DE locally satisfied. The nature of such formulation encouraged the exploration of equivalent quantum algorithms, where the surrogate solution is expressed by variational quantum architectures. The locality of typical loss functions emphasises the DE to hold at an ensemble of points sampled in the domain, but encounters issues when generalising beyond such points, or when propagating boundary conditions. Issues which affect classical and quantum PI algorithms alike. The quest to fill this gap in robustness and accuracy against mainstream DE solvers has led to a plethora of proposals in various directions. In particular, classical DE solvers have long employed the weak form - an integral based approach aiming at imposing a global condition on the solution - prioritising a good average behaviour instead of ``overfitting'' select points. Here, we propose and explore to combine contributions from both local and global loss functions in PI routines, to exploit the advantages and mitigate the weaknesses of both. We showcase this intuition in a variety of problems focusing on differentiable quantum architectures, and demonstrating in particular how orchestrating such hybrid loss formulation with domain decomposition can offer a strong advantage over local-only strategies.

Abstract: Quantum synchronisation errors are a class of quantum errors that change the number of qubits in a quantum system. The classical error correction of synchronisation errors has been well-studied, including an insertion-deletion equivalence more than a half-century ago, but little progress has been made towards the quantum counterpart since the birth of quantum error correction. We address the longstanding problem of a quantum insertion-deletion equivalence on permutation-invariant codes, detailing the conditions under which such codes are $t$-insertion error-correctable. We extend these conditions to quantum insdel errors, formulating a more restrictive set of conditions under which permutation-invariant codes are $(t,s)$-insdel error-correctable. Our work resolves many of the outstanding questions regarding the quantum error correction of synchronisation errors.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose a heralded high-probability scheme to generate remote entanglement between moderate-cooperativity spin-cavity registers with high fidelity. In conventional single-shot interfaces, limited cooperativity restricts the spin-conditional optical response and thus strongly suppresses the success probability. Our proposal instead recycles a single incident photon for repeated interactions with the spin-cavity register, such that a small spin-conditional phase shift acquired on each round trip accumulates coherently to enable remote entanglement. Moreover, the repeated scheme enables higher spin-photon encoding efficiency by using a spectral-width-scaling photon pulse with a shorter duration. We show that, for realistic imperfections and losses, this repeated phase-encoding approach produces high-fidelity entangled states with an appreciable success probability even at cooperativity $C\sim1$. Our protocol is particularly well suited to weakly coupled, cavity-based solid-state spin platforms and provides a route toward hybrid, photon-loss-tolerant distributed quantum computing.

Result: Achieved high normalized brightness (10.3 kpairs/s/nm/mW²) on a 100 GHz channel pair and exceeds 96% fidelity/visibility across multiple wavelengths.

Conclusion: The Sagnac-based source is effective for plug-and-play quantum platforms, demonstrating practicality for future networks.

Abstract: A fully fibered source of entangled photon pairs based on a nonlinear Sagnac interferometer is reported. Operating at telecom wavelengths, the source relies exclusively on standard fiber-optic components and periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguides, resulting in a compact, robust, and field-deployable architecture. The generation stage supports both polarization and energy-time entanglement without modification, enabling versatile operation depending on the targeted application. Broadband spontaneous parametric down-conversion allows dense wavelength-division multiplexing over the telecom C and L bands. High normalized brightness (10.3 kpairs/s/nm/mW$^2$) is achieved on a standard 100 GHz ITU channel pair, together with high entanglement quality. Polarization and energy-time encodings are characterized through state tomography and two-photon interference measurements, yielding fidelities, purities, and visibilities exceeding 96 % over multiple wavelength channels. The stability and reproducibility of the source are further evaluated through long-duration operation in a network environment. These results demonstrate that the proposed Sagnac source constitutes a practical and scalable building block for future plug-and-play quantum communication and quantum networking platforms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of quantum circuits requires more flexible qubit connectivity, which is a significant challenge in superconducting qubits.

Method: Cavity-mediated coupling architecture using tunable qubit-cavity couplers allows dynamic reconfiguration of qubit interactions. High-fidelity gates (iSWAP and CZ) are demonstrated with low coherent errors, and the system supports four-qubit interactions with minimal crosstalk.

Result: Implementation of gates between non-adjacent qubits with high fidelity and low coherent errors, feasible scaling to larger systems.

Conclusion: This architecture provides a practical solution for enhancing qubit connectivity in future quantum processors.

Abstract: Superconducting qubits have achieved remarkable progress in gate fidelity and coherence, yet their typical nearest-neighbor connectivity presents constraints for implementing complex quantum circuits. Here, we introduce a cavity-mediated coupling architecture in which a shared cavity mode, accessed through tunable qubit-cavity couplers, enables dynamically reconfigurable interactions between non-adjacent qubits. By selectively activating the couplers, we demonstrate that high-fidelity iSWAP and CZ gates can be performed within 50 ns with simulated coherent error below $10^{-4}$, while residual $ZZ$ interaction during idling remains below a few kilohertz. Extending to a four-qubit system, we also simulate gates between every qubit pair by selectively enabling the couplers with low qubit crosstalk. This approach provides a practical route toward enhanced interaction flexibility in superconducting quantum processors and may serve as a useful building block for devices that benefit from selective non-local coupling.

Abstract: Designing high-fidelity quantum circuits remains challenging, and current paradigms often depend on heuristic, fixed-ansatz structures or rule-based compilers that can be suboptimal or lack generality. We introduce a neuro-symbolic framework that reframes quantum circuit design as a differentiable logic programming problem. Our model represents a scaffold of potential quantum gates and parameterized operations as a set of learnable, continuous ``truth values'' or ``switches,'' $s \in [0, 1]^N$. These switches are optimized via standard gradient descent to satisfy a user-defined set of differentiable, logical axioms (e.g., correctness, simplicity, robustness). We provide a theoretical formulation bridging continuous logic (via T-norms) and unitary evolution (via geodesic interpolation), while addressing the barren plateau problem through biased initialization. We illustrate the approach on tasks including discovery of a 4-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) from a scaffold of 21 candidate gates. We also report a hardware-aware adaptation experiment on the 133-qubit IBM Torino processor, where the method improved fidelity by 59.3 percentage points in a localized routing task while adapting to hardware failures.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that a dense frequency comb spectrum can enable simultaneous addressing of multiple resonators via frequency multiplexing and provides a framework for achieving effective spectroscopic coverage of a given frequency bandwidth.

Abstract: Coplanar waveguide resonators are central to the thriving field of circuit quantum electrodynamics. Recently, we have demonstrated the generation of a broadband microwave-frequency comb spectrum using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) driven by a time-dependent magnetic field. Here, the frequency comb is used to spectroscopically probe a bank of coplanar microwave resonators, inductively coupled to a common transmission line, a standard circuit with a variety of applications. We compare the resonator line shape obtained from signals synthesized at room temperature using conventional electronics with the radiation produced in the cryogenic environment by our source, showing substantial equivalence in the estimation of the resonator quality factors. To measure non-uniformly spaced resonant frequencies, we drive the generator with a bi-chromatic tone to generate intermodulation products. Such a dense frequency comb spectrum enables simultaneous addressing of a few resonators via frequency multiplexing. Finally, we discuss the criteria for achieving effective spectroscopic coverage of a given frequency bandwidth.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large-scale deployments of quantum key distribution in fiber and satellite networks, addressing challenges like transmission loss, noise, and finite key effects is crucial.

Method: Implemented a 1550 nm QKD system using efficient-BB84 protocol and iPOGNAC scheme with repetition rates of 1.5–3.3 GHz, QBER of ~0.4%, and tested on both laboratory and intermodal fiber-links.

Result: Achieved a sustained secret key rate (SKR) above 1 Mb/s and a secure key rate of 10 Mb/s at 5 dB losses, as well as 6.5 kb/s at 38.5 dB losses.

Conclusion: The system successfully demonstrated practical QKD with high performance, suitable for satellite and future space-based applications.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to exchange a secret key between two parties. Despite its promising features, QKD also faces several practical challenges such as transmission loss, noise in quantum channels and finite key size effects. Addressing these issues is crucial for the large-scale deployment of QKD in fiber and satellite networks.
  In this paper, we present a 1550 nm QKD system realizing the efficient-BB84 protocol and based on the iPOGNAC scheme. The system achieved repetition rates up to 1.5~GHz and showed an intrinsic QBER of $\sim 0.4\%$. The system was first tested on a laboratory fiber link and then on an intermodal link in the field, consisting of both deployed fiber and a 620 m free-space channel. The experiment was performed in daylight conditions, exploiting the Qubit4Sync synchronization protocol. With this trial, we achieved a new benchmark for free-space BB84 QKD systems by generating a sustained secret key rate (SKR) above 1~Mb/s for 1 hour. Finally, exploiting a recently discovered finite-size bound, we achieved a secure key rate of about 10 Mb/s at low losses (5 dB), and around 6.5~kb/s in the high-loss (38.5 dB), low block length ($N=10^4$) regime. The latter results demonstrate the system's suitability for highly lossy and time-constrained scenarios such as QKD from low Earth orbit satellites.

Abstract: Using polarization entangled photon pairs, we demonstrate a robust scheme for quantum illumination and ranging in a lossy environment. Entangled photon pairs are generated in a Sagnac interferometer configuration, yielding high-visibility two-photon polarization entanglement with a measured CHSH parameter of $S =2.802\pm0.002$. One of the photons from the entangled pair is retained as idler and the other one is directed into either of the two paths, namely reference and probe, of which probe is sent toward a distant object through a lossy free-space channel, and the reflected photons are collected after round-trip free-space propagation over distances approaching $1$ km. Remarkably, strong correlations are observed with CHSH values $S >2.6$ even when only a few tens of probe photons are returned, confirming the robustness of polarization entanglement under long-distance free-space propagation. This work reports the robustness of encoding photons in different basis before it is sent towards the object and recovery of polarization entanglement even after a kilometer-scale scattering from the objects, establishing a practical foundation for scalable quantum-assisted object detection and ranging.

Abstract: We propose a sensing scheme for detecting weak forces that achieves Heisenberg-limited sensitivity without relying on entanglement or other non-classical resources. Our scheme utilizes coherent averaging across a chain of N optomechanical cavities, unidirectionally coupled via a laser beam. As the beam passes through the cavities, it accumulates phase shifts induced by a common external force acting on the mechanical elements. Remarkably, this fully classical approach achieves the sensitivity scaling typically associated with quantum-enhanced protocols, providing a robust and experimentally feasible route to precision sensing. Potential applications range from high-sensitivity gravitational field measurements at the Large Hadron Collider to probing dark matter interactions and detecting gravitational waves. This work opens a new pathway for leveraging coherent light-matter interactions for force sensing.

Abstract: Quantum chemistry and materials science are among the most promising areas for demonstrating algorithmic quantum advantage and quantum utility due to their inherent quantum mechanical nature. Still, large-scale simulations of quantum circuits are essential for determining the problem size at which quantum solutions outperform classical methods. In this work, we present a novel hybrid simulation approach, forming a hybrid of a fullstate and a Clifford simulator, specifically designed to address the computational challenges associated with the time evolution of quantum chemistry Hamiltonians. Our method focuses on the efficient emulation of multi-qubit rotations, a critical component of Trotterized Hamiltonian evolution. By optimizing the representation and execution of multi-qubit operations leveraging the Pauli frame, our approach significantly reduces the computational cost of simulating quantum circuits, enabling more efficient simulations. Beyond its impact on chemistry applications, our emulation strategy has broad implications for any computational workload that relies heavily on multi-qubit rotations. By increasing the efficiency of quantum simulations, our method facilitates more accurate and cost-effective studies of complex quantum systems. We quantify the performance improvements and computational savings for this emulation strategy, and we obtain a speedup of a factor $\approx 18$ ($\approx 22$ with MPI) for our evaluated chemistry Hamiltonians with 24 qubits. Thus, we evaluate our integration of this emulation strategy into the Intel Quantum SDK, further bridging the gap between theoretical algorithm development and practical quantum software implementations.

Abstract: Quantum mechanical interaction potentials typically support either localized bound states below the dissociation threshold or delocalized scattering states above it. While bound states are energetically isolated, scattering states embed a quantum system in a continuum of environmental modes, making dissipation and loss intrisic features of open quantum systems. A striking exception are bound states in the continuum (BICs), which remain localized despite lying within the scattering continuum due to destructive interference. It was predicted that such states can arise from the interference of two Feshbach resonances coupled to a common continuum, yet this mechanism has remained experimentally inaccessible in genuine quantum systems. Here we demonstrate the formation of such an interference-stabilized state in ultracold collisions of ${}^6$Li atoms by coherently coupling two tunable Feshbach resonances using Floquet engineering. At a critical parameter point, both elastic and inelastic coupling to the continuum vanish, yielding a molecular state above the dissociation threshold. Loss spectroscopy, quench dynamics, and rf-photoassociation directly reveal the resulting decoupling from scattering states. Our observations are quantitatively captured by full coupled-channel calculations and a minimal non-Hermitian model, identifying a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC. Our results establish quantum interference as a powerful mechanism for controlling openness in quantum matter and for engineering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum interference and disorder effects in three-dimensional systems, particularly in metallic and insulating states, is fundamental. This paper seeks experimental confirmation of the Anderson transition and its critical properties.

Method: The researchers use an energy-resolved scheme to prepare matter waves with a narrow energy distribution and track their expansion over long periods to observe the Anderson transition.

Result: The results align well with numerical predictions, providing a precise measurement of the mobility edge across various disorder strengths and resolving previous discrepancies.

Conclusion: The experiment validates the theoretical framework for the Anderson transition, opening new avenues for studying quantum critical phenomena in disordered systems.

Abstract: Anderson localization of particles -- the complete halt of wave transport through multiple scattering and phase coherence -- is a paradigmatic manifestation of quantum interference in disordered media. In three dimensions, the scaling theory predicts a quantum phase transition at a critical energy, the mobility edge, separating localized from diffusive states and underpinning metal-insulator transitions in electronic systems. Despite decades of experimental efforts, a direct observation of this emblematic transition for matter waves has remained elusive. Previous attempts with ultracold atoms were hindered by strong and uncontrolled energy broadening, resulting in indirect, sometimes inaccurate, and model-dependent estimates of the mobility edge. Here we implement a novel energy-resolved scheme to prepare atomic matter waves with a narrow energy distribution and track their expansion dynamics over long timescales. This allows for a direct observation of the three-dimensional Anderson transition in a laser-speckle disordered potential, and for a precise measurement of the mobility edge that is independent of any underlying theoretical modeling. Our measurements show excellent agreement with state-of-the-art numerical predictions over a wide range of disorder strengths, resolving long-standing discrepancies between prior experiments and theory. Beyond the three-dimensional Anderson transition, our approach opens new avenues for quantitative investigations of quantum critical phenomena in spatially disordered systems, including the roles of dimensionality, symmetry class, and interactions.

Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of an attractively interacting impurity suddenly immersed with a nonzero initial velocity into a system of one-dimensional weakly interacting homogeneous bosons. We uncover and characterize different dynamical regimes in the parameter space. Especially interesting is the relaxation of a fast impurity with a mass close to or exceeding the critical one, where the impurity exhibits undamped temporal long-lived velocity oscillations before reaching a stationary state. The underlying mechanism is the transient localization of a boson depletion cloud near the impurity, that oscillates around the boson density peak situated at the impurity position. The lifetime of this entangled oscillating state increases with the absolute value of the impurity-boson coupling. Cold atomic gases provide an ideal playground where this phenomenon can be probed.

### [98] [Particle Mechanics from Local Energy Conservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07577)
*Thomas Oikonomou*

Main category: physics.class-ph

TL;DR: A new formulation of particle mechanics derives the functional relation between force and kinetic energy directly from energy conservation without assuming specific kinetic-energy or momentum-velocity relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reformulate classical mechanics by deriving force laws from energy conservation, potentially offering a new foundational approach.

Method: The authors start with the condition that the time rate of change of kinetic energy (dE/dt) is zero, then derive generalized force laws without assuming specific forms for kinetic energy or momentum-velocity relations.

Result: The inertial response decomposes into two components: one parallel to acceleration (changing kinetic energy) and one transverse (preserving energy). The paper also discusses constraints from rotational equivariance, the relativity principle, and symmetry considerations for different inertial frames.

Conclusion: The framework unifies conservative and non-conservative dynamics and clarifies when energy-based or variational formulations are equivalent. Newtonian and relativistic mechanics emerge as symmetry-selected instances of this common structure.

Abstract: We develop a formulation of particle mechanics in which the functional relation between force and kinetic energy is derived directly from local conservation mechanical energy $E$, rather than postulated through Newton's second law or a variational principle. Starting from the instantaneous condition $\dot{E}=0$, imposed as a pointwise constraint along a particle trajectory, we obtain a generalized force law that does not assume a specific kinetic-energy function, momentum-velocity relation, or equation of motion. The resulting inertial response naturally decomposes into a component parallel to the acceleration, responsible for changes in kinetic energy, and a transverse component that preserves energy while altering the direction of motion. Imposing rotational equivariance constrains the geometric structure of the force law, while the relativity principle between inertial reference frames further restricts its admissible realizations. In strictly one-dimensional motion, inertial-frame equivalence implies invariance of the total force under inertial boosts; together with local energy conservation, this uniquely fixes the functional form of kinetic energy and momentum. Galilean invariance selects the Newtonian expressions, whereas Lorentz invariance yields the relativistic ones. The framework unifies conservative and non-conservative (yet non-dissipative) dynamics at the single-particle level and clarifies the precise conditions under which energy-based and variational formulations of mechanics are dynamically equivalent. Newtonian and relativistic mechanics thus emerge as symmetry-selected realizations of a common energy-conserving force-energy structure.

Abstract: We discuss the classical elliptic Toda chain introduced by Krichever and the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda chain introduced by Adler, Shabat and Suris. It is shown that these models can be obtained as particular cases of the elliptic Ruijsenaars chain. We explain how the classical $r$-matrix structures are derived for these chains. Also, as a by-product, we prove that the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda chain is gauge equivalent to discrete Landau-Lifshitz model of XYZ type. The elliptic Toda chain is also gauge equivalent to XYZ chain with special values of the Casimir functions at each site.

Abstract: Optical transmission spectra of YAl3(BO3)4 crystals doped with the Pr3+ ions in concentrations 1 and 2.5 at. % were studied by high-resolution (up to 0.05 cm-1) Fourier spectroscopy, including in magnetic field parallel to the trigonal c axis of the crystal. The g factors of several crystal-field doublets of Pr3+ were determined. The crystal-field calculations performed using the exchange-charge model and high-resolution spectroscopy data allowed us to obtain a physically reasonable set of crystal-field parameters. The observed splitting of a number of doublets in zero magnetic field is explained by the presence of random lattice deformations. Simulation of the profiles of observed deformational doublets was carried out taking into account both hyperfine and electron-deformation interactions. The width of the distribution function of random strains was estimated. The main sources of random strains in YAl3(BO3)4:Pr3+ crystals are discussed.

Result:  successfully designed and tested 3-mode and 10-mode mode sorters, highlighting the potential for scalable and precise optical systems.

Conclusion: this paves the way for scalable and robust MPLC technologies, facilitating future developments in quantum and classical photonics.

Abstract: Multi-plane light converters (MPLCs) are an emerging 3D beam shaping technology capable of deterministically mapping a basis of input spatial light modes to a new basis of output modes. The ability to perform such spatial reformatting operations has many future applications in both classical and quantum photonics, spanning from optical communications to photonic computing and imaging. MPLCs are intricate optical systems consisting of a cascade of inverse-designed diffractive optical elements, typically separated by free-space. In this work we investigate the fabrication of miniaturised fully-encapsulated transmissive MPLCs within a glass chip using single-step direct laser writing. Our approach relies on the formation of femto-second laser induced birefringent nanogratings with a spatially controllable fast axis orientation. The glass chip is internally patterned with layers of these nanogratings to create multiple geometric phase holograms which imprint controllable phase patterns onto circularly polarised light propagating through them. We experimentally demonstrate two proof-of-concept glass-embedded 700x700x2000 micrometer cubed MPLCs: a 3-mode and a 10-mode Hermite-Gaussian mode sorter. We discuss the fabrication challenges and future improvements of these devices. Our work plots a path towards the rapid prototyping of robust monolithic MPLC technology.

Abstract: Broadband and high-resolution spectroscopy in the visible and ultraviolet is central to advances in multiple fields, including fundamental quantum physics, biology, atmospheric science and astronomy. Traditionally, these measurements are performed with grating or Fourier-transform spectrometers using incoherent light sources. Leveraging coherent light enables powerful frequency-comb-based techniques, but is limited by the technical complexity of efficiently generating broad spectral bandwidths from relatively narrowband and spectrally distant laser sources. Current visible dual-comb spectrometers require implicit compromises between optical bandwidth, experimental simplicity, and acquisition speed. In this work, we introduce a simple and efficient dual-comb spectrometer that converts robust Er:fiber frequency combs from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet and visible with thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) nanophotonic waveguides. Using real-time signal processing, we retrieve coherently averaged dual-comb spectra over nearly 120 THz of simultaneous bandwidth in the visible with 100 MHz spectral resolution. With these capabilities, we measure the broadband absorption spectrum of molecular iodine (I2), demonstrating the broadest visible spectral coverage of a dual-comb spectrometer to date. Additional measurements of NO2, atomic rubidium, and atomic sodium further illustrate the achievable combination of spectroscopic bandwidth, resolution, and intrinsic frequency accuracy. Our results demonstrate the powerful integration of low-power frequency combs, nonlinear nanophotonics, and digital signal processing to enable a compact, efficient and versatile approach to high-resolution mapping of complex absorption spectra across 500 THz in the UV-visible and near-infrared spectral regions for multiple applications beyond the research lab

Abstract: Deploying fibrous membranes for passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) on large and irregular surfaces is highly desirable but remains challenging, owing to the slow deposition rates and the need for electrically conductive substrates in conventional electrospinning. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput in-situ strategy for fabricating nanocomposite PDRC fibrous membranes via solution blow spinning. This method achieves deposition rates 8-12 times faster than electrospinning and can be applied directly onto nonplanar, nonconductive objects. The resulting membranes, composed of styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) fibers embedded with Y2O3 nanoparticles, achieve sub-ambient cooling of up to 7.0 °C outdoors, effectively delaying ice melting. Moreover, they are fully recyclable through simple cleaning, dissolution, and reprocessing. This scalable and sustainable fabrication route provides a versatile and practical platform for integrating PDRC fibrous membranes across diverse surfaces, paving the way toward real-world thermal management applications.

Result: 我们的THz梳具有0.05-4 THz的宽谱覆盖、0.3 Hz的梳波线宽（频谱分析极限），以及1秒内8.6×10^-14的频率稳定性。在延迟时域光谱学中，我们实现了每50 MHz分辨率的约36,000梳波线。

Conclusion: 我们的THz梳通过其宽谱覆盖、低线宽和频率可调性能，成为高分辨率分子光谱分析和精准THz度量的理想工具。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) frequency combs are increasingly essential for spectroscopy, metrology, and quantum science. However, generating a dense array of evenly spaced ultra-narrow THz comb lines is challenging. Here, we demonstrate broadband THz comb generation using a photoconductive antenna that transfers a noise-suppressed near-infrared electro-optical (EO) comb into the THz domain. Our noise-suppression strategy, leveraging soliton self-frequency shift and spectral filtering, effectively suppresses EO comb phase noise without requiring active stabilization. The resulting THz comb exhibits broad spectral coverage (0.05-4 THz), narrow comb linewidths (0.3 Hz at the Fourier-transform limit), and excellent frequency stability (8.6*10^-14 at 1-second integration). We further demonstrate asynchronous THz time-domain spectroscopy, resolving ~36,000 comb lines with 50 MHz spacing. Crucially, the inherent frequency agility of the EO comb enables rapid and wide-range tuning of the THz comb line spacing. These attributes position our THz comb as a versatile tool for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy and precision THz metrology.

Conclusion: 饱和非线性导致孤立波周期增加，理论与数值结果一致。

Abstract: We study theoretically the spatial evolution of optical beams inside a graded-index fiber exhibiting saturable nonlinearity. Utilizing an approach based on the variational principle, we identify the existence of bistable spatial solitons inside such a nonlinear medium, whose stability, analyzed through a linear stability analysis, is due to the saturating nature of the nonlinearity. Spatial solitons adhere to a specific amplitude-width relationship. Any deviation from this relationship leads to oscillating-type solutions with a period that increases with saturation level of the nonlinearity. Theoretically calculated values of this period agree well with numerical findings.

Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated the ability to manipulate nonlinear interactions via time modulation, giving rise to the so-called stroboscopic nonlinearity.

In this work, we elucidate the physical mechanism underlying stroboscopic nonlinear dynamics and establish an effective time-independent model under suitable modulation conditions. The proposed model almost exactly reproduces the full time-dependent dynamics in the quasi-steady state and significantly outperforms empirical descriptions used previously. Our results provide a clear physical picture of stroboscopic nonlinear dynamics and establish a general framework for engineering nonlinear interactions through temporal modulation.

Abstract: Short THz pulses are highly attractive both for fundamental research and practical applications in this underdeveloped region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Abstract: Optical frequency combs have revolutionized high-precision spectroscopy, yet an intrinsic trade-off between spectroscopic signal-to-noise ratio (sSNR) and measurement bandwidth ($B$) fundamentally constrains sensitive, broadband measurements. While broadband swept lasers offer a potential solution, generating broadband, ultrafast and linearly sweeping lasers with a narrow linewidth remains a significant challenge, particularly in the fingerprint mid-infrared (mid-IR) band. Here we overcome this limitation by using a microresonator-anchored ultrafast sweeping Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) laser for mid-IR spectroscopy. We introduce a dual-microresonator-anchor approach: a microcomb provides frequency calibration and a high-Q microresonator resolves the instantaneous FDML lasing lineshape. The strategy enables accurate correction of the FDML laser's sweep nonlinearity and broad linewidth in the near-IR, allowing the FDML laser to function as a high-fidelity mid-IR light via difference frequency generation. The system achieves a record sSNR$\times$$B$ of 1.3$\times$10$^5$ THz$\cdot \sqrt{\rm Hz}$ and methane sensing precision of 9 ppb$\cdot$m$\cdot$$\sqrt{\rm s}$, while retaining GHz resolution to distinguish methane isotope. We further demonstrate broadband, coherent swept laser phase spectroscopy in the mid-IR, tolerating losses up to 78 dB. This work leverages advances in integrated photonics to overcome the fundamental limitations of precision spectroscopy, paving the way for next-generation, broadband, and ultra-sensitive mid-IR spectroscopic sensing systems.

By correlating 2P microscopy-derived structural metrics with systematic variations in poling conditions, we establish a scalable, image-driven approach for evaluating and improving PPLN fabrication. The resulting workflow supports wafer-level process development and accelerates the manufacturing and packaging of lithium niobate photonic integrated circuits (PICs).

Abstract: Time-varying metamaterials and photonic time crystals offer a powerful route to wave amplification through temporal modulation of material parameters. Here, we experimentally demonstrate amplified up-conversion of free-space electromagnetic waves in the microwave regime, with conversion efficiency exceeding the limits imposed by the Manley-Rowe relations as a result of a cascaded amplification process. Using a time-varying metasurface composed of an array of varactor-loaded coupled split-ring resonators, we investigate parametric amplification, frequency up-conversion and wave generation. Direct measurements in both non-degenerate and degenerate regimes show that the Manley-Rowe limits can be surpassed near integer multiples of the incident wave frequency when the pump frequency is approximately twice that of the incident wave. These results establish time-varying metasurfaces as an efficient platform for amplification, generation, and frequency conversion of electromagnetic waves in the microwave and terahertz bands, with potential extension to optical frequencies via ultrafast modulation techniques.

Abstract: Optical vector beam generation based on the superposition technique [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107(5), 053601 (2011)] has attracted significant interest in both fundamental and applied optics due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. In this approach, the superposed modes exist in orthogonal polarization states and therefore do not interfere with each other. When optical gadgets are employed for characterization, the corresponding polarization distribution can be observed. In this work, we report that the characteristic (non-uniform) polarization distribution of vector beams is not inherently present in their field distribution. Instead, the observed polarization features arise during characterization as a consequence of the geometric phase difference introduced between the superposed modes by the optical gadgets. This analysis opens a new direction in the understanding of various classes of vector beams and offers potential advances in the field of structured beam optics.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by emphasizing the potential of 1D topological photonics for future advancements in photonic technologies.

Abstract: Over the past decade, topological photonics has emerged as a vibrant field, attracting significant attention and witnessing remarkable advancements. This growth can be attributed to its fundamental appeal and the unique opportunities it offers for unconventional control of light, promising innovations in next-generation photonic devices. At the heart of topological photonics lies the one-dimensional (1D) SSH model. Originally conceived to elucidate the physics of a molecular chain of polyacetylene, this model has found widespread applications in exploring a wide range of topological phenomena in photonics and beyond. In this chapter, we aim to provide an overview of topological photonics in one-dimensional (1D) settings. After briefly introducing paradigmatic 1D models, including the SSH, Rice-Mele, and AAH models, we review recent advances in experimental studies and applications of topological photonics based on 1D platforms. Our discussion highlights demonstrated examples, such as the nonlinear tuning of topological states in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian photonic SSH lattices, as well as nonlinear harmonic generation and topological lasing in SSH-type photonic microstructures. We further discuss characteristic topological phenomena in other representative 1D settings, including Floquet systems, topological pumping, quasicrystals, and synthetic non-Hermitian systems. Finally, we examine selected examples of two-dimensional (2D) photonic topological crystalline insulators that are closely linked to the SSH model. Towards the end, we summarize the chapter and provide a list of key contributions, together with an outlook on possible future directions in 1D topological photonics. While this review focuses specifically on 1D topological photonics, it is not intended to be comprehensive or exhaustive.

### [115] [Brillouin Spectroscopy Reveals Mechanical Properties Beyond Hydration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08150)

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of Brillouin light scattering (BLS) to measure micromechanical properties of cells and extracellular matrices in mechanobiology. While BLS provides high-resolution data on the GHz-frequency longitudinal modulus, interpreting the results in biological tissues is challenging due to water dynamics and differences in biomechanical interpretations compared to standard shear rheology. The study shows that longitudinal viscosity includes bulk viscosity, a contribution often overlooked. By testing various hydrogel systems and solvent mixtures, the researchers demonstrated that the BLS shift correlates with both the mechanical response and water content, but not monotonically. They also found that bulk viscous dissipation significantly influences the BLS response. Their findings provide a mechanical framework for interpreting BLS spectra in hydrated biological systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanical properties of cells and extracellular matrices is crucial for advancing mechanobiology. However, interpreting data from traditional methods like shear rheology is complex, especially in biological systems. The Brillouin light scattering method offers a noncontact, high-resolution alternative, making it a valuable tool for this field. This paper aims to address the challenges in interpreting Brillouin spectra specifically for biological tissues.

Method: The study employed various hydrogel systems and solvent mixtures to test the BLS method. They varied gelatin concentrations and measured ethanol water mixtures to analyze how the Brillouin shift correlates with water content and mechanical response. By comparing longitudinal, bulk, and shear viscosities, they assessed the role of bulk viscous dissipation in the BLS response.

Result: The key findings are that the BLS shift is influenced by both mechanical response and water content, but not monotonically. The longitudinal viscosity includes a significant contribution from bulk viscosity. Testing different hydrogel systems and solvent mixtures demonstrated that BLS spectra are modulated but not dominated by hydration. The measured viscosities help clarify the relationship between the BLS shift and the mechanical properties of hydrated systems.

Conclusion: This study establishes a reliable mechanical framework for interpreting BLS spectra in hydrated biochemical systems. By accounting for both mechanical response and bulk viscosity, the framework enhances the application of BLS in mechanobiology research. Future work should continue to improve the interpretation of BLS data to better understand cell behavior and ECM mechanics.

Abstract: Characterizing the micromechanical properties of cells and extracellular matrices is critical in mechanobiology. To meet this need, Brillouin light scattering (BLS) has emerged as a noncontact, high-resolution elastography tool that probes the GHz-frequency longitudinal modulus of materials. This longitudinal modulus reflects both elastic and viscous behavior at microscopic scales. However, interpreting Brillouin spectra in biological specimens is challenging: in highly hydrated samples the Brillouin shift is dominated by water dynamics, and the GHz longitudinal modulus does not directly equate to conventional low-frequency stiffness measures (e.g. Young's or shear moduli). Debates remain about how hydration and polymer relaxation influence the Brillouin signal, and how to relate it to macroscopic biomechanics. In particular, the longitudinal viscosity measured by Brillouin scattering includes a contribution from bulk viscosity, which is absent in standard shear rheology and often overlooked. To address these issues, we used different hydrogel systems and solvent mixtures to show Brillouin spectra are modulated but not dominated by hydration. By varying gelatin concentration, we demonstrated that Brillouin shifts can either positively or negatively correlate with water content, depending on the underlying mechanical response. Measurements on ethanol water mixtures further clarify this behavior. Although the Brillouin shift varies strongly with composition, it does not follow water content monotonically and instead reflects changes in the mixture's mechanical properties. By comparing longitudinal, bulk, and shear viscosities, we also showed that bulk viscous dissipation plays a significant role in the Brillouin response. These results established a mechanical framework for interpreting Brillouin spectrum in hydrated and biomolecular systems.

Abstract: Development of quantum light sources and search for quantum systems capable of supporting collective many-body states are crucial for further progress of modern quantum technologies. Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for quantum light sources, as individual QDs are reliable single photon emitters even at room temperature. However, photon bunching, a key signature of collective many-body states, has been so far largely observed at cryogenic temperatures in perovskite materials, limiting their applications under ambient conditions. Here, we report the observation of collective blinking and photon bunching in perovskite QD superlattices at room temperature. Sub-wavelength-sized (100 - 500 nm) CsPbBr3 QD superlattices, fabricated via a self-assembly process, exhibit an unusual two-level blinking behavior similar to that of single QDs, and demonstrate photon bunching with a degree of up to 2.75. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements and super-resolution imaging reveal that the superlattices have a significantly longer PL lifetime than individual QDs and that their emission is spatially confined to regions tens of nanometers in size. These observations suggest long-range exciton migration to a localized energy trap within the superlattice. Excitation power dependent degree of bunching and analysis of the bunching dynamics indicate that the photon bunching originates from exciton-biexciton cascade emission, a key mechanism for generating entangled photons. These findings establish perovskite QD superlattices as a promising platform for room-temperature collective optical phenomena and quantum light generation, advancing scalable quantum photonic technologies.

Abstract: Optical I/O technologies have emerged as a potential industrial solution for high-performance data interconnection in AI/ML computing acceleration. While optical I/Os are deployed at the edge of computational chips by co-packaged optics (CPO), flexible and high-performance integration architectures need to be explored to address system-level challenges. In this work, we present and experimentally demonstrate a SiON/Si-based optical interposer that integrates high-bandwidth and energy-efficient optical I/O chipsets. High-performance photonic and electronic components are co-packaged on the interposer, leading to low-loss, signal-integrity-friendly, and thermally efficient characteristics. The optical interposer incorporates low-loss SiON photonic circuits to realize scalable waveguide routing and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) with polarization-insensitive operation and high fabrication tolerance, while supporting flip-chip integration with InP-based active devices, including electro-absorption modulated lasers (EMLs) and photodetectors (PDs). Based on this architecture, a 400-Gb/s single-fiber optical transceiver is implemented and experimentally evaluated. Clear eye diagrams and high receiver sensitivity demonstrate reliable high-speed data transmission, which offers scalable, high-bandwidth optical I/Os in future high-performance computational clusters.

Abstract: Twisted photonic lattices that form moiré superlattices have attracted significant attention owing to their unique properties, such as strong field confinement and high-quality factors, in which the localized optical modes can serve as efficient light sources. However, in conventional moiré lattices, the emission direction of confined modes is typically fixed, and achieving a broad range of emission angles through simple modulation remains a significant challenge. Here, we design and fabricate single-layer moiré photonic lattices into cylindrical geometries using a nanomembrane origami technique. This approach enables wide-angle localized-mode emission while maintaining stable single-mode operation and excellent spectral uniformity. The moiré supercells support localized flat-band modes under various effective twist angles, resulting in the observation of periodic localized-mode emission over a wide range of azimuthal angles. Our research provides an approach for developing moiré light sources on curved surfaces, offering significant potential in applications that demand spatial light control, including three dimensional imaging, light detection and ranging, and topological states manipulation.

Abstract: The prediction of electromagnetic spectra for MXene-based solar absorbers is a computationally intensive task, traditionally addressed using full-wave solvers. This study introduces an efficient deep learning framework incorporating transfer learning, multi-channel spectral refinement (MCSR), and Savitzky-Golay smoothing to accelerate and enhance spectral prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Projecting images onto non-planar surfaces inevitably introduces geometric distortions that degrade visual quality. Traditional correction methods often require tedious manual calibration or structured light sequences to establish pixel-wise correspondences. In this paper, we develop the Curved Surface Projection Rectification Network (CSPR-Net), a self-supervised deep learning framework for automated distortion correction. Our approach employs dual coordinate-based neural networks to learn the bi-directional mapping between the projector and camera spaces. By enforcing a robust cycle-consistency constraint, CSPR-Net autonomously resolves complex geometric transformations without requiring ground-truth deformation fields. Furthermore, a gradient-based loss function is introduced to mitigate the impact of complex ambient light interference and accurately capture high-frequency geometric variations. Quantitative evaluations in physical experimental scenarios demonstrate that CSPR-Net achieves a 20.7% improvement in end-to-end fidelity (SSIM) and outperforms the polynomial baseline by 3.8% and 5.4% in forward and inverse mapping in terms of SSIM respectively, effectively generating high-precision pre-warped images for seamless projection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: exploring nonlinear phenomena in multicore fibers for applications in telecommunications, sensing, and imaging.

Method: used sub-nanosecond transform-limited pulses in a 7-core fiber and performed theoretical modeling to explain observed phenomena.

Result: equalized output power between cores with reduced fluctuations at high input power, achieved in ~5m for cut-back experiments, and observed bell-shaped far-field profile.

Conclusion: beam stirring effects are amenable to control with high power enabling stable beam distributions in multicore fibers, opening up possibilities for applications.

Abstract: Multicore fibers (MCF) are perspective media for telecommunications, sensing, imaging and laser technologies. Here, the effect of beam stirring between weakly coupled cores is observed for sub-nanosecond transform-limited pulses of several kW peak power propagating in ~10 m long 7-core fiber, for the first time to our knowledge. In contrast to low-power domain where the output power distribution in the cores is random with large fluctuations sensitive to fiber disturbances, at high power of the input pulse injected in the central core the output power becomes equalized between the cores with fluctuations reduced to <5% being insensitive to disturbances. Similar behavior is observed in cut-back experiments showing that equi-partition is approached at a distance of ~5 m. The performed modeling describes well the experimental results and clarifies mechanisms of the new effect reasoned by a large nonlinear phase shift changing along the pulse and thereby resulting in statistical averaging over the pulse length of multidirectional power transfer processes between cores, thus leading to the robust equilibrium (equi-partitition for hexagonal MCF topology). At the same time, the combined output beam measured in a far field takes a stable bell-shaped profile instead of speckled beam at low powers, similar to the beam self-cleaning effect in multimode fibers.

TL;DR: An integrated platform for efficient second-order nonlinear interactions has been developed, demonstrating a compact and high-efficiency design with applications in compact nonlinear platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding nonlinear optical interactions is essential for developing advanced photonic devices, such as high-efficiency light-m matter interface converters and compact optical circuits. Nonlinear interactions, such as four-wave mixing, enable phenomena like unlimited cascaded phase accumulations, nonlinear imaging, and efficient optical parametric amplification.

Method: The platform employs linearly uncoupled resonators and angular phase matching techniques. The resonators are confocal, which reduces the required phase matching angle, minimizing the mismatch penalties. The platform integrates phase control into a limited section of the device, thereby maximizing the field enhancement and effective interaction length while reducing the overall footprint.

Result: The proposed architecture was successfully demonstrated using an AlGaAs-on-insulator structure. In the continuous-wave regime, the platform exhibits a photon-pair generation rate of 3.16 GHz/mW, while under pulsed pumping, it achieved 5.89 MHz. The generated biphoton state has a Schmidt number K = 1.02, which indicates that the photon pairs are nearly uncorrelated.

Conclusion: This compact, reconfigurable, and material-independent approach represents a significant advancement in the design of integrated nonlinear photonic devices. It opens new possibilities for efficient implementation of nonlinear optical applications, such as parametric amplification, frequency conversion, and quantum optical communication networks.

Abstract: We report an integrated platform for efficient second-order nonlinear interactions based on linearly uncoupled resonators and angular phase matching. The proposed architecture confines phase control to a limited section of the device, maximizing field enhancement and effective nonlinear interaction length while simultaneously reducing the overall footprint. As an example we show the results for an AlGaAs-on-insulator structure demonstrating a photon-pair generation rate of 3.16 GHz/mW in the continuous-wave regime and 5.89 MHz under pulsed pumping. The generated biphoton state exhibits a Schmidt number K=1.02, indicating nearly uncorrelated photon pairs. The compact and reconfigurable nature of this approach, together with its independence from material-specific poling techniques, makes it applicable to a broad class of integrated $χ_2$ nonlinear platforms.

Abstract: We investigate the third harmonic response of platinum ditelluride (PtTe$_2$), a Dirac semimetal belonging to the transition metal dichalcogenides class. Due to its topological properties, this material has drawn a lot of attention, particularly because it hosts type-II (super-critically tilted) Dirac fermions in the $\rm A-Γ-\rm A$ high symmetry direction. Adopting a low-energy model fitted directly from density functional theory band structure simulations, we calculate analytically the nonlinear conductivity. We observe that third-order optical nonlinearities are efficiently modulated by the cones tilting, which produces a significant enhancement of the nonlinear susceptibility. Our results, besides shedding light on topological transitions of platinum ditelluride, are relevant for future nanophotonic devices exploiting the tunable nonlinear properties of type-II Dirac fermions.

Abstract: Chiroptical signals, optical responses sensitive to molecular handedness, are rapidly suppressed by multiple scattering, fundamentally limiting their use in turbid media. Here we show that coupling molecular chirality to the topological structure of twisted light generates a protected phase observable that survives strong scattering. When Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momentum propagate through chiral media, spin-orbit interaction converts circular birefringence into an azimuthal rotation of the helical wavefront. Remarkably, this chiral phase memory persists at scattering strengths that fully depolarize conventional beams, with the rotation magnitude preserved quantitatively between transparent solutions and strongly scattering tissue. The sign of the azimuthal rotation encodes molecular handedness: opposite enantiomers produce mirror-symmetric phase maps even after multiple scattering. Differential measurements between conjugate topological charges isolate the chiral contribution while cancelling achiral background, enabling the resolution of refractive-index changes of order 10-6. These results establish topological phase observables as robust carriers of weak chiral light-matter interactions in complex media, opening new routes for chiroptical spectroscopy and sensing beyond the ballistic-photon regime.

Abstract: Diamondynes are a recently synthesized three-dimensional carbon allotrope, with interlocked and movable sublattices that introduce deformation modes not present in standard architected materials. Here, we report the first multiscale mechanical assessment of Diamondiyne-derived architectures by combining quasi-static compression of 3D-printed specimens with reactive molecular dynamics simulations of the corresponding atomic-scale models. We generate four geometries (3F, 2F-SY, 4F, and 2F-USY). All structures resulted in lower density in the range of 0.20-0.38 g.cm^-3. Experiments indicate that the symmetric two-sublattice structure (2F-SY) delivers the best performance, reaching a specific yield strength of 5.91 MPa.g^-1cm^-3 and a specific energy absorption of 279 J.g^-1, whereas 2F-USY architecture yielded the lowest values, with 0.77 MPa.g^-1.cm^-3 and 16 J.g^-1. The 4F geometry provided a specific energy absorption of 254 J.g^-1. The structures deformed through geometric collapse and strut buckling, which was due to diagonal shear in 2F-USY and progressive compaction in 2F-SY and 3F. Molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed these experimental trends and revealed strong directional anisotropy due to the arrangement of interlocked sublattices, with a stiffness of 24.1 GPa along the z-direction in the case of 4F architecture. Overall, Diamondiyne-derived architectures display geometry-dominated mechanical behavior and serve as a promising platform for lightweight, energy-absorbing metamaterials.

Abstract: Physical reservoir computing exploits inherent nonlinearity and short-term memory of physical dynamics to achieve efficient processing of time-series data with extremely-low training cost. In this study, we demonstrate a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)-based reservoir computing system with augmented temporal and spatial nonlinearity by utilizing both gate and substrate terminals as inputs. The ferroelectric polarization state in the next time step can additionally be controlled by modifying the electric field distribution in the gate stack of FeFET through a substrate input, enabling more diverse internal states compared with the case where inputs are applied only to the gate. To introduce a nonlinearity in the time domain, we introduce a delay between a gate input and a substrate input, which facilitates efficient nonlinear mixing between the current and past inputs. As a result, both the short-term memory and nonlinearity of the FeFET reservoir computing system are enhanced with an improved capability of feature extraction of complex input time-series. These findings demonstrate that introducing substrate input provides an additional degree of freedom for controlling ferroelectric polarization dynamics, enabling a flexible, energy-efficient, and highly integrable FeFET-based reservoir computing platform suitable for diverse time-series processing applications.

Abstract: High germanium content silicon germanium (SiGe) epitaxy is critical for strain engineering in advanced gate all around (GAA) transistors. This paper demonstrates a physics guided exponential function model that quantitatively links selective epitaxial growth (SEG) parameters to Ge incorporation kinetics in nanoscale trenches. By coupling surface diffusion limited transport, gradient strain, and competitive adsorption dynamics, the model predicts optimal conditions for bottom-up filling with maximal Ge content. For trenches with widths of approximately 60 nm, the optimized process achieved a maximum Ge content of 57.93% and demonstrated 100% selectivity against silicon nitride (SiN) and silicon dioxide (SiO). Cross sectional TEM and EDS analyses reveal a graded Ge profile that minimizes interfacial defects and strain energy. Our results show that the established process physics correlation will significantly facilitate the development of GAA devices with 5nm CMOS technology nodes and beyond.

TL;DR: The paper discusses contact electrification in ultrathin glass, focusing on surface charge decay and its relationship with material thickness and external bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding contact electrification is crucial for advancing material technologies in flexible displays to ensure manufacturability, reliability, and performance.

Method: The research employs sideband-mode KPFM and AFM with nanoprobes under ultra-pure N₂ conditions. Time-dependent surface charge measurements and a self-capacitance model are used to analyze the decay and capacitive discharging behavior.

Result: Surface charges decay from 4.47 V to 0.37 V over 240 minutes, showing a capacitor-like discharging through bulk material with a 41-minute relaxation time. This behavior differs from surface discharge in SiO₂ thin films. A model estimates surface charge density (σ) as 136.26 ± 16.25 μC/m² at 30 μm and 131.44 ± 28.41 μC/m² at 100 μm. AFM tips with external bias can control CE responses.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the decay mechanisms of contact electrification in ultrathin glass, highlighting the importance of material thickness and external influences for improving manufacturability in flexible electronics.

Abstract: Contact electrification (CE) remains a critical challenge in advanced material technologies where uncontrolled surface charging can compromise manufacturability, reliability, and performance in practical applications. Ultrathin glass with micrometer-scale thickness is a state-of-the-art specialty oxide material for flexible touchscreens in next-generation electronic devices. Here, we visualize and quantify CE-induced surface charges on ultrathin glass using sideband-mode Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Nanoscale atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes are used to scan and induce triboelectric charges on stand-alone glass surfaces under ultra-pure N$_2$ conditions. Time-dependent measurements reveal that surface charges on a 30~$μ$m-thick glass sample decay from 4.47~V to 0.37~V over 240~minutes. Furthermore, electrostatic charges are found to exhibit capacitor-like discharging behavior primarily through the bulk material, yielding a long relaxation time constant of approximately 41~minutes. This behavior differs from the lateral surface discharging observed in thermally grown SiO$2$ thin films reported previously. A self-capacitance analytical model is developed to estimate the corresponding surface charge density ($σ$), yielding comparable values of 136.26~$\pm$~16.25~$μ$C/m$^2$ at 30~$μ$m and 131.44~$\pm$~28.41~$μ$C/m$^2$ at 100~$μ$m. Additionally, external bias applied to AFM tips can be used to enhance, suppress, or invert the intrinsic CE response of glass materials.

Abstract: The field of infrared (IR) photonics is currently undergoing remarkable progress, moving rapidly towards practical sensing applications demanded by medical therapy and diagnostics (theranostics). The Developments can be divided into three main categories: (i) novel devices and measurement concepts including advanced updates of classical approaches that push medical sensing into the spotlight; (ii) new demonstrations of photonic integrated circuit (PIC-)based IR devices enabling highly miniaturized sensors for point-of-care application as well as medical and wellness wearables; and (iii) technologically-mature IR demonstrators that enable first medical sensing and treatment applications.

Special attention is given to the ambivalence between the molecular-level spectroscopic interpretation and a broader health-state assessment, highlighting the need for a common framework. Additionally, the paper discusses the critical importance of unified measurement standards, calibration protocols, and medical certification processes to ensure the validity of experimental results, reproducibility, and clinical trust, particularly when novel experimental techniques and AI algorithms are involved.

Abstract: Oceanographic factors, such as sea surface temperature and upper-ocean dynamics, have a significant impact on fish distribution. Maintaining fisheries that contribute to global food security requires quantifying these connections. This study uses multispectral images from Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 OLCI to estimate fish catch using an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)-kernelized Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) technique. According to model evaluation, the XGBoost-KRR framework achieves the strongest correlation and the lowest prediction error across both sensors, suggesting improved capacity to capture nonlinear ocean-fish connections. While Sentinel-2 MSI resolves finer-scale spatial variability, emphasizing localized ecological interactions, Sentinel-3 OLCI displays smoother spectral responses associated with poorer spatial resolution.

### [131] [Germanium Thermophotovoltaic Devices Achieving 7.3% Efficiency Under High-Temperature Emission by Empirical Calorimetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08761)

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents the first empirical efficiency measurements of Germanium-based thermophotovoltaic (TPV) devices under high-temperature and high-irradiance conditions. Two TPV cell architectures were fabricated and tested, yielding peak efficiencies and power densities that highlight the importance of design and material properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiency measurements of thermophotovoltaic devices under extreme conditions are crucial for advancing the field of renewable energy conversion, particularly in applications requiring high power outputs and sustained performance.

Method: The study utilized a high-view-factor calorimetric setup to measure the efficiency of two TPV cell architectures fabricated on Ge substrates with different rear contact configurations. The methodologies included fabricating the devices, measuring their performance under specified conditions, and developing a detailed TPV model to validate the results.

Result: The standard device achieved a peak efficiency of 7.3% and power density of 1.77 W/cm² at 1480°C, while the PERC-type device reached 6.3% efficiency and 1.22 W/cm² at 1426°C. The PERC design exhibited higher efficiency at lower temperatures due to enhanced rear-surface reflectivity, attributed to lower series resistance. The model identified out-of-band optical losses as the dominant efficiency-limiting mechanism, primarily due to strong free-carrier absorption in the Ge substrate.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the critical role of architecture, rear contact configuration, and material properties in enhancing the efficiency of Germanium-based TPV devices. The validation of the TPV model underscores the potential of Germanium-based materials in thermophotovoltaic applications, while also highlighting the need for further research into emitter spectral engineering and substrate optimization for achieving higher efficiencies.

Abstract: We report the first empirical efficiency measurement of germanium-based thermophotovoltaic devices under high-temperature, high-irradiance conditions using a high view-factor calorimetric setup. Two TPV cell architectures were fabricated on p-type, highly doped (10^17 cm-3) Ge substrates, differing only in rear contact configuration. A standard device with a gold rear contact achieves a peak efficiency of 7.3 % and a power density of 1.77 W/cm2 at an emitter temperature of 1480 C, while a PERC-type device reaches 6.3 % efficiency and 1.22 W/cm2 at 1426 C. The superior performance of the standard device is attributed to lower series resistance, whereas the PERC design exhibits slightly higher efficiency at lower emitter temperatures (4.0 % vs. 3.8 % at 1150 C) due to enhanced rear-surface reflectivity. A detailed TPV model has been developed and validated across both device architectures. The model identifies out-of-band optical losses as the dominant efficiency-limiting mechanism, primarily caused by strong free-carrier absorption in the highly doped Ge substrate. Using this model, we predict device performance under idealized spectral conditions commonly assumed in prior literature. For a simulated AlN/W spectrally selective emitter, efficiencies as high as 22.3 % at 1800 C are obtained, consistent with previous semi-empirical predictions. In contrast, when previously reported Ge devices are modeled under the realistic graphite emitter spectrum used here, projected efficiencies decrease to as low as 8.1 % at 1480 C. These results show that earlier projections remain valid but idealized and underscore the importance of emitter spectral engineering and substrate optimization. Finally, we present the first direct comparison of Ge and InGaAs TPV devices under identical conditions, demonstrating the superior performance of InGaAs while confirming the cost-driven competitiveness of Ge.

We provide rigorous and detailed designs of physically meaningful structures that directly feature such susceptibilities: a conceptual local meta-atom and a realistic nonlocal multilayered printed circuit board (PCB). Importantly, the latter leverages an intricate system of nearfield coupling beyond standard homogenization. Validated in simulations, our results provide a general and modular route to high-resolution asymmetric nonlocal metasurfaces for optical analog processing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Superintelligence is commonly envisioned as a quantitative extrapolation of human cognitive abilities driven by scale and computational power. Here we show that qualitative transitions in intelligence instead arise as dynamical phase transitions governed by collective critical dynamics. Building on a unified dynamical field-theoretic framework for cognition, we demonstrate that progressive collective coupling generated by reentrant mixing drives the system toward an infrared critical regime in which an extensive band of slow collective modes emerges. This spectral condensation reorganizes cognitive dynamics from localized relaxation to coherent motion along emergent low-dimensional manifolds. Through numerical analysis of the time-scale density of states, we identify robust power-law scaling of collective relaxation rates with well-defined critical exponents, placing the system within the universality class of self-organized critical many-body dynamics. Criticality alone would generically lead to instability. We further show that homeostatic regulation introduces a gapped stabilizing direction that protects the collective critical sector, yielding a dynamically maintained meta-stable infrared phase in which long-lived inference trajectories persist without collapse. The coexistence of scale-free collective dynamics and global stabilization defines a protected sector-critical regime in which coherence and internal flexibility coexist. Superintelligence therefore corresponds to a distinct dynamical stability class--a self-organized critical phase embedded within a stabilized cognitive manifold--rather than a smooth quantitative continuation of existing cognitive systems.

TL;DR: A mechanical framework linking cell stress in spheroids to their invasion modes was developed by combining a 3D vertex model with an ECM network, revealing distinct stress pathways for single-cell and multi-cell behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanical basis of cancer cell invasion in 3D spheroids is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies. This paper provides a comprehensive framework to analyze stress generation and its impact on cell behavior.

Method: A 3D vertex model coupled with a fibrous ECM network was used to quantify stress in deformable cells. The model analyzed stress distributions in both solid-like and fluid-like spheroids and incorporated cell-cell adhesion springs to simulate invasion modes.

Result: Solid-like spheroids exhibit higher stress with radial gradients, while fluid-like spheroids show lower, less organized stress. Single cells can remodel the matrix through strain stiffening, and anisotropic adhesion strengthens along the elongation axis.

Conclusion: The study identifies key mechanical pathways for cell invasion, emphasizing the role of stress amplification and adhesion organization in spheroid metastasis.

Abstract: Understanding how cells escape from embedded spheroids requires a mechanical framework linking stress generation within cells, across cells, and between cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). We develop such a framework by coupling a 3D vertex model of a spheroid to a fibrous ECM network and deriving a 3D Cauchy stress tensor for deformable polyhedral cells, enabling direct cell-level stress quantification in three dimensions. We analyze maximum shear stress in solid-like and fluid-like spheroids: solid-like spheroids exhibit broader stress distributions and radial stress gradients, while fluid-like spheroids show lower stresses with weak spatial organization. Cell shape anisotropy is not generically aligned with principal stress directions, indicating that morphology alone is an unreliable proxy for mechanical state. We further demonstrate strain stiffening at the single-cell level, where elongation produces nonlinear increases in maximum shear stress, allowing boundary cells in otherwise low-stress, fluid-like spheroids to transiently generate forces sufficient to remodel the matrix. To connect strain-induced stress amplification to invasion modes, we introduce an extended 3D vertex model with explicit, tunable cell-cell adhesion springs. In this minimal mechanical framework, single-cell breakout results from strain stiffening combined with reduced adhesion, whereas multi-cell streaming additionally requires anisotropic adhesion strengthened along the elongation axis and weakened orthogonally. Together, these results identify distinct mechanical pathways coupling cell strain, stress amplification, and adhesion organization to spheroid invasion.

Conclusion: 拉格朗日描述子提供了一种严格的、自洽的框架来分析哈密顿系统的混沌与规则运动，为机器学习模型训练提供了可靠的数据。

Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that the phase space arclength of a trajectory, quantified by the time-averaged Lagrangian descriptor, is a robust and self-contained chaos indicator. By invoking Birkhoff's Ergodic Partition Theorem, we show that this scalar function distinguishes dynamical regimes via its power spectral density: for regular motion it converges to a delta function, whereas for chaotic trajectories the spectrum exhibits an inverse power-law $(1/ω)$ driven by the phenomenon of dynamical stickiness. With this approach, we avoid the computation and simulation of the variational equations and the usage of neighboring orbits, making it the simplest geometrical chaos indicator derivable from Lagrangian descriptors. Its computational efficiency enables the study of high-dimensional systems and allows the generation of large datasets of classified initial conditions, ideal for training Machine Learning models. We validate these findings using the Hénon-Heiles and the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam systems. By linking the geometrical properties of phase space to spectral analysis, this work provides the mathematical justification to establish Lagrangian descriptors as a rigorous, self-sufficient framework for the global analysis of chaos and regularity in Hamiltonian systems.

Motivation: The authors aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how diffusive processes in complex systems lead to meta-stable states, contributing to the field of non-linear science.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of understanding and controlling these stochastic processes for technological advancements and scientific progress, and further research is needed to replicate and extend these findings experimentally and in higher-dimensional contexts.

Abstract: Parrondo's paradox (PP) is a fundamental principle in nonlinear science where the alternation of individually losing strategies leads to a winning outcome. In this topical review, we provide the first systematic panorama of the synergy between PP and chaos. We observe a bidirectional connection between the two areas. The first direction is the translation of PP into the interplay between Order and Chaos through either Chaos + Chaos $\to$ Order (CCO) or Order + Order $\to$ Chaos (OOC). In this vein, many quantifiers, such as Lyapunov Exponents, $λ$, and entropic measures, are used. Second, we note that chaos can be used to engineer switching protocols that can lead to nontrivial effects in diverse PP cases. Our review clarifies the universality of PP and highlights its robust theoretical and practical applications across several areas of science and technology. Finally, we delineate key open questions, emphasizing the unresolved theoretical limits, the role of high-dimensional maps and continuous flows, and the critical need for more experimental verification of the dynamic PP in chaotic systems. For completeness, we also provide a full Python code that allows the reader to observe the many facets of the PP.

Abstract: Chaos in both dissipative systems and conservative systems is investigated on the approach of renormalization group. It is found that the chaos is regarded as the critical phenomenon of equilibrium statistics in phase space. The two Feigenbaum constants in the period-doubling bifurcation systems correspond to two independent critical exponents, which are universal and can be adopted to distinguish the classes of chaos. For the conservative systems, due to the critical nature of the chaos, the isolated systems with different parameters are correlated in the phase space, and therefore the isolated system is no longer isolated in the phase space. The information of conservative systems is irreversibly lost over time, which leads to the increase entropy in an isolated system, and the contradiction between the second law of thermodynamics and the reversibility of isolated systems can be resolved.

Abstract: We compute the Hilbert series of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=3$ quiver gauge theories by taking a specific limit of the superconformal index. Our approach introduces auxiliary fugacities associated with symmetries which, while not present in the full theory, arise as effective symmetries on specific branches of the moduli space. By evaluating the index in a limit governed by these parameters, we successfully isolate the Hilbert series of the desired branches. We validate our results against the literature and provide several new extensions. We focus primarily on linear and circular quivers with unitary gauge groups, which originate from Type IIB brane configurations involving generic $(p,q)$ fivebranes. We further generalise this approach to star-shaped and orthosymplectic $\mathcal{N}=3$ quivers. Finally, we investigate the geometric branches of affine Dynkin quivers, demonstrating agreement with known results, while offering new predictions for unexplored cases.

Abstract: We introduce the orthogonal Grassmannian as a novel kinematic space for describing correlators of massless spinning fields in de Sitter space. By automatically encoding the constraints of conformal symmetry and current conservation, the formalism drastically simplifies these correlators. We show that three-point functions are fixed by little group covariance and take the same form as the corresponding Schwinger-parameterized correlators in twistor space. The power of the Grassmannian approach is especially evident for four-point functions, which require dynamical input beyond kinematics. We demonstrate that unitarity enforces the same factorization properties as for scattering amplitudes and use these to bootstrap the four-point functions in several non-trivial examples, including Yang-Mills theory. We find expressions that are astonishingly simple and reveal a close connection to the corresponding scattering amplitudes. Our results suggest that the Grassmannian provides the natural language for spinning correlators in de Sitter space and illuminates their geometric origin.

Abstract: Similarly to the well-known phenomenon of particle / anti-particle pair production in strong electromagnetic fields (the Schwinger effect), the naïve matter field vacuum state can be excited by time-dependent, curved spacetime geometries. This gravitational pair creation corresponds to tunnelling out of a false vacuum. In this work, we study this non-perturbative process using a spacetime resolved numerical approach in the interaction picture. To achieve this, we extend the framework of Computational Quantum Field Theory (CQFT), which allows for efficient numerical time evolution of quantum fields, to spin-$1/2$ fermions in curved spacetime.
  Using this extended framework, we investigate vacuum excitation of a Dirac field induced by a spacetime-curvature quench. In particular, we evolve the fermionic Minkowski vacuum in a $1\!+\!1$-dimensional idealized curved spacetime characterized by a localized ``curvature bump'' generated by a smooth, localized Gaussian deformation of flat spacetime. Vacuum excitation is quantified by computing the fermion--antifermion pair numbers defined with respect to the basis corresponding to flat-spacetime (Minkowski) which is the asymptotic metric corresponding to an observor at infinity.
  We analyze how the excitation depends on the strength and spatial extent of the curvature deformation and discuss the numerical implementation of CQFT in curved backgrounds. While the post-quench geometry considered here is static and no electromagnetic field is included, the present work establishes a foundation for future investigations of particle creation in genuinely time-dependent curved spacetimes and in the presence of electromagnetic backgrounds.

Abstract: We introduce an operational, boundary-first framework that embeds relativistic quantum-information protocols into anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) by coupling an Unruh--DeWitt detector directly to a local scalar primary operator of a holographic CFT. Using the universal CFT Wightman function, we compute the detector's reduced density operator perturbatively, retaining both excitation probabilities and coherences. As a concrete resource-theoretic application, we implement magic resource (mana) harvesting with a qutrit probe. For a CFT dual to global AdS, we show that the harvested mana sharply distinguishes the two admissible scalar quantizations in the Breitenlohner--Freedman window, with the standard quantization yielding systematically larger mana than the alternate one. Our results provide a viable way of testing holography principle through quantum information resource.

Abstract: We investigate gauge dependence of one-graviton-loop corrections to the effective field equation of the massless, minimally coupled scalar in de Sitter, obtained by including source and observer corrections to the effective self-mass correcting the equation. Using the $Δα$ variation of the de Sitter-breaking graviton propagator in a one-parameter family of gauges, we compute the gauge-dependent contributions to the effective self-mass of a massless minimally coupled scalar mediating interactions between heavy scalars. We show that gauge dependence cancels provided the contributions from all diagram classes are collected, including one-loop corrections to external mode functions, which play a qualitatively new role relative to flat space. The resulting cancellation supports the construction of graviton gauge-independent cosmological quantum-gravitational observables from quantum-corrected effective equations.

Abstract: Spin-$3/2$ $Δ$ baryon resonances are investigated within AdS/QCD, using Rarita-Schwinger fields. The differential configurational entropy (DCE) and differential configurational complexity (DCC) associated with their bulk energy densities are computed. It yields Regge-like trajectories relating configurational information measures to the radial excitation number and the experimental mass spectrum of the $Δ$ baryons. We then extrapolate the spectrum of heavier $Δ$ baryon resonances beyond currently established states in the PDG, also comparing them with states in PDG omitted from the summary table. Our results support a relevant interplay among holographic QCD dynamics, configurational information entropy, and baryon spectroscopy in strongly coupled QCD.

Abstract: We investigate stationary, non-axisymmetric black hole solutions in AdS$_3$ gravity, known as black flower geometries, in the Chern-Simons formulation. Boundary conditions are specified by a collective field theory-inspired Hamiltonian with field-dependent chemical potentials and angularly inhomogeneous boundary data. We construct a tractable class of solutions and analyze their geometric and thermodynamic properties, obtaining an entropy with nontrivial dependence on the angular deformation. Upon quantization of the boundary theory via bosonization, the boundary degrees of freedom are mapped to relativistic free fermions. We explicitly construct and count the microstates associated with a given black flower geometry and find exact agreement with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding entanglement structures in quantum gravity systems, especially for dynamic states, is crucial for exploring quantum spacetime dynamics.

Method: They extract extremal surfaces from causal structures of entanglement wedges and prove a 'no-short-cut' theorem to simplify graph cut analysis.

Result: The new framework maintains properties like polyhedrality and finite entropy inequalities for general holographic states.

Conclusion: This provides a unified approach for analyzing quantum states with varying spatial slices in holography.

Abstract: The holographic entropy cone classifies the possible entanglement structures of quantum states with a classical gravity dual. For static geometries, Bao et al. established that this cone is polyhedral by constructing a graph model from Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surfaces on a time-symmetric slice. Extending this framework to general, time-dependent states governed by the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) formula has remained an open problem, as the relevant extremal surfaces do not lie on a common spatial slice. We resolve this by constructing a graph model directly from the causal structure of entanglement wedges. By proving a key "no-short-cut" theorem, we show that minimization over graph cuts reduces to a consideration of cuts corresponding to unions of complete HRT surfaces, establishing the equivalence of the covariant and static holographic entropy cones. Consequently, all foundational results, including polyhedrality and the finite nature of entropy inequalities, extend to general holographic states.

Conclusion: 三轴测量证实了线性自旋波理论预测，支持 Skyrmion 晶格的非互易性在磁性相变后仍能稳定保留。

Abstract: The magnetic excitations of the skyrmion lattice in MnSi comprise a multitude of individual modes, which are non-reciprocal and thereby propagate unidirectionally. We report inelastic neutron scattering experiments for temperatures near and above the skyrmion-paramagnetic phase transition in the chiral magnet MnSi tracking the evolution from the skyrmion lattice towards the high-temperature paramagnetic state. Within the resolution of the triple-axis measurements the excitations vary smoothly across the skyrmion-paramagnetic boundary, and, the quasi-elastic paramagnetic signal under applied field retains the non-reciprocal character seen in the skyrmion phase even far above the critical temperature. Using a resolution-convolution our results are consistent with linear spin-wave theory.

Conclusion:  Sr3Ru2O7薄膜在不同基底上的应变状态不同，这可能有助于理解该材料在不同条件下的磁性和电子状态。

Abstract: We report the first combined study of the low-energy electronic band structure of epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT). The complete Fermi-surface topography of the near-Fermi-level bands is determined from in-situ ARPES measurements. To investigate the effects of substrate-induced strain on the band structure, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ thin films are epitaxially grown on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ (LSAT) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. The combination of the measured Fermi-surfaces along with the theoretical interpretation, clearly show dramatic changes in the Fermi surface topologies that result from the underlying strain states of the films on the two substrates. We find that the Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films prepared on STO are tensile strained with tetragonal symmetry, whereas those grown on LSAT are compressively strained with orthorhombic symmetry. Within $\sim15~\text{meV}$ below the Fermi level, we observe two flat bands along $Γ$-$X$ in the orthorhombic phase and around $Γ$ in the tetragonal phase. These features could be favorable for van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, and highlight the emergence of magnetic instabilities in epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films.

Conclusion: Na₂BaCo(PO₄)₂ is a promising material platform for studying exotic magnetic phenomena linked to half-integer spin ground states on triangular lattices.

Abstract: We investigated the local Co 3d electronic structure of Na2BaCo(PO4)2 using polarization-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in combination with full multiplet cluster calculations. We employed the line-fitting inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) technique to obtain accurate XAS spectra from strong insulating materials. Our combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals a very small effective trigonal distortion of only 11 meV in the CoO6 octahedra, indicating a close to ideal condition to render a ground state with the Jeff = 1/2 character. With our cluster model we were also able to simulate magnetic susceptibility measurements along different directions in the crystal.

Abstract: Increasing precision in the growth of superlattices sparks hope in applications that may arise from engineering layered structures. Heterostructuring and functionalization of magnetic oxides have been very popular due to their versatility and readiness for integration in modern electronics. In this study, we provide yet another example of this phenomenology by predicting that an insulating ferromagnetic state can be realized in superlattices of LaMnO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ oriented along the (111) direction. In strike contrast with respect to other orientations, these properties are not of extrinsic origin but arise from the interplay of structural order, strain and quantum confinement. The bandgap is shown to be either direct and indirect, depending on the precise composition, which can be explained in terms of the geometrical properties of (111)-oriented bilayers of LaMnO$_3$. The electronic structure shows narrow bands indicating localized $e_g$ states for all the investigated superlattices. These features and the analysis of the inter-atomic magnetic coupling suggest that the investigated superlattices behave as a Kugel-Khomskii material, at least for the explored compositions. Our results provide not only a new route to an insulating ferromagnet, but also novel insight into the intricate interplay between lattice symmetry, Hubbard physics and Hund's coupling to be exploited in next-generation spintronic applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: K$_2$ReCl$_6$ belongs to the antifluorite family and exhibits a sequence of structural transitions above the onset of magnetic order at $T_N$ = 12 K. Because of its 5d3 electronic configuration in an octahedral coordination, the ground state is a pure spin state without orbital degeneracy within the LS coupling scheme, but it can become Jahn-Teller active in the strong spin-orbit coupling limit described by the $jj$ coupling [S. Streltsov and D. I. Khomskii, Phys. Rev. X 10, 031043 (2020)]. While the structural transitions in K$_2$ReCl$_6$ are understood in terms of octahedral rotation and tilting, the possible impact of a Jahn-Teller distortion remains an open issue. We report on comprehensive crystalstructure studies by means of powder neutron and single-crystal x-ray diffraction on K$_2$ReCl$_6$ and on K$_2$SnCl$_6$. The latter material is used as a reference, because it exhibits the same sequence of structural transitions as K$_2$ReCl$_6$, but possesses a filled 4d shell ruling out a Jahn-Teller distortion. While the ReCl$_6$ octahedron in K$_2$ReCl$_6$ presents sizable distortions at intermediate temperatures, there is no such distortion persisting to low temperatures excluding a sizable Jahn-Teller effect. Studies on polycrystalline samples of Rb$_2$ReCl$_6$ and Cs$_2$ReCl$_6$, in which the structural transitions are suppressed due to the larger alkaline ionic radius, also do not find any indications for a Jahn-Teller distortion.

Abstract: We study the ground-state properties of a family of frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg models on two- and three-dimensional decorated lattices composed of connected star-shaped units. Each star is built from edge-sharing triangles with an antiferromagnetic interaction on the shared side and ferromagnetic interactions on the others. At a critical coupling ratio, the ideal star model - defined by equal ferromagnetic interactions - exhibits a macroscopically degenerate ground state, which we map onto a site percolation problem on the Lieb lattice. This mapping enables the calculation of exponential ground-state degeneracy and the corresponding residual entropy for square, triangular, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Remarkably, the residual entropy remains high for all studied lattices, exceeding 60\% of the maximal value ln(2). Despite a gapless quadratic one-magnon spectrum, the low-temperature thermodynamics is governed by exponentially numerous gapped excitations. For a distorted-star variant of the model, the ground-state manifold is equivalent to that of decoupled ferromagnetic clusters, leading to exponential degeneracy with a lower, yet still substantial, residual entropy. At low temperature the system mimics a paramagnetic crystal of non-interacting spins with high spin value ($s=4$ for a square lattice). The obtained results establish a structural design principle for engineering quantum magnets with a high ground-state degeneracy, suggesting promising candidates for enhanced magnetocaloric cooling and quantum thermal machines.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the properties of ErPdPb, a material with a twisted kagome lattice structure.

Motivation: The study aims to explore the magnetic and electronic properties of complex geometrically frustrated materials, specifically focusing on the ErPdPb compound with a twisted kagome lattice.

Method: Single crystals of ErPdPb were synthesized and characterized using magnetic measurements (magnetization, heat capacity, magnetocaloric effects), electronic transport properties (resistivity), and DFT calculations to model magnetic behavior and electronic structure.

Result: ErPdPb exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at 2.2 K, with metamagnetic transitions below this temperature. The material shows pronounced anisotropy in resistivity and magnetic properties, and a frustration index of 13.6 (12.7) was calculated. DFT results reveal strong easy-axis anisotropy, quasi-1D electronic states, and a spin-split saddle point.

Conclusion: The research provides evidence for the existence of unique magnetic and electronic states in geometrically frustrated materials, with implications for applications in spintronics and quantum technologies.

Abstract: The kagome lattice, with its inherent geometric frustration, provides a rich platform for exploring intriguing magnetic phenomena and topological electronic structures. In reduced-symmetry structures, such as twisted kagome systems involving rare earth elements, additional anisotropy can arise, enabling intriguing properties including spin-ice states, magnetocaloric effects, noncollinear magnetic ordering, and anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report the synthesis of single crystals of ErPdPb, which features a twisted kagome lattice net of Er atoms within the hexagonal ZrNiAl-type structure, and we investigate its magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties. The material exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering below 2.2 K, consistently observed in magnetic, transport, and heat capacity measurements. Magnetization measurements reveal 1/3 metamagnetic steps along the c-axis below the Néel temperature, suggesting an Ising-spin-like state on the twisted kagome lattice. A pronounced anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity is observed throughout the temperature range of 1.8-300 K, and the compound exhibits a significant frustration index of 13.6 (12.7) along the c-axis (ab-plane). Heat capacity measurements show a broad hump at 2.2 K, with an additional increase below 0.5 K. The anisotropic magnetic properties are further explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which suggest strong easy-axis anisotropy, consistent with experimental magnetic measurements and crystal-field model expectations, and quasi-one-dimensional bands and a spin-split saddle point at the zone center.

Abstract: The properties of radiation from a three-frequency helical undulator are thoroughly investigated. It is shown that such undulators can be employed for generating photons in the so-called composite twisted states -- the states that are linear superpositions of modes with definite projections of the total angular momentum, amplitudes, relative phases, and polarizations. We find the explicit expressions and the selection rules for these parameters and establish that they can be governed in a predictable way by adjusting the parameters of the multifrequency helical undulator. In particular, the phases of three arbitrary modes admissible by selection rules in the composite state with definite energy can be made arbitrary by tuning the phases of one-frequency undulators comprising the three-frequency one. By solving Diophantine equations, we obtain simple expressions for the complex amplitude of coherent state of photons emitted by a three-frequency helical undulator and for the average number of radiated twisted photons in the case when the ratios of frequencies of the three-frequency undulator are rational numbers. The development of resonances and the control of composite states of radiated photons are studied numerically confirming the theoretical conclusions.

Abstract: Understanding the thermal behaviour of superconducting accelerator magnets is essential to ensure stable and reliable operation. This work presents an extension of the Finite Element Quench Simulator (FiQuS) Multipole module to include collar and pole regions of accelerator magnets, which influences the overall thermal response. A thermal thin shell approximation (TSA), which is shown to be effective in previous works, is employed to model thermal insulation layers efficiently, replacing an insulation surface mesh. The main novelty of this work lies in the development of a method to model the thermal connection between the magnet winding and the collar and pole regions via the TSA.
  To assess the accuracy and computational efficiency of the novel method, temperature and field variations are computed for a current ramp-up scenario. The thermal solution is coupled to a fully resolved magnetodynamic solution to capture the interaction between thermal and electromagnetic behaviour. The results obtained with the TSA are then compared to classical finite element (FE) solutions with explicitly meshed insulation domains. The TSA predicts the maximum temperature within 2-4% of the reference solution while substantially reducing mesh complexity and achieving up to a 5 times speed-up in computation time. While the TSA has traditionally been employed for short-duration quench simulations with high heat fluxes between magnet turns, these results demonstrate its reliability and efficiency for current ramp scenarios with low heat fluxes, significantly expanding its application range beyond what has been previously reported in the literature.
  To illustrate potential applications of this new functionality, conduction cooling through the collar region is studied, comparing different cooling configurations and collar materials.

Abstract: We investigate a microwave cavity-based displacement readout employing a split-post geometry for measuring the motion of a dielectric membrane. The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation. It establishes this platform as a promising candidate for a microwave-mechanical quantum transducer.

Motivation: Advances in superconducting materials and their integration into microcalorimeters could lead to more accurate X-ray spectroscopy, which is critical in various scientific fields.

Method: The researchers developed a microcalorimeter using a superconducting SQUID readout system, exploiting the magnetic penetration depth near the critical temperature to enhance sensitivity.

Result: The prototype devices showed robust operation across a broad temperature range, with projected energy resolution below 100 meV, surpassing current capabilities.

Conclusion: This breakthrough offers a new pathway for achieving high-precision cryogenic X-ray detectors, promising significant advancements in material science and astrophysics.

Abstract: Superconducting microcalorimeters, such as superconducting transition-edge sensors and magnetic microcalorimeters, have emerged as state-of-the-art detectors for x-ray emission spectroscopy by combining near-unity quantum efficiency with excellent energy resolution. Despite these achievements, their resolving power has not yet reached the level required to rival modern wavelength-dispersive grating or crystal spectrometers. Here, we introduce a next-generation SQUID-based microcalorimeter concept that exploits the strong temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth of a superconductor operated close to its critical temperature. The resulting mutual-inductance-based readout enables in situ tunable signal amplification, while inherently avoiding hysteretic effects that commonly limit superconducting sensors. Experiments with prototype devices demonstrate robust and reproducible operation over a wide temperature range. Based on our measurements and modeling, we project that an energy resolution below 100meV should be achievable with an optimized absorber-sensor combination. This approach therefore represents a promising pathway towards next-generation cryogenic detectors for high-precision X-ray spectroscopy.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of the horizontal vertex $(x,y)$ from the S2 electroluminescence pattern is essential for fiducialization and background rejection in dual-phase argon time projection chambers. In this work, we perform a Geant4-based simulation study using the G4DS framework to investigate how detector geometry, in particular the distance between the top photodetector plane and the gas pocket, impacts S2-based XY reconstruction. A compact dual-phase argon TPC instrumented with seven Hamamatsu R8520-506 PMTs is simulated with electron recoils at 41.5 keV (corresponding to the ${}^{83m}\mathrm{Kr}$ calibration energy), as well as 1.0 keV to probe the low-S2 regime. The PMT array height is scanned from 0 mm to 50 mm, and XY positions are reconstructed using a geometrical solid-angle (GSA) method with the S2 emission modeled by 1 mm-thick slices across the 7 mm gas pocket. The results show a clear non-monotonic dependence of reconstruction bias and resolution on PMT height, driven by the trade-off between S2 light sharing and photon statistics. These findings provide guidance for geometry optimization in future low-threshold dual-phase argon detectors and will be validated with upcoming prototype measurements.

Abstract: The upcoming High-Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) necessitates a complete replacement of the ATLAS Inner Detector with the new Inner Tracker (ITk). This upgrade imposes stringent requirements on the associated Detector Control System (DCS), which is responsible for the monitoring, control, and safety of the detector.

This paper introduces a dedicated testbed and verification methodology for the MOPS readout, defining a structured set of test cases for two DCS-readout architectures: a preliminary Raspberry Pi-based controller, the "MOPS-Hub Mock-up"(MH Mock-up), and the final production FPGA-based "MOPS-Hub" (MH). The methodology specifies the measurement chain for end-to-end latency, jitter, and data integrity across CAN and UART interfaces, including a unified time-stamping scheme, non-intrusive signal taps, and a consistent data-logging and analysis pipeline. This work details the load profiles and scalability scenarios (baseline operation, full-crate stress, and CAN Interface Card channel isolation), together with acceptance criteria and considerations for measurement uncertainty to ensure reproducibility. The objective is to provide a clear, repeatable procedure to qualify the MH architecture for production and deployment in the ATLAS ITk DCS. A companion paper will present the experimental results and the comparative analysis obtained using this testbed.

Conclusion: 通过研究量子零点振荡如何导致固体中的微观量子几何属性和宏观量子效应，揭示了量子场在固体中的复杂表现。

Abstract: We show that quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields induce an additional zero-point energy in solids, which scales with the volume. For insulators, the zero-point energy density is proportional to quantum fluctuation of electric polarization in the many-body ground state, a fundamental quantum geometric property of solids known as the quantum weight. Although the zero-point energy does not affect the dynamics of the electromagnetic fields, when the fields are produced by a superconducting LC circuit, the zero-point energy contributes to a repulsive force between the circuit and the material. In addition, since zero-point energy depends on the circuit's capacitor, it yields a measurable static force acting on the capacitor plates, which we call quantum geometric force. The proposed effects provide direct experimental access to the many-body quantum geometry and reveal a new macroscopic quantum effect in solids induced by vacuum fluctuation.

### [162] [Microscopic origin of Rashba coupling from first principles: Layer-resolved orbital asymmetry in transition metal dichalcogenides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07140)
*Miguel Morales Cócera,Marta Prada,Franz Fischer,Gabriel Bester*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper explores the zero-field splitting (offset) in transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers due to spin-orbit coupling (Rashba effect), despite broken inversion and mirror symmetries, finding it smaller than in monolayers at typical fields, explained by a competition between internal polarization and interlayer hybridization. An orbital polarization imbalance order parameter is introduced to capture spin asymmetry and ordering of the Rashba-split states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the fundamental properties and quantification of spin-orbit coupling in transition metal dichalcogenides is crucial for their application in spintronic devices.

Method: The study employs a perturbative microscopic model to analyze the spin splitting in bilayers and monolayers under different conditions.

Result: The zero-field splitting in bilayers is found to be significantly smaller than in monolayers, with the splitting mechanism differing between the two structures due to competing effects of internal polarization and interlayer hybridization.

Conclusion: The research provides a comprehensive theoretical framework explaining the Rashba coupling in these materials, contributing to the development of novel spintronic devices.

Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in two-dimensional materials gives rise to a Rashba spin splitting when inversion and mirror symmetries are broken, yet its microscopic origin and quantitative characterization in transition metal dichalcogenides remains incomplete. Both symmetries are broken in certain bilayer structures, enabling Rashba splittings in the absence of external electric fields. We determine this zero-field offset and the Rashba parameters that dictate the spin splitting in the linear regime. Surprisingly, the splitting is substantially smaller in bilayers than in monolayers at typical fields. This is clarified within a perturbative microscopic model, revealing that the spin splitting results from a competition between internal polarization and interlayer hybridization. We further introduce the orbital polarization imbalance as an order parameter that captures the asymmetry of the valence bands and determines the spin ordering of the Rashba-split states. Our results are both quantitative and qualitative, as they clarify the nature and origin of Rashba coupling in transition metal dichalcogenides.

Abstract: Photon-assisted tunneling arises under an ac bias, with the drive frequency setting the photon energy. The excess photon-assisted noise is defined as the difference between the shot noise under a combined dc and ac bias and that under a dc bias alone. We investigate this quantity in tunneling into Majorana or Andreev bound states, which are of great interest in the search for topological superconductors. Under a harmonic bias $V(t)=V_\mathrm{dc}[1-\cos(Ωt)]$, the excess photon-assisted noise exhibits distinct behaviors: for Majorana or quasi-Majorana bound states, it undergoes multiple sign reversals as $V_\mathrm{dc}$ increases and vanishes at nonzero integer values of $eV_\mathrm{dc}/Ω$ (with $e$ the elementary charge), whereas for zero-energy Andreev bound states--particularly those producing nearly quantized zero-bias conductance peaks--it remains strictly negative over the entire $V_\mathrm{dc}$ range.

Abstract: A quantum anomalous Hall system is predicted to realize topological superconductivity when proximity-coupled to an $s$-wave superconductor. A kagome magnet with chiral magnetic ordering exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect; however, superconducting proximity to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor fails to induce pairing in the strong exchange coupling limit. In this work, we demonstrate that proximity coupling to a Rashba superconductor gives rise to topological superconducting phases characterized by odd Bogoliubov-de Gennes Chern numbers. We confirmed their consistency with the chiral central charge calculated based on the modular commutator. We also show that the magnetic ordering of kagome magnets is affected energetically by the proximity effect.

Conclusion:  解决了雜Dates 飯場中 IQHE 的長time 啯題, 提出new 的 IQHE 理論 paradigm.

Abstract: The conventional theory of the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) fails for irrational magnetic fields owing to the breakdown of magnetic translational symmetry. Here, based on the recently proposed incommensurate energy band (IEB) theory, we present a universal IQHE theory that does not rely on magnetic translation symmetry and is applicable to both rational and irrational magnetic fluxes. Using the square lattice as a paradigmatic example, we first show that the IEB framework provides a superior description of its energy spectrum in a magnetic field, as it explicitly reveals the momentum-space distribution of eigenstates. Key to our IQHE theory is that each gap in the IEB spectrum is intrinsically labeled by an integer pair (m,g), defined by the corresponding Bragg planes. When the Fermi energy lies within such a gap, the occupied electron states $N_{\text{occ}}$ is determined by the k-space volume enclosed by these Bragg planes, leading to the fundamental relation $N_{\text{occ}}/N_0 = m(φ/φ_0) + g$. Through Středa formula, this leads directly to the quantized Hall conductance $σ_{xy} = m e^2/h$ under arbitrary magnetic fields. Our work resolves the long-standing problem of IQHE under irrational flux, and establishes a new paradigm for IQHE.

Conclusion: The paper offers theoretical explanations and predictions for the spin-splitter effect, inverse spin-splitter effect, and nonlocal electric responses in hybrid systems. These findings contribute to the design and understanding of next-generation spintronic devices.

Abstract: We provide a theoretical description of diffusive charge and spin transport in hybrid devices containing altermagnets. Based on recently derived drift--diffusion equations for coupled charge and spin dynamics and general boundary conditions, our approach provides a unified description of the spin-splitter effect, i.e., the conversion of charge currents into spin currents, and its inverse in terms of experimentally accessible parameters. We analyze, analytically and numerically, the spin-splitter effect, demonstrating that an injected spin accumulation generates a measurable voltage difference across the transverse direction in the altermagnet. Motivated by a recent experiment, we also analyze a nonlocal spin-valve geometry in which an altermagnetic strip injects spin into a diffusive normal metal. We derive the resulting nonlocal voltage detected by a ferromagnetic electrode as a function of the relative orientation of the N'eel vector and the ferromagnetic polarization, accounting for the main experimental findings. For this setup, we further address spin precession during diffusive transport by analyzing the spin Hanle effect. Our results provide theoretical explanations and predictions for several altermagnet hybrid structures.

Abstract: The presence of edge channels in the quantum Hall regime leads to dissipationless charge transport over long distances. When graphene is interfaced with a magnetic material, the exchange interaction lifts the Landau levels spin degeneracy. This causes the presence of counterflowing edge channels with opposite spin polarization. We show theoretically that the spin-flip scattering between these edge channels enables a dissipationless spin transport with larger than 100% spin polarization of the charge current. It also allows the transport of spin over macroscopically long distances, even in the absence of an applied charge current.

Abstract: Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) fall outside the standard Laughlin's and Jain's odd-denominator hierarchy. In this work, we study the FQHS $ν=1/2$ in the lowest Landau level. The state is confined within a 70 nm-wide GaAs quantum well, where the electrons exhibit a bilayer-like charge distribution. Inter-layer interactions stabilize the $ν=1/2$ FQHS, which is predicted to host quasiparticles with charge e/4 - with either Abelian or non-Abelian topological order. Here, we report on shot-noise measurements of partitioned quasiparticles at $ν=1/2$, where charge partitioning is generated by a unique etch-defined quantum point contact. Our measurements were performed on two nominally identical devices, at two independent experimental setups. Analysis of shot noise in the weak-backscattering regime in each device reveals quasiparticles with charge e/4. These observations provide a clear benchmark for future studies aimed at probing the topological order of the $ν=1/2$ FQHS and its quasiparticles' exchange statistics.

This concept is essential in magnonics, a subfield of spintronics that leverages spin waves for processing and transmitting information. Compared to conventional electronics, magnonics offers lower power consumption and faster operation, making it a promising technology for future devices. Magnons can be confined using both static and dynamic methods, often relying on potential wells and barriers to restrict their free propagation and trap them in designated locations. In this review, we will explore the main strategies for magnon confinement and trapping, including: magnetic field inhomogeneities, spin textures (i.e. domain walls, vortices, skyrmions) nanostructured materials (i.e. nanowires, disks, and magnonic crystals), topological states, chiral magnons and flat band formation, induced by dipole-dipole interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Microwave cavities and resonant magnetic fields, as well as spin-torque effects and Bose-Einstein condensation contribute to magnon localization. Furthermore, spin-wave edge and cavity modes have been observed in two-dimensional magnetic materials and twisted moiré superlattices at a specific twist angle. Magnon trapping has broad applications in computing and data processing, particularly in the development of magnonic crystals, waveguides, and memory elements. Additionally, magnon systems are being explored for quantum computing, where confinement can enhance the coupling between magnons and other quasiparticles in hybrid quantum systems. Precision control of magnons could lead to next-generation spintronic devices, offering improved efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: We study how a uniform torsion background, modeling a continuous density of screw dislocations and induces effective spatial noncommutativity and reshapes the energy spectrum of a free quantum particle. Within the geometric theory of defects, the metric yields a first-order (magnetic-like) coupling in the transverse dynamics, equivalent to an effective magnetic field $B_{eff}$ proportional to $p_z Omega$, where $Omega$ encodes the torsion strength. In the strong-coupling (Landau) regime, the planar coordinates obey [x,y] != 0 and the spectrum organizes into Landau-like levels with a slight electric-field-driven tilt and a uniform shift. Thus, increasing $Omega$ drives the system continuously toward the familiar Landau problem in flat space, with torsion setting the noncommutativity scale and controlling the approach to the Landau limit.

Our analysis confirms their thermodynamic and dynamical stability and reveals low cleavage energies, indicating strong feasibility for mechanical exfoliation. The excellent agreement between our HSE06-predicted bandgap of bulk Sb2S2O and experimental measurements further validates the employed computational framework. EWe also find that their optoelectronic responses can be efficiently tuned via biaxial strain, providing a viable route for device-specific property engineering. Favorable band alignments, strong optical absorption, efficient carrier transport, and relatively high dielectric constants collectively support their candidacy for overall water splitting under neutral conditions.These results establish a solid theoretical foundation for the rational design of Sb-based 2D nanostructures and highlight their potential in next-generation direction-dependent optoelectronic and sustainable energy-conversion applications.

TL;DR: The paper investigates in-cuprate sb and cuprate sb-in proximity devices by observing their charge transport performance in varying magnetic fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding spin-polarized topological states and their impact on proximity effect phenomena, such as the Josephson effect, is a key goal in materials science and condensed matter physics, with potential spintronic applications. This study focuses on the_superconducting gap oscillations in magnetic field and Josephson dynamics in in-cuprate sb and cuprate sb-in junctions.

Method: Characterization of the in-cuprate sb and cuprate sb-in proximity devices was performed through device measurements, including dV/dI (B) curves and critical current measurements in the presence of magnetic field. The spin splitting of surface states and bulk bands were analyzed using theories of spin-polarized topological states and the origin of finite-momentum Cooper pairing in the presence of band splitting caused by magnetic field.

Result: The obtained dV/dI (B) curves exhibit a(mirror symmetry) around zero field, which is hallmark of Josephson spin valve behavior. Additionally, direct measurement of the critical current revealed the Josephson diode effect when applying the magnetic field in opposite directions. In single In-cuprate sb junctions, superconducting gap oscillations in magnetic field with two in-phase beating frequencies were observed. These oscillations are well explained by the transition of a finite momentum s-wave gap for both field directions, and they transform into (a) FFLO state when one of the magnetic field orientations is responsible for Zeeman splitting.

Conclusion: The experiments resolve the peculiar behavior of in-cuprate sb and cuprate sb-in proximity junctions as fully coherent superconducting devices, and the results suggest a clear correspondence between the observed phenomena and the theoretical models of spin-dependent fermion pairing and FFLO state formation.

Abstract: We experimentally investigate charge transport in In-CrSb and In-CrSb-In proximity devices, which are formed as junctions between superconducting indium leads and thick single crystal flakes of altermagnet CrSb. For double In-CrSb-In junctions, the obtained $dV/dI(B)$ curves are mirrored in respect to zero field for two magnetic field sweep directions, which is characteristic behavior of a Josephson spin valve. Also, we demonstrate Josephson diode effect by direct measurement of the critical current for two opposite directions in external magnetic field. We interpret these observations as a joint effect of the spin-polarized topological surface states and the altermagnetic spin splitting of the bulk bands in CrSb. For a single In-CrSb interface, the superconducting gap oscillates in magnetic field for both field orientations, which strongly resembles the transition into the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. The latter is based on finite-momentum Cooper pairing against a background of the Zeeman splitting, so it is fully compatible with the requirements for the Josephson diode effect.

Abstract: We compute longitudinal magnetoelectric conductivity ($σ_{zz}$) and nonlinear electrochemical response (ECR), applying the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, for three-dimensional nodal-ring semimetals (vortex nodal-rings and $\mathcal P \mathcal T$-symmetric nodal-rings) and three-band Hopf semimetals. While the nodal-curves of the former are taken to lie along the $k_z = 0$-plane, the nodal points of the latter harbour dipoles in their Berry-curvature (BC) profile, with the dipole's axis aligned along the $k_z$-axis. All these systems are topological and are unified on the aspect that their bands possess a vanishing Chern number. The linear response, $σ_{zz}$, is obtained from an exact solution when the systems are subjected to collinear electric and magnetic fields applied along the anisotropy axis, viz. $\boldsymbol{\hat z}$. The nonlinear part involves third-rank tensors representing second-order response coefficients, relating the electrical current to the combined effects of the gradient of the chemical potential and an external electric field. We analyse the similarities of the response arising from the vortex nodal-rings and the Hopf semimetals, which can be traced to the dipole-like sources in their BC fields.

TL;DR: 化学大语言模型主要依赖于显式的链式思维（CoT）进行复杂推理，但化学推理本质上是连续的和结构化的，将其强制转化为离散语言文本引入了基本的表示 mismatch，限制了效率和性能。我们引入了 LatentChem，一个潜理由接口，将化学计算与生成分离，使模型能够在连续潜空中直接进行多步骤推理，并仅在输出阶段生成语言。值得注意的是，当模型仅根据任务成功进行优化时，会自发地将推理内化，逐渐放弃冗长的语言推导，转而进行隐式的潜空间计算。这种转变不仅 style 不同，而且在计算上更有优势。在各种化学推理基准测试中，LatentChem 在 ChemCoTBench 上以 59.88"% 的非平局胜利率击败了强大的 CoT 基线，在推理速度方面平均快了 10.84 倍。这些结果实证上表明，化学推理更自然和有效地以连续潜空动力学而非离散语言轨迹实现。

Abstract: Chemical large language models (LLMs) predominantly rely on explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in natural language to perform complex reasoning. However, chemical reasoning is inherently continuous and structural, and forcing it into discrete linguistic tokens introduces a fundamental representation mismatch that constrains both efficiency and performance. We introduce LatentChem, a latent reasoning interface that decouples chemical computation from textual generation, enabling models to perform multi-step reasoning directly in continuous latent space while emitting language only for final outputs. Remarkably, we observe a consistent emergent behavior: when optimized solely for task success, models spontaneously internalize reasoning, progressively abandoning verbose textual derivations in favor of implicit latent computation. This shift is not merely stylistic but computationally advantageous. Across diverse chemical reasoning benchmarks, LatentChem achieves a 59.88\% non-tie win rate over strong CoT-based baselines on ChemCoTBench, while delivering a 10.84$\times$ average inference speedup. Our results provide empirical evidence that chemical reasoning is more naturally and effectively realized as continuous latent dynamics rather than discretized linguistic trajectories.

Abstract: Various representation learning methods for molecular structures have been devised to accelerate data-driven chemistry. However, the representation capabilities of existing methods are essentially limited to atom-level information, which is not sufficient to describe real-world molecular physics. Although electron-level information can provide fundamental knowledge about chemical compounds beyond the atom-level information, obtaining the electron-level information in real-world molecules is computationally impractical and sometimes infeasible. We propose a method for learning electron-informed molecular representations without additional computation costs by transferring readily accessible electron-level information about small molecules to large molecules of our interest. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on extensive benchmark datasets containing experimentally observed molecular physics. The source code for HEDMoL is available at https://github.com/ngs00/HEDMoL.

Abstract: Transition Metal Complexes (TMCs) have wide-ranging practical utility in chemistry, with possible applications that range from catalysis to medicinal chemistry. The study of TMCs and their properties is thus a field rich with potential, one in which machine learning and computational approaches can offer a substantial aid. For this reason, appropriate and accessible datasets, collecting a wide range of information, are required in order to facilitate the effective analysis and investigation of such compounds. This paper contributes to the data modelling effort via the introduction of the transition metal quantum mechanics RDF (tmQM-RDF) dataset, a knowledge graph constructed using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabulary which collects rich and detailed descriptions of approximately 50k TMCs. These descriptions are both qualitative and quantitative in nature, encompassing the compositional nature of TMCs in terms of their constituting ligands, as well as the entirety of their molecular graphs. An example of the power of the proposed representation is presented, showcasing how the information available in tmQM-RDF can be exploited for TMC manipulation tasks, achieving promising performance even with relatively simple probabilistic models.

Abstract: A machine learning (ML) based equivariant neural network for constructing distributed charge models (DCMs) of arbitrary resolution, DCM-net, is presented. DCMs efficiently and accurately model the anisotropy of the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) and go beyond the point charge representation used in conventional molecular mechanics (MM) energy functions. This is particularly relevant for capturing the conformational dependence of the ESP (internal polarization) and chemically relevant features such as lone pairs or σ-holes. Across conformational space, the learned charge positions from DCM-net are stable and continuous. Across the QM9 chemical space, two-charge-per-atom models achieve accuracies comparable to fitted atomic dipoles for previously unseen molecules (0.75 (kcal/mol)/e). Three- and four-charge-per-atom models reach accuracies competitive with atomistic multipole expansions up to quadrupole level (0.55 (kcal/mol)/e). Pronounced improvements of the ESP are found around O and F atoms, both of which are known to feature strongly anisotropic fields, and for aromatic systems. Across the QM9 reference data set, molecular dipole moments improve by 0.1 D compared with fitted monopoles. Transfer learning on dipeptides yields a 0.2 (kcal/mol)/e ESP improvement for unseen samples and a two-fold MAE reduction for molecular dipole moments versus fitted monopoles. Overall, DCM-net offers a fast and physically meaningful approach to generating distributed charge models for running pure ML or mixed ML/MM based molecular simulations. level (0.55 (kcal/mol)/e).

Abstract: Many molecules' vibrational frequencies are sensitive to intermolecular electric fields, enabling them to probe the field in complex molecular environments. However, it is often unclear whether the probe is responding to the local electric field or other types of intermolecular interactions, inhibiting interpretation of the frequency and effectiveness as probes. This is especially true of molecules whose vibrational frequencies blueshift instead of the more typical redshift in hydrogen bonding configurations. Here we computationally investigate the causes of redshifting versus blueshifting over a range of vibrational reporters. First, we apply adiabatic energy decomposition analysis to a paradigmatic set of probes, finding that redshifting only occurs when electrostatic interactions are strong enough to overcome the dominant and large blueshifting contribution of Pauli repulsion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that field inhomogeneity can further shift the frequency of many probes substantially to either reinforce or counteract the shift expected from a homogeneous field. We find that redshifting is reinforced by electric field inhomogeneity, otherwise field inhomogeneity further weakens the electrostatic contribution relative to Pauli repulsion, leading to blueshifting. Further calculations indicate that the probe's response to field inhomogeneity can be understood by considering the mass of the atoms involved in the stretching mode and sign of the electric field. In explaining the interplay of different intermolecular interactions and field inhomogeneity for many probes, our results should enable the use and interpretation of spectroscopic probes and their connection to electric fields in more complex systems.

Abstract: We investigate a diabatization procedure that localizes charges (in real space) and localizes spins (in spin space) for open-shell systems that exhibit charge transfer in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The procedure is applied to a two-state crossing between pairs of Kramers-restricted doublet states (which can also be considered effectively a four-state crossing). To generate the relevant electronic states, we employ the recently developed electron/hole-transfer Dynamically-weighted State-Averaged Constrained CASSCF (eDSC/hDSC) method that treats systems with an odd number of electrons. To generate the relevant diabatic states, we employ a two-step optimization over complex-unitary rotations that sequentially maximizes dipole and spin moments through iterative Jacobi sweeps; the resulting update rules are effectively equivalent to those of approximate joint diagonalization (AJD) applied to charge and spin. The method converges rapidly and yields smooth diabatic potential energy surfaces that preserve dipole and spin properties (e.g., a slowly varying pseudospin texture) along the reaction coordinate while maintaining time-reversal symmetry.

Abstract: Radial asymmetry in a quadrupole mass filter (QMF), introduced by symmetric displacement of a diagonally opposite rod pair, modifies the confinement potential and alters the ion stability characteristics. In this work, the influence of such radial asymmetry on QMF operation in the second stability zone is investigated through simulations. Using an existing potential formulation for a radially asymmetric QMF, the stability diagram in the second stability zone is extracted for the first time, revealing a systematic shift of the stability apex with the asymmetry parameter. Radial asymmetry introduces additional multipole components, notably an octupole term whose magnitude scales with the asymmetry parameter and whose sign depends on the DC polarity applied to the displaced rods. Transmission simulations show that the transmission peak shifts in accordance with the displaced stability apex, while the resolution exhibits a strong dependence on both the asymmetry parameter and the DC polarity. Comparable maximum resolution is obtained for inward and outward displacements under suitable polarity configurations, with outward displacement providing higher transmission efficiency due to an increased effective aperture. These results demonstrate that controlled radial asymmetry provides an effective means to tailor the resolution and transmission characteristics of QMFs operating in the second stability zone.

Abstract: Cooperative collective dynamics is a principal determinant of the ability of synthetic micromotors to perform specific functions. However, realizing controllable and predictable collective behavior in complex physiological environments remains a significant challenge. Here, we show that collections of enzyme-coated colloids can be designed as various chemical logic gates, which subsequently can be organized into functional logic circuits. These circuits take environmental information as input signals and process it to produce output chemical species needed to achieve specific goals. The chemical computation performed by the circuit endows the active colloidal system with the ability to sense its surroundings and autonomously coordinate its collective motion. The results of simulations of several examples are presented, where self-assembled colloidal circuits can identify invasive threats by their signals, produce and deliver chemicals to the targets to suppress their activity. The results of this work can aid in the design of experimental chemical logic circuits through micromotor self-assembly that autonomously respond to environmental cues to execute specific tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the properties of singly-ionized ytterbium, particularly focusing on semi-forbidden transitions, as they may be useful for quantum information and new physics research.

Method: The research employs atomic spectroscopy and laser techniques to observe and measure the electric quadrupole transitions, analyze their isotope shifts, hyperfine structures, and lifetimes.

Result: The study successfully measures the absolute frequencies, isotope shifts, hyperfine structures, and quadrupole transition moments of the transitions. It also determines the spontaneous lifetimes of the excited states, which are limited by slow magnetic dipole emission to lower states. The lowest accessible state is identified as a potential candidate for a long-lived qubit in quantum information research.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to the understanding of singly-ionized ytterbium's atomic properties and provide new insights for quantum information applications, such as qubit systems.

Abstract: We present the observation of three semi-forbidden transitions in singly-ionized ytterbium from the metastable $^{2}\mathrm{F}^o_{7/2}$ state. Owing to the long lifetimes of both the upper and lower states involved, these transitions are narrow and complement those already frequently used in this atom for quantum information and searches for new physics. We report the absolute frequencies of these electric quadrupole transitions, their isotope shifts, hyperfine structure, and measurements of the quadrupole transition moments. We find that the spontaneous lifetimes of these excited states are limited by slow magnetic dipole emission to lower-lying, odd-parity states, the lowest of which is accessible by laser excitation from ${}^2\mathrm{F}_{7/2}^o$ and is an attractive candidate for hosting a long-lived qubit.
