In the\nfirst algorithm, we use the matrix exponentiation method (Patel et al., 2018),\nwhile in the second algorithm, we repurpose the quantum spectral method (Childs\net al., 2020). Our main technical contribution is to derive the sufficient\nconditions for the diagonalization of the Carleman embedding matrix, which is\nindispensable for designing both quantum algorithms. We supplement this with an\nefficient iterative algorithm to diagonalize the Carleman matrix.\n  Our first algorithm has gate complexity of\nO(d$\\cdot$log(d)+T$\\cdot$polylog(T/$\\varepsilon$)). Here $d$ is the size of the\nCarleman matrix, $T$ is the simulation time, and $\\varepsilon$ is the\napproximation error.

For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact\ndiagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on\nthe edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra\ndegeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to\nstudy the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of\nflux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences\nbetween the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength\nscans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a\nbond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also\nextract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH\nside, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter\nand transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are\nconsistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain\nexcited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a\ncharge neutral momentum $\\pi$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the\ndimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but\ngaps to other excitations remain large."}

One requirement to create a quantum processor is\nnonlinearity, which in superconducting circuits is typically achieved by\nsandwiching a layer of aluminum oxide between two aluminum electrodes to form a\nJosephson junction. These junctions, however, face several limitations that\nhinder their scalability: the small superconducting gap of aluminum\nnecessitates millikelvin operating temperatures, the material interfaces lead\nto dissipation, and the sandwich geometry adds unwelcome capacitance for\nhigh-frequency applications. In this work, we address all three limitations\nusing a novel superconducting weak link based on the superconductor-insulator\ntransition. By locally thinning a single film of niobium nitride, we exploit\nits thickness-driven superconductor-insulator transition to form a weak link\nemploying only atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching.

In a closely related context, it is\nalso known that two-body loss in a non-Hermitian Kondo model triggers the Kondo\nbreakdown. To elucidate the essence of these phenomena, we study the Anderson\nimpurity model with a non-Hermitian complex hybridization as an effective model\nthat provides a simple understanding of the Kondo breakdown. Using the\nslave-boson mean-field theory, we show that this model can explain the Kondo\nbreakdown with a single complex parameter. Furthermore, we provide the exact\nBethe ansatz solutions that support the results obtained by the slave-boson\nmean-field theory.

Here, we propose a method to restore the\nquantum superiority of the quantum illumination in the presence of quantum\nnoises. Going beyond the widely used Born-Markov approximation, we discover\nthat the resolution of noisy quantum illumination is highly sensitive to the\nenergy spectrum of the composite system formed by each of the two light modes\nand its local quantum noise.

We find that\none can reasonably construct a wave packet that covers outside, but the wave\nfunction must be annihilated near the event horizon. This observation strongly\nsuggests that we cannot choose a coherent state for a spacelike hypersurface\nthat crosses the event horizon. To explain the unitary time evolution, we must\nkeep the slices as coherent states; hence, they must always be outside the\nevent horizon.

Our simulations were focused on a ternary coating\ndesign, which is a candidate for use in next-generation detectors. Results\nreveal that higher coating absorption localizes peak temperatures near the\ncoating--vacuum interface. Importantly, the comparative analysis demonstrates\nthat temperature predictions from the reduced model differ from the detailed\nmodel by only milli-Kelvins, a discrepancy often within the experimental\nuncertainties of the system's thermo-physical parameters. This finding suggests\nthat computationally efficient reduced models can provide sufficiently accurate\nresults for thermal management and first-order distortion analyses. Moreover,\nthe critical role of accurately characterizing the total power absorbed by the\ncoating is emphasized."}

Black holes seem to have thermodynamic properties,\nsuch as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, which are important when considering\nblack holes with size of a few centimeters or smaller. Since entropy in\nstatistical mechanics is related to the number of microstates of a system,\nseveral questions arise: what gives rise to the black hole entropy? Can it be\nexplained by a quantum description of gravity? In order to further study these\nquestions, the connection between thermodynamics and gravity must be explored\nat the microscale. In this doctoral thesis, we aim to understand this\nconnection using two descrip-tions that yield the thermodynamics of curved\nspacetimes. We start by imposing the first law of thermodynamics to a charged\nself-gravitating matter thin shell in higher dimensions and choose equations of\nstate which allow the study of the black hole limit and the recovery of black\nhole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we use the Euclidean path integral approach\nto quantum gravity to construct statistical ensembles of black hole spacetimes\nand self-gravitating matter, in order to study semiclassically the phase\ntransitions between hot matter and black holes.

It is based on the postulations\nthat quantum states, which violate the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints,\nrepresent instances of time, and stochastic fluctuations of the lapse and shift\ngenerate the time evolution under which an initial state gradually collapses\ntoward a diffeomorphism-invariant state. Under the wavefunction collapse, the\nscale factor monotonically increases, thus acting as a clock. The scalar,\nvector, and tensor gravitons arise as physical excitations, and the arrow of\ntime for their evolution is set by the initial state. In the long-time limit,\nthe tensor gravitons exhibit emergent unitary dynamics. However, the extra\nmodes are strongly damped due to the non-unitary dynamics that suppress the\nconstraint-violating excitations. The vector mode is uniformly suppressed over\nall length scales, but the decay rate of the scalar is proportional to its wave\nvector. This makes the latter a viable candidate for dark matter; excitations\nwith large wavelengths survive over long periods, contributing to long-range\ninteractions, while the fast decay of short-wavelength modes renders them\nundetectable without sufficient temporal resolution.

However, is there\nany justification for avoiding time slices that cover inside the event horizon?\nTo answer the question, we investigate the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, where the\ntime slices can cover both inside and outside the event horizon. We find that\none can reasonably construct a wave packet that covers outside, but the wave\nfunction must be annihilated near the event horizon. This observation strongly\nsuggests that we cannot choose a coherent state for a spacelike hypersurface\nthat crosses the event horizon. To explain the unitary time evolution, we must\nkeep the slices as coherent states; hence, they must always be outside the\nevent horizon. In contrast, inside the horizon, we cannot have a single\ncoherent state of a classical spacetime. Hence, the interior must be a\nsuperposition of several coherent states, which implies that there exists a\nhorizon-scale uncertainty and a black hole should be viewed as a highly quantum\nmacroscopic object.

It is one of the simplest examples of the\ncyclic RG where $\\log N$ plays the role of the RG time. The deterministic model\nis integrable and shares the same Bethe Ansatz (BA) equations with the\ninhomogeneous twisted XXX spin chain. We analyze the quantum metric, the Berry\ncurvature, and the fractal dimension in the sector with a single Cooper pair. A\nrich phase structure in the $(\\theta,\\gamma)$ parameter plane is found, where\n$\\gamma \\log N$ quantifies the hopping term.\n  For the deterministic RDM we clearly identify the extended domain of\nnon-ergodic multifractal phase on the $(\\theta,\\gamma)$ parameter plane\nsupporting the reentrance transitions between the localized, ergodic, and\nmultifractal phases. We find the pattern of phase transitions in the global\ncharge $Q(\\theta,\\gamma)$, which arises from the BA equation. In particular, in\nthe multifractal phase in the deterministic model $Q(\\gamma)$ exhibits the\nanalogue of \"charge concentration\" and fortuity phenomena discussed in the\ncontext of black hole microstates at finite $N$. The BA equations in RDM\nexactly coincide with the equations defining the ground states in the theory on\nthe worldvolume of the vortex strings in $N_F=2N_C$ ${\\cal N}=2$ SQCD at a\nstrong coupling point $\\frac{1}{g_{YM}^2}=0$ with identification $\\theta_{RDM}=\n\\theta_{4D}-\\pi$. We conjecture that the Hamiltonian of the RDM model describes\nthe mixing in particular 2d-4d BPS sector of the Hilbert space. Our findings\nprovide an example of the BPS multifractality regime for the probe operator in\nthe sector of Hilbert space, and we comment on the possible application to\ndense QCD with $\\theta$ term."}

At near\nzero absolute temperature, atoms exhibit macroscopic phase coherence and\ncollective quantum behavior, enabling their use in precision metrology, quantum\nsimulation, and even information processing. This review provides an\nintroductory overview of the key techniques used to trap, manipulate, and\ndetect ultracold atoms, while highlighting the main applications of each\nmethod. We outline the principles of laser cooling, magnetic and optical\ntrapping, and the most widely used techniques, including optical lattices and\ntweezers. Next, we discuss the manipulation methods of atomic internal and\nexternal degrees of freedom, and we present atom interferometry techniques and\nhow to leverage and control interatomic interactions. Next, we review common\nensemble detection strategies, including absorption and fluorescence imaging,\nstate-selective readout, correlation and quantum non-demolition measurements\nand conclude with high-resolution approaches. This review aims to provide\nnewcomers to the field with a broad understanding of the experimental toolkit\nthat underpins research in ultracold atom physics and its applications across\nquantum science and technology."}
