### [1] [Analytic thermal bootstrap meets holography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20894)
*Julien Barrat,Deniz N. Bozkurt,Enrico Marchetto,Alessio Miscioscia,Elli Pomoni*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 该论文通过结合热力学泛函和KMS条件，与多应流体流体系数，计算得到热力学相关器，研究了双标量算子的两点函数在零空间分离情况下的ergarten结构等。

Motivation: 该论文针对双标量算子的两点函数在热力学极限下的 kindergarten结构展开研究，提出了一种新的计算方法，补充了现有结果。

Method: 该论文结合了热力学泛函和KMS条件，使用多应流体流体系数，计算得到热力学相关器。

Result: 该论文研究了双标量算子的两点函数在零空间分离情况下 kindergarten结构，展示了结果的合理性和数值解的一致性。此外，还证明了扩展到弯曲时空中的可行性。

Conclusion: 该论文通过结合热力学泛函和KMS条件，获得了双标量算子的相关器表达式，验证了以此方法有效的计算能力。

Abstract: We compute thermal holographic correlators by combining their analytic
structure with the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition and a finite set of
multi-stress tensor OPE coefficients determined from the dual AdS description.
We focus on two-point functions of identical scalar operators with integer
conformal dimensions at zero spatial separation. For correlators
holographically dual to black brane backgrounds, we show that our results
satisfy all relevant consistency conditions and agree with numerical solutions
of the bulk wave equation. We further demonstrate that the expansion in
generalized free field correlators proposed in [Barrat,6/2025] admits a natural
interpretation in terms of Witten diagrams. Finally, we extend our analysis to
spherically symmetric black hole backgrounds and show that higher-curvature
corrections can be incorporated within the same framework.

### [2] [Higher spin Lagrangians from higher derivative diffeomorphisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20895)
*Will Barker,Dario Francia,Carlo Marzo,Alessandro Santoni*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel approach to describing massless particles of arbitrary spin using higher-derivative gauge transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper revisits the covariant description of massless particles of arbitrary spin, challenging conventional assumptions about the role of gauge symmetry in such theories.

Method: The authors develop a variational principle for constructing such theories and demonstrate the uniqueness of Fronsdal's action under certain gauge symmetries.

Result: The authors conclude that Fronsdal's action is uniquely determined by requiring invariance under higher-derivative gauge transformations generated by vector parameters.

Conclusion: This finding suggests a deeper connection between higher-spin symmetries and diffeomorphisms beneath general relativity, prompting further exploration of these ideas.

Abstract: The covariant description of massless particles of arbitrary spin typically
employs symmetric tensors of rank $s$ and rests on a local symmetry carried by
symmetric tensor parameters of rank $s-1$, suitably generalizing the $U(1)$
transformations of Maxwell's theory and the diffeomorphisms underlying general
relativity. Here we show that Fronsdal's action is actually uniquely identified
by the weaker requirement of invariance under higher-derivative gauge
transformations driven by a vector parameter. This observation may hint to a
tighter, if unexpected, connection between higher-spin symmetry and
diffeomorphisms.

### [3] [Generalized Replica Manifolds I: Surgery and Averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20900)
*Mohamed Hany Radwan*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: A framework is developed to perform path integral 'surgery' using correlated averaging over codimension-one defects, enabling the construction of replica manifolds by cutting and gluing the path integral. This method allows computing R'enyi entanglement entropy for various subsystem partitions. The framework is extended to gauge theories, linking replica calculations of entanglement between color degrees of freedom to quiver gauge theories. The approach is explored in the context of large-N theories and holography, with future directions noted in a subsequent paper.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces a novel method for calculating entanglement entropy using path integral techniques, which could provide insights into quantum gravity, gauge/gravity dualities, and black hole entropy.

Method: The framework uses correlated averaging over operators representing the Heisenberg group to perform 'surgery' on path integrals, constructing replica manifolds without explicitly modifying the underlying manifold.

Result: The approach successfully allows computing R'enyi entanglement entropy for various subsystem partitions and extends to gauge theories, linking entanglement calculations to quiver gauge theories.

Conclusion: This framework offers a new way to study entanglement entropy in various physical theories and has potential applications in quantum gravity and holography.

Abstract: We develop a simple framework for implementing a type of path integral
"surgery" via correlated averaging over codimension-one defects/extended
operators. This technique is used to construct replica manifolds by effectively
cutting and gluing the path integral without explicitly modifying the
underlying manifold. We argue that restricted forms of this averaging can be
used to calculate R\'enyi entanglement entropy corresponding to a wide range of
choices of subsystem partitioning. When the entanglement entropy being
calculated in this way does not simply correspond to entanglement between
subregions, we call the resulting objects from this surgery "generalized
replica manifolds". We show how this framework extends to gauge theories and,
in particular, how in non-Abelian gauge theories it establishes a connection
between replica calculations of a gauge-invariant notion of entanglement
between color degrees of freedom and a quiver gauge-theory structure. Finally,
we discuss how this framework appears in the context of large-$N$ theories and
holography, with a bird's-eye view of potential future directions. This paper
focuses on averaging over operators that form a representation of the
Heisenberg group; a subsequent paper will extend the framework to more general
operator averaging.

### [4] [Searching for emergent spacetime in spin glasses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20902)
*Dimitris Saraidaris,Leo Shaposhnik*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper examines many-body quantum systems and their potential holographic nature by studying their spectral functions. It finds that systems with spectral functions lacking compact support exhibit tails similar to large-q SYK models, suggesting possible connections to semiclassical spacetimes. The SU(M) Heisenberg model's quantum spin glass phase shows such tails, and the p-spin model's spin liquid phase exhibits an infinite family of quasiparticle excitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the connection between many-body quantum systems and holography, a key area in theoretical physics. By analyzing spectral functions, it aims to identify conditions under which these systems could be holographically dual to gravitational theories, contributing to our understanding of quantum gravity and spacetime emergence.

Method: The authors study three models: the SYK model, the p-spin model, and the SU(M) Heisenberg chain, computing their spectral functions in the large N limit. They identify parameter regimes where the spectral functions exhibit exponential tails, pointing to features like non-compact support and lack of conformal symmetry.

Result: The paper identifies that spectral functions without compact support in the quantum spin glass and spin liquid phases exhibit exponential tails. Specifically, the SU(M) Heisenberg model's quantum spin glass phase and the p-spin model's spin liquid phase display these tails, suggesting potential holographic dualities. Additionally, it finds an infinite family of quasiparticle excitations in the p-spin model's spin liquid phase, indicating a possible type I von Neumann algebra structure. The presence of exponential tails in all examined cases without compact support and conformal symmetry leads to the conclusion that such spectral features are indicative of holographic bulk causal structures.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to understanding when many-body quantum systems could be holographically dual to gravitational theories. It provides evidence supporting holography in specific parameter regimes of the studied models, associated with exponential spectral tails. The findings hint at connections to spacetime causality and von Neumann algebra structures, advancing the link between quantum mechanics and gravity.

Abstract: Recent work on algebraic formulations of holographic dualities in terms of
large $N$ algebras has revealed a deep connection between the properties of the
associated spectral functions and the emergence of a semiclassical spacetime
and causal horizons therein. One of the main lessons is that, for a radial
direction to emerge, the spectral function has to exhibit non-compact support.
Furthermore, there exist conjectures upon a possible duality between complex
gravitational configurations and glassy systems. The goal of this paper is to
combine these ideas by studying many-body quantum-mechanical systems and assess
in which parameter regimes they could potentially be holographic. Thus, we
compute the spectral functions of three many-body systems with quenched
disorder, the SYK model, the $p$-spin model and the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg chain in
the large $N$ limit and present results in different parameter regimes. Our
main finding is that in the quantum spin glass phase of the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg
model, the spectral function develops an exponential tail, similar to the large
$q$ limit of SYK. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of an infinite
family of quasiparticle excitations deep in the spin liquid phase of the
$p$-spin model, which could point towards an emergent type I von Neumann
algebra. In addition, we demonstrate the presence of an exponential tail in the
spectral function for all cases without compact support and conformal symmetry.
Motivated by this observation, we prove that no low-energy operator can detect
a nontrivial bulk causal structure, if the spectral function has exponentially
decaying tails.

### [5] [O(16)$\times$O(16) heterotic theory on $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20915)
*Daniel Robbins,Hassaan Saleem*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究了非超对称 $O(16)	imes O(16)$ 异源理论在 $AdS_{3}	imes S^{3}	imes T^{4}$ 背景下的 $	ext{AdS-CFT}$ 对应，发现了一族参数化的空穴，经过一环标量势的加入，$	ext{cosmological constant}$ 增加，但没有实现从 $	ext{Anti-de Sitter}$ 到 $	ext{de Sitter}$ 空间的 uplifting。研究了这些空穴周围的振荡模，发现所有六维有效理论中的标量和张量振荡均超过 Breitenlohner-Freedman 界限，并且来自环形紧致化所产生的标度模也在该界线下文范围内超过该界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究 $	ext{AdS-CFT}$ 对应中的空穴解及其稳定性，探索 $	ext{de Sitter}$ 空间的实现可能性以及模的稳定性

Method: 利用六维有效理论研究振荡模，并加入一环标量势分析 $	ext{cosmological constant}$ 的变化

Result: 振荡模均超过 Breitenlohner-Freedman 界限，但没有实现从 $	ext{AdS}$ 到 $	ext{de Sitter}$ 的 uplifting

Conclusion: 未能构造出稳定满足所有模的 Breitenlohner-Freedman 界限的 $	ext{de Sitter}$ 空穴解

Abstract: In this paper, we study non-supersymmetric $O(16)\times O(16)$ heterotic
theory on an $AdS_{3}\times S^{3}\times T^{4}$ background, finding a family of
vacua parameterized by a pair of flux integers. Adding the one-loop scalar
potential to the effective theory contributes positively to the cosmological
constant, but we find that there is no uplift to de Sitter for any values of
the fluxes. We study the fluctuations around these vacua and show that all
scalar and tensor modes from the six-dimensional effective theory lie above the
Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. The moduli coming from the torus compactification
will also be above the bound, at least for a large range of fluxes.

### [6] [Matching conditions at null infinity in the presence of logarithms: the role of advanced and retarded radiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21072)
*Matías Briceño,Hernán A. González,Marc Henneaux,Alfredo Pérez*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper introduces new insights into the matching conditions between past and future null infinity, particularly focusing on the role of logarithmic terms in field asymptotics for scalar fields and electromagnetism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivations behind this research likely stem from the desire to better understand gravitational waves or field behavior at boundaries of spacetime in general relativity.

Method: The research appears to employ advanced mathematical analysis of field asymptotics, considering both massless scalar and electromagnetic fields, and specifically examines radiation fields contributing to finite energy flux.

Result: The primary results involve the identification of the physical origin of logarithmic terms in the fields' asymptotic expansions and the derivation of matching conditions that ensure Coulombic behavior at spatial infinity.

Conclusion: The conclusions highlight that logarithmic terms play a crucial role in the matching of boundary conditions between past and future null infinity, offering a deeper understanding of radiation and field behavior at infinity.

Abstract: We provide a new perspective on the general matching conditions between the
future of past null infinity and the past of future null infinity, emphasizing
the impact of dominant logarithmic terms in the asymptotic expansion of the
fields near null infinity. We explicitly consider the cases of a massless
scalar field and of electromagnetism. Key in our derivation is the
identification of the physical origin of these logarithms, which are associated
with advanced and retarded radiation saturating the finite energy flux
condition at null infinity (in a space of functions which is made precise). The
matching conditions arise then from the requirement of Coulombic (i.e., $1/r$)
behaviour at spatial infinity.

### [7] [Spatially flat cosmological quantum spacetimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21283)
*Christian Gaß,Harold C. Steinacker*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 我们最近描述了一个可以作为 IKKT 矩阵模型背景的量子时空，具有零空间曲率，假设其对应的规范理论弱耦合。基于这个例子，我们构建了大量空间平直的量子时空。我们详细探讨了这些模型的代数和半经典结构，特别讨论了高自旋模式。我们引入了量子时空上的近域对称性，这些对称性源于矩阵模型的规范变换，并研究在半经典情况下不同规范之间的关系。最后，我们简要提到了如何将描述的量子时空纳入完整的 IKKT 模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子时空和规范理论在理论物理中是前沿领域，我们通过构建和分析量子时空及其与规范理论的关系，试图理解量子 gravity 的潜在机制。

Method: 我们从已有的例子出发，构建了更大的族的量子时空，分析了它们的代数结构，探讨了高自旋模式，并引入了近域对称性概念，借助半经典方法进行研究。

Result: 我们深入探讨了量子时空的代数和半经典结构，特别讨论了高自旋模式，并详细讨论了规范对称性在量子时空中的表现。

Conclusion: 我们将构建方法扩展到更广泛的情况，提供了量子时空的一般结构框架，并为完整的 IKKT 模型构建奠定了基础。

Abstract: We recently described a cosmological quantum spacetime of vanishing spatial
curvature, which can be considered as background for the IKKT matrix model,
assuming that the resulting gauge theory couples weakly. Building on this
example, we construct a large class of spatially flat cosmological quantum
spacetimes. We also elaborate on various details of their algebraic and
semi-classical structure as well as the higher spin modes present in these
models. In particular, we introduce the notion of approximate diffeomorphisms
on the cosmological quantum spacetimes that stem from gauge transformations of
the underlying matrix model, and investigate how different gauges are related
in the semi-classical regime by approximate diffeomorphisms. Finally, we
briefly outline how the described quantum spacetimes could be incorporated into
the full IKKT model.

### [8] [Quantum Corrections to $η/s$ from JT Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21602)
*Sera Cremonini,Li Li,Xiao-Long Liu,Jun Nian*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 计算了极化率在强相互作用及量子色动力学（QCD）下粘度熵比η/s随温度变化的规律，发现其与에너지及粘性有关，且与黑体辐射理论中的1/(4π)存在偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粘度熵比η/s是介理论中的基本参数之一，其在不同温度下的变化对热物理性质有着重要影响。

Method: 通过分析近极性黑孔的量子效应及其在霍普金斯模型下的量子修正，采用数论方法对粘度熵比进行了计算。采用热力学性质评估法对粘度熵比进行分析。

Result: 主要结果是η/s的粘性随温度变化表现出复杂的非线性行为。在 semiclassical 区域，η/s 达到一个比 KSS 边界值还低的最小值。在较低温度下，又逐渐上升，并显著高于 KSS 边界值。在量子高限时，粘度膨胀显著高于边界值。

Conclusion: 这项研究为粘度熵比在量子修正下的行为提供了新的理解，特别是在极化率及粘性研究方面。这些发现为现代物理中极性数理论 & 黑体辐射提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We revisit the computation of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio $\eta/s$
at finite chemical potential in a holographic model that takes into account the
quantum fluctuations in the IR region of near-extremal black branes. Such
quantum corrections can be computed from JT gravity and generate non-trivial
temperature dependence for $\eta/s$, which deviates from the universal $1/4\pi$
result. In the semi-classical regime, $\eta/s$ attains a minimum which is below
the KSS bound, generated by the presence of the quantum effects. In the quantum
regime at lower temperatures, $\eta/s$ increases and is well above the KSS
bound. We also compare the shear viscosity to the quantum-corrected absorption
cross-section of near-extremal black holes, and find agreement.

Abstract: Carrollian physics provides the natural framework for describing null
hypersurfaces. This review explores the geometry of Carrollian manifolds --
spaces endowed with a degenerate metric. We begin with an algebraic overview of
the Carroll group, its conformal extension, and its relation to the BMS group.
Then, in the core of the review, we follow the standard pseudo-Riemannian
narrative: metric $\to$ connection $\to$ curvature. We first introduce the
modern, general definition of a Carrollian structure, the analogue of the
metric on such manifolds, reviewing the historical developments, symmetries,
and link with the algebraic groups. The second part concerns connections. We
show the breakdown of the Levi-Civita theorem in the Carrollian setting and
construct the most general intrinsic Carrollian connection. A preferred
connection is then identified intrinsically and later shown to coincide with
the one induced by embedding a null hypersurface in an ambient spacetime. The
third part develops the associated curvature tensors. We include novel results
presented here for the first time.
  Two advanced topics highlight the broader scope of this framework. The first
treats null hypersurfaces via the rigging technique, deriving the induced
geometry from the ambient space. This provides a unified language for
spacelike, timelike, and null hypersurfaces, and shows that the induced rigged
connection exactly reproduces the intrinsic Carrollian one. From this, the
Gauss and Codazzi-Mainardi equations follow, and the Einstein equations emerge
as conservation laws for the null Brown-York stress tensor. The second topic
extends the Carrollian setup to generic, non-null hypersurfaces, enabling a
smooth null limit and completing the unified geometric description of
hypersurfaces of all causal characters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近似分析在复杂系统中高频行为具有重要意义，尤其是在热力学和量子场论领域。

Method: 利用场的算符乘积展开（OPE）进行近似分析，并结合 WKB 描述法研究反射系数。

Result: 发现非扰urbative 修正由两条单侧 AdS 黑洞的反射系数控制。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解 holographic 理论下的高频行为提供了新的视角，特别是发射系数在单侧 AdS 黑洞中的角色。

Abstract: We consider two-point functions of light fields at finite temperature and
large real frequencies in holographic theories. The thermal system is dual to a
single-sided AdS black hole. We show that the high-frequency expansion obtained
from the Operator Product Expansion receives nonperturbative corrections, which
are controlled by null geodesics bouncing off the black hole singularity in the
two-sided eternal black hole geometry. We develop a bulk WKB description of
these bouncing geodesics and explain how to calculate reflection coefficients
at the singularity.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 扩展了AdS$_3$引力的Kac-Moody边界条件，引入了费米场。对于$	extcal{N}=(1,1)$超引力，有两种方法实现费米扩展。第一种方法将扩展的KM边界条件与标准的超维拉图ro(US)边界条件通过大规范变换联系起来，建立了一个超对称的KM-US对偶。第二种方法通过更一般的边界配置施加强制条件，呈现出丰富的渐近结构，并提供了一个新的实现扩展的Kac-Moody代数的方式，以及从相对论性自由费米滴落的几何解释。最后通过提升经典泊松括号为反交换数，构造了哈密顿空间，并表明谱仅包含 bosonic’s软激发，没有额外的 fermionic’s软模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AdS$_3$引力的边界条件和其推广方法是理论物理中的重要课题，在超对称引力理论和量子重力的研究中具有深远的意义。通过引入费米场，可以探索边界条件的多样性以及与现有对偶关系的可能扩展。

Method: 使用了Kac-Moody代数、超维拉图ro(US)代数和超对称理论框架，借助大规范变换、超级miur映射和泊松括号的量子化方法，系统性地分析了不同边界条件下的理论结构。

Result: 第一种方法实现了KM边界条件与VS边界的联系，扩展了超对称对偶；第二种方法揭示了更复杂的边界配置，推导出新的代数结构和几何解释；并且通过量子化，证明了边界上的激发仅包含bosonic’s的软模式。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何通过引入费米场扩展AdS$_3$引力的边界条件，在保持理论一致性的同时，提供了新的代数和几何视角，并通过明确的量子化过程确定了理论的谱结构。这为理解超对称引力和量子边界理论提供了新的见解和方法。

Abstract: We extend the Kac-Moody (KM) boundary conditions of AdS$_3$ gravity by
incorporating fermionic fields. For $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ AdS$_3$ supergravity,
we show that there are two possible ways to implement the fermionic extension.
In the first, the extended KM boundary conditions are related to the standard
super-Virasoro (VS) boundary conditions through a large gauge transformation
realized by the super-Miura map between fields and chemical potentials,
establishing a supersymmetric generalization of the KM-VS correspondence. In
the second, a more general boundary configuration leads to strong constraints
on the fermionic chemical potentials, yet offers a much richer asymptotic
structure. It provides us a novel realization of the extended Kac-Moody
algebra, and a geometric interpretation in terms of folds in the relativistic
free-fermion droplet. Finally, we quantize the latter theory by promoting the
classical Poisson brackets to (anti-)commutators, construct the corresponding
Hilbert space, and show that the resulting spectrum contains only bosonic soft
excitations, with no additional fermionic soft modes.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent work on cosmological amplitudes has established reality conditions
(derived from unitarity) for general particle-creation processes in flat FLRW
cosmologies, in the Bunch-Davies wavefunction. In light of these results, we
propose a new class of large-$N$ holographic gauge theories with $d$ spatial
dimensions, which we call Kosmic Field Theories (KFTs), of which only a subset
are conformal (KCFTs). By imposing an appropriate -- $d$ dependent -- complex
phase for the number of colours $N$ and the t' Hooft coupling $\lambda$, we
show that the complex phases of $n$-point functions in a KFT match the reality
conditions required by $d + 1$ bulk unitarity, to all orders in bulk and
boundary perturbation theory, including loop diagrams. Since $N^2/\lambda$ is
imaginary in all dimensions, the class of (parity-even) KFTs has no overlap
with the class of Wick rotations of unitary QFTs. We also make a preliminary
investigation of positivity conditions, which might constrain the overall $\pm$
sign of $N^2$ and $\lambda$.
  Although SU($N$) models with adjoint matter can be defined in generic real
dimensions $d$, several features of the class of KFTs are nicer when $d$ is
odd, allowing $N^2$ to be real. This includes the possibility of non-oriented
and/or open string duals, reality of the effective number of degrees of
freedom, and closure under RG flow beyond the leading order in a $1/N$
expansion. This could explain why we live in a cosmology with an even number of
spacetime dimensions.

TL;DR: 研究探索了极化子的作用如何动态重构电子能谱，揭示了多项 results 说明极化子在量子相干态中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极化子在 Landau's 理论中被视为由晶格场“.decorate”过的载流子，但现有的实验和光谱研究只能观察到静止的间接重 normalize。研究者想知道在这种动态条件下，极化物是否能重构电子能谱并形成新的量子相干态。

Method: 利用 femtosecond 理想多维相干光谱仪，在受控大小和组成下研究PERovskite 量子点，实时跟踪极化作用带来的动力学变化。

Result: 观察到在50-150 fs时间尺度上，极化物诱导了量子相干态的延迟凝结，并且通过动力学耦合。这些谐波显示出异常的大小依赖性，超过了单独的能级分裂，并且在300 K下仍可见。使用 Raman 约束的spin-boson 模型可以解释这些结果。

Conclusion: 极化子在动态重构电子能谱和生成量子相干态方面起到了关键作用。这为理解新的集体量子现象如 superradiance, superfluorescence 和 superabsorption 开启了新的途径。极性是这些现象的核心机制。

Abstract: Since Landau's theory, polarons have been understood as quasiparticles in
which charges are dressed by the lattice field, yet decades of transport and
spectroscopic studies have yielded only static indirect renormalizations.
Whether such dressing can dynamically reorganize electronic spectra to generate
new quantum-coherent states has remained unresolved. Here we use femtosecond
coherent multidimensional spectroscopy on size and composition controlled
perovskite quantum dots to track polaronic field-induced dynamics in real time,
revealing their consequences. We observe a delayed condensation into a confined
spectrum of coherent states on 50-150 fs timescales, with couplings between
these states evolving dynamically on the same timescale. The splittings are
robust, exhibit anomalous linear size dependence, exceed single-particle
splittings and manifest at 300 K. A Raman-constrained spin-boson Hamiltonian
captures both the anomalous scaling and dynamical onset, establishing polarons
as generators of coherent manifolds that enable collective quantum phenomena
including superradiance, superfluorescence and superabsorption.

Abstract: Electrons levitating above the surface of solid neon have recently emerged as
a promising platform for high-quality qubits. The morphology and uniformity of
the neon growth in these systems is crucial for qubit performance in a scalable
architecture. Here we report on the controlled growth and characterization of
thin solid neon films using multiplexed superconducting microwave resonators.
By monitoring changes in the resonant frequency and internal quality factor
($Q_i$) of an array of frequency multiplexed quarter-wave coplanar waveguide
resonators, we quantify the spatial uniformity of the film. A pulsed gas
deposition protocol near the neon triple point results in repeatable film
formation, generating measurable shifts in frequency and variations in $Q_i$
across the resonator array. Notably, introducing a post-deposition anneal at 12
K for one hour improves the film homogeneity, as shown by the reduced
resonator-to-resonator variance in frequency and $Q_i$, consistent with
enhanced wetting. These results demonstrate resonator-based metrology as an
in-situ tool for characterising neon film growth, directly supporting the
development of electron on inert quantum solid qubit platforms.

Abstract: The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, whereby chiral molecules
preferentially transmit electrons of one spin orientation, remains one of the
most intriguing and debated phenomena at the interface of spintronics,
molecular electronics, and quantum materials. Despite extensive experimental
observations across diverse platforms - including transport junctions,
photoemission, and enantioselective chemistry - a comprehensive theoretical
framework is still lacking. In this perspective, we critically examine the
spinterface mechanism as a unifying explanation for the CISS effect. The
spinterface model, which hypothesizes a feedback interaction between electron
motion in chiral molecules and fluctuating surface magnetic moments, is shown
to quantitatively reproduce experimental data across various systems and
conditions. We contrast it with some existing theoretical models, highlighting
key experimental features. Importantly, we also address open questions and
criticisms of this model, including the nature of surface magnetism, the role
of dissipation, and the applicability of the mechanism to non-helical or
electrode-free systems. By offering falsifiable predictions and reconciling
theory with experimental raw data, this work aims to sharpen the dialogue
surrounding the microscopic origin of CISS and stimulate further experimental
and theoretical progress.

Abstract: We study the structural relaxation and electronic properties of a
one-dimensional (1D) moir\'e system composed of a zigzag graphene nanoribbon
(GNR) placed on a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Using an effective
grid model derived from continuum elasticity theory, we calculate the relaxed
atomic structure of the GNR/hBN system for various twist angles and ribbon
widths. The relaxation gives rise to a characteristic 1D domain structure
consisting of alternating commensurate AB$'$ regions and two distinct types of
domain boundaries. At finite twist angles, the ribbon adopts a wavy shape,
locally tracing the hBN zigzag direction but occasionally sliding to adjacent
atomic rows. The resulting moir\'e potential strongly modulates the electronic
structure: the zero-energy zigzag edge states are modulated by the local
stacking, leading to densely packed subbands in the AB$'$ domains and sharply
localized domain-wall states in the energy gaps between domain plateaus, which
together realize gate-tunable one-dimensional arrays of quantum-confined
electronic states. Our results demonstrate that moir\'e modulation in GNR/hBN
heterostructures provides a versatile platform for electronic structure
engineering and the design of 1D moir\'e nanodevices.

Abstract: Precise probe and control of various quantum degrees of freedom in novel
quantum matter are central to understanding fundamental quantum physics and
hold promise for innovative routes to encode and process information. Chirality
is one such degree of freedom that has recently attracted intense research
interest, especially for Weyl fermions in topological Weyl semimetals. The
coupling of chiral degrees of freedom through light-matter interactions and the
versatile control of these couplings through external fields can lead to
precise quantum control of Weyl fermions. In this work, we demonstrate the
observation of light chirality-dependent photocurrent in the mid-infrared
regime. Excitation wavelength-dependent measurements reveal that the
photocurrent originates from the injection of chiral polarized Weyl fermions by
chiral polarized mid-infrared photons. The optical process that generates
unbalanced chiral polarized Weyl fermions is determined to be a third-order
nonlinear photocurrent process. Compared with nonmagnetic Weyl semimetals, such
coupling is versatilely tunable in magnetic Weyl semimetals with the
magnetization direction and external electric field in addition to the
chirality of light. Our results are not only directly applicable to tunable
circular-polarization-sensitive photodetection in the mid-infrared regime, but
also pave the way toward functional quantum devices that utilize the chiral
quantum degrees of freedom of Weyl fermions.

Abstract: The electrical generation of spin signals is of central interest for
spintronics, where graphene stands as a relevant platform as its spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) is tuned by proximity effects. Here, we propose an enhancement
of spin-charge interconversion in graphene by controlling the intraparticle
entanglement between the spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom. We demonstrate
that, although the spin alone is not conserved in Rashba-Dirac systems, a
combined spin-pseudospin operator is conserved. This conserved quantity
represents the interconversion between pure spin and pseudospin textures to a
spin-pseudospin entangled structure, where Kane-Mele SOC tunes this balance. By
these means, we achieve spin-charge interconversion of 100\% efficiency via the
Rashba-Edelstein effect. Quantum transport simulations in disordered
micron-size systems demonstrate the robustness of this effect, and also reveal
a disorder resilient spin Hall effect generated by the interplay between Rashba
and Kane-Mele SOC. Our findings propose a platform for maximally efficient
spin-charge interconversion, and establish spin-pseudospin correlations as a
mechanism to tailor spintronic devices.

Abstract: Ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers host maze-like stripe domains that transform
into a disordered bubble/skyrmion lattice under out-of-plane magnetic fields at
ambient temperature. Femtosecond magneto-optics distinguishes these textures
via their distinct coherent breathing dynamics. Crucially, applying a brief
in-plane ``set'' magnetic field to the stripe state enhances both frequency and
amplitude of the bubble/skyrmion lattice breathing mode. Lorentz transmission
electron microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, and micromagnetic simulations
reveal that this enhancement arises from field-aligned stripes nucleating a
dense, near-hexagonal bubble/skyrmion lattice upon out-of-plane field
application, with strong indications for a pure skyrmion lattice. Thus,
modifying the initial domain configuration by in-plane fields enables precise
control of coherent magnetization dynamics on picosecond to nanosecond
timescales and potentially even of topology.

Abstract: Spin filtering and its back-action spin transfer torque (STT) are key
ingredients of latest spintronic devices based on magnetic tunnel junctions
(MTJs). Resonant tunneling (RT), implemented by design or occurring as
parasitic effects, is known to crucially affect macroscopic device performance,
but direct experimental access to its individual microscopic processes has
remained difficult. Here we apply the RT scheme from MTJs to spin-polarized
scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) for ultimate miniaturization obtained by
addressing distinct sites on individual nanomagnets. Combined with energy
selectivity, our experimental model set-up enables to study the spin filtering
capabilities of RT through an individual spin-split vacuum resonance state and
of the corresponding STT exerted on the nanomagnet. We find, that the sign and
magnitude of the STT follow the effective spin-polarization of the resonance
state, which, as we show, can by tailored on demand either by adjusting the
applied bias or the current injection point on the nanostructure. We
anticipate, that our atomic-scale RT-MTJ approach and the discovery of a
versatile tunable spin-filter at smallest scale will prove invaluable for
studying and designing next generation MTJs potentially based on recently
discovered 2D van-der-Waals magnets or altermagnets.

Abstract: Through systematic experimental and theoretical studies of
layer-thickness-dependent absorption in semiconducting MoSe$_2$ and WS$_2$
across the visible to near-infrared spectral range, we demonstrate a universal
absorption behavior in solids at nanoscale thicknesses. With increasing
thickness, a non-monotonic evolution of absorption integrated over the measured
spectral region is revealed which is accompanied by pronounced oscillatory
features. This strongly deviates from the expected Beer-Lambert law. The
observed behavior has origins in the electromagnetic interference effects
taking place between the two surfaces of the thin crystals. The present work on
2D semiconductors is extendable to all kinds of solids such as conventional
semiconductors (e.g. Si, GaAs, GaN, InP), (semi)metals (e.g. Al, Ag, Au,
c-HOPG) and 2D magnetic materials (e.g. CrSBr and NiPS$_3$). Our results
provide fundamental insights into light-matter interactions in solids at the
nanoscale and are vital for optimally designing the new generation of
absorption-based flexible optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Many monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, including MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$,

with electrons in nearby but electrically isolated 2D materials. These
modulations have been successfully used to detect transitions between distinct

Abstract: The precision of nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems is fundamentally

unexplored. A general theoretical framework is introduced that explicitly links
quantum coherence to thermodynamic uncertainty relations. By defining a
coherence-sensitive measure, it is shown that quantum effects can relax the
classical trade-off between the entropy production and the current
fluctuations, enabling the precision beyond classical bounds. Application to a
three-level quantum maser illustrates the framework in a concrete setting.
These results establish quantum coherence as a genuine thermodynamic resource

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel entanglement-assisted synchronization
framework for indoor optical wireless systems based on grid-based beam
steering. A central transmitter equipped with a spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) source emits time-energy entangled photon pairs,
directing user photons toward spatially defined grids based on estimated user
positions, while retaining reference photons for timestamping. The room is
partitioned into multiple beam-aligned regions, and photon reception
probability is analytically modeled using local coordinate transformations and
Gaussian beam optics. To address the inherent sparsity and randomness of photon
detection, we develop a robust two-stage synchronization algorithm that
performs sparse bit-pattern matching and timestamp averaging to estimate timing
offsets. Monte Carlo simulations are then performed to evaluate the impact of
synchronization duration, grid resolution, and photon-pair generation rate on
synchronization accuracy. Results show that finer grid configurations and
optimal photon-pair rates significantly reduce synchronization error, achieving
sub-10 ps timing accuracy within 1 ms of synchronization time. The proposed
approach enables scalable, high-precision quantum synchronization in wireless
indoor environments, laying the groundwork for future joint quantum
communication, sensing, and positioning systems.

Result: Achieves errors below 3 kcal/mol with 2-body FVO expansion and sub-kcal/mol accuracy with 3-body expansion. Combined with VQE and EFMO, it achieves 96-100% accuracy.

Conclusion: FVO provides an efficient pathway for quantum chemical calculations on intermediate-scale quantum processors.

Abstract: The development of quantum computing for molecular simulations is constrained
by the limited number of qubits available on current Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) devices. The present work introduces the Virtual Orbital
Fragmentation (FVO) method, a systematic approach that reduces qubit
requirements by 40--66\% while maintaining chemical accuracy. The method
partitions the virtual orbital space into chemically intuitive fragments and
employs many-body expansion techniques analogous to spatial fragmentation
methods. Applications to six molecular systems demonstrate that the 2-body FVO
expansion achieves errors below 3 kcal/mol, while the 3-body expansion provides
sub-kcal/mol accuracy. When integrated with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver
(VQE) and combined with the Effective Fragment Molecular Orbital (EFMO) method
for multi-molecular systems, the hierarchical Q-EFMO-FVO approach achieves
96--100\% accuracy relative to full calculations. The method provides a
practical pathway for quantum chemical calculations on current 50--100 qubit
processors and establishes virtual orbital fragmentation as a complementary
strategy to spatial fragmentation for managing quantum computational
complexity.

Abstract: In universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, implementing logical
non-Clifford gates often demands substantial spacetime resources for many
error-correcting codes, including the high-threshold surface code. A critical
mission for realizing large-scale quantum computing is to develop simple and
resource-efficient implementations of logical non-Clifford gates. We propose a
novel way of implementing non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code
based on hybrid lattice surgery. First we generalize the standard lattice
surgery to hybrid lattice surgery, where operations of rough merge and rough
split happen across different topological codes. Then we apply such procedures
between Abelian and non-Abelian codes and show that this can provide
non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code, in the form of a magic
state or a non-Clifford gate teleportation. Complementing this, we provide a
continuum topological field theory description of this hybrid lattice surgery
utilizing interfaces between (2+1)d topological orders. From these
considerations, we can generalize our protocol to non-Clifford gates and magic
states at all finite levels of the Clifford hierarchy, as well as gates beyond
the hierarchy. We also discuss protocols extending this framework to qutrits.

Abstract: We study the entanglement dynamics of a one-dimensional spin chain subject to
a local Floquet drive of a two-site impurity. We uncover a sharp transition in
the entanglement dynamics as a function of the driving frequency. For large
drive periods $T$, we observe a linear growth in entanglement entropy (EE),
indicating a heating phase with volume law entanglement. Surprisingly, for
driving periods below a critical value $T_\ast$, the EE grows subextensively
with time, characteristic of a local quantum quench. In the non-interacting
limit, we analytically trace the origin of this phenomenon to a transition in
the single-particle Floquet quasi-energy spectrum. We also find that for
$T>T_*$, the so-called ``average energy" operator develops non-local,
rainbow-like couplings that are responsible for the rapid entanglement growth
in the heating phase, but remains local for $T<T_*$. Using extensive
matrix-product-state simulations, we show that the non-heating phase and the
subextensive entanglement growth persist in the presence of weak interactions
for numerically accessible timescales. Our results establish that local Floquet
engineering can generate emergent bulk phenomena, shedding new light on energy
localization and thermalization in driven many-body systems.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates proposals using Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) to improve radioactive decay processes, particularly for gamma-ray and neutrino lasers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation lies in exploring unconventional methods to enhance the efficiency of radioactive decay processes, specifically in gamma-ray and neutrino lasers, by leveraging properties of Bose-Einstein condensates.

Method: The researchers analyzed existing experimental proposals that suggest using BECs as a source to address the challenges posed by high-energy radiation and short coherence times.

Result: The study concludes that the proposed experiments would yield minimal gains, with a potential enhancement factor of less than 10^{-20}. This suggests that the theoretical potential of using BECs for such applications remains unproven or significantly underperformed in practical terms.

Conclusion: In summary, the paper challenges the viability of using Bose-Einstein condensates for improving gamma-ray and neutrino lasers, indicating that the proposed methods as of now are unlikely to provide the hoped-for significant improvements.

Abstract: This paper lays out the principles of how Bose-Einstein condensates can
modify radioactive decay. We highlight the challenges of many modes and short
coherence times due to the $\approx$ MeV energies of the emitted radiation.
Recent proposals for gamma ray and neutrino lasers claim that using a
Bose-Einstein condensate as a source would solve these issues. We show that
this is not the case, and the proposed experiments would have a gain of only
$10^{-20}$ or smaller. We also analyze proposals for gamma ray lasers based on
stimulated annihilation of positronium Bose-Einstein condensates.

*S. Palafox,M. Salado-Mejía,M. Santiago-García,R. Román-Ancheyta*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: In the deep-strong coupling (DSC) regime, light and matter interact beyond their frequencies, causing decoupling. This is supported by theoretical and experimental evidence, but a local approach is insufficient for describing energy fluxes. A two-terminal quantum junction was used to derive a thermodynamically consistent master equation, showing that the heat current approaches zero in this regime, highlighting virtual photons' role in the vacuum ground state. The findings suggest that decoupling is a general feature of the DSC regime, with implications for quantum thermotronics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interaction between light and matter at extreme coupling strengths is crucial for advancing quantum thermodynamics and related fields. This research provides new insights into energy transfer mechanisms in critical and non-equilibrium conditions.

Method: The study employs a two-terminal quantum junction to derive a global master equation, enabling the analysis of heat currents and their behavior under deep-strong coupling conditions.

Result: The research demonstrates that in the DSC regime, the heat current tends to zero, indicating a significant decoupling effect. This finding supports the idea that virtual photons play a key role in the vacuum ground state and provides a thermodynamically consistent framework for analyzing energy fluxes at extreme coupling strengths.

Conclusion: The study reveals a fundamental decoupling mechanism in the DSC regime, which has broad implications for quantum thermodynamics and the design of quantum thermal machines. The results also emphasize the importance of considering nonlocal observables for a comprehensive understanding of energy transfer processes in extreme coupling scenarios.

Abstract: In the deep-strong coupling (DSC) regime, the interaction between light and
matter exceeds their bare frequencies, leading to an effective decoupling.
Theoretical and experimental evidence for this behavior has relied solely on
measurements of local observables at equilibrium. However, such a local
approach is insufficient to accurately describe energy fluxes in critical and
nonequilibrium phenomena. Here, we use a two-terminal quantum junction to
derive a thermodynamically consistent global master equation. We demonstrate
that the associated heat current, a key nonlocal observable in any quantum
thermal machine, also approaches zero in this extreme coupling scenario,
underscoring the role of virtual photons in the vacuum ground state. Our
results indicate that the decoupling is a more general feature of the DSC
regime, with implications for quantum thermotronics.

Abstract: Here we address the fundamental question whether an idealized system of $N$
atoms will show collective behavior and superradiance when it emits fermions
instead of photons. We show that the maximum emission is $\propto N$ and not
$\propto N^2$ which proves the absence of superradiance and shows that the
recent proposal to realize a superradiant neutrino laser is impossible. This
can be understood as either destructive interference of fermionic transition
amplitudes, or Pauli blockade by collective excitations with fermionic nature.
On the other hand, states with low excitation can show collective behavior. We
derive the exact solution of the fermionic Dicke problem and analyze the decay
dynamics in various regimes.

Abstract: Gaussian states are of fundamental importance in the physics of
continuous-variable quantum systems. They are appealing for the experimental
ease with which they can be produced, and for their compact and an elegant
mathematical description. Nevertheless, many proposed quantum technologies
require us to go beyond the realm of Gaussian states and introduce non-Gaussian
elements. In terms of quantum resource theory, we can then recognize
non-Gaussian states as resources and Gaussian operations and states as free,
which can be used and prepared easily. Given such a structure of resource
theory, the task of broadcasting the resource is to determine if the resource
content of a state can be cloned in a meaningful way, which, if possible,
provides a strong operation for manipulation of the resource. In this work, we
prove that broadcasting of non-Gaussian states via Gaussian operations is not
possible. For this, we first show that the relative entropy of non- Gaussianity
is not super-additive, which rules it out as a prime candidate in the analysis
of such no-go results. Our proof is then based on understanding fixed points of
Gaussian operations and relates to the theory of control systems. The no-go
theorem also states that if two initially uncorrelated systems interact by
Gaussian dynamics and non-Gaussianity is created at one subsystem, then the
non-Gaussianity of the other subsystem must be reduced. Further, keeping the
set of free operations fixed to Gaussian operations, we can also comment on the
broadcasting of Wigner negativity and genuine quantum non-Gaussianity.

Abstract: Bose et al. and Marletto and Vedral proposed an experiment to test whether
gravity can induce entanglement between massive systems, arguing that the
capacity to do so would imply the quantum nature of gravity. In this work, a
class of semi-classical models is examined that treat gravity classically,
through some potential in the Schr\"odinger equation, and it is shown that
these models do not generate entanglement. This class includes the
Newton-Schr\"odinger model, where gravity is sourced by the wave function, the
Bohmian analogue, where gravity is sourced by actual point-particles, and an
interpolating model proposed by D\"oner and Grossardt. These models are
analyzed in the context of the proposed experiment and contrasted with the
standard Newtonian potential, which does generate entanglement.

Abstract: The certification of intrinsic randomness is foundational to quantum
information theory and central in many practical applications thereof, such as
in the generation of unquestionably random numbers and in cryptographic
protocols. Device-independent randomness certification based on violations of
Bell inequalities has been thoroughly investigated within the standard Bell
scenario. In this work, we aim to extend this line of research by exploring
randomness certification in more general causal structures, namely, network
scenarios. To address this task, we demonstrate how the computational tool
known as the inflation technique can be adapted. As proof of concept, we use
inflation to certify randomness relative to a beyond-quantum adversary for
sample probability distributions obtained in the bilocality and triangle
scenarios. Complementarily, we also provide computational methods for the
problem of certifying an absence of randomness, which should not be conflated
with certifying the classicality of a given probability distribution. We
conclude with a discussion of conceptual subtleties regarding randomness
certification in networks, highlighting important open problems in this nascent
research field.

Conclusion: 量子 interference启发独立性原理，法量子理论对事件独立性施加约束，必要时有限制性影响。

Abstract: Quantum theory implies, and empirical evidence confirms, that while particles
$\textit{can}$ exhibit wave-like behavior in interferometric experiments, this
behavior is so limited as $\textit{not}$ to allow for third- and higher-order
interference. The article at hand shows that this possibility-impossibility
structure suggests the universal validity of a principle that regulates
statistical correlations between spatiotemporally localized events,
$\textit{independently}$ of the nature of the objects that may or may not
partake in these events. Roughly, the said principle mandates that
$\textit{any}$ joint influence of $m$ mutually spacelike separated events on
$\textit{another}$ event, be such, that it can be separated by $\textit{at
least}$ $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$ mediating events, and in some cases, by
$\textit{no more}$ than $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$ mediating events. The
structure of quantum interference thus teaches us that events can influence
each other in a non-separable fashion, but that this non-separability has a
certain exactly quantifiable limit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  the study aims to find an alternative method for simulating open quantum systems without the overhead of conventional noise-suppression techniques.

Method:  the approach leverages the natural noise of quantum processors to emulate nonunitary channels, avoiding the need for error correction and encoding nonunitary dynamics into unitary circuits.

Result:  the proposed noise-assisted quantum algorithm reduces qubit requirements and error correction fidelity while still enabling efficient simulation of open quantum dynamics.

Conclusion:  this work suggests that recognizing and utilizing noise as a valuable resource can lead to breakthroughs in practical quantum simulation of open quantum systems.

Abstract: Simulating open quantum systems on quantum computers presents a fundamental
challenge: open quantum dynamics are intrinsically nonunitary, whereas quantum
computers operate through unitary evolution. Conventional approaches overcome
this mismatch by encoding nonunitary processes into unitary circuits, but such
methods incur substantial overhead in both qubits and gates. Here, we propose
an alternative perspective. Quantum processors are themselves open systems,
inherently subject to noise. Instead of correcting all errors and then encoding
nonunitary dynamics with unitary logical qubits and gates, we show how noise
can be harnessed as a computational resource. We develop a noise-assisted
quantum algorithm that selectively preserves physical noise to emulate
nonunitary channels, enabling efficient simulation of open quantum dynamics
with minimal qubit requirements. Our approach applies both to noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and future fault-tolerant
architectures. By leveraging intrinsic noise, this method circumvents the need
to encode nonunitary dynamics into unitary gates and relaxes fidelity
requirements on physical qubits, thereby reducing the overhead of quantum error
correction. This framework reframes noise from a limitation into a resource,
opening new directions for practical quantum simulation of open systems

*Ali Mollabashi,Mohammad-Javad Vasli*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates how randomness affects information scrambling in integrable free-fermionic systems, finding that random local couplings facilitate information delocalization and scrambling despite the underlying system's integrability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding information scrambling in quantum systems, especially in integrable models, is crucial for insights into quantum chaos and thermalization.

Method: The study employs maximally entangled states as initial conditions and examines multipartite entanglement measures like entanglement negativity and tripartite mutual information (TMI) in Gaussian states evolved under quadratic Hamiltonians with varying degrees of randomness.

Result: Results show that randomness leads to the vanishing of the memory effect in entanglement between disjoint subsystems, indicating information scrambling. TMI saturates to negative values, suggesting weaker scrambling compared to chaotic systems. Spectral analysis reveals that randomness induces a ramp in the spectral form factor and a crossover in the level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like to Wigner-Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of randomness.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that randomness minimally induces information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models, highlighting its potential role in achieving thermalization or many-body quantum chaos without requiring non-integrable dynamics.

Abstract: We study the role of randomness in the scrambling of quantum information
within integrable free-fermionic systems. Considering quadratic Hamiltonians
with varying degrees of randomness, we analyze entanglement-based measures to
characterize the scrambling structure. We show that the memory effect in the
entanglement of disjoint subsystems of Gaussian states vanishes when the local
couplings are random, indicating information delocalization. The tripartite
mutual information exhibits negative saturation values similar to those in
chaotic systems, albeit with a smaller magnitude, revealing weaker scrambling
under integrable quadratic dynamics. Despite integrability, spectral analyses
reveal that local random models display a spectral-form-factor ramp and a
partial crossover in the single-particle level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like
to Wigner--Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of random couplings.
These results demonstrate that randomness can act as a minimal ingredient for
inducing information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Thermal noise is one of the physical obstacles that constrain the achievable
detection sensitivities of various detectors. Indeed, as we showed in a recent
paper (PRB 111, 024501 (2025)), the usual Josephson threshold detector (JTD)
operated in an equilibrium state can be utilized to implement a weak microwave
signal, just approaching (but not arriving at) its energy quantum limit, even
though its physical parameters have been optimized. In this letter, we further
demonstrate numerically that the phase dynamics of a current-biased Josephson
junction (CBJJ) can be insensitive to the always-on thermal noise if the sweep
rate of the biased current is significantly high. As a consequence, the JTD can
be operated alternatively in a non-equilibrium state. Based on the statistical
binary detection criterion, we demonstrate how such a non-equilibrium JTD
(NEJTD) can be utilized to implement the weak microwave signal, arriving at its
energy quantum limit level. The dynamic range and photon-number resolvability
of the proposed NEJTD are also discussed when it serves as a broadband single
microwave-photon detector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing need for reliable methods to infer quantum states from experimental data motivates this work on establishing a rigorous theoretical framework for maximum-entropy inference.

Method: The authors use convex duality, relative entropy, and Pinsker-type inequalities to analyze maximum-entropy inference for finite-dimensional quantum states under linear moment constraints.

Result: The paper proves that convergence of moments and entropy implies convergence of states in the trace norm, derives explicit quantitative bounds, and shows stability under unital completely positive maps.

Conclusion: This work solidifies the theoretical underpinnings of finite-dimensional maximum-entropy inference, offering a robust tool for quantum state estimation.

Abstract: We study maximum-entropy inference for finite-dimensional quantum states
under linear moment constraints. Given expectation values of finitely many
observables, the feasible set of states is convex but typically non-unique. The
maximum-entropy principle selects the Gibbs state that agrees with the data
while remaining maximally unbiased. We prove that convergence of moments and
entropy implies convergence of states in trace norm, derive explicit
quantitative bounds linking data and entropy deviations to state distance, and
show that these results are stable under unital completely positive maps. The
analysis is self-contained and relies on convex duality, relative entropy, and
Pinsker-type inequalities, providing a rigorous and unified foundation for
finite-dimensional maximum-entropy inference.

Abstract: Quantum clock synchronization underpins modern secure communications and
critical infrastructure, yet its fundamental dependence on channel reciprocity
introduces an exploitable vulnerability to asymmetric delay attacks. Current
attack strategies rely on static delays, limiting their ability to target

implementation, we demonstrate how tailored attack trajectories can selectively
compromise system stability across different scenarios. This work uncovers key
vulnerabilities in synchronization protocols under customizable attacks and
provide a foundation for developing secure and resilient quantum clock

Abstract: This paper presents an entropy based adaptive measurement sequence strategy
for quantum sensing of magnetic fields. To physically ground our ideas we
consider a sensor employing a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond, however our
approach is applicable to other quantum sensor arrangements. The sensitivity
and accuracy of these sensors typically rely on long sequences of rapidly
occurring measurements. We introduce a new technique for designing these
measurement sequences aimed at reducing the number of measurements required for
a specified accuracy as measured by entropy, by selecting measurement
parameters that optimally reduce entropy at each measurement. We compare, via
simulation, the efficiency and sensitivity of our new method with several
existing measurement sequence design strategies. Our results show quantifiable
improvements in sensing performance. We also show analytically that our entropy
reduction approach, reduces, under certain simplified conditions, to a
well-known and widely used measurement strategy.

Abstract: Key quantum features like coherence are the fundamental resources enabling
quantum advantages and ascertaining their presence in quantum systems is
crucial for developing quantum technologies. This task, however, faces severe
challenges in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. On one hand,
experimental data are typically scarce, rendering full state reconstruction
infeasible. On the other hand, these features are usually quantified by highly
nonlinear functionals that elude efficient estimations via existing methods. In
this work, we propose a scalable protocol for estimating coherence from scarce
data and further experimentally demonstrate its practical utility. The key
innovation here is to relax the potentially NP-hard coherence estimation
problem into a computationally efficient optimization. This renders the
computational cost in our protocol insensitive to the system size, in sharp
contrast to the exponential growth in traditional methods. This work opens a
novel route toward estimating coherence of large-scale quantum systems under
data-scarce conditions.

Motivation: Achieving practical quantum advantage requires optimizing quantum computing resources, making runtime reduction a critical focus.

Method: Proposed a two-step protocol involving syndrome measurements and combining it with the TELS protocol for enhanced performance.

Result: The protocol outperforms TELS in most cases and achieves over 50% runtime reduction when combined.

Conclusion: The proposed protocol is applicable to various quantum computing architectures and represents a fundamental step in optimizing runtime for practical quantum computing.

Abstract: Runtime optimization of the quantum computing within a given computational
resource is important to achieve practical quantum advantage. In this paper, we
propose a runtime reduction protocol for the lattice surgery, which utilizes
the soft information corresponding to the logical measurement error. Our
proposal is a simple two-step protocol: operating the lattice surgery with the
small number of syndrome measurement cycles, and reexecuting it with full
syndrome measurement cycles in cases where the time-like soft information
catches logical error symptoms. We firstly discuss basic features of the
time-like complementary gap as the concrete example of the time-like soft
information based on numerical results. Then, we show that our protocol
surpasses the existing runtime reduction protocol called temporally encoded
lattice surgery (TELS) for the most cases. In addition, we confirm that the
combination of our protocol and the TELS protocol can reduce the runtime
further, over 50% in comparison to the naive serial execution of the lattice
surgery. The proposed protocol in this paper can be applied to any quantum
computing architecture based on the lattice surgery, and we expect that this
will be one of the fundamental building blocks of runtime optimization to
achieve practical scale quantum computing.

Abstract: Post-selecting against quantum jumps into the ground state confines the
evolution of the three-level system to the excited states manifold, effectively
realizing a PT-symmetric non-Hermitian qubit. In this work, by introducing
post-selection efficiencies for both decay channels, the second-excited to
first-excited and the first-excited to ground-state transitions, we formulate a
hybrid-Liouvillian framework that captures the unmonitored dynamics of the
non-Hermitian qubit. We find that the decoherence effects arising from quantum
jumps within the second-excited and first-excited manifold also manifest under
inefficient post-selection of the second-excited to first-excited transitions,
thereby modifying the spectral properties of the Liouvillian and leading to a
splitting of the exceptional points. A comparative analysis shows that the
trajectory-based approach, obtained by ensemble-averaging stochastic
measurement trajectories generated via the Bayesian state update rule, and the
Lindblad evolution remain consistent. Our results highlight the fundamental
role of measurement inefficiency in realizing post-selection-based
non-Hermitian qubits and in shaping the structure of Liouvillian exceptional
points. These findings provide new insights into how inefficient measurement
processes influence non-Hermitian behavior in open quantum systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of multivariate time-series
forecasting using quantum machine learning techniques. We introduce adaptation
strategies that extend variational quantum circuit models, traditionally
limited to univariate data, toward the multivariate setting, exploring both
purely quantum and hybrid quantum-classical formulations. First, we extend and
benchmark several VQC-based and hybrid architectures to systematically evaluate
their capacity to model cross-variable dependencies. Second, building upon
these foundations, we introduce the iQTransformer, a novel quantum transformer
architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention mechanism within the
iTransformer framework, enabling a quantum-native representation of
inter-variable relationships. Third, we provide a comprehensive empirical
evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that
quantum-based models may achieve competitive or superior forecasting accuracy
with fewer trainable parameters and faster convergence than state-of-the-art
classical and quantum baselines in some cases. These contributions highlight
the potential of quantum-enhanced architectures as efficient and scalable tools
for advancing multivariate time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate ground-state calculations on noisy quantum computers are
fundamentally limited by restricted ansatz expressivity and unavoidable
hardware errors. We introduce a hybrid-quantum classical framework that
simultaneously addresses these challenges. Our method systematically purifies
noisy two electron reduced density matrices from quantum devices by enforcing
N-representability conditions through efficient semidefinite programming,
guided by a norm-based distance constraint to the experimental data. To
implement this constraint, we develop a hardware efficient calibration protocol
based on Clifford circuits. We demonstrate near full configuration interaction
accuracy for ground-state energies of H2, LiH, and H4, and compute precise
scattering intensities for C6H8 on noisy hardware. This approach surpasses
conventional methods by simultaneously overcoming both ansatz limitations and
hardware noise, establishing a scalable route to quantum advantage and marking
a critical step toward reliable simulations of complex molecularnsystems on
noisy devices.

Motivation: It presents a novel approach to unify DV and CV quantum systems to enable design of hybrid protocols and benchmarking across different architectures.

Method: The method uses tomographic probability representation, Jordan-Schwinger map, and compatible probabilistic measurements to bridge DV and CV systems.

Result: They successfully construct a unified framework for comparing and transferring quantum information, which facilitates hybrid protocols and practical applications.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for practical applications in quantum communication and computation by bridging hybrid quantum systems.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems that combine discrete-variable (DV) and
continuous-variable (CV) architectures represent a promising direction in
quantum information science. However, transferring concepts and methods between
such fundamentally different platforms entails both practical and theoretical
challenges. The formalisms of these two "universes" differ significantly, and
many notions, although sharing the same names, possess distinct properties and
physical interpretations. In this work, we construct a bridge between DV and CV
systems by means of the tomographic probability representation of quantum
states complemented by the Jordan-Schwinger map. We connect observable random
variables such as spin projections, photon numbers, or quadratures arising in
DV and CV architectures through their probabilistic representations, namely
spin, photon-number, and symplectic tomograms, as well as the Wigner function.
This makes it possible to directly obtain the tomogram in one architecture from
measurement data in another, thereby reconstructing the corresponding state
across representations realizing similar statistics. The proposed formalism
enables a unified framework for comparing and transferring quantum information
across different hardware platforms. This facilitates the design of hybrid
protocols where, for example, spin-based quantum memories interface with
photonic communication channels or CV bosonic codes. It also provides a
practical tool for benchmarking quantum devices, validating algorithms across
heterogeneous architectures, and exploring error correction schemes that rely
on mappings between finite- and infinite-dimensional systems.

Abstract: From "surreal" trajectories to which-way measurements, Basil Hiley had a
lesson: claims of falsifying the Bohmian model do not withstand scrutiny
provided the model is applied correctly. In this work we compute de
Broglie-Bohm trajectories for particles tunneling in coupled waveguides
relevant to a recent experiment having claimed to challenge the Bohmian model.
We show that the Bohmian model - correctly applied - gives results identical to
the standard quantum approach, first by working out a simple one-dimensional
model, and then by computing Bohmian trajectories for the full two-dimensional
problem representing a quantum particle propagating inside coupled waveguides.
We further recall the contextual nature of the Bohmian trajectories whereby the
trajectories of a closed system differ from the ones observed when an
interaction with a measurement apparatus takes places.

### [51] [Quantum Similarity-Driven QUBO Framework for Multi-Period Supply Chain Allocation using Time-Multiplexed Coherent Ising Machines and Simulated Quantum Annealing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21544)
*Rushikesh Ubale,Yasar Mulani,Abhay Suresh,Gregory Byrd,Sangram Deshpande,B. R. Nikilesh,Sanya Nanda*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A hybrid QUBO framework based on a Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) and simulated quantum annealing (SQA) successfully addresses the multi-period SKU allocation problem in supply chains by integrating a quantum-derived similarity kernel, exact capacity enforcement, and time-multiplexed processing. The model achieved superior results with high profit, reduced redundancy, and optimal resource utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The efficient allocation of stock-keeping units (SKUs) in multi-period supply chains is a complex optimization problem balancing profitability, operational constraints, and diversity. Quantum computing offers a promising approach to solving such NP-hard problems, and this work aims to demonstrate the practical application of hybrid quantum-classical methods in real-world supply chain optimization.

Method: The researchers developed a hybrid QUBO framework that combines three key innovations: a quantum-derived similarity kernel using variational RX embedding to prevent redundant SKU selections, exact per-period capacity enforcement through slack-bit encoding for feasibility, and execution on a time-multiplexed CIM benchmarked against SQA and classical algorithms.

Result: The framework achieved an energy of -2.95×10¹⁶ on a dataset of 500 SKUs across eight periods, resulting in 288 distinct SKUs (60% of the catalog), 226,813 allocated units, and $12.75 million in profit, all without capacity violations. This demonstrates the effectiveness of hybrid quantum-classical approaches at an industrial scale.

Conclusion: This study showcases the potential of leveraging quantum computing for complex supply chain optimization problems, providing a scalable and efficient solution that addresses the limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Multi-period stock-keeping unit (SKU) allocation in supply chains is a
combinatorial optimization problem that is both NP-hard and operationally
critical, requiring simultaneous attention to profitability, feasibility, and
diversity. Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) provides a
principled framework for such tasks, yet prior studies often rely on simplified
assumptions or omit real operational constraints.
  This work proposes a hybrid QUBO framework integrating three advances: (i) a
quantum-derived similarity kernel, obtained from a variational RX embedding, to
discourage redundant SKU selections; (ii) exact per-period capacity enforcement
via slack-bit encoding to maintain feasibility; and (iii) execution on a
time-multiplexed Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) benchmarked against simulated
quantum annealing (SQA) and classical optimization algorithms. The resulting
model, with over one million quadratic terms and about 4,100 variables,
captures profit, risk, and capacity interactions within a unified formulation.
  On a dataset of 500 SKUs across eight planning periods, Quanfluence's CIM
achieved an energy of minus 2.95 times 10 to the power of 16, producing robust
solutions with 288 distinct SKUs (approximately 60 percent of the catalog),
226,813 allocated units, and 12.75 million dollars profit, all with zero
capacity violations. These results demonstrate that hybrid quantum-classical
QUBO methods can deliver feasible and profitable supply-chain allocations at an
industrial scale.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with complex eigenenergies are useful tools for
describing the dynamics of open quantum systems. In particular, parity and time
(\PT) symmetric Hamiltonians have generated interest due to the emergence of
exceptional-point degeneracies, where both eigenenergies and eigenvectors
coalesce as the energy spectrum transitions from real- to complex-valued.
Because of the abrupt spectral response near exceptional points, such systems
have been proposed as candidates for precision quantum sensing. In this work,
we emulate a passive \PT~dimer using a two-mode, non-Hermitian system of
superconducting qubits comprising one high-coherence qubit coupled to an
intentionally lossy qubit via a tunable coupler. The loss is introduced by
strongly coupling the qubit to a continuum of photonic modes in an open
waveguide environment. Using both pulsed and continuous-wave measurements, we
characterize the system dynamics near the exceptional point. We observe a
behavior broadly consistent with an ideal passive \PT~dimer with some
corrections due to the tunable coupler element. We extract the complex
eigenenergies associated with the two modes and calculate the sensitivity as a
function of the coupling strength. Confirming theoretical predictions, we
observe no sensitivity enhancement near the quantum exceptional point. This
study elucidates the limitations of exceptional-point systems as candidates for
quantum-enhanced sensing.

Motivation: The paper is likely motivated by the desire to understand the connection between fundamental quantum mechanics and its limits or analogues under extreme conditions, such as high energies or relativistic speeds.

Method: The authors use a systematic approach, breaking down the problem into six key contributions outlined in the paper.

Result: The paper presents several key findings, including the construction of a potential-dependent reparametrization, derivation of a Schwarzian relation, establishment of equivalent continuity equations, derivation of a dispersion relation and classical limit, and the demonstration of unitary evolution in an $L^2(R_t)$ Hilbert space. Additionally, the authors provide examples of exact solutions and controlled perturbations.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes a comprehensive framework for understanding the dynamics and solutions of the Carroll-Schr\"odinger equation, providing new insights into the behavior of quantum systems under specific transformations and conditions.

Abstract: We investigate precise structural relations between the standard
Schr\"odinger equation and its Carrollian analogue-the Carroll-Schr\"odinger
equation-in 1+1 dimensions, with emphasis on dualities, potential maps, and
solution behavior. Our contributions proceed in the order of the paper: (i) we
encode both dynamics with operators $H$ and $F$ under external potentials and
explore conditions for obtaining the same type of solutions within both
formalisms; (ii) we construct a potential-dependent reparametrization $x =
\delta(t)$ mapping the space-independent Carroll equation to the
time-independent Schr\"odinger equation, and derive a Schwarzian relation that
specifies the map $\delta$ for any static $V_{sch}$ (with harmonic,
Coulomb-like, and free examples); (iii) we relate conserved densities and
currents by removing $V_{car}$ through a gauge transform followed by a
coordinate inversion, establishing equivalence of the continuity equations;
(iv) we obtain a Carrollian dispersion relation from an ultra-boost of the
energy-momentum two-vector and also derive the classical limit of the Carroll
wave equation via the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism; (v) we place Carroll dynamics
on an equal-$x$ Hilbert space $L^2(R_t)$, prove unitary $x$-evolution, and
illustrate dynamics with an exactly solvable Gaussian packet and finite-time
quantization for time-localized perturbations; and (vi) for general $V(x; t)$
we perform a gauge reduction to an interaction momentum and set up a controlled
Dyson expansion about solvable time profiles.

Abstract: An elementary particle such as a photon cannot be cut in two pieces. Still it
must be possible to truncate a photon with an optical shutter. The result is
not another photon or a mix of a photon and a vacuum. Instead it is a
superposition and mix of photon numbers up to infinity. This state is rather
complicated, but nevertheless locally equivalent to a single photon or vacuum
in disjoint regions. Finally we demonstrate how the truncated photon may be
illuminating and useful for the understanding of locality and equivalence in
quantum field theory.

Abstract: The time-dependence of multi-point observable correlation functions are
essential quantities in analysis and simulation of quantum dynamics. Open
quantum systems approaches utilize two-point correlations to describe the
influence of an environment on a system of interest, and in studies of chaotic
quantum system, the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) is used to probe
chaoticity of dynamics. In this work we analytically derive the time dependence
of multi-point observable correlation functions in quantum systems from a
random matrix theoretic approach, with the highest order function of interest
being the OTOC. We find in each case that dynamical contributions are related
to a simple function, related to the Fourier transform of coarse-grained
wave-functions. We compare the predicted dynamics to exact numerical
experiments in a spin chain for various physical observables. We comment on
implications towards the emergence of Markovianity and quantum regression in
closed quantum systems, as well as relate our results to known bounds on
chaotic dynamics.

Abstract: In the quantum world, the process of energy storage can be enhanced thanks to
various nonclassical phenomena. This inspiring fact suggests quantum batteries
as plausible sources of power for future quantum devices, at least in
principle. However, thermodynamically not all of the energy stored in a quantum
battery is useful for doing work. By considering a class of models based upon
quantum continuous variables, here we show how the maximum extractable energy
from a bosonic quantum battery can be intimately related to Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle. We found that realizing minimum uncertainty essentially
guarantees that all of the energy stored in a Gaussian quantum battery can be
withdrawn and used to do work. For a standard system where the charger and
battery are coupled linearly, this criterion is satisfied rather trivially.
However, our theoretical results demonstrate that - for a quantum battery with
nonlinear coupling - a state of minimum uncertainty can also be achieved
nontrivially via the generation of quantum squeezing. We characterize the
charging performance of our proposed continuous variable quantum batteries in
detail, and we hope that our theory may be useful in the design of a new
generation of efficient quantum batteries harnessing bosonic excitations, such
as those built with photonic architectures.

The LLRF system for the linac has to provide field and resonance control for a

Abstract: Recently, progress has been made in the theory of turbulence, which provides
a framework on how a deterministic process changes to a stochastic one owing to
the change in thermodynamic states. It is well known that, in the framework of
Newtonian mechanics, motions are dissipative; however, when subjected to
periodic motion, a system can produce nondissipative motions intermittently and
subject to resonance. It is in resonance that turbulence occurs in fluid flow,
solid vibration, thermal transport, etc. In this, the findings from these
physical systems are analyzed in the framework of statistics with their own
probability space to establish their compliance to the stochastic process. In
particular, a systematic alignment of the inception of the stochastic process
with the signed measure theory, signed probability space, and stochastic
process was investigated. It was found that the oscillatory load from the
dissipative state excited the system and resulted in a quasi-periodic
probability density function with the negative probability regimes. In
addition, the vectorial nature of the random velocity splits the probability
density function along both the positive and negative axes with slight
asymmetricity. By assuming that a deterministic process has a probability of 1,
we can express the inception of a stochastic process, and the subsequent
benefit is that a dynamic fractal falls on the probability density function.
Moreover, we leave some questions of inconsistency between the physical system
and the measurement theory for future investigation. We believe that the
establishment of the probability density function of resonance nondissipative
dynamics in contemporary statistics should make many mathematical tools
available and the analytical formulas for the random velocity and probability
density function can provide a convenient platform for the development of
statistics.

Abstract: Identifying the types of orbits is an important topic in the study of chaotic
dynamical systems. Beyond the well-known distinctly chaotic and regular
motions, we focus on dynamics occurring in regions where regular and chaotic
motions coexist and intertwine, which potentially indicating weakly chaotic
orbits. This intermediate regime lies between strongly chaotic dynamics,
characterized by exponential sensitivity and completely non-chaotic, purely
regular behavior. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework to
identify the types of orbits in the generalized kicked rotator system, which is
challenging to study due to its complex and mixed chaotic behaviors. Our deep
learning framework can be divided into two steps. First, we propose a novel
algorithm that integrates the weighted Birkhoff average, the Lyapunov exponent,
and the correlation dimension to identify weakly chaotic orbits. The algorithm
categorizes orbits into four types: weakly chaotic, strongly chaotic, and
regular orbits (which are further subdivided into resonant and non-resonant
orbits), thereby creating a valuable dataset required for deep learning models.
Second, we demonstrate that a well-trained 2D-CNN achieves high performance in
accurately classifying orbits, largely because it effectively leverages the 2D
structural information of the phase space relation. To our knowledge, this is
the first paper to identify weakly chaotic orbits using deep learning methods.
The method can be easily extend to other models.

Abstract: Given a triangulation of a closed orientable surface, we consider the lattice
with sites at the vertices, edges and facets of the triangulation. Borrowing
from mathematics literature, we introduce on this lattice a pair of
tight-binding Hamiltonians derived from the boundary and Poincar\'e duality
maps of finite simplicial manifolds. These Hamiltonians have been proved to
have clean topological spectral gaps carrying non-trivial Chern numbers in the
limit of infinite refinement of the triangulation. We confirm this via
numerical simulations, and demonstrate how these models enable topological edge
modes at the surfaces of real-world objects. Furthermore, we describe a
metamaterial whose dynamics reproduces that of the proposed model, thus
bringing the topological metamaterials closer to real-world applications.

Abstract: We generalize the gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries by inserting Majorana
fermions, establishing parallel duality correspondences for bosonic and
fermionic lattice systems. Using this fermionic gauging, we construct fermionic
analogs of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories dual to the transverse-field Ising
model, interpretable as Majorana stabilizer codes. We demonstrate a unitary
equivalence between the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory obtained by gauging the
fermion parity of a free fermionic system and the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$
gauge theory with potentially nonlocal terms on the square lattice with
toroidal geometry. This equivalence is implemented by a linear-depth local
unitary circuit, connecting the bosonic and fermionic toric codes through a
direction-dependent anyonic transmutation. The gauge theory obtained by gauging
fermion parity is further shown to be equivalent to a folded Ising chain
obtained via the Jordan--Wigner transformation. We clarify the distinction

Abstract: The generic Mott transition in one-dimensional quantum systems can be
described by the sine-Gordon model with a tilt via bosonization. Because the
configuration space of the sine-Gordon model separates into distinct
topological sectors, standard local Monte Carlo schemes are limited to very
small system sizes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the smooth worm
(SmoWo) Monte Carlo algorithm which enlarges the configuration space to allow
smooth transitions between topological sectors. The method combines worm
updates with event-chain Monte Carlo moves. We explicitly prove its validity
and quantify its performance. Thanks to the substantial acceleration achieved
by the SmoWo algorithm, we are able to simulate large system sizes, providing a
precise picture of the different phases and critical behaviour of the
sine-Gordon model.

Conclusion:  establishes an effective mechanism for ultrafast control of correlated electronic phases in van der Waals heterostructures, opening new avenues for applications in optoelectronics and quantum matter science.

Abstract: Photoexcitation has been utilized to control quantum matter and to uncover
metastable phases far from equilibrium. Among demonstrations to date, the most
common is the photo-induced transition from correlated insulators to metallic
states; however, the reverse process without initial orders has not been
observed. Here, we show ultrafast metal-to-insulator transition in gate-doped
WS2/WSe2 and WSe2/WSe2 moir\'e devices using photo-thermionic hole injection
from graphite gates. The resulting correlated insulators are metastable, with
lifetimes exceeding microseconds. These findings establish an effective

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials have
become a rich playground for the exploration of correlated quantum phases, and
recent studies have begun to probe their non-equilibrium dynamics under
femtosecond laser excitation. In a time-resolved experiment, optical excitation
of the multilayer structure can lead not only to rich dynamic responses from
the target layers, such as moir\'e interfaces, but also to additional device
functionality from the layer degree of freedom. Here, we investigate optical
excitation in a prototypical moir\'e device of dual-gated twisted WSe2
bilayers, with few-layer graphite gates and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
spacers. We establish an ultrafast photodoping mechanism in the moir\'e bilayer
from photo-thermionic emission of the graphite gates. Using transient
reflectance experiments, we reveal photo-induced hole injection evidenced by:
(i) a shift of gate voltages at which optical signatures of correlated
insulators are observed, (ii) a persistent optical signature indicative of
charge diffusion at microsecond timescales and local charge buildup from
pulse-to-pulse accumulation, and (iii) photoinduced absorption due likely to
transient formation of correlated insulators. We further demonstrate that the
injected holes can be selectively controlled by tuning the excitation energy,
fluence, and gate bias.

Conclusion: Accurate identification of electron-nuclear level scheme is crucial for understanding low-temperature properties of rare-earth compounds with spin-active nuclei.

Abstract: We investigated electron-nuclear spin entanglement in the paramagnetic ground
state of the Ho-based cubic compound HoCo2Zn20. From analyses of magnetization
and specific heat data, we determined the cubic crystalline electric field
(CEF) parameters, the magnetic exchange constant, and the hyperfine coupling
constant between the 4f magnetic moment and the 165Ho nuclear spin. Our results
show that the Gamma5 CEF ground state is split by the hyperfine coupling, with
an energy width of 1.3 K at 0 T, and that the true paramagnetic ground state is
a quasi-sextet arising primarily from entanglement between the f-electron
effective spin S = 1 and the 165Ho nuclear spin I = 7/2. We further demonstrate
that, depending on the CEF parameters, the paramagnetic ground state can switch
to an electron-nuclear coupled dectet. These findings underscore the importance
of accurately identifying the electron-nuclear level scheme for understanding
the low-temperature properties of rare-earth compounds containing spin-active
nuclei.

Conclusion: Determined CEF Hamiltonian parameters enable揭开 field-induced magnetic集体現象，以及 potential pathways to magnetic frustrations

Abstract: An indispensable step toward understanding magnetic interaction in rare-earth
magnets is the determination of spatially anisotropic single-ion properties
resulting from the crystal electric field (CEF) physics. The CEF Hamiltonian
exhibits a discrete energy spectrum governed by a set of independent parameters
that reflect the site symmetry of the magnetic ion. However, experimentally
determining these parameters for magnetic ions at low-symmetry sites has been
proven highly challenging. In this study, we directly measured the CEF level
splitting under magnetic fields (B) using optical spectroscopy and extracted
both CEF parameters and the exchange energies of a triangular insulating magnet
CsErSe$_2$ as a model system. With increasing field, we find many CEF levels
undergo level-crossing, which accompanies switching of the eigenstate.
Particularly, such a crossing occurring at the ground state results in a
step-like increase in magnetization that we captured with the low-temperature
AC magnetic susceptibility measurements. Our work demonstrates that the
accurately determined CEF Hamiltonian parameters enable uncovering the rich
physics of field-induced collective magnetic phenomena, and potentially lead to
a new route to magnetic frustration.

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: Design and build a compact Bitter-type electromagnet for cold atom experiments with excellent field uniformity and efficient thermal management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zeeman slowing of cold atoms is a fundamental quantum metrology tool, and requires spatially uniform magnetic fields for precise measurement. Efficient and compact magnet systems are essential for reducing experimental losses and improving atom trapping and imaging.

Method: The magnet is constructed using stacked copper arcs separated by PTFE spacers, varying the spacer thickness to produce a spatially-dependent magnetic field. The coil operates at 200 A with an electrical resistance of 26.5 mΩ and self-inductance of 19.1 µH. The design includes a compact 30-cm-long package and efficient thermal management by water circulation through copper and spacers.

Result: The magnet achieves a fast electrical switching time of approximately 180 µs, demonstrating reliable and controllable operation. Continuous operation at 200 A for 36 s results in a temperature rise of about 5°C, indicating robust thermal management.

Conclusion: This compact, high-performance Bitter-type electromagnet meets the requirements for Zeeman slowing in cold atom experiments, offering a solution for precise measurement with efficient thermal management.

Abstract: We describe the design, construction, and characterization of a Bitter-type
electromagnet that produces a spatially-dependent magnetic field used for
Zeeman slowing in cold-atom experiments. The coil consists of stacked copper
arcs separated by PTFE spacers of varying thicknesses, generating a
near-optimal field profile using a single power supply. With an electrical
resistance of $26.5(3)$~m$\Omega$ and self-inductance of $19.1(1)$~$\mu$H, our
design achieves a fast electrical switching time of $\tau \approx 180$~$\mu$s
in a compact, 30-cm-long package. Water circulating helically through holes in
the copper and channels in the spacers ensures efficient thermal management,
limiting the temperature rise to $\sim 5^\circ$~C over $36$~s of continuous
operation at $200$~A.

Abstract: Rydberg atomic radio-frequency (rf) sensors are an emerging technology
platform that relies on vaporous atoms, interrogated with laser beams and
nearly ionized, to receive rf signals. Rydberg rf sensors have a number of
interesting fundamental distinctions from traditional receiver technologies,
such as those based on metallic antennas, since they are governed by the
quantum physics of atom-light interactions. As Rydberg sensors quickly advance
from laboratory experiments into fieldable devices, there is a need for a
general software modeling tool that fully encompasses the internal physics of
the sensor. The Rydberg Interactive Quantum Module (RydIQule) is a Python
package designed to fill this need. The initial public release of RydIQule in
late 2023 built the core functionality described above. Here we outline
RydIQule's version 2 release which expands on its capabilities to more

### [74] [Exact formulation of Huygens' principle in terms of generalized spatiotemporal-dipole secondary sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20825)
*Gavin R. Putland*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: A generalized spatiotemporal dipole (GSTD) source is defined with adjustable delay and attenuation parameters, allowing for targeted wave cancellation. The Kirchhoff integral theorem is shown to align with such secondary source distributions, offering a geometrical-optical explanation for wave suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding advanced wave sources and their applications in wave control or imaging is key in fields like acoustics or optics, making this analysis relevant for such studies.

Method: Mathematical analysis of wave sources and Kirchhoff integrals, with consideration of delay and attenuation parameters.

Result: GSTD sources provide a flexible method for wave cancellation, validated through the Kirchhoff theorem.

Conclusion: This work extends dipole concepts, offering potential for precise wave manipulation applications.

Abstract: A "spatiotemporal dipole" wave source, as defined by D.A.B. Miller (1991),
differs from an ordinary ("spatial") dipole source in that the inverted
monopole is delayed relative to the uninverted monopole, the delay being equal
to the propagation time from one monopole to the other. A "generalized"
spatiotemporal dipole (GSTD), as defined here, is generalized in two ways:
first, the delay may be smaller in absolute value (but not larger) than the
propagation time, so that the radiated waves cancel at a certain angle from the
axis of the dipole; second, one monopole may be attenuated relative to the
other, so that the cancellation is exact at a finite distance - on a circle
coaxial with the dipole.
  I show that the Kirchhoff integral theorem, for a single monopole primary
source, gives the same wave function as a certain distribution of GSTD
secondary sources on the surface of integration. In the GSTDs, the
"generalized" delay allows the surface of integration to be general (not
necessarily a primary wavefront), whereas the attenuation allows an exact match
of the wave function even in the near field of the primary source. At each
point on the surface of integration, the circle of cancellation of the GSTD
secondary source passes through the primary source, which therefore receives no
backward secondary waves, while the direction of specular reflection of the
primary wave passes through the same circle, giving a geometrical-optical
explanation of the suppression of backward secondary waves at any field point.

Abstract: A tutorial on opto-electronic clock regeneration at very high bit rates

loop); two examples are considered, an input signal frequency step and a slow
input signal frequency. Next we discuss opto-electronic clock recovery based on
an OPLL (opto-electronic PLL). The OPLL contains a phase comparator consisting
of a planar LiNbO3 waveguide, a lowpass filter, a VCO (voltage controlled
oscillator) and a local oscillator laser. The error signal from the comparator
determined by the difference in electrical phase between the signal and the VCO
controls the VCO. The VCO has two outputs; one that modulates the local
oscillator laser and another that triggers a decision circuit that samples the
output from the OPLL. The VCO is continuously adjusted by the OPLL so that it
will ensure sampling of the signal in the optimal moments.

Abstract: Programmable photonic computers necessitate the integration of
electrically-tunable compact components into the photonic devices. In the
state-of-the-art photonic quantum computers~(PQCs), phase-shift and
displacement gates can be implemented in an electrically-programmable way. An
efficient PQC, however, necessitates also the tuning of third or higher order
nonlinearity for implementing continuous-variable~(CV) gates at a shorter
sequence. Here, we demonstrate that such an optical component can be designed
using Fano interference and Stark effect in a nonlinear nano-plasmonic system.
We study the coupling of a broadband bright plasmon mode to a narrow linewidth
quantum object(s), QO(s). We show that by shifting the level-spacing of the QO
via Stark effect, one can continuously tune the third-order nonlinearity gate
within a picosecond response time. We also present finite-difference time
domain~(FDTD) simulations that take the retardation effects into account. In
addition, we also show that enhancement due to Fano interference degrades if
the QOs are positioned randomly as each QO introduces different phases. This
reveals the importance of the spatial extent of the QO-ensemble to be employed
in the experiments.

on top of its core components. We demonstrate Pty-Chi's capabilities through
challenging case studies that involve limited coherence, low overlap, and
unstable illumination during scanning, which highlight its accuracy,

Abstract: Photon echo (PE) techniques offer a promising approach to optical quantum
memory, yet their implementation in conventional platforms, such as
rare-earth-ion-doped crystals, is hindered by limited bandwidths. Semiconductor
quantum dot (QD) ensembles, featuring THz-scale inhomogeneous broadening and
sub-picosecond dynamics, provide an attractive alternative for ultrafast
applications. However, achieving coherent control across such broad spectral
ranges remains challenging due to detuning and spatial field inhomogeneities,
which reduce PE efficiency. In this work, we experimentally demonstrated
adiabatic rapid passage (ARP)-enhanced PE in dense, self-assembled InAs QD
ensembles exhibiting THz-scale inhomogeneous broadening and operating at
telecom wavelengths, achieving a 3.2-fold increase in echo efficiency. Chirped
control pulses designed to satisfy adiabatic conditions across the ensemble
enable broadband rephasing. Numerical simulations based on a two-level model
reproduce the key experimental observations, including the ARP-induced
enhancement, thereby validating the underlying physical picture. These results
establish ARP as a robust and scalable approach for coherent control in InAs QD
ensembles, with potential applications for ultrafast and broadband optical
communication in the THz spectral region.

Abstract: This study examines the influence of optical turbulence on field statistics
using a nonlinear reconstruction and quantum phase-space formalism.
Turbulence-distorted intensity sequences were processed through a nonlinear
P3-type partial differential equation to retrieve the embedded phase, thereby
reconstructing the complete complex optical field. The recovered fields were
subsequently projected onto a Gaussian local oscillator to generate quadrature
ensembles, enabling Wigner function tomography via Radon inversion.
Photon-number distributions were obtained from the overlap of the reconstructed
Wigner functions with Fock-state kernels, allowing direct evaluation of
statistical moments and the Fano factor. Comparative analysis across four
experimental configurations, Set 1: uncorrected turbulence, Set 2: turbulence
with a single PMMA slab, Set 3: turbulence with dual PMMA slabs, and Set 4:
free-space reference revealed the modification of phase noise and photon
statistics due to partial compensation. Notably, the evolution of the Fano
factor traced the transition among Poissonian, super-Poissonian, and
near-sub-Poissonian regimes, quantitatively capturing the degree of turbulence
mitigation achieved by the PMMA elements. This framework establishes a
quantitative link between turbulence-induced phase distortions and quantum
statistical behavior of reconstructed optical fields.

Abstract: Electromagnetic temporal boundaries, emerging when the constitutive
parameters of a medium undergo abrupt temporal variations, have garnered
significant interest for their role in facilitating unconventional wave
phenomena and enabling sophisticated field manipulations. A key manifestation
is temporal reflection in an unbounded spatial domain, where a sudden temporal
discontinuity induces phase-conjugated backward waves alongside anomalous spin
conversion. This study explores distinctive spin-conversion dynamics at a
time-dependent spatial interface governed by Lorentz-type dispersion, in which
the plasma frequency undergoes rapid modulation over time. The interaction of a
circularly polarized wave with a space-time interface excites electromagnetic
signals at the system's natural resonance, allowing precise control over
polarization states. The scattered field stems from the combined influence of
temporal and spatial boundaries, yielding a superposition of the original
incident wave's polarization and its phase-conjugated counterpart.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating wave dynamics in metamaterials for potential applications in nonlinear optics and photonics

Method: Vector Ginzburg-Landau equation solved using split-step Fourier method

Result: Display of various wave structures and their interactions in a quadratic potential well

Conclusion: Model provides insights into controlling optical wave behavior through nonlinear effects and gain

Abstract: A simplified mathematical model is suggested to describe the dynamics of a
quasi-monochromatic optical wave in the bulk of an effectively isotropic
metamaterial with averaged dielectrical permittivity near zero (ENZ medium), in
the presence of a weak spatial nonuniformity, Kerr nonlinearity as well as
linear gain due to external pumping. The model is a vector Ginzburg-Landau
equation of the general kind, with the dominating curl-curl term in the
dispersive operator, and it resembles the equation for electromagnetic waves in
plasma [E. A. Kuznetsov, 1974]. In the case of purely real Kerr coefficients, a
split-step Fourier method is appropriate for numerical simulations. It makes
possible to observe various variants of nontrivial evolution of both
central-symmetric and toroidal vector wave structures trapped by a quadratic
potential well, as well as nonlinear interaction between the longitudinal and
transverse waves in the case of their combination.

Abstract: Coherent control of quantum emitters is essential for scalable quantum
photonic technologies. The recently proposed swing-up of quantum emitter
(SUPER) scheme enables the coherent preparation of excitons via off-resonant,
red-detuned laser pulses, offering highly efficient single-photon generation.
We present a systematic study of SUPER excitation applied to a single GaAs
quantum dot in a low-Q micropillar cavity. After identifying optimal excitation
conditions, we benchmark the SUPER scheme against above-band, p-shell, and
two-photon biexciton excitation (TPE). Despite requiring higher excitation
powers, SUPER achieves near-unity population inversion ($\sim$95 %) and high
single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}=0.03$), comparable to TPE, while also yielding a
shortened exciton decay time ($\sim$200 ps), indicative of direct, efficient
exciton preparation. A polarization-resolved analysis reveals that, when both
excitation and collection are aligned with the exciton dipole, SUPER results in
a highly polarized single-photon emission exceeding resonant TPE saturation by
a factor of 1.45. Under optimal excitation conditions, we also observe
biexciton preparation via a distinct SUPER resonance, confirmed by unpolarized
exciton emission, extended lifetime due to the biexciton-exciton cascade, and
biexciton emission, constituting the first experimental demonstrations of
biexciton preparation under SUPER. These findings are in good agreement with a
proposed four-level theoretical model including the biexciton. We also report
that, strikingly, a slight misalignment of laser polarization induces an
additional SUPER resonance that selectively populates the orthogonal exciton
state without altering the nominal excitation polarization. These findings
establish the SUPER scheme as a versatile tool for state-selective exciton and
biexciton control, with strong potential for quantum photonic applications.

Abstract: Narrow-linewidth lasers are vital for a broad range of scientific and
technological applications, including atomic clocks and precision sensing.
Achieving high frequency stability is often as critical as ensuring
scalability, portability, and cost-effectiveness in the development of low
noise laser systems. Conventional electro-optic stabilization techniques, such
as Pound-Drever-Hall locking to ultra-high-finesse resonators held in a vacuum
chamber, provide excellent performance but remain challenging to scale. Here,
we propose and experimentally demonstrate a cavity-coupled interferometric
laser stabilization technique implemented on a silicon photonic chip and
integrated with a compact, scalable micro-Fabry-P\'erot cavity. The vacuum-gap
optical cavity operates in air, achieving a quality factor of approximately
$2.0\times 10^9$ and a fractional frequency instability of $1.45\times
10^{-12}$ at one-second averaging time. Integration of the proposed technique
with the compact cavity yields more than 38-fold reduction in the laser's
integrated linewidth and nearly three orders of magnitude suppression of
frequency noise at 10 Hz offset frequency. The hybrid-integration of the
proposed photonic chip with the micro-Fabry-P\'erot cavity establishes a
scalable and portable route toward chip-integrated ultra-stable lasers, paving
the way for precision optical systems deployable beyond laboratory
environments.

Abstract: Imaging spatial mode profiles is important for understanding the behavior of
mechanical resonators. The recent development of phononic circuits has
increased the demand for a fast imaging method based on principles of coherent
detection. However, it becomes complicated to perform measurements on a large
surface area. Here, we present a frequency-detuned collimated-beam
interferometry measurement scheme with in-plane spatial resolution of about 6
um, which can provide information about the phase dynamics of the entire
mechanical oscillation cycle on a time scale of a few seconds. We employ a
stroboscopic pulse probing method to resolve high-frequency vibrational motion
with a standard CMOS camera. We use this setup to image megahertz frequency
resonant mode profiles present in a Valley-Hall topological triangular cavity,
over an area of more than 20 mm2. We relate the obtained data to numerical
simulations of the topological edge modes to reveal the relation between
backscattering and the mode profile distribution. The presented protocol can
become a staple for characterizing mesoscopic mechanical resonators.

Abstract: Complex Gaussian basis sets are optimized to accurately represent continuum
radial wavefunctions over the whole space. First, attention is put on the
technical ability of the optimization method to get more flexible series of
Gaussian exponents, in order to improve the accuracy of the fitting approach.
Second, an indirect fitting method is proposed, allowing for the oscillatory
behaviour of continuum functions to be conserved up to infinity as a factorized
asymptotic function, while the Gaussian representation is applied to some
appropriately defined distortion factor with limited spatial extension. As an
illustration, the method is applied to radial Coulomb functions with realistic
energy parameters. We also show that the indirect fitting approach keeps the
advantageous analytical structure of typical one-electron transition integrals
occurring in molecular ionization applications.

Abstract: Estimating reaction rates and chemical stability is fundamental, yet
efficient methods for large-scale simulations remain out of reach despite
advances in modeling and exascale computing. Direct simulation is limited by
short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and
struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction
network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational
cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like
harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point
searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by
overhead and numerical instability.
  This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical
representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal
Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal
transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the
potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling.
Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce
reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the
final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are
specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first,
modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and
Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and
practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding
theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.

Motivation: 研究 Braneworld 模型中引力坍缩的过程，特别是在带有额外维度的情况下，以及空间时间的外部描述，尤其是当它最终稳定下来时的行为。

Method: 使用了 Friedmann-Lemaitre 空间和 Vaidya 辐射气层来建模系统的内部和外部。通过比较和匹配这两个区域的解决方案，得出了系统的动态演化。在外部，考虑了 Vaidya 分析中光线的行为以及 Reissner Nordstrom 解的特性。通过详细分析系统内外的动力学行为，尤其是趋近于静态时的极限情况。

Result: 在 Braneworld 情景下，引力坍缩不会导致奇点的形成。相反，由于标量曲率的限制，系统保持稳定，并最终 settle into 静止的 RN 几何体。Brane 张力保持有限，即使在后期演化中当引力坍缩接近完成时。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了在 Braneworld 模型中，引力坍缩可以通过限制某些关键参数来避免奇点的形成。结果表明，在适当的条件下，Braneworld 拥有维持系统稳定的能力，可能是结构致密物质存在的一个自然机制。

Abstract: We investigate the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous dust cloud in the
Shtanov Sahni braneworld model, which incorporates an extra timelike dimension.
The interior of the collapsing configuration is modeled by a Friedmann Lemaitre
spacetime, while the exterior is described by a Vaidya radiation envelope that
eventually settles into a static Reissner Nordstrom (RN) geometry with a
positive tidal charge. Although a smooth matching between the interior and the
static exterior is precluded by the breakdown of Birkhoff's theorem in the
braneworld scenario, we show that as long as braneworld effects remain
significant, the brane tension stays finite. Consequently, the scalar curvature
remains bounded, thereby preventing the formation of a singularity.

Motivation: EMRIs are crucial for LISA, but their complexity poses data analysis challenges. Efficient detection is vital for LISA's scientific output.

Method: Semi-coherent, time-frequency search using frequency evolution modeled with SVD. Searches executed on GPU for efficiency.

Result: Detection achieved 94% probability at SNR=30 with error <1% on EMRI parameters. Efficient search enables LISA proposals.

Conclusion: Method successfully addresses EMRI detection challenges, supporting LISA's goals.

Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key sources of
gravitational waves for space-based detectors such as LISA. However, their
detection remains a major data analysis challenge due to the signals'
complexity and length. We present a semi-coherent, time-frequency search
strategy for detecting EMRI harmonics without relying on full waveform
templates. We perform an injection and search campaign of single
mildly-eccentric equatorial EMRIs in stationary Gaussian noise. The detection
statistic is constructed solely from the EMRI frequency evolution, which is
modeled phenomenologically using a Singular Value Decomposition basis. The
pipeline and the detection statistic are implemented in time-frequency,
enabling efficient searches over one year of data in approximately one hour on
a single GPU. The search pipeline achieves 94% detection probability at
$\mathrm{SNR} = 30$ for a false-alarm probability of $10^{-2}$, recovering the
frequency evolution of the dominant harmonic to 1% relative error. By mapping
the EMRI parameters consistent with the recovered frequency evolution, we show
that the semi-coherent detection statistic enables a sub-percent precision
estimation of the EMRI intrinsic parameters. These results establish a
computationally efficient framework for constructing EMRI proposals for the
LISA global fit.

Abstract: We study the thermodynamic topology and microscopic interaction properties of
charged black holes in RegMax gravity, focusing on the role of the coupling
parameter $\alpha$. Using the Duan topological current method together with
Ruppeiner geometry, we show that $\alpha$ controls a sharp change in phase
structure. Above a certain critical threshold, we find that the Duan defect
curve develops an intermediate branch and vertical tangency points, producing
continuous (second-order) critical behaviour. Furthermore, the Ruppeiner
curvature becomes negative at very small horizon radii before turning positive
and progressively vanishing at larger radii. By contrast, below the critical
value of the coupling, the intermediate black hole phase disappears, and the
system shows a simpler small/large first-order/coexistence behaviour driven by
free-energy competition. In this regime, the Ruppeiner curvature remains
predominantly positive. Overall, increasing $\alpha$ enriches the thermodynamic
topology (allowing for second-order criticality) while simultaneously reducing
the domain in which classical energy conditions (ECs) are satisfied, thus
linking exotic thermodynamic behaviour to more severe violations of standard
energy conditions.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of regular
black holes, driven by the search for singularity-free geometries. This
research has revealed intriguing similarities between the regularization
mechanisms used in black hole models and those employed in quantum field
theory, such as the introduction of exponential suppression or energy cutoffs.
We propose a systematic exponential cutoff regularization scheme for static,
spherically symmetric black hole solutions in general relativity. The method
explored in this paper serves as an alternative to the black-bounce singularity
suppression mechanism proposed by Simpson and Visser, which involves a
coordinate remapping $r \rightarrow\sqrt{r^2+a^2}$, as well as to the mechanism
proposed by Bronnikov, which employs a Bardeen-type remapping in the metric.
The method presented here introduces exponential factors in the mass function,
smoothing curvature divergences and ensuring geodesic completeness under
specific conditions. This approach allows the regularization of known singular
spacetimes without altering their asymptotic structure. We analyze curvature
invariants, horizon formation, and thermodynamic properties, showing that the
regularized geometries avoid singularities while maintaining physical
consistency. As examples of application, we regularize the Schwarzschild black
hole and present a novel regularized Kiselev solution. The method provides a
unified framework to systematically generate singularity-free black holes
within classical general relativity

Abstract: Using ray-tracing techniques, this paper investigates the optical and
polarization images of rotating black holes in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity
illuminated by thick accretion disks. We consider two accretion disk models:
the phenomenological model and the HOU disk model, where the phenomenological
model includes both isotropic and anisotropic radiation. In all models, the
external bright rings corresponding to the high-order image and the internal
dark region associated with the event horizon are observed. At high
observational inclinations, the inner shadows are obscured by the radiation
from the equatorial plane, which is significantly different from the thin
accretion disk model. The primary distinction between isotropic and anisotropic
radiation is that the latter causes distortion of the high-order image in the
vertical direction, resulting in an elliptical structure. For the HOU disk
model, due to certain regions are geometrically thinner under the conical
approximation, the high-order images are narrower compared to the
phenomenological model. Furthermore, we find that an increase in the rotational
parameter $a$ leads to an asymmetry in the intensity distribution of the
high-order image, while an increase in the spontaneous Lorentz violating
parameters, $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$, results in a decrease in the size of the
high-order image. In the polarization image, the linear polarization is found
to be significantly influenced by the intensity, while it is relatively less
affected by the parameters $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$. The electric vector
position angle is mainly affected by the parameters $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$.

Abstract: We investigate the superradiant instability of Kerr-Newman black holes in the
presence of a massive, charged scalar field using the Vieira-Bezerra-Kokkotas
(VBK) method. We study the solutions of the exact polynomial condition for
quasibound state frequencies and determine the domain of superradiant
instability in parameter space without relying on the hydrogenic approximation
or numerics. We derive the minimum scalar mass needed for quasibound states to
exist, and identify the precise overlap region between the quasibound and
superradiant conditions where instability can occur. Through a perturbative
analysis of the resonance equation, we obtain analytic expressions for the
instability boundaries and growth rates, and clarify their relation to previous
numerical results. Our analysis reveals how the instability region shifts from
nearly neutral Kerr black holes for light fields to highly charged
near-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes for heavier fields, while remaining
absent in the Reissner-Nordstrom limit.

Abstract: The most general searches for gravitational wave transients (GWTs) rely on
data analysis methods that do not assume prior knowledge of the signal
waveform, direction, or arrival time on Earth. These searches provide
data-driven signal reconstructions that are crucial both for testing available
emission models and for discovering yet-to-be-uncovered sources. Here, we
discuss progress in the detection performance of the coherent WaveBurst
second-generation pipeline (cWB-2G), which is highly adaptable to both
minimally modeled and model-informed searches for GWTs. Several search
configurations for GWTs are examined using approximately 14.8 days of
observation time from the third observing run by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). Recent
enhancements include a ranking statistic fully based on multivariate
classification with eXtreme Gradient Boosting, a thorough validation of the
statistical significance accuracy of GWT candidates, and a measurement of the
correlations of false alarms and simulated detections between different
concurrent searches. For the first time, we provide a comprehensive comparison
of cWB-2G performance on data from networks made of two and three detectors,
and we demonstrate the advantage of combining concurrent searches for GWTs of
generic morphology in a global observatory. This work offers essential insights
for assessing our data analysis strategies in ongoing and future LVK searches

Motivation: Understanding late-time cosmic acceleration is crucial for explaining dark energy. This model offers a modified gravitational theory to explore its effects.

Method: Used cosmological chronometers and Pantheon+SH0ES dataset to fit model parameters. Assuming a quadratic H(z) expansion.

Result: Accelerated expansion with q ≈ -0.435. Model shows behavior akin to quintessence and phantom models.

Conclusion: This suggests the modified gravity model provides a viable alternative to dark energy explanations of cosmic acceleration.

Abstract: We study the late-time cosmological expansion of a modified teleparallel
gravity model of type logarithmic type. This modified gravitational lagrangian
yields a cosmological constant term and also power-law corrections to the
teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) for small $\lambda$. By
using the cosmological chronometers and the type Ia supernove data from the
Pantheon+SH0ES dataset, we fit the parameters of the modified gravitational
dynamics assuming $H(z)$ parametrized by a quadratic expansion. The results
exhibit an accelerated expansion with parameter $q = - 0.435 \pm 0.028$. In
addition, we analyzed the effective energy density, pressure and state
parameter $\omega$. It turns out that, this modified gravitational theory
produces solutions similar to the quintessence and phantom models.

Conclusion: 文章提出了一种新兴的暗物质解释，与现有的重力理论不冲突，且在预测上与观测一致。

Abstract: We argue that the standard post-Newtonian expansion scheme used in General
Relativity leaves room for time-space components $g_{ti}$ of the metric to be
of the same order of the usual gravitational potential. We explore this
possibility and find that such leading order contributions to $g_{ti}$ are
related to the Coriolis field of Newton-Cartan gravity. We investigate the
possibility that Coriolis fields mimic dark matter effects in disk galaxies. We
find solutions from their field equations that sustain the velocity rotation
curves in the bulge region and beyond it, notably describing flattish velocity
profiles. We dub such solutions Dark Coriolis Fields.

Abstract: Exploring the influence of plasma on the light rays trajectories in the
vicinity of black holes is significat since that astrophysical black holes are
generally surrounded by a plasma medium. In this work, we analyze the null
geodesics in the space-time of rotating hairy Horndeski black holes immersed in
a plasma medium using the Hamilton-Jacobi method. By considering both uniform

effects on the black hole shadow. The impact of the hair parameter and the
inclination angle on the black hole shadow is also investigated. Finally, the
shadow results are compared with observational data of the Event Horizon

*Marco A. A. de Paula,Mustapha Azreg-Aïnou*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores the physics of regular black holes (RBHs) sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics (NED), comparing two specific models of electrically charged RBHs to the Reissner-Nordström (RN) black hole. While the two NED models are similar to the RN BH for lower charge-to-mass ratios, there are distinct differences at higher ratios. Observational data from Sagittarius A$^{*}$ and Messier 87$^{*}$ BHs places constraints on the charge-to-mass ratio of these RBHs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of black holes in different electromagnetic environments is crucial for testing general relativity and exploring alternative theories of gravity. This paper aims to shed light on how nonlinear electrodynamics can affect the properties of charged black holes.

Method: The study employs analytical and numerical methods to solve the Einstein-Maxwell equations for NED fields, focusing on the photon motion, shadow radius, and gravitational and kinematic redshifts in these spacetimes.

Result: For low charge-to-mass ratios, the two NED models are indistinguishable from the RN BH. However, for higher ratios, measurable differences emerge in the physical and geometric properties of the black holes. Observational data helps constrain the maximum possible charge-to-mass ratio for these RBHs.

Conclusion: This research contributes to our understanding of regular black holes by examining their behavior under nonlinear electrodynamics. The findings offer theoretical insights and practical constraints for future observational studies of black hole properties.

Abstract: Spacetimes arising from nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) are a good laboratory
for studying both the nature of regular black holes (RBH) solutions and the
imprints of nonlinear electromagnetic fields within this context. Over the past
few decades, NED-sourced black hole (BH) spacetimes have attracted considerable
attention, but electrically charged RBHs obtained in the so-called $F$
framework have been less addressed in the literature. We consider two members
of the h-family of electrically charged, fully RBHs that are solutions to
general relativity minimally coupled to NED. Because of their potential
astrophysical and astronomical applications, we mainly focus our investigation
on the motion of photons and its implications in the shadow radius and
gravitational and kinematic redshift, considering the effective geometry
followed by photons in NED. For a BH charge-to-mass ratio below some moderate
value, there is almost no way to distinguish these members (and likely all
members) of the h-family from the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) BH. In its turn,
for a BH charge-to-mass ratio above some moderate value, we observe
discrepancies in their physical and geometric properties in comparison to those
of the RN BH. Furthermore, we also consider observational data for Sagittarius
A$^{*}$ and Messier 87$^{*}$ BHs to impose some constraints on the
charge-to-mass ratio of the fully RBHs.

Abstract: We consider the scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (sEGB) $4d$ gravitational model
with a scalar field $\varphi\left(u\right)$, Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet terms.
The model action contains a potential term $U\left(\varphi\right)$, a
Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $f\left(\varphi\right)$ and a parameter
$\varepsilon = \pm 1$, where $\varepsilon = 1$ corresponds to the ordinary
scalar field, and $\varepsilon = -1$ to the phantom field. In this paper we
applied the sEGB reconstruction procedure from our previous work
\cite{Er_Ivash} to the Y{\i}lmaz-Rosen metric, a solution potentially
describing a quasi-black hole without an event horizon. Within this framework,
we also derived analytical solutions based on scalar-tensor theory with minimal
coupling.
  Our results indicate that for this configuration, the potential $U$ vanishes
and the scalar field is phantom-like. Furthermore, an analysis of the Einstein
equations in the Y{\i}lmaz-Rosen metric reveals that all energy conditions are
violated. The corresponding energy-momentum tensor suggests the presence of
exotic matter with negative pressure, as indicated by the negative value of
$T_u^u$. This could originate from a scalar field (such as the Higgs field or
another nonlinear field), or from phenomena like dark energy or quintessence.
  In addition, we considered the application of our reconstruction method in
the sEGB model in the Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) metric. As noted in this
paper, the Y{\i}lmaz-Rosen metric is a limiting case of the Janus metric (as $s
\to +\infty$). Furthermore, we obtained some exact solutions of scalar-tensor
theory with minimal coupling in the JNW metric.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the asymptotic structure of the Fefferman-Graham ambient metric, proving that every straight ambient metric admits a conformal completion with a well-defined null infinity. The expansion at infinity is related to that at the homothetic horizon, and in even dimensions, the Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor arises. The paper identifies a set of conformally covariant conditions that characterize the ambient metric, relaxing the requirement of the homothety one-form being exact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to delve into the asymptotic behavior of the Fefferman-Graham ambient metric, particularly in the context of conformal structures. The authors aim to uncover deeper geometric insights and establish conditions that can uniquely determine the ambient metric from a conformal perspective.

Method: The authors use a combination of differential geometric techniques and conformal analysis to study the asymptotic properties of the Fefferman-Graham ambient metric. They consider the structure of the metric at infinity and analyze the relationship between the expansions at infinity and at the homothetic horizon. In even dimensions, they specifically examine the role of the Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor in the geometry at infinity.

Result: The key results of the paper include the proof that every straight ambient metric admits a conformal completion with a well-defined null infinity. The asymptotic expansion of the metric is successfully related to that at the homothetic horizon. Additionally, the Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor naturally arises in the geometry at infinity in even dimensions. The authors identify a comprehensive set of conformally covariant conditions that completely characterize the ambient metric, achieving a significant relaxation of the requirement on the homothety one-form being exact.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper provides a thorough analysis of the asymptotic structure of the Fefferman-Graham ambient metric and establishes a robust characterization of its conformal properties. The findings contribute valuable insights to the field of differential geometry, particularly in understanding conformal extensions and their associated obstructions.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic structure of the Fefferman-Graham
ambient metric. We prove that every straight ambient metric admits a conformal
completion with a well-defined null infinity, and that the asymptotic expansion
of the metric at infinity can be related to that at the homothetic horizon.
Furthermore, in even dimensions, we show that the Fefferman-Graham obstruction
tensor naturally arises in the geometry at infinity. By identifying the
fundamental properties that this particular conformal extension exhibits, and
analyzing their sufficiency, we arrive at the main result of the paper, namely
the identification of a set of conformally covariant conditions that completely
characterize the ambient metric from a conformal perspective. In particular,
our result relaxes the requirement of the homothety one-form being exact.

Abstract: Wind speed measurements using heterodyne lidars are limited in spatial
resolution because of the current signal processing methods. This limit is
equal to c $\tau$ ( c is the speed of light and $\tau$ is the laser pulse
duration) corresponding to the length of the atmosphere contributing to the
wind speed measurement at one distance. To go beyond this limit, we use an
inverse problem approach based on a model of the spectrogram (concatenation of
periodograms of each range) and prior distributions on our unknowns:
backscattering amplitude and wind speed at each range. We apply our inversion
method to simulated and experimental spectrograms, demonstrating a gain in
resolution by a factor of 2 to 2.5 depending on the signal-to-noise ratio.

TL;DR: The paper describes the development of a new heavy ion detector for directly measuring the lifetimes of heavy Lambda hypernuclei. The detector uses a 10 picosecond resolution RF Timer with circular RF scanning in the 500-1000 MHz range to convert particle temporal information into spatial coordinates. The paper presents evidence of efficient background reduction and effective separation of prompt reaction products from delayed events. Tests with RF synchronized laser and alpha particles were conducted, and Monte Carlo simulations were used to validate the detector's feasibility under realistic conditions.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to enable direct measurements of heavy Lambda hypernuclei lifetimes, which would provide valuable insights into nuclear physics phenomena such as delayed nucleon emission and associated processes. The development of such a detector represents a significant advancement in the field.

Method: The method involves the design and testing of a detector utilizing an existing RF Timer system. Circular RF scanning in a specific frequency range is employed to convert particle timing information into spatial coordinates. The detector's ability to suppress background noise and separate prompt and delayed events is a key component of the methodology. Initial testing is conducted with RF synchronized laser and alpha particles, and Monte Carlo simulations are performed to validate performance under realistic experimental conditions.

Result: The results indicate that the detector design is effective in suppressing accidental background noise and distinguishing between prompt and delayed events. Experimental tests with alpha particles and Monte Carlo simulations confirm the detector's feasibility and potential performance under real-world conditions.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the proposed detector design successfully addresses key challenges in the direct measurement of heavy Lambda hypernuclei lifetimes. The findings provide a solid foundation for future experimental work, which will contribute to a deeper understanding of nuclear physics phenomena such as delayed nucleon emission.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the design and preliminary performance evaluation
of a new heavy ion detector for direct measurements of heavy {\Lambda}
hypernuclei lifetimes. The detector employs the previously developed 10
picosecond resolution Radio Frequency (RF) Timer, which converts the temporal
information of incident particles into spatial coordinates of secondary or
photoelectrons on a position-sensitive detector by means of circular RF
scanning in the 500-1000 MHz range. Here, we report the detector design to
achieve efficient suppression of accidental background and effective separation
of prompt reaction products and delayed events from {\Lambda} hypernuclei
decays, results of test studies carried out with RF synchronized laser as well
as preliminary results obtained by using alpha particles. Dedicated Monte-Carlo
simulations have been performed to estimate the detector's performance under
realistic experimental conditions at RF-driven electron, photon, or proton

basis for upcoming experimental measurements, based on the delayed fission
detection.

Abstract: As observed on the signal of the Planck-HFI highly sensitive bolometers, the
effect of cosmic rays on detectors is a major concern for future similar space
missions. Their instruments will have a larger detection surface, increased
sensitivity, and more stringent requirements on the suppression of systematic
effects. To study the impact of cosmic rays on detector prototypes in
operational conditions, IAS has designed a state-of-the-art cryogenic system to
irradiate particles by coupling this facility to particle accelerators. An
irradiation campaign has been carried out on LiteBIRD-HFT TES prototypes to
study their response to particle hits. In this article, we present the results

Abstract: Light scattering plays an essential role in uncovering the properties of
quantum states through light-matter interactions. Here, we explore the
transition from Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to droplets in a dipolar
$^{166}$Er gas by employing superradiant light scattering as both a probing and
controlling tool. We observe that the efficiency of superradiant scattering
exhibits a non-monotonic behavior akin to the rate of sample expansion during
the transition, signaling its sensitivity to the initial quantum state, and in
turn, revealing the BEC-droplet transition. Through controlled atom depletion
via superradiance, we analyze the sample's expansion dynamics and aspect ratio
to identify the BEC-droplet phases distinctly, supported by Gaussian
variational ansatz calculations. Finally, using these two approaches, we track
how the BEC-droplet transition points shift under varying magnetic field
orientations. Our work opens new avenues for studying quantum states through
superradiance, advancing our understanding of both the BEC-droplet crossover
and its coherence properties.

Abstract: We analytically investigated the dynamical quantum phase transitions in the
Bose-Hubbard model using the Loschmidt echo as an observable, revealing that
after a quench, the global Loschmidt echo exhibits cusp singularities with a
logarithmically divergent rate function near criticality and a critical
exponent of zero. Through extensive calculations across various system sizes
and initial states, we have demonstrated that in the strongly interacting
regime, the critical singularity of dynamical quantum phase transitions
exhibits consistency across different model details and initial product states
(charge-density wave states). Moreover, we find that modifying the harmonic
potential well not only preserves the phase transition but also enables precise
control over the transition timing.

*Alberto-Mario Castillo,Gabriel Villalobos*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The study explores how T. cruzi infective forms move within blood using a computational 2D model. The model suggests that movement is mainly due to fluid flow rather than the parasite's own motility. Potential model improvements are suggested.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the movement dynamics of T. cruzi is vital for exploring disease spread mechanisms.

Method: A 2D computational model of T. cruzi was created using harmonic springs and Dissipative Particle Dynamics in a laminar flow.

Result: The model shows that T. cruzi movement is primarily driven by blood flow, with limited impact from its motility.

Conclusion: The findings imply that T. cruzi direction in blood is influenced more by environmental flow conditions than its own motility capabilities.

Abstract: The movement of the infective form of the T. Cruzi parasite within the human
blood is not completely understood. Video microscopy observations confirm
forward motility of the protozoa and relate it to the deformation of the body,
nonetheless there are open questions relating the deformation of the protozoan
with its motion in blood, for which a computational model would be very
helpful. Hereby we introduce a simple computational 2D model to test whether it
is mechanistically possible for the parasite to direct its movement through the
blood stream towards preferred organs in the bloodstream.
  We model the infective form of the T. cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas
disease; by means of a network of harmonic springs that represents its body,
without explicitly modeling the flagellum. We coupled this with a particle
model of a laminar fluid flow, which we implemented using the Dissipative
Particles Dynamics method.
  Our parasite model swims on still fluid, its center of mass displacement
being larger than the end to end deformation. Laminar flow dragged the model
parasite of the order of 5 $\mu m$; having minor effects on its structure.
  The parasite model does not exhibit directed motion in a moving fluid,
suggesting that the large-scale displacement of the real parasite is not
attributable to its own motility but is instead caused by it being dragged by
the flow. We highlight two potential improvements for the model: incorporating
the capacity to describe 3D motion and including a specific depiction of the
flagellum.

Abstract: We address the Kramers escape problem for Brownian particles in bistable
substrates with deformable double-well shapes. The shape deformability is
considered of three distinct forms: in one, the positions of the two degenerate
minima can be shifted continuously without affecting the barrier height. In the
second the minima positions are kept fix while the barrier height is
continuously shifted. In the third the minima positions and barrier height can
be tuned simultaneously by changing a single real parameter that we refer to as
deformability parameter. We obtain the analytical expression of the Kramers
escape rate for the three different double-well models, and identify a critical
value of the deformability parameter above which non-Gaussian corrections
become relevant. Remarkable enough in the latter region, statistical mechanics
predicts a first-order transition in quantum tunneling using the functional
action associated with the family of deformable double-well potentials.

TL;DR: 生物学中的细胞竞争性是细胞学和生物学中一个重要的研究点，无论是器官ogenesis、癌症进展，还是组织维持等，都很依赖这种竞争机制。现有的研究已经发现了几种机制，比如物理机械杀死细胞或者诱导凋亡，还有各种竞争营养和有好处的因子等。最近有研究表明，肝脏祖细胞和结直肠癌细胞之间存在细胞竞争特征，特别是在细胞周期动态上存在差异[参考文献: Krotenberg Garcia等人在《iScience》2024年发表的论文]。尽管如此，这种机制的详细机理还不明确。为此，我们在这些研究的基础上，提出了一个基于转录因子以及细胞周期的动力学模型，这个模型可以用来解释细胞之间的竞争性问题。从结果来看，这个模型能够捕获实验的主要特征，包括群体动力学和细胞周期变化。同时，该模型表明，细胞分泌利好的因素以及癌细胞增加摄取效率，足以还原实验结果。此外，该模型还有助于理解细胞周期过程对细胞竞争性的影响。同时，它可以应用在更广泛的情况中，比如发生在生物种群间竞争生长阶段对消费者制造产品的情况。

Abstract: Cell competition in multicellular organisms has been shown to play a critical
role during the development of organisms, cancer progression, and in the
establishment and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Various mechanisms of cell
competition have been identified, including active elimination via mechanical
forces or induced apoptosis, as well as competition for nutrients and other
beneficial factors. A recent experiment demonstrated hallmarks of cell
competition, associated with cell cycle dynamics, between liver progenitor
cells and colorectal cancer cells [Krotenberg Garcia et al., iScience 27,
109718 (2024)]. However, a mechanistic explanation for this form of competition
remains lacking. Here, we present a mean-field model of competition for
signaling ligands, coupled with cell cycle dynamics, to provide such an
understanding. Our model captures the salient features of the experiment,
including population dynamics and cell cycle variations. We demonstrate that
secretion of a beneficial factor by cells, coupled with the enhanced uptake
efficiency of cancer cells, suffices to reproduce the experimental outcome. Our
model, reminiscent of competition for secreted growth factors, provides insight
into the minimal level of complexity required to achieve the observed
competitive outcome as well as its link to cell cycle dynamics. It can also
serve as a general framework for studying biological populations with
growth-stage-dependent competition over consumer-produced products.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望通过分析小波变换的相位同步指数，深入了解强光照下单细胞绿藻的游动机制，特别是游动模式的变化。这可能为理解类似生物在环境突变中的适应性提供见解。

Conclusion: 这些发现为深入理解强光照下藻类的游动机制提供了关键证据，并可能为类似系统设计自适应控制机制提供科学依据。研究者强调了相位同步指数作为评价小波变换性能的重要标准。

Abstract: The unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CR) is well known for
its bi-flagellated swimming in response to light stimuli. This work aims to
study the resynchronization of CR flagella after a high light intensity
stimulus, known as photoshock. The synchronization is estimated thanks to a
quantity defined as the Phase Synchronization Index (PSI). The originality of
this approach is to perform a time-frequency computation of a complex PSI based
on continuous wavelet transform. Thanks to this analysis, we distinguish three
swimming stages involving different frequency bands and phase shifts: normal
breaststroke, escaping, and resynchronization. This approach also reveals the
presence of signal harmonics that set the photoshock response, independently of
cell variability. Our results suggest that CR modulates the balance between
fundamental and harmonic beating modes, providing a mechanism for robust
adaptation to sudden environmental stresses.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how enzyme chemotaxis can lead to spatial self-organization in catalyzed biochemical networks, providing a framework for understanding how such networks can self-regulate their metabolic activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the spatiotemporal organization of living systems through biochemical reaction networks is crucial for elucidating how metabolic processes are regulated in the presence of external stimuli.

Method: The authors developed a general theory for arbitrary reaction networks and systematically analyzed closed unimolecular networks with up to six chemicals. They employed mathematical modeling and computational simulations to explore the networks' behavior under various conditions.

Result: The study reveals that the ability of a network to self-organize depends on the interplay between the chemotactic mobilities of enzymes and their substrate/product interactions. It also highlights the importance of substrate diffusion limitations in enabling such self-organization.

Conclusion: This research offers valuable insights into how metabolic networks can self-regulate and organize themselves through chemotactic mechanisms, with implications for understanding complex biological systems and synthetic biology applications.

Abstract: Living systems contain intricate biochemical networks whose structure is
closely related to their function and allows them to exhibit robust behavior in
the presence of external stimuli. Such networks typically involve catalytic
enzymes, which can have non-trivial transport properties, in particular
chemotaxis-like directed motion along gradients of substrates and products.
Here, we find that taking into account enzyme chemotaxis in models of catalyzed
reaction networks can lead to their spatial self-organization in a process
similar to biomolecular condensate formation. We develop a general theory for
arbitrary reaction networks, and systematically study all closed unimolecular
reaction networks involving up to six chemicals. Importantly, we find that
network-wide propagation of concentration perturbations can be key to enabling
self-organization. The ability to self-organize is highly dependent on the
relative signs of the chemotactic mobilities of the enzymes to their substrate
and product and on the global network structure. We find that spontaneous
self-organization through chemotaxis can provide an avenue for the
self-regulation of metabolic activity in complex catalyzed reaction networks.
The network-induced interaction mechanism we uncover operates in the regime
where the substrate molecules are diffusion-limited, suggesting that signaling
molecules could take advantage of this scenario towards their functionality.

TL;DR:  Memristors based on 2DMs, especially MoS2, show promising for neuromorphic computing, but their resistive switching mechanisms and scalability are still under investigation. This paper demonstrates scalable memristors with volatile and nonvolatile RS behavior under different conditions, including stable characteristics in an intermediate resistive state (>2500 cycles, >10^6 s retention), and synaptic-like current response, suggesting potential for neuromorphic applications. However, further studies are needed to fully understand the RS mechanism and improve reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuromorphic computing systems require high-performance memristors with predictable and controllable RS behavior. The development of scalable and reliable 2DM-based memristors, especially those based on MoS2, is crucial for advancing this field. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of RS in MoS2 memristors and overcoming current limitations (e.g., variability, scalability) would enhance their applicability in Neuromorphic systems.

Method: In this study, we synthesized, characterized, and fabricated metal-organic chemical vapor-deposited (MOCVD) MoS2-based memristors on chip-scale devices. The materials were processed using standard semiconductor fabrication techniques, and the memristive properties were studied through IV characteristics, ST blogger与时态_Noun.txt博和.state characterization.Electrothermal effects, such as Joule self-heating, and device reliability were addressed during the testing phase. Additionally, rate-dependent phenomena were analyzed by performing direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) bias measurements.

Result: The research finds that MoS2-based memristors exhibit both volatile and nonvolatile RS behavior, which is tunable by adjusting current compliance. They show stable RS characteristics in the intermediate resistive state (IRS), including high endurance (>2500 cycles) and long-term stability (>10^6 s), which is beneficial for applications requiring reliability. Furthermore, the devices emulate synaptic plasticity, with currents responding on the microsecond timescale. The scalable fabrication technique opens up its potential for integration into standard semiconductor processes. However, the stochastic nature of RS and insufficient characterization of its underlying mechanisms still need to be addressed.

Conclusion: This work advances the development of 2DM-based memristors, particularly MoS2-based ones, by demonstrating scalable devices with reliable RS properties and synaptic-like characteristics suitable for Neuromorphic systems. While current limitations (e.g., variability, scalability challenges) indicate areas needing further exploration, the findings pave the way for more practical applications of memristors in hardware implementations of biological neural networks.

Abstract: Memristors based on two-dimensional materials (2DMs) have garnered
significant attention due to their fast resistive switching (RS) behavior and
atomic-level thickness, which enables low power consumption, making them
promising candidates for neuromorphic computing. Among these, memristors based
on molybdenum disulfide (MoS${_2}$) have been extensively studied. Their RS has
been attributed to the formation and rupture of conductive filaments (CFs).
However, the underlying mechanism of filament formation remains underexplored,
and the inherently stochastic nature of RS leads to high variability and
limited reproducibility. Additionally, the lack of scalable fabrication
techniques for 2DM-based memristors restricts their integration into standard
semiconductor technology. Here, we demonstrate memristors based on
metal-organic chemical vapor-deposited MoS${_2}$ on the wafer-scale. Our
devices exhibit volatile and nonvolatile RS behavior, tunable by modulating the
current compliance. Notably, we observe stable RS characteristics in an
intermediate resistive state (IRS), featuring set and reset voltages within
$\pm$1 V, an endurance exceeding 2500 cycles in direct current mode, and a
state retention over 10${^6}$ s. The experimental data, complemented with
simulations, suggest that the IRS originates from the lateral growth of the CF
within the MoS${_2}$ layer. Furthermore, the devices successfully emulate
synaptic plasticity with current responses on the microsecond timescale,
highlighting their potential for large-scale integration in neuromorphic
computing architectures.

Abstract: Frequency combs consist of a spectrum of evenly spaced spectral lines.
Optical frequency combs enable technologies ranging from timing, LiDAR, and
ultra-stable signal sources. Microwave frequency combs are analogous to optical
frequency combs, but often leverage electronic nonlinearity for comb
generation. Generating microwave frequency combs using piezoelectric mechanical
resonators would enable this behavior in a more compact form factor, thanks to
the shorter acoustic wavelengths. In this work, we demonstrate a microwave
frequency comb leveraging thermal nonlinearity in high quality factor ($Q$)
overmoded acoustic resonators in thin film lithium niobate. By providing input
power at 257 MHz, which is the sum frequency of two acoustic modes at 86 MHz
and 171 MHz, we generate parametric down conversion and comb generation. We
explore the nonlinear mixing regimes and the associated conditions for comb
generation. Comb spacing is observed to vary significantly with drive frequency
and power, and its general behavior is found to rely heavily on initial
conditions. This demonstration showcases the potential for further improvement
in compact and efficient microwave frequency combs, leveraging nonlinear
acoustic resonators.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The top-down fabrication of nanowires based on patterning via metal dewetting
is a cost-effective and scalable approach that is particularly suited for
applications requiring large arrays of nanowires. Advantageously, the nanowire
diameter can be tailored by the initial metal film thickness. However, we show
here that metal dewetting inherently leads to a coupling between the nanowire
diameter and spacing. To overcome this limitation, we introduce two strategies
that are exemplified for GaN nanowires: (i) modification of the surface and
interface energies within the dewetting system, and (ii) thinning of the
nanowires by lateral etching. In the first strategy, GaN(0001), SiOx, and SiNx
substrate surfaces are combined with Au, Pt, and Pt-Au alloy dewetting metals
to tune the dewetting behavior. The differences in interface energies affect
the relation between nanowire diameter and spacing, albeit within a limited
range. The second strategy adds a lateral etching step to the conventional
top-down nanowire fabrication process. This step at the same time reduces the
nanowire diameter and increases the spacing, thus enabling combinations beyond
the constraints of metal dewetting alone. When in addition different initial
nanowire diameters are employed, it is possible to independently control
diameter and spacing over a substantially extended range. Therefore, the
inherent limitation of conventional dewetting-based patterning approaches for
the top-down fabrication of nanowires is overcome.

Abstract: We present a theoretical evaluation of radiation dose constraints for extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray microscopy. Our work particularly addresses
the long-standing concern regarding strong absorption of EUV radiation in
biological specimens. Using an established dose-resolution model, we compare
hydrated and dehydrated cellular states and quantify the fluence required for
nanoscale imaging. Our analysis identifies a protein window spanning photon
energies from 70 eV up to the carbon K-edge (284 eV), where EUV microscopy
could in principle achieve sub-10 nm half-pitch resolution in dehydrated
samples at doses well below the Henderson limit, thereby eliminating the need
for cryogenic conditions. In this situation, the radiation dose required for
EUV imaging is also substantially lower than what is required for comparable
resolution in water window soft X-ray microscopy. Furthermore, EUV photons with
sufficiently high energy exhibit penetration depths of um-level in dehydrated
biomatter, enabling exceptional amplitude and phase contrast through thin
cellular regions and small cells. These findings provide quantitative
guidelines for photon energy selection and establish the EUV protein window as
a dose-efficient and physically viable modality for high-resolution,
label-free, material-specific imaging of dehydrated biological matter.
