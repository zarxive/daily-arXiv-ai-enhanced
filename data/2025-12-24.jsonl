Often, such systems of differential equations are reducible, which, broadly speaking, implies that the differential system is composed of various subsystems. Studying such decompositions and subsystems can greatly aid in solving the full differential system, as well as bring to light a substantial amount of structure. In this PhD thesis, we study reducibility for a particular system of differential equations known as GKZ (Gelfand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky) systems. We show how reducibility manifests itself in the differential equations through the existence of certain special operators, reduction operators, and explain their properties. Furthermore, we apply this framework to cosmological correlators, exemplifying how these reduction operators can be used to obtain and understand the structure within the system. Here the amount of structure seems remarkably large, and we leverage this structure to obtain many algebraic and permutative identities within the space of solutions to the differential equations. Interestingly, these include various cut and contraction relations between diagrams. We show how to obtain all such relations and how they reduce the full solution set to a certain, remarkably small, subset. Finally, we explain how such simplifications can be understood through the lens of o-minimality and Pfaffian complexity, as well as some of the limitations of this perspective."}

We present a twistor-based direct computation of the polygon loop integrands, and determine the two-loop integrands for any number of external operators.

These constructions require no local sources. We show that the associated energy-momentum tensors (both 10D and the resulting 4D effective) satisfy the null, weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. In our explicit constructions, the Ricci scalar of the four-dimensional Einstein frame metric is negative; such backgrounds may find applications to anisotropic or FLRW cosmologies in the early universe. We also revisit the Maldacena--Nuñez no-go analysis, incorporating new elements that appear in our constructions, namely an overall noncompact spacetime-dependent scale factor multiplying the internal metric, and field strengths with components partially covering the noncompact directions.

Using the geometric engineering dictionary, we argue that the discrete higher symmetries of 5d SCFTs constructed from M-theory on a non-compact Calabi-Yau threefold can be related to a quantum symmetry of the associated BPS quiver. Through un-orbifolding the quantum symmetry we obtain a new theory without higher form symmetry, providing a notion of ''minimality'' for a theory. This procedure is carried out via algebraic manipulations of the BPS/McKay quiver describing the crepant resolution of the singular geometry. This technique can also be reverted and thus, starting from any ''minimal'' theory, one can orbifold it and generate new theories with the desired higher form symmetries. We test our technology on classes of 5d SCFTs that arise from M-theory geometric engineering on Calabi-Yau threefolds that are non-toric non-complete intersections, which have historically been challenging to tackle."}

Such rapid scrambling is a defining feature of strongly chaotic quantum dynamics, and our results identify the systems with multifractal states as a promising solid-state platform for realizing this regime.

We focus on Quasi-topological theories involving infinite towers of terms for which the unique vacuum spherically symmetric solutions correspond to regular black holes. We solve analytically the problem of constant-density stars and find that the space of solutions is bounded by: configurations with divergent central-pressure, corresponding to the most compact stars; configurations which possess zero central-pressure; and configurations for which the sizes of the stars coincide with the inner-horizon radii of the would-be regular black holes. In the more general case of perfect-fluid stars for which the mean density decreases with increasing radius, we show that, for each density profile, maximum compactness is reached when the metric becomes singular at the center. Under certain additional conditions, we find a novel Buchdahl limit for the maximum compactness of stars, attained by a specific constant-density profile. We show, in particular, that stars in these theories may be more compact than in Einstein gravity. While the vacuum solutions of these theories are such that all curvature invariants take mass-independent maximum finite values, we argue that there exist ordinary matter stars with finite central pressures for which such bounds can be violated -- namely, arbitrarily high curvatures can be reached -- unless additional constraints, such as the dominant energy condition, are imposed on the fluid."}

We derive upper bounds on positional information gain due to nonlocal readout and identify signal processing algorithms that approximate optimal positional inference, as well as simple chemical reaction schemes which implement such algorithms. Our theory suggests that correlational information can be exploited to significantly enhance developmental precision."}

In this paper we present a theoretical framework to describe an inverse Compton scattering x-ray source for arbitrary interaction angles between the electron and laser pulse. Importantly the divergence of a tightly focused laser pulse will have a significant impact of the number of scattered x-rays. The parameters of the interaction geometry are optimized for two specific cases: head-on scattering; and a grazing co-propagating interaction angle. For head-on scattering we show that a tight symmetrically focused laser pulse, that balances laser intensity and interaction time, optimizes the x-ray brilliance. For a grazing angle geometry an elliptical focus of the laser pulse is required to mitigate a reduced interaction time. We find that the latter geometry is especially useful for soft x-ray generation."}

We also present a representation of particle trajectories in velocity space, which provides a clear insight into the nature and asymptotic behavior of the dynamics. As an application, we compare the motion of massive and massless particles in a constant electromagnetic field and find that, for identical field configurations, their asymptotic behavior is independent of both mass and initial conditions.

In this work, we discover that the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) can appear in a flat band. Unlike conventional NHSEs for dispersive bands that are protected by nontrivial point-gap topology, the flat band remains a point on the complex-energy plane and is therefore always topologically trivial. We found that, intriguingly, the flat-band skin effect (FBSE) is associated with the non-trivial spectral topology of the dispersive bands enclosing the flat band on the complex-energy plane, so it only emerges within a finite range of non-Hermitian parameters and can counterintuitively disappear at large non-Hermiticity. Moreover, the gaps between the flat and the dispersive bands can close at higher-order exceptional points under both periodic and open boundary conditions. The flat-band wavefunctions are discontinuous in quantum distance across these exceptional points, signifying that the gap-closing is singular. The FBSE was experimentally observed in a non-Hermitian mechanical lattice. Our work reveals flat-band phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems and highlights new possibilities in quantum geometry and localization control."}

By means of a suitable form of the Wigner-Moyal expansion, and invoking ensemble equivalence in statistical physics, we provide a consistent approach to the growth rate of the OTOC for many-body systems with chaotic classical limit where both the classical Lyapunov exponent and the quantum nature of the density of states enter. Applying this construction to quantized high-dimensional hyperbolic motion, i.e., a quantum chaotic system that exhibits gravity-like correlation functions in the late-time regime, we compute the OTOC growth rate $Λ$ as a function of the number of degrees of freedom, $f$, and inverse temperature, $β$.\n  We show that the scaled growth rate, $Λ/f$, can be described by a universal function of $f β$ and displays a cross-over from classical to quantum behavior as we increase $f$ and/or lower the temperature. In the deep quantum regime of infinite $f$, we find maximally fast scrambling in the sense of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound on chaos. This elucidates the non-perturbative mechanism underlying the saturation of the bound via quantum contributions to the mean density of states, and it provides further support for this dynamical system as a dual to two-dimensional quantum gravity. In this way, we present first evidence of maximally fast scrambling in a quantum chaotic system with a well-defined classical Hamiltonian limit, without invoking any external mechanism such as (disorder) averaging."}

Piezopolymer-based transducers offer a practical alternative; however, most existing studies focus on piezoelectric materials, while the influence of electrode material and electrode-polymer interface remains underexplored. This study leverages different interface-engineering strategies to examine the influence of electrode-piezopolymer interface morphology on piezoelectric, dielectric, and acoustic behavior in flexible transducers. Devices were fabricated using silver (Ag), gold (Au), graphene flakes (GF), laser-induced graphene (LIG), and Au-decorated LIG electrodes, enabling comparison across interfacial architectures. LIG-based transducers showed strong acoustic and piezoelectric output due to partial infiltration of the piezopolymer into the porous LIG network, which enhances interfacial contact and stress transfer. Au-based transducers achieved comparable acoustic output. In contrast, dense Ag electrodes and layered GF films provided limited coupling, resulting in reduced electromechanical response. LIG-based transducers exhibited the highest flexibility and durability, retaining stable performance after 10,000 bending cycles and an eight-week aging study, whereas GF, Ag, and Au devices degraded under bending, and Ag electrodes declined over time. These findings demonstrate that engineering the electrode-polymer interface is critical for high-performance flexible ultrasound transducers and identify LIG as a strong candidate for wearable imaging applications."}

These efforts were dramatically accelerated by the subsequent discovery of a profound link between low-energy topological and lattice chirality in structurally chiral crystals. Though TSMs are well understood in the limit of perfect translation symmetry, real solid-state materials host defects and disorder, and may even be rendered amorphous down to all but the smallest system length scales. Previous theoretical studies have concluded that chiral TSMs transition into trivial diffusive metals at moderate disorder scales, raising concerns that chiral TSM states may only be accessible in highly crystalline samples. In this work, we in contrast identify large families of chiral TSMs that persist under strong structural disorder - even into the amorphous regime. We show that amorphous chiral TSM phases can in particular be stabilized by the presence of long-range order in the local structural chirality. We present extensive analytic and numerical calculations demonstrating the existence of both Weyl and higher-charge chiral fermions in amorphous metals whose topology and spin and orbital angular momentum textures are tunable via the interplay of average symmetry and geometry. To distinguish and generate new realizations of strongly disordered chiral fermions, we introduce an analytic approach grounded in symmetry group theory. We then introduce an amorphous Wilson loop numerical method to characterize chiral fermions with quantized Berry curvature fluxes in metals with 3D structural disorder. Our findings bridge the crystalline and strongly disordered regimes of chiral TSMs, and indicate a clear route towards engineering geometry-enforced topology in non-crystalline materials and metamaterials."}

First, we analytically investigate eternal quantum black hole solutions to a one-parameter family of analytically solvable models interpolating between Russo-Susskind-Thorlacius and Bose, Parker, and Peleg gravities. Examining these models in a semi-classically allowed parameter space, we find naked singularities may exist for quantum fields in the Boulware state. Using a quasi-local formalism, where we confine the black hole to a finite sized cavity, we derive the conserved energy and analyze the system's thermal behavior. Specifically, we show the semi-classical Wald entropy precisely equals the generalized entropy, accounting for both gravitational and fine grained matter entropies, and we find a range where the quantum black holes are thermally stable. Finally, we numerically construct eternal black hole solutions to semi-classical Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger gravity and find their thermal behavior is qualitatively different from their analytic counterparts. In the process, we develop an analytic expansion of the solutions and find it accurately approximates the full numerical solutions in the semi-classical limit."}

Proof of the completeness of the squared eigenfunctions is provided. Our closure relation accounts for the singularities of the scattering data at the branch points of the continuous spectrum, which leads to the correct discrete eigenfunctions of the closure relation. Using the one-soliton closure relation and its discrete eigenmodes, the slow-time evolution equations of the soliton parameters are determined. Moreover, the first-order correction integral to the dark soliton is shown to contain a pole due to singularities of the scattering data at the branch points. Analysis of this first-order correction integral leads to predictions for the height, velocity and phase gradient of the shelves, as well as a formula for the slow time evolution of the soliton's phase, which in turn allows one to determine the slow-time dependence of the soliton center. All the results are corroborated by direct numerical simulations, and compared with earlier results."}

Given research directions of interest previously identified in arXiv: 1804.01797, besides converse upper bounds on the bit transmission rate obtained by the author in recent work (arXiv: 2507.03035), additional possibilities remain, including: (1) determining whether aspects of QKD dependent protocols can be incorporated into steps of QKD independent protocols; (2) whether there would be any amplification to the Quantum-classical performance gap that Alice and Bob can exploit towards prospective Quantum advantage; (3) formulating the conditions under which secrecy and authentication can be simultaneously achieved. To characterize the conditions for which secrecy can be achieved with high probability, we argue that there not only exists suitable protocols which enable Alice and Bob to map into the authenticated space of bit codewords with high probability, but also that forward conceptual channels, through cascading, can significantly increase Eve's probability of false acceptance. Albeit the fact that secrecy, along with conceputalizations of the public broadcast channel, were initially discussed by Maurer for QKD dependent protocols, determining whether aspects of such protocols can be adapted for unconditional security without the use of a secret key is of great interest to explore. We demonstrate that Eve's error probability, through the cascading procedure, can be analyzed with the Holevo information under an optimal decoder. Furthermore, through post-processing of the outputs of a Completely Positive Trace Preserving (CPTP) map, we also demonstrate how to decrease Holevo sum quantities with data-processing and entropy-continuity bounds."}

Analysis of all 24 permutations in the augmented phase space identifies eighteen distinct invariants ($K_1-K_{18}$) organized into three regularization classes: Class I (permutations $1abc$), Class II ($2abc$), and Class III ($3abc$). Six permutations ($4abc$) yield null results due to Schwarz integrability conditions. Each class is characterized by a distinct polynomial factor that removes singularities at nullcline crossings. The regularized variable $v_n = p\\, u_n$ evolves according to $dv_n/dt = Q_n(x,y,z)$, independent of $v_n$ itself; different conservation laws thereby impose distinct measures of trajectory history. Any three invariants from different classes provide independent constraints, defining a canonical Triad that characterizes orbit structure. Statistical analysis reveals class-dependent dynamical signatures: Class III invariants display higher intermittency (kurtosis ~15 versus ~8 for Class I) and stronger asymmetry (skewness ~2.7 versus ~1.6), correlating with lobe-switching events where the product $xy$ undergoes rapid sign reversal. This geometric sensitivity establishes Class III invariants as probes of topological transitions, while Class I invariants track continuous dynamics. The class-dependent divergence quantifies how different conservation principles impose incompatible demands on trajectory history. High-precision numerical validation confirms conservation of all identified quantities."}

In this work, we consider an elastic compliant plate coupled to a two-dimensional foundation comprising an array of bistable elements, a system that can form and retain complex continuous morphologies without sustained actuation via creation of stable domain walls separating regions in different stable states. These domain walls exhibit three distinct behaviors: expansion, shrinking, and metastable pinning. These arise from two limits of foundation discreteness. In the continuum limit, where bistable units are strongly coupled, domain walls undergo global phase transitions analogous to first-order phase transitions. In the anti-continuum limit, discreteness introduces Peierls-Nabarro-type energy modulations that lead to metastable pinning. To quantify these behaviors and the transition between the two limits, we develop a reduced-order model that captures the total potential energy of configurations with domain walls and validate it using finite element analysis (FEA). For axisymmetric domain walls, the model yields phase diagrams identifying the regimes of expansion, shrinking, and pinning as functions of bistable-potential asymmetry, relative foundation discreteness, and domain-wall size. We then extend the analysis to non-axisymmetric geometries and establish local geometric criteria that predict the stability of convex and concave polygonal domain walls, confirmed by simulations. Together, these results clarify how discreteness enables stability through energy-landscape modulation, provide predictive design rules for multistable reconfigurable surfaces, and offer insights into domain-wall stability more generally in elastically coupled multistable metamaterials."}

By analysing the stream of photons emitted by single dimers, the rates of formation and decay of SF-born triplet states were determined. We report considerable static and dynamic heterogeneities of the SF process which are reflected in broad rate distributions as well as the occasional occurrence of delayed fluorescence and rate fluctuations during spin evolution.

Extending these gravitational measurements to other sectors of the SM requires the formation of neutral bound states using higher-generation, unstable particles. Muonium, the bound state of an antimuon ($μ^+$) and an electron ($e^-$), offers the possibility to probe gravity with second-generation (anti)leptons, in the absence of the strong interaction. However, the short $μ^+$ lifetime ($τ_μ\\approx 2.2~μ$s) and the existing diffuse thermal muonium sources rendered such measurements unfeasible. Here, we report the synthesis of a high-brightness muonium beam, extracted from a thin layer of superfluid helium by exploiting its chemical potential and unique transport properties. The mean longitudinal velocity (${v}\\approx 2180~\\rm{m/s}$) and narrow distribution (${Δv}< 150 ~\\rm{m/s}$) of the atoms characterise a superthermal beam, while yields are similar to the highest intensity diffuse sources.

The stability of these configurations is assessed through their dynamical evolution using a fully non-linear relativistic code. For stable configurations, we compute the oscillation spectrum and identify the fundamental mode frequency. We found that, while the isotropic and Horvat models become unstable close to the maximum-mass point, the Bowers-Liang and Covariant models become unstable at lower central densities, indicating that the standard turning-point criterion may not reliably predict the onset of dynamical instability in anisotropic stars. Based on our results, we also determine the neutral-stability line and verify that configurations lying to the right of this line are indeed unstable under radial perturbations and collapse. Overall, given an equation of state, pressure anisotropy can increase the maximum mass of an stable configuration by up to ~30 % compared to the isotropic case. It also allows for more compact stable configurations that may collapse on longer timescales once they become unstable. Finally, we show that these compact stars could initially mimic a black hole's gravitational-wave ringdown. However, the production of subsequent echoes is not guaranteed by high compactness; instead, it depends critically on the star's specific internal structure and equation of state."}

However, if an observer probes this quantum state by performing measurements on the underlying qubits, thereby collecting an ensemble of highly correlated classical snapshots, two closely related questions arise: (i) do measurements decohere the topological order of the quantum state; and (ii) how much of the logical information can one learn from the snapshots? Here we address these questions for measurements in a uniform basis on all qubits. We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana \"metal\" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a \"metal to insulator\" transition..."}

By applying spectral clustering to physicochemical features of monomers, we identified three distinct monomer groups with characteristic reactivity patterns. This computationally efficient clustering approach revealed specific monomer group interactions leading to different sequence arrangements, including alternating, random, block, and gradient copolymers, providing chemical insights for initial exploration. Building upon these insights, we trained artificial neural networks to achieve quantitative reactivity ratio predictions. We explored two integration strategies including direct feature concatenation, and cluster-specific training, which demonstrated performance enhancements for targeted chemical domains compared to general training with equivalent sample sizes.

In its simplest form, such a test consists of the comparison of a measured transition frequency with its QED prediction, which can be calculated with very high precision for the hydrogen atom. However, these calculations require some input in the form of physical constants, such as the Rydberg constant $R_\\infty$ and the proton charge radius $r_\\mathrm{p}$, both of which are currently determined to a large degree by hydrogen spectroscopy itself. Therefore, the frequency of at least three different transitions needs to be measured in order to test QED. Equivalently, a comparison of the values of $R_\\infty$ and $r_\\mathrm{p}$ determined from measurements of different transitions constitutes a test of QED.\n To this end, laser spectroscopy of optical 2S-$n$P transitions has been performed in this work. As these transitions are one-photon transitions, they are affected by a different set of systematic effects than the two-photon transitions on which most other spectroscopic measurements of hydrogen are based. In order to contribute to the test of QED, their transition frequencies must be determined with a relative uncertainty on the order of one part in $10^{12}$, corresponding to approximately 1 kHz in absolute terms. This is in turn approximately a factor of 10000 smaller than the relatively broad natural linewidth of the 2S-$n$P transitions, and a successful measurement requires both a very large experimental signal-to-noise ratio and a detailed theoretical understanding of the line shape of the observed resonance.\n The 2S-$n$P transitions were probed on a cryogenic beam of hydrogen atoms, which were optically excited to the metastable 2S level. The atomic beam was crossed at right angles with counter-propagating spectroscopy laser beams, which further excited the atoms to the $n$P level. The fluorescence from the subsequent rapid spontaneous decay served as experimental signal. The excitation with two counter-propagating beams led to two Doppler shifts of equal magnitude, but opposite sign, which thus canceled each other out. A velocity-resolved detection was used to determine any residual Doppler shifts, which could be excluded within the measurement uncertainty for both of the measurements discussed below.\n In a first experiment, the 2S-4P transition was probed. Quantum interference of neighboring atomic resonances produced subtle distortions of the line shape, which were found to be significant because of the very large resolution relative to the linewidth. The line shifts caused by the distortions were directly observed and could be removed by use of a line shape model based on perturbative calculations. With this, the transition frequency was determined with a relative uncertainty of 4 parts in $10^{12}$. In combination with the very precisely measured 1S-2S transition frequency, this allowed the, at the time, most precise determination of $R_\\infty$ and $r_\\mathrm{p}$ from atomic hydrogen. Moreover, good agreement was found with the much more precise value of $r_\\mathrm{p}$ extracted from spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen, which had been in significant disagreement with previous data from (electronic) hydrogen, causing concern about the validity of QED. This result has since been confirmed by other experiments. The 2S-4P measurement is treated in the appendix of this thesis.\n The 2S-4P measurement, despite its large signal-to-noise ratio, was limited by counting statistics. To improve precision, a transition with a narrower linewidth and an improved experimental signal was necessary. Hence, the study of the 2S-6P transition, which offers a three times smaller natural linewidth, was begun. The atomic beam apparatus was upgraded, resulting in a corresponding decrease of the experimentally observed linewidth, and a close to an order of magnitude larger flux of atoms in the low-velocity tail of the atomic beam. Together with a detector redesign, this led to an up to 16 times larger signal than for the 2S-4P measurement, opening the path to increased precision. The Doppler-shift suppression was also rebuilt to support such precision, including a fiber collimator developed for this purpose, which provides high-quality spectroscopy beams at the new transition wavelength of 410 nm.\n This enabled a measurement of the 2S-6P transition frequency with a statistical uncertainty of 430 Hz, five times lower than for the 2S-4P measurement and corresponding to a suppression of the Doppler shift by six orders of magnitude. At this level of precision, the light force shift from the diffraction of atoms at the light grating formed by the counter-propagating spectroscopy beams becomes significant. This light force shift was directly observed for the first time for the 2S-$n$P transitions and found to be well-described by a model derived for this purpose. The size of all other systematic effects, except the very precisely known recoil shift, is estimated to be below 500 Hz each. The blind data analysis is ongoing at the time of writing and thus no transition frequencies can yet be given. However, a preliminary analysis suggests a five-fold improvement in the determination of $R_\\infty$ and $r_\\mathrm{p}$ as compared to the 2S-4P measurement, and a two-fold improvement over the currently most precise determination from atomic hydrogen. This places the uncertainty of the determined value of $r_\\mathrm{p}$ within a factor of five of that of the muonic value. The 2S-6P measurement is treated in the main text of this thesis."}

These bound states are resonant states of the electromagnetic field with a complex resonance frequency and can have very small mode volumes. PCCs are attractive for a variety of applications, from cavity quantum electrodynamics to biosensing. A PC slab geometry is advantageous given its superior manufacturability compared to three-dimensional crystals, and the accessibility of the surface allows sensing and coupling. However, the emission into the half spaces above and below the slab limits the bound state lifetime. Controlling this emission is thus crucial for applications, most of which benefiting from a long lifetime. A range of methods to find defect geometries suppressing the emission to increase the lifetime have been demonstrated in the past. However, they do not cater for a designed resonant frequency covering a wide addressable range, as needed for multiplexed devices. Here, we demonstrate a design method controlling both resonance frequency and emission, by minimising a cost function including both losses and target frequency. We show applications on PCCs in GaAs PC slabs immersed in water, relevant for biosensing. The reduced refractive index contrast in these structures compared to previously studied PCCs embedded in vacuum renders the emission suppression more challenging. We optimize the quality factor of a standard L3 cavity from 1000 to 10^4-10^5, with an addressable resonance frequency range covering 12% relative bandwidth, spanning more than half of the band gap. We furthermore report optimised structures of H1 cavities, and provide the optimisation code for widespread use."}

For $U(N)$ maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, we study such matrix integral and show that it localizes to ensembles of superconformal indices near its essential singularities. The latter asymptotic localization explains why a single microcanonical index reproduces the growth of the total number of BPS states in a large-$N$ expansion at charges of order $N^2$, despite exhibiting large sign-oscillations due to the insertion of $(-1)^F$. To compute quantum corrections to entropy, at finite $N$, the correct observable is the protected partition function which by definition is a positive quantity.\n  To study this protected observable, we propose and test an improvement of the Cardy-like method that allows us to identify and compute perturbatively exact expressions for the leading large-$N$ onshell action of eigenvalue-configurations that we call orbifold, dressed orbifold, and eigenvalue-instanton saddles."}

The nuclear polarization build-up time is of 150 s, consistent with earlier reports at higher temperatures, where hyperfine scattering on free photoexcited electrons governs relaxation. At 500 mK, the onset of dynamic self-polarization of nuclear spins is observed, which becomes more pronounced as the lattice temperature is further reduced to 300 mK.

We prove that Nat'{a}rio's spacetime is Petrov type I, not fitting the Class B warped product spacetime definition. Second, we assess the relative magnitude of the Weyl scalar curvature invariant and compare it with the amplitudes of Einstein's scalar and the Ricci quadratic and cubic invariants within the warp-bubble zone.

Fourth, we critically examine claims that Nat'{a}rio's warp drive is more realistic than Alcubierre's. We demonstrate that Nat'{a}rio's spacetime exhibits curvature invariant amplitudes 35 times greater than Alcubierre's, given identical warp-bubble parameters, making Nat'{a}rio's concept even less viable.

We introduce NMIRacle, a two-stage generative framework that builds upon recent paradigms in AI-driven spectroscopy with minimal assumptions. In the first stage, NMIRacle learns to reconstruct molecular structures from count-aware fragment encodings, which capture both fragment identities and their occurrences. In the second stage, a spectral encoder maps input spectroscopic measurements (IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR) into a latent embedding that conditions the pre-trained generator. This formulation bridges fragment-level chemical modeling with spectral evidence, yielding accurate molecular predictions. Empirical results show that NMIRacle outperforms existing baselines on molecular elucidation, while maintaining robust performance across increasing levels of molecular complexity."}

The results reveal qualitative differences between spacelike and timelike intervals: the timelike entanglement entropy is time-independent in the global quench model, depends solely on the temporal separation, and universally exhibits a constant imaginary contribution. These features are naturally explained by a generalized quasiparticle picture in which entanglement is produced precisely when one worldline of each quasiparticle pair intersects the interval.

In contrast, an exact analytical diagonalization under open boundary conditions reveals extended regions in parameter space with purely real or purely imaginary spectra, separated from complex spectral domains by exceptional lines. The intersections of these exceptional lines define triple-junction points where distinct spectral regimes meet, giving rise to a structured phase diagram that is absent under periodic boundary conditions.

The simulations reveal a three-stage sequence with impact energy: the low energy regime, 10 to 20 eV, which favors ionic dissociation, intermediate energy regime, between 30 to 40 eV, opens a neutralization window, and high energy regime, greater than 50 eV, drives covalent fragmentation into many light products with mixed charge states. Fractional energy distributions show a transition from few-body, energy-concentrated outcomes in the low energy regime to many-body, energy-dispersed outcomes in the high energy regime. Deflection angle distributions exhibit a strong mass-to-angle anti-correlation such that heavier fragments favor small deflection, whereas lighter fragments populate larger deflection angles. The fraction of transient metastables peaks near 50 eV, coinciding with abundant neutral fragment production. Importantly, neutral bombardment still produces charged secondaries at the target even when the upstream ion plume is fully suppressed by a decelerating electrode.

The inference further suggests that both black holes possess high spins, measured to be $0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$. Therefore, the observation of this event suggests the formation of black holes from channels beyond the standard stellar collapse. However, different waveform models yield significantly different parameter estimates, possibly due to missing physics in the models used in inference. In this work, we carry out a reanalysis of GW231123 using a physically complete model, accounting for both spin precession and eccentricity. Our analysis shows that this event does not exhibit strong evidence for eccentricity and the exclusion of eccentricity has minimal impact on inference. Furthermore, for GW231123-like systems, even eccentricities as large as $0.15$ at $10$ Hz do not yield a confident nonzero eccentricity measurement. Through a zero-noise injection recovery study, we show that the observed discrepancies in the parameter estimates can be explained by disagreement in the waveform models at strong spin precession, with the degree of parameter bias in the zero-noise runs being comparable to that observed for the real signal. We also show that inference performed with an eccentric, aligned-spin waveform model can yield a confident nonzero eccentricity measurement due to the degeneracy between eccentricity and spin precession. Bayesian model selection, however, rules out this interpretation in favor of the eccentric, spin precessing hypothesis, which supports zero eccentricity -- a conclusion we confirm with additional zero-noise injection-recovery tests."}

Yet the measured trace is a pseudo-OCV (pOCV) that includes two non-degradation contributions: an SOC-dependent ohmic drop and intrinsic charge-discharge hysteresis, especially in graphite--silicon oxide (C/SiOx) negative electrodes. We show these can dominate attribution and generate Phantom LAM/LLI --apparent material loss created by curve registration, branch choice and voltage-windowing rather than true degradation. Using two commercial 21700 cells (LG M50T: higher resistance; Molicel P45B: lower resistance), we extract an SOC-dependent instantaneous resistance $R_Ω(\\mathrm{SOC})$ from the first $\\sim$50,ms pulse step and apply an IR correction to pOCV before fitting. In LG M50T, IR correction lifts the low-rate discharge pOCV by $+13$--$27$,mV with ageing; without it, PE-LAM is increasingly under-diagnosed (to $-8.80%$ relative error at late life) and LLI is suppressed (median $-3.07%$), with compensating inflation of apparent graphite loss. In P45B, on a branch-fair $3.0$--$4.2$,V window, end-of-life charge-branch DMA reports higher PE-LAM ($+3.42$,pp) and LLI ($+5.36$,pp), while the discharge branch recovers larger Si-LAM (discharge--charge difference to $+14.38$,pp). Raising the lower cutoff ($2.5$--$4.2 \\rightarrow 3.0$--$4.2$,V) further under-reports Si-LAM by $13.61$,pp by removing the Si-sensitive low-voltage tail. We propose a practical protocol: correct only the instantaneous ohmic term, harmonize the voltage window, and base quantitative attribution on the discharge branch, treating anomalous/negative component LAMs on charge as allocation artefacts rather than recovery."}

The associated symmetry algebra can be realized by light-ray operators defined on the null hypersurface. Within this framework, the gravitational wave memory effect corresponds to a shift of null hypersurfaces in the bulk. As explicit examples, we compute bulk supertranslations in Minkowski spacetime in arbitrary dimensions and in four-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, where we uncover a novel curvature-induced memory effect with observable consequences for light propagation."}

Here, we report the observation of magneto-moiré excitons in twisted bilayer CrSBr, correlated with moiré spin textures that emerge below a critical twist angle of ~2°. The nanoscale moiré spin texture imprints distinct signatures onto the optical spectrum, shifting the exciton energy via a periodic magnetic exchange field. First-principles calculations corroborate that these signatures arise from one-dimensional spin textures governed by the balance of exchange interactions and domain wall energy.

On the one hand, quantum information theory assumes subsystem locality, i.e.~the factorization of the total Hilbert space into subsystems. On the other hand, gauge constraints prevent the total Hilbert space to decompose into a spacetime-local tensor product structure. Because the Hilbert space structure of gauge theories does not accommodate the subsystem decomposition used in quantum information theory, standard information-theoretic results, such as the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) theorem, cannot be used straightforwardly in the context of gauge theories. In this work, we bridge this gap in the case of a two-dimensional lattice gauge model that captures key features of electromagnetism. In particular, we construct gauge-invariant local algebras and derive a physically meaningful decomposition of the Hilbert space, providing an operationally consistent notion of locality in the absence of a local tensor-product structure. We apply this framework to field-mediated entanglement protocols relevant to proposed tests of the quantum nature of gravity. We show that the discretized version of electromagnetism satisfies an analogue of the LOCC theorem: entanglement cannot be generated without genuine quantum field interactions, even in the absence of a spacetime-local tensor product factorization of the Hilbert space. This may point towards an operational way to define a subsystem structure for gauge theories."}

The technique has also opened up a new dimension for cryo-EM sample preparation, making it possible to deposit compounds onto a cryo-EM sample while it is frozen, so that upon flash melting, the embedded particles experience an altered environment. For example, we have recently shown that depositing ultrathin silicon dioxide membranes onto a cryo-EM sample causes particles to detach from the interface upon flash melting, removing preferred particle orientation. These experiments also point towards a new strategy for initiating protein dynamics in time resolved experiments by depositing reagents, which will then mix with the sample upon flash melting. Here, we describe an apparatus for physical vapor deposition of compounds onto cryo-EM samples, detailing its design and operation. As a demonstration, we determine that the minimum thickness of silicon dioxide sealing membranes in a laser flash melting experiment is just over two monolayers.

Moreover, mitigating adverse Rb-photonics interactions is essential, particularly as devices become more compact and the alkali source lies in close proximity to the photonic elements. Here, we demonstrate the successful operation of compact and fully integrated devices that combine silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with microfabricated borosilicate vapor cells and pill-type rubidium (Rb) dispensers through hermetic seals via anodic bonding. We show how successful operation hinges on optically activating the dispenser in a low-power pulsed mode, releasing controlled amounts of Rb vapor on demand while mitigating photonic degradation. Simultaneously, a counter-propagating desorption laser completely suppresses Rb-induced losses and enables waveguide-based atomic vapor spectroscopy. Using this approach, we demonstrate repeatable control of vapor density by tuning activation pulse length, duty cycle, and device temperature. These results establish a compact, manufacturable, and scalable vapor-PIC device, and set the stage for future demonstrations in cavity quantum electrodynamics, quantum nonlinear optics, and chip-scale atomic sensors."}

We identify a specific regime of the electron spin dynamics, where temperature-induced activation of spin-independent hopping leads to a monotonic acceleration of electron spin relaxation. This behavior contrasts with bulk CdTe crystals, where the motional narrowing effect is observed. We attribute this difference to the significantly larger inhomogeneous broadening of the donor-related trion resonance in our quantum well compared to bulk samples.

Training relies on estimating the gradient of the relative entropy between the target and model distributions, a task that is well understood when the classical Boltzmann machine has both visible and hidden units. For some years now, it has been an obstacle to generalize this finding to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines that have both visible and hidden units. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the reduced state of the visible units of a quantum Boltzmann machine. Crucially, this expression is amenable to estimation on a quantum computer, as it involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations reminiscent of those appearing in my prior work on rotated Petz recovery maps. This leads to a quantum algorithm for gradient estimation in this setting. I then specialize the setting to quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa, and provide analytical expressions for the gradients, along with quantum algorithms for estimating them. Finally, I replace the quantum relative entropy objective function with the Petz-Tsallis relative entropy; here I develop an analytical expression for the gradient and sketch a quantum algorithm for estimating it, as an application of a novel formula for the derivative of the matrix power function, which also involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations. Ultimately, this paper demarcates progress in training quantum Boltzmann machines with visible and hidden units for generative modeling and quantum state learning."}

This architectural breakthrough simultaneously enables a much smaller device footprint and an extended low-V$π$ bandwidth, without relying on narrowband resonances. Building on this concept, we experimentally demonstrate both a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and a cascaded PM, and verify their versatility in finite impulse response (FIR) filtering and optical frequency comb (OFC) generation. The recirculating MZM operates as a 4-tap rectangular-window FIR filter with 110 GHz bandwidth in a compact 2.889$\\times$0.58 mm$^2$ footprint.

In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts.

In the absence of magnetic field, transport is governed by a single shear viscosity coefficient, whereas the application of a finite magnetic field induces anisotropy, give rise to the five independent shear viscosity coefficients associated with distinct velocity gradient tensors. These coefficient can be physically categorized into perpendicular, parallel and Hall components relative to the magnetic field direction.

By leveraging multi-layer diffractive wavefront decoding and deep learning-based end-to-end optimization, the system achieves high-fidelity depth-resolved 3D image projection in a snapshot, enabling axial plane separations on the order of a wavelength. The digital encoder leverages a Fourier encoder network to capture multi-scale spatial and frequency-domain features from input images, integrates axial position encoding, and generates a unified phase representation that simultaneously encodes all images to be axially projected in a single snapshot through a jointly-optimized diffractive decoder. We characterized the impact of diffractive decoder depth, output diffraction efficiency, spatial light modulator resolution, and axial encoding density, revealing trade-offs that govern axial separation and 3D image projection quality. We further demonstrated the capability to display volumetric images containing 28 axial slices, as well as the ability to dynamically reconfigure the axial locations of the image planes, performed on demand.

Moreover, the FT-TAO-DFT, FT-TAO-AIMD, and FT-TAO-QM/MM methods are employed to explore the radical nature and infrared (IR) spectra of n-acenes (n = 2--6), consisting of n linearly fused benzene rings, in vacuum and in an argon (Ar) matrix at finite temperatures. According to our calculations, for n-acenes at 1000 K or below, the electronic temperature effects on the radical nature and IR spectra are very minor, while the nuclear temperature effects on these properties are noticeable. For n-acene in an Ar matrx at absolute zero, the Ar matrix has minimal impact on the radical nature of n-acene, while the co-deposition procedure of n-acene and Ar atoms may affect the IR spectrum of n-acene."}

By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis.

Our results reveal a barrierless reaction pathway toward the formation of chlorine gas ($\\mathrm{Cl}_2$), a major contributor to stratospheric ozone loss. We design a heterogeneous kinetic model informed by our MD simulation and available experimental data: despite the barrierless formation of $\\mathrm{Cl_2}$, the higher surface affinities and partial pressures of $\\mathrm{HNO_3}$ and $\\mathrm{HCl}$ compared to those of $\\mathrm{ClONO_2}$ result in a negligible reaction probability, $γ_\\mathrm{ClONO_2}$, upon chlorine nitrate collision with the silica surface. Since $γ_\\mathrm{ClONO_2}$ enters as a proportionality constant in the definition of the heterogeneous reaction rate, our kinetic model indicates that the injection of silica-based aerosols may have only a limited impact on stratospheric ozone depletion driven by $\\mathrm{HCl}$ and $\\mathrm{ClONO_2}$ chemistry. At the same time, our findings also underscore the scarcity of experimental data, the need of better theoretical frameworks for the inclusion of MD results into kinetic models, and the urgency for further experimental validations of silica-based SAI technologies before their deployment in climate intervention strategies."}

Throughout the transmission process, the inherent challenges of long-haul signal propagation inevitably introduce multiple noise components, including but not limited to thermal noise, phase fluctuations, and environmental interference. The system incline to use the conventional evaluation index - Allan deviation (ADEV) to reflect the system stability in order to evaluate the noise level. Whereas, ADEV can only provide numerical expression and lacks the time-frequency details. Therefore, a complete evaluation system is required by the system. In this paper, we present a groundbreaking integration of ADEV and wavelet transformed empirical mode decomposition (EMD-WT), establishing a novel analytical framework that enables simultaneous characterization of noise types and time-frequency domain properties. This synergistic approach achieves unprecedented dual-domain resolution in noise discrimination in frequency transfer systems."}

This information is used to identify subslices of codimension one in the complex-structure moduli space, where the Hodge structure splits in particular ways and different type IIB flux vacua emerge. We calculate the corresponding background fluxes and their potential that drives the IIB string compactification to these subslices and analyse the properties of the corresponding physical vacua. We address the question whether the subslices correspond to fixed loci of symmetries acting on the original family and whether they can be identified with consistent complex-structure moduli spaces of Picard-Fuchs systems with standard integral monodromy bases for fewer complex deformation parameters. We distinguish between supersymmetric vacua and singular subslices. In the latter case a standard geometrical basis can be expected if a physical transition leads to a smooth type II vacuum. In many cases the differential equations on the subslice are fulfilled by the restricted periods after adding an inhomogeneous term. This suggests that the resolution of the singularity provides three-chains and we indeed find that the corresponding integrals allow an integral expansion compatible with their interpretation as generating functions of disk instantons."}

It was previously shown in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 205127] that thermal excitation of the long-lived plasmons in graphene provides a substantial contribution to heat and momentum transport in the interaction-dominated regime. Detailed information on these excitations is therefore necessary for the understanding of hydrodynamic transport with quantitative precision. On the other hand, dynamics of graphene plasmons is usually studied using the perturbation theory within the Dirac-cone approximation, thus neglecting the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections. Both these effects can be however significant for strong-interacting systems including free-standing graphene where the effective coupling constant can reach values up to two. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free standing graphene using unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We confirm the existence of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the $Γ$ point, report their dispersion and the dependence of their quasiparticle residue on momentum. Comparison with the Random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculation for the Dirac theory shows that strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects, automatically taken into account in QMC calculations substantially alter the results. Our findings highlight the need to account for these effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene."}

However, if an observer probes this quantum state by performing measurements on the underlying qubits, thereby collecting an ensemble of highly correlated classical snapshots, two closely related questions arise: (i) do measurements decohere the topological order of the quantum state; and (ii) how much of the logical information can one learn from the snapshots? Here we address these questions for measurements in a uniform basis on all qubits. We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana \"metal\" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a \"metal to insulator\" transition..."}

The usual EoS for the static and SS case, $ρ= -p_r$, is no longer satisfied due to the presence of the HG AE terms. We study three linear EoS associated with: an analogue charged BH, a non-trivial extremal BH, and an ultra-relativistic stiff fluid, respectively. The HG AE terms lead to exotic behaviors, both in the physical properties of the solutions and in their thermodynamics. In Case I, the matter sources can be interpreted as an exotic anisotropic matter distribution, giving rise to an effective electric-potential term in the geometry. In Case II, we obtain a non trivial extremal BH solution for which the event horizon is $n_{\\text{odd}}$ fold degenerate.

A strong complexity-information correlation appears uniquely in the quantum case, providing a clear trajectory-level signature of quantum effects.

While the ``Yarkony Seam'' -- the $(3N-8)$-dimensional manifold of degeneracy -- is well-understood geometrically, its accurate characterization by high-level electronic structure methods is plagued by numerical instabilities. Specifically, standard Coupled Cluster (CC) theory suffers from root bifurcations near Ground State CIs, rendering the ``Gold Standard'' of chemistry inapplicable where it is needed most. Here, we present \\textbf{QuMorpheus}, an open-source computational package that resolves these singularities by implementing a topological framework based on Dissipative Mixed Hodge Modules (DMHM) [P. Saurabh, arXiv:2512.19487 (2025)]. By algorithmically mapping the CC polynomial equations to a spectral sheaf, we compute the exact Monodromy ($μ$) invariants of the intersection. We demonstrate that this automated algebraic geometry approach correctly identifies the physical ground state topology in the Köhn-Tajti model and resolves the intersection seams of realistic chemical systems, including Ethylene and the Chloronium ion ($\\mathrm{H_2Cl^+}$). Furthermore, we apply QuMorpheus to the photoisomerization of Previtamin D, proving that the experimentally observed Woodward-Hoffmann selection rules are a direct consequence of a topological ``Monodromy Wall'' ($μ=1, γ=π$) rather than purely energetic barriers. This establishes a general software solution to the ``Yarkony Problem,'' enabling the robust, automated mapping of global intersection seams in complex molecular systems. The topological stability of these intersections allows for the control protocols discussed in Ref.[P. Saurabh, Submitted to Phys. Rev. X (2025)]."}

Analytic continuation of this dispersion relation to $ν= -1$ yields a formal zero-frequency endpoint where $j_{-1}(x) = \\cos x / x$ admits the root $x = 0$. We examine this limit in detail, showing that while the mathematics is well-defined, the endpoint does not correspond to a physical electromagnetic mode. The positivity of the angular Sturm-Liouville operator restricts physical eigenvalues to $ν\\geq 0$, placing $ν= -1$ outside the admissible spectrum. We demonstrate that all electromagnetic field components vanish in this limit, even though the underlying Debye potential $Π= \\cos(kr)/kr$ remains non-trivial and exhibits a monopole-type singularity at the origin. This distinction between potential and field reflects the kernel structure of the curl-curl operator for spherically symmetric configurations. The analysis clarifies the boundary between propagating electromagnetic modes and static field configurations in spherical geometry, connecting the formal endpoint to longstanding questions about mode counting in cavity quantization."}

By analysing the stream of photons emitted by single dimers, the rates of formation and decay of SF-born triplet states were determined. We report considerable static and dynamic heterogeneities of the SF process which are reflected in broad rate distributions as well as the occasional occurrence of delayed fluorescence and rate fluctuations during spin evolution.

A phenomenological relation between ergotropy and entanglement is uncovered, which generalizes the existing free fermion integrable results to an interacting scenario.

Using analytic expansions in the low and high temperature limits, we compute the HEN for adjacent, disjoint and bipartite subsystem configurations and examine its dependence on the backreaction parameter $ρ$. Our results reveal a clear regime dependence: at low temperature, backreaction suppresses the negativity, signaling a reduction of distillable quantum correlations while at high temperature the negativity is enhanced due to the monotonic $ρ$-dependence of near horizon contributions. We further compare the behavior of HEN with HEE and mutual information, demonstrating that entanglement negativity provides a sharper diagnostic of the competition between thermal and quantum correlations in holographic plasmas with matter backreaction."}

It was previously shown in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 205127] that thermal excitation of the long-lived plasmons in graphene provides a substantial contribution to heat and momentum transport in the interaction-dominated regime. Detailed information on these excitations is therefore necessary for the understanding of hydrodynamic transport with quantitative precision. On the other hand, dynamics of graphene plasmons is usually studied using the perturbation theory within the Dirac-cone approximation, thus neglecting the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections. Both these effects can be however significant for strong-interacting systems including free-standing graphene where the effective coupling constant can reach values up to two. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free standing graphene using unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We confirm the existence of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the $Γ$ point, report their dispersion and the dependence of their quasiparticle residue on momentum. Comparison with the Random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculation for the Dirac theory shows that strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects, automatically taken into account in QMC calculations substantially alter the results. Our findings highlight the need to account for these effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene."}

We then use random matrix theory to derive a closed-form relation linking the variance bound to a set of key physical parameters: the spectral correlation length, the mean transmittance, and the number of frequency and measurement channels. The analysis reveals certain fundamental trade-offs between these physical parameters, and establishes the conditions for a spectrometer to achieve ``super-resolution'' below the limit set by the spectral correlation length.

The approach involves an implicit summation over final states, which makes causality manifest since retarded propagators emerge naturally. This inclusive summation over final states may also offer insights into the cancellation of IR divergences in physical observables within gauge theories, in accordance with the BN and KLN theorems. To study this, we first conduct particle scattering calculations using conventional methods, determining the quark-antiquark production cross section at first-order in gluon corrections, with careful tracking and cancellation of both IR and UV divergences. We then apply the causal formalism to analogous processes in scalar field theory, introducing novel diagrams that represent algebraic terms at the probability level, akin to Feynman diagrams at the amplitude level. We present a list of rules that generate all probability-level diagrams for particle scattering processes in which one is fully inclusive over final states that contain no initial-state particles. We also investigate the Unruh effect through the lens of the causal formalism. We calculate the transition rate of an accelerating UdW detector coupled to a massive scalar field, from both the perspective of an inertial observer and an accelerating observer. We confirm that the two perspectives give the same transition rate, despite the Rindler observer describing the Minkowski vacuum state as a thermal bath of particles. Numerical results for the transition rate are presented, highlighting the transient effects caused by forcing the field to initially be in the Minkowski vacuum state.

These bound states are resonant states of the electromagnetic field with a complex resonance frequency and can have very small mode volumes. PCCs are attractive for a variety of applications, from cavity quantum electrodynamics to biosensing. A PC slab geometry is advantageous given its superior manufacturability compared to three-dimensional crystals, and the accessibility of the surface allows sensing and coupling. However, the emission into the half spaces above and below the slab limits the bound state lifetime. Controlling this emission is thus crucial for applications, most of which benefiting from a long lifetime. A range of methods to find defect geometries suppressing the emission to increase the lifetime have been demonstrated in the past. However, they do not cater for a designed resonant frequency covering a wide addressable range, as needed for multiplexed devices. Here, we demonstrate a design method controlling both resonance frequency and emission, by minimising a cost function including both losses and target frequency. We show applications on PCCs in GaAs PC slabs immersed in water, relevant for biosensing. The reduced refractive index contrast in these structures compared to previously studied PCCs embedded in vacuum renders the emission suppression more challenging. We optimize the quality factor of a standard L3 cavity from 1000 to 10^4-10^5, with an addressable resonance frequency range covering 12% relative bandwidth, spanning more than half of the band gap.

Further, we quantify the systematic errors by developing a Bayesian inference framework for the current detector network. The inspiral-only aligned spin gravitational wave waveform model for eccentric binaries, TaylorF2Ecc, is employed. For the current detector network, neglecting an initial eccentricity of $e_0^{\\rm inj}=0.1$ defined at $20\\,\\mathrm {Hz} $ can lead to a serious bias in binary parameter inference.

Leveraging autonomous error correction, we propose a second-generation gate-based microwave quantum repeater (GBMQR) with encoded bosonic grid states. Each repeater station comprises a transmon and two bosonic resonators: one resonator serving as a stationary quantum memory utilizing autonomous error correction, and the other as an information bus for entanglement generation. Entanglement is generated sequentially through the successful absorption of a microwave photon wavepacket. This method enables deterministic entanglement generation, in contrast to a probabilistic mixing of two heralding signals on a balanced beamsplitter. Furthermore, our GBMQR employs an all-bosonic entanglement swapping Bell-state measurement. This is implemented via a bosonic controlled-Z gate and two separate X-basis projective homodyne measurements on the stationary stored codewords. Our approach circumvents mode-mismatch losses associated with routing and interfering of heralding modes on a beamsplitter, and confines losses to those arising from stationary storage. We evaluate the performance of the proposed quantum repeater by calculating its secret key rate under realistic lab environments. Moreover, we explicitly demonstrate that at stationary damping rate of $κ^{-1}_{\\text{damp}}=$~\\SI{40}{\\milli\\second}, GBMQR can achieve entanglement generation and swapping success probabilities approx.~$0.75$, and $0.58$ respectively, surpassing the hallmark success probability of $1/2$ set by ideal linear beamsplitter-based Bell-state measurements.

Such RMPS models allow us to exactly define and compute contributions of higher topologies and replica geometries in the gravitationally prepared state to all orders. We show that the bra-ket wormhole phase transition, a crucial physical property of gravitationally prepared states, is ensured if the transfer matrix of the RMPS satisfies the spectral gapping property, which we define, and define a class of models called $\\mathrm{O}(k)$ models satisfying this property. A novel advantage of RMPS models is that they allow us to compute the effects of off-shell wormholes, i.e., wormhole topologies without semiclassical solutions. In particular, using RMPS models, we find that off-shell wormholes lead to nonzero long-distance correlators in gravitationally prepared states. We also define RMPS models in continuous space, and discuss implications for studying de Sitter gravitationally prepared states."}

We focus on Quasi-topological theories involving infinite towers of terms for which the unique vacuum spherically symmetric solutions correspond to regular black holes. We solve analytically the problem of constant-density stars and find that the space of solutions is bounded by: configurations with divergent central-pressure, corresponding to the most compact stars; configurations which possess zero central-pressure; and configurations for which the sizes of the stars coincide with the inner-horizon radii of the would-be regular black holes. In the more general case of perfect-fluid stars for which the mean density decreases with increasing radius, we show that, for each density profile, maximum compactness is reached when the metric becomes singular at the center. Under certain additional conditions, we find a novel Buchdahl limit for the maximum compactness of stars, attained by a specific constant-density profile. We show, in particular, that stars in these theories may be more compact than in Einstein gravity. While the vacuum solutions of these theories are such that all curvature invariants take mass-independent maximum finite values, we argue that there exist ordinary matter stars with finite central pressures for which such bounds can be violated -- namely, arbitrarily high curvatures can be reached -- unless additional constraints, such as the dominant energy condition, are imposed on the fluid."}

The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets generally coexisting with different types of magnetic interactions poses a challenge for topological magnonic manipulation. Here we investigate the topological magnon phases of 2D Kagome ferromagnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI). It is found that the different sole magnetic anisotropic interactions introduce completely distinct topological phase diagrams and topological states. The multiple topological magnon phases with high Chern number emerge due to the distinct anisotropic interactions. Moreover, the interplay of the multiple anisotropic DMI and PDI interactions involved with Dirac and flat bands controls a variety of topological phase transitions, implying greater manipulation potential. In addition, the sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities induced by temperature is found in particular topological phase regions, namely topological origin, relating to the energy gap and Berry curvature (Chern number) in the vicinity of magnetic phase transition from the thermal fluctuations, providing a possible explanation for the experimental puzzles.

On the one hand, quantum information theory assumes subsystem locality, i.e.~the factorization of the total Hilbert space into subsystems. On the other hand, gauge constraints prevent the total Hilbert space to decompose into a spacetime-local tensor product structure. Because the Hilbert space structure of gauge theories does not accommodate the subsystem decomposition used in quantum information theory, standard information-theoretic results, such as the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) theorem, cannot be used straightforwardly in the context of gauge theories. In this work, we bridge this gap in the case of a two-dimensional lattice gauge model that captures key features of electromagnetism. In particular, we construct gauge-invariant local algebras and derive a physically meaningful decomposition of the Hilbert space, providing an operationally consistent notion of locality in the absence of a local tensor-product structure. We apply this framework to field-mediated entanglement protocols relevant to proposed tests of the quantum nature of gravity. We show that the discretized version of electromagnetism satisfies an analogue of the LOCC theorem: entanglement cannot be generated without genuine quantum field interactions, even in the absence of a spacetime-local tensor product factorization of the Hilbert space. This may point towards an operational way to define a subsystem structure for gauge theories."}

Examining these models in a semi-classically allowed parameter space, we find naked singularities may exist for quantum fields in the Boulware state. Using a quasi-local formalism, where we confine the black hole to a finite sized cavity, we derive the conserved energy and analyze the system's thermal behavior. Specifically, we show the semi-classical Wald entropy precisely equals the generalized entropy, accounting for both gravitational and fine grained matter entropies, and we find a range where the quantum black holes are thermally stable. Finally, we numerically construct eternal black hole solutions to semi-classical Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger gravity and find their thermal behavior is qualitatively different from their analytic counterparts.

Muonium, the bound state of an antimuon ($μ^+$) and an electron ($e^-$), offers the possibility to probe gravity with second-generation (anti)leptons, in the absence of the strong interaction.

In QIA, operators are expressed as structured combinations of basis elements indexed by Boolean codes, allowing products, commutators, and conjugations to be computed through finite rules on discrete indices rather than through dense matrix arithmetic. This representation unifies combinatorial index structure, explicit matrix realization, and transformation properties under Walsh-Hadamard-type transforms within a single formalism. Using QIA and its associated block-matrix realization, we reformulate the Bernstein-Vazirani hidden-string problem in its phase-oracle form entirely within a real, finite-dimensional algebraic setting. We show that, under structured oracle access, the QIA procedure reproduces the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm exactly and achieves the same asymptotic query complexity and circuit depth as the standard quantum algorithm. In particular, the hidden string is recovered by symbolic manipulation of a sparse algebraic representation of the oracle rather than by numerical simulation of quantum amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the apparent quantum speed-up in this setting is a consequence of operator structure rather than Hilbert-space dimensionality alone. QIA thus provides a precise language for separating genuinely quantum resources from those arising from algebraic and combinatorial structures and offers a new perspective on the classical simulability of structured quantum circuits."}

This work investigates automated quantum-circuit construction for regression tasks and introduces a genetic-algorithm framework that discovers Reduced Regressor QNN architectures. The approach explores depth, parametrized gate configurations, and flexible data re-uploading patterns, formulating the construction of quantum regressors as an optimization process. The discovered circuits are evaluated against seventeen classical regression models on twenty-two nonlinear benchmark functions and four analytical functions. Although classical methods often achieve comparable results, they typically require far more parameters, whereas the evolved quantum models remain compact while providing competitive performance. We further analyze dataset complexity using twelve structural descriptors and show, across five increasingly challenging meta-learning scenarios, that these measures can reliably predict which quantum architecture will perform best. The results demonstrate perfect or near-perfect predictive accuracy in several scenarios, indicating that complexity metrics offer powerful and compact representations of dataset structure and can effectively guide automated model selection. Overall, this study provides a principled basis for meta-learning-driven quantum architecture design and advances the understanding of how quantum models behave in regression settings--a topic that has received limited exploration in prior work. These findings pave the way for more systematic and theoretically grounded approaches to quantum regression."}

By means of a suitable form of the Wigner-Moyal expansion, and invoking ensemble equivalence in statistical physics, we provide a consistent approach to the growth rate of the OTOC for many-body systems with chaotic classical limit where both the classical Lyapunov exponent and the quantum nature of the density of states enter. Applying this construction to quantized high-dimensional hyperbolic motion, i.e., a quantum chaotic system that exhibits gravity-like correlation functions in the late-time regime, we compute the OTOC growth rate $Λ$ as a function of the number of degrees of freedom, $f$, and inverse temperature, $β$.\n  We show that the scaled growth rate, $Λ/f$, can be described by a universal function of $f β$ and displays a cross-over from classical to quantum behavior as we increase $f$ and/or lower the temperature. In the deep quantum regime of infinite $f$, we find maximally fast scrambling in the sense of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound on chaos. This elucidates the non-perturbative mechanism underlying the saturation of the bound via quantum contributions to the mean density of states, and it provides further support for this dynamical system as a dual to two-dimensional quantum gravity.

However, since a large number of ancillary quantum oscillators representing internal modes of a non-Markovian environment directly interact with the principal system in these models, the dimension of the augmented system may be very large causing significant computational burden in designing filters and controllers. In this context, this paper proposes an $\\mathscr{H}_2$ model reduction method for the augmented model of linear non-Markovian quantum systems. We first establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the physical realizability of the augmented model of linear non-Markovian quantum systems, which are more stringent than those for Markovian quantum systems. However, these physical realizability conditions of augmented system model pose non-convex constrains in the optimization problem of model reduction, which makes the problem different from the corresponding classical model reduction problem. To solve the problem, we derive necessary conditions for determining the input matrix in the reduced model, with which a theorem for designing the system matrix of the ancillary system in the reduced system is proved. Building on this, we convert the nonlinear equality constraints into inequality constraints so that a semidefinite programming algorithm can be developed to solve the optimization problem for model reduction.\n  A numerical example of a two-mode linear quantum system driven by three internal modes of a non-Markovian environment validates the effectiveness of our method."}

However, the dynamic characteristics of satellite network topology, limited quantum resources, and strict coherence time constraints pose significant challenges to reliable entanglement routing. An entanglement distribution analysis model for this unique environment is critical and helpful for entanglement routing research. We address the fundamental challenge of establishing and maintaining quantum entanglement links between satellites operating in free space, where links are subject to both transmission losses and quantum memory decoherence. This paper presents a comprehensive Markov chain model with a state space defined by link storage age and physical distance for analyzing entanglement distribution in noisy dynamic LEO satellite quantum networks. We construct transition matrices that capture system dynamics under varying request arrival rates, and derive analytical expressions for key performance metrics, including request satisfaction rate, average waiting time, link utilization efficiency, and average consumed link fidelity. Our analysis reveals that the critical trade-offs of higher request rates lead to faster link consumption with higher fidelity but potentially lower satisfaction rates, while lower request rates allow longer storage times at the cost of lower fidelity of increased decoherence effect. Moreover, this paper proves it is reasonable to leave out polarization rotation when the transmission distance is very short (40-50 km). In summary, this work provides theoretical foundations for designing and optimizing quantum entanglement distribution strategies in satellite networks, with applications to global-scale quantum communications."}

Importantly the divergence of a tightly focused laser pulse will have a significant impact of the number of scattered x-rays. The parameters of the interaction geometry are optimized for two specific cases: head-on scattering; and a grazing co-propagating interaction angle. For head-on scattering we show that a tight symmetrically focused laser pulse, that balances laser intensity and interaction time, optimizes the x-ray brilliance. For a grazing angle geometry an elliptical focus of the laser pulse is required to mitigate a reduced interaction time. We find that the latter geometry is especially useful for soft x-ray generation."}

The approach involves an implicit summation over final states, which makes causality manifest since retarded propagators emerge naturally. This inclusive summation over final states may also offer insights into the cancellation of IR divergences in physical observables within gauge theories, in accordance with the BN and KLN theorems. To study this, we first conduct particle scattering calculations using conventional methods, determining the quark-antiquark production cross section at first-order in gluon corrections, with careful tracking and cancellation of both IR and UV divergences. We then apply the causal formalism to analogous processes in scalar field theory, introducing novel diagrams that represent algebraic terms at the probability level, akin to Feynman diagrams at the amplitude level. We present a list of rules that generate all probability-level diagrams for particle scattering processes in which one is fully inclusive over final states that contain no initial-state particles. We also investigate the Unruh effect through the lens of the causal formalism. We calculate the transition rate of an accelerating UdW detector coupled to a massive scalar field, from both the perspective of an inertial observer and an accelerating observer. We confirm that the two perspectives give the same transition rate, despite the Rindler observer describing the Minkowski vacuum state as a thermal bath of particles. Numerical results for the transition rate are presented, highlighting the transient effects caused by forcing the field to initially be in the Minkowski vacuum state.

The study targets 5-qubit (thus 32-class) readout error-correction model. Using the ChipWhisperer Husky for physical voltage glitching, this work leverages an automated algorithm for scanning the fault injection parameter search space to find various successful faults in all the layers of the target ML model. Across repeated trials, this work finds that fault susceptibility is strongly layer-dependent: early-layers demonstrate higher rates of misprediction when faults are triggered in them, whereas later layers have smaller misprediction rates. This work further characterizes the resulting readout failures at the bitstring level using Hamming-distance and per-bit flip statistics, showing that single-shot glitches can induce structured readout corruption rather than purely random noise.

Firstly, the general theoretical framework of optimizing the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) scheme based on the dynamical quantum geometric tensor is given, and then the dynamical quantum geometric tensor and the nonadiabatic transition rate are calculated by taking the detuned $Λ$-type three-level system and tripod-type four-level system for example. Secondly, the transfer dynamics of the particle population of the system are investigated in detail. For a three-level system, the optimal STIRAP scheme has an efficiency of over 98\\% in transferring the population to the final state, while the transfer efficiency of traditional STIRAP is about 72\\%. The superposition states with arbitrary proportions can be efficiently prepared for a four-level system due to the decoupling of the degenerate dark states. Finally, the influences of system parameters, such as the operation time of the Rabi pulses, the amplitude fluctuation and the single-photon detuning, on the transfer process are discussed. Especially, the phenomenon of the adiabatic resonance transfer is revealed. Choosing the pulse parameters in the resonance window can reduce the infidelity of the population transfer to below $10^{-3}$. It is found that the optimal STIRAP scheme by the dynamical quantum geometric tensor provides faster and more efficient transfer than the traditional STIRAP scheme."}

Although Si/SiGe heterostructures are commonly used to host spin qubits due to their high mobility and low percolation density, the SiGe spacer creates a gap between the qubits and control electrodes, which limits the ability to tune exchange coupling. As a result, residual coupling leads to unwanted single-qubit phase shifts, making multi-qubit control more difficult. In this work, we explore swapping the roles of overlapping nanogates to overcome this issue. By reconfiguring the gate voltages, we demonstrate in situ role switching while maintaining multi-qubit control. Additionally, this method significantly improves the tunability of exchange coupling by several orders of magnitude over the traditional approach. This strategy reduces unintended single-qubit phase shifts and minimizes the complexity of multi-qubit control, supporting scalable growth with minimal experimental overhead."}

Notably, only a single real eigenvalue is found before the EP, which differs markedly from typical non-Hermitian systems where a pair of real eigenvalues precedes the EP.

In this work, we introduce a simple variant of the model in which this ergodic behaviour is suppressed by introducing a spatial inhomogeneity in the interaction strengths. For this we partition the chain into two equal segments within which the spins interact with different coupling strengths. The ratio of these couplings defines an inhomogeneity parameter, whose variation away from unity leads to constrained dynamics. We characterize this crossover using multiple diagnostics, such as the long-time saturation of out-of-time-ordered correlators, level-spacing statistics, and the spectral form factor. We further examine the consequences for operator growth in Krylov space and for entanglement generation in the system's eigenstates. Together, these results demonstrate that introducing a macroscopic inhomogeneity in coupling strengths provides a minimal, disorder-free route to breaking ergodicity in this specific model of interacting spins."}

The normalized eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenspectra are derived within a non-Hermitian framework, ensuring consistent probability densities. Conditions for the reality of the spectra are established and used to analyze the dependence of eigenvalue behaviour on potential parameters. The study reveals distinct regimes of spectral characteristics arising from the interplay of complex mass, the Morse parameter, and eigenvalues, leading to the emergence of five intrinsic matter types. By analysing the energy eigenspectra, normalization conditions, and probability density profiles across parameter space, we identify regimes corresponding to real-spectrum Hermitian-like matter, quasi-stable or resonant states, purely complex quantum matter, non-physical, non-normalizable states, and a quasi-classical determinate regime in which the probability density becomes spatially static. One of these system exhibits a non-dissipative, collisionless state with long-range gravitational-like characteristics, suggesting a theoretical analogue for dark matter within a non-Hermitian quantum framework. Further, the five identified classes of matter may be interpreted as distinct phases of a single quantum system governed by complex mass and Morse parameters This classification elucidates the boundary between physical and non-physical regimes in complex quantum systems and provides a unified approach for interpreting stability, resonance, and emergent classicality arising from complex parameters."}

Both $\\mathbf{A\\cdot p}$ and $\\mathbf{d\\cdot E}$ interactions are included in the unified gauge, which is truly gauge equivalent to the minimum coupling principle. The Coulomb and dipole interactions are just the special cases of unified gauge. Remarkably three interactions lead to the same results under the resonant condition of field-atom frequencies, while significant difference appears in red and blue detunings. The QPT is analyzed in terms of spin coherent-state variational method, which indicates the abrupt changes of energy spectrum, average photon number as well as the atomic population at the critical point of interaction constant. Crucially, we reveal the sensitive dependence on the initial optical-phase, which is particularly useful to test the validity of three gauges experimentally. The non-Hermitian atom-field interaction results in the exceptional point (EP), beyond which the semiclassical energy function becomes complex.

For unitary parameter encoding generated by local Hamiltonians, such enhancement is characterized by superlinear scaling of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) with system size. Despite extensive progress, a systematic understanding of which many-body quantum states can exhibit this scaling has remained elusive. Here, we develop a general framework that connects metrological performance to long-range entanglement, state-preparation complexity, and quantum error-correction properties. We prove that super-linear QFI scaling necessarily requires long-range entanglement by deriving rigorous complexity-dependent upper bounds on the QFI. We further show that, for two broad classes of quantum error-correcting codes, nondegenerate codes and Calderbank--Shor--Steane quantum low-density parity-check codes, a nonconstant code distance precludes super-linear QFI scaling for a wide class of local Hamiltonians, revealing a fundamental incompatibility between metrological sensitivity and protection against local noise. Finally, we identify constructive routes that evade this obstruction by exploiting asymmetric code structures. In particular, we show that states associated with classical low-density parity-check codes, as well as asymmetric toric code states, both having asymmetric logical distances, can achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling. Together, our results establish long-range entanglement and asymmetric error correction as the essential resource underlying quantum metrology and clarify the interplay among state complexity, error correction, and metrological power."}

Building on the history matching framework by Lguensat et al. (2023), we fully automate the tuning process with a new convergence criterion and propose replacing classical Gaussian process emulators with quantum counterparts. We benchmark three quantum kernel architectures, distinguished by their quantum feature map circuits. A dimensionality argument implies, in principle, an increased expressivity of the quantum kernels over their classical competitors. For each kernel type, we perform an extensive hyperparameter optimization of our tuning algorithm. We confirm the validity of a quantum-inspired approach based on statevector simulation by numerically demonstrating the superiority of two studied quantum kernels over the canonical classical RBF kernel. Finally, we discuss the pathway towards real quantum hardware, mainly driven by a transition to shot-based simulations and evaluating quantum kernels via randomized measurements, which can mitigate the effect of gate errors. The very low qubit requirements and moderate circuit depths, together with a minimal number of trainable circuit parameters, make our method particularly NISQ-friendly."}

This is particularly relevant in EO, where labeled data are often costly to obtain and limited in availability. However, classical DMs still face significant computational limitations, requiring hundreds to thousands of inference steps, as well as difficulties in capturing the intricate spatial and spectral correlations characteristic of EO data. Recent research in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), including initial attempts of Quantum Generative Models, offers a fundamentally different approach to overcome these challenges. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce the Quanvolutional Conditioned U-Net (QCU-Net), a hybrid quantum--classical architecture that applies quantum operations within a conditioned diffusion framework using a novel quanvolutional feature-extraction approach, for generating synthetic labeled EO imagery. Extensive experiments on the EuroSAT RGB dataset demonstrate that our QCU-Net achieves superior results. Notably, it reduces the Fréchet Inception Distance by 64%, lowers the Kernel Inception Distance by 76%, and yields higher semantic accuracy. Ablation studies further reveal that strategically positioning quantum layers and employing entangling variational circuits enhance model performance and convergence.

In this study, we propose a quantum blockchain protocol whose protection mechanism is directly derived from quantum mechanical principles. The protocol combines high-dimensional Bell states, time-entanglement, entanglement switching, and high-dimensional superdense coding. Encoding classical block information into time-delimited qudit states allows block identity and data verification to be implemented through the causal sequencing of quantum measurements instead of cryptographic hash functions. High-dimensional coding increases the information capacity per quantum carrier and improves noise resistance. Time-entanglement provides distributed authentication, non-repudiation, and tamper detection across the blockchain. Each block derives its own public-private key pair directly from the observed quantum correlations by performing high-dimensional Bell state measurements in successive time steps. Because these keys are dependent on the time ordering of measurements, attempts to alter block data or disrupt the protocol's timing structure inevitably affect the reconstructed correlations and are revealed during validation. Recent advances in the creation and detection of high-dimensional time-slice entanglement demonstrate that the necessary quantum resources are compatible with emerging quantum communication platforms. Taken together, these considerations suggest that the proposed framework can be evaluated as a viable and scalable candidate for quantum-secure blockchain architectures in future quantum network environments."}

We extend the Bayesian framework from parameter estimation to global function inference, where the task is to infer a target function of the sensor input drawn from an arbitrary prior, and we demonstrate a clear computational-sensing advantage for direct functional inference over indirect reconstruction. We relate the corresponding Bayesian risk to the Capacity metric and argue that the Resolvable Expressive Capacity provides a natural measure of the space of functions accessible in a single shot. The resulting eigentask analysis identifies noise-robust feature combinations that yield compact estimators with improved accuracy and reduced optimization cost in resource-limited or real-time on-device settings."}

In this context, it is natural to differentiate between states -- and corresponding dynamics -- that involve only finitely many degrees of freedom, referred to as local, and those that are inherently nonlocal. Previous studies have shown that such systems can support nonlocal coherent states (NCS). In this work, we demonstrate that NCS can dynamically evolve into nonlocal cat states under the influence of a nonlocal Hamiltonian -- specifically, the square of the total number operator. Crucially, the resulting dynamics cannot be decomposed into local factors. Furthermore, we explore broader mathematical implications of these phenomena within the framework of generalized bosons. Our findings highlight that the concepts of coherent states and nonlocal cat states are not inherently bound together; rather, their fusion is a distinctive feature of standard bosons. Finally, we propose that if the generalized boson framework can be physically realized in engineered quantum systems, the phenomena described here may hold significant relevance for both physics and materials science."}

We are left to wonder: does the same hold when the set of accessible measurements is constrained? Such constraints are necessary to account for realistic experimental restrictions. Here, we consider a fully Gaussian scenario focusing on only Gaussian measurements. We prove that the optimal Gaussian measurement protocol remains local, if the information is encoded in either the displacement or the covariance matrix. However, when the information is imprinted on both, this no longer holds true: we construct a simple global Gaussian measurement where the Fisher information becomes super additive. These results can improve parameter estimation tasks via feasible tools. Namely, in quantum optical platforms our proposed global operation requires only passive global operations and single mode Gaussian measurements. We demonstrate this in two examples where we estimate squeezing and losses. While in the former case there is a significant gap between the Fisher information of the optimal Gaussian measurement and the quantum Fisher information for a single copy, this gap can be reduced with joint Gaussian measurements and closed in the asymptotic limit of many copies."}

The core idea is to \\textit{disentangle} the target MPS using a sequence of optimised local unitaries, and then reverse this process to obtain a state preparation circuit. Specifically, we define a loss function directly on the Schmidt spectra of intermediate states and use automatic differentiation to optimise each circuit layer so as to systematically reduce entanglement entropy. Once a disentangling sequence has been learned, we take the adjoints of the optimised unitaries to obtain a shallow-depth circuit that approximately reconstructs the target MPS from the computational all-zero state. We benchmark SSO across a range of MPS approximations to the ground states of local Hamiltonians and demonstrate state-of-the-art shallow-depth performance, improving accuracy by up to an order of magnitude over existing methods.

These issues become especially pronounced in the strong noise regime for gates with fidelities around $90\\%$. To address these limitations, we introduce an extended CSB model together with a fidelity estimate interval (FEI) -- an interval-valued estimate of the target gate fidelity. Numerical simulation demonstrates that FEI remains sufficiently narrow, with its midpoint reliably approximating the true fidelity. We further validate the protocol on a trapped-ion quantum processor by benchmarking two implementations of the three-qubit Toffoli gate.

Wolfram as generic model systems for multicomputational processes, emphasizing their significance as a foundation for modeling complexity, nondeterminism, and branching structures of measurement outcomes. Here, we investigate a specific class of multiway systems based on cyclic character strings with a neighborhood constraint - the latter called Leibnizian strings. We show that such strings exhibit a Fermi-Dirac distribution for expectation values of occupation numbers of character neighborhoods. A Leibnizian string serves as an abstraction of a $N$-fermion system. A multiway system of these strings encodes causal relations between rewriting events in a nondeterministic manner. The collection of character strings realizes a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module with a symmetric $\\mathbb{Z}$-bilinear form. For discrete spaces, this generalizes the notion of an inner product over a vector field. This admits a discrete analogue of the path integral and a $S$-matrix for multiway systems of Leibnizian strings. The elements of this $S$-matrix yield transition amplitudes between states of the multiway system based on an action defined over a sequence of Leibnizian strings. We then show that these $S$-matrices give explicit representations of quantum gates for qubits and qudits, and also circuits composed of such gates. We find that, as formal models of nondeterministic computation, rewriting systems of Leibnizian strings with causal structure encode representations of the CNOT, $π/8$, and Hadamard gates. Hence, using multiway systems one can represent quantum circuits for qubits."}

This consists in a procedure to transform $n$ parallel queries of an arbitrary quantum channel into $n$ parallel queries of the same uniformly random Stinespring isometry, via universal encoding and decoding operations that are efficiently implementable. When the channel is promised to have Choi rank at most $r$, the procedure can be tailored to yield a Stinespring environment of dimension $r$.

Here, we present a scalable and reconfigurable silicon photonic integrated circuit capable of emulating arbitrary non-Hermitian time evolution with high precision. Using this programmable platform, we implement a two-band non-Hermitian Hamiltonian defined on a Klein-bottle topology a nonorientable parameter space that enables exceptional phases forbidden on orientable manifolds. Through an on-chip amplitude-and-phase reconstruction protocol, we retrieve the full complex Hamiltonian at multiple points in parameter space and experimentally map the associated Fermi arc where the imaginary eigenvalue gap closes. The orientation of the measured Fermi arc reveals a nontrivial exceptional topology: it implies the presence of same-charge EPs (or an EP monopole) that cannot annihilate locally on the Klein bottle. Our results demonstrate the first photonic realization of exceptional topology on a nonorientable manifold and establish a versatile platform for exploring exotic non-Hermitian and topological models relevant to classical and quantum photonics."}

Chai, J. Chem. Phys. 136, 154104 (2012)] has been demonstrated to be an efficient and accurate electronic structure method for studying the ground-state properties of large multi-reference (MR) systems at absolute zero. To explore the thermal equilibrium properties of large MR systems at finite electronic temperatures, in the present work, we propose the finite-temperature (FT) extension of TAO-DFT, denoted as FT-TAO-DFT. Besides, to unlock the dynamical information of large MR systems at finite temperatures, FT-TAO-DFT is combined with ab initio molecular dynamics, leading to FT-TAO-AIMD. In addition, we also develop FT-TAO-DFT-based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), denoted as FT-TAO-QM/MM, to provide a cost-effective description of the thermal equilibrium properties of a QM subsystem with MR character embedded in an MM environment at finite temperatures. Moreover, the FT-TAO-DFT, FT-TAO-AIMD, and FT-TAO-QM/MM methods are employed to explore the radical nature and infrared (IR) spectra of n-acenes (n = 2--6), consisting of n linearly fused benzene rings, in vacuum and in an argon (Ar) matrix at finite temperatures. According to our calculations, for n-acenes at 1000 K or below, the electronic temperature effects on the radical nature and IR spectra are very minor, while the nuclear temperature effects on these properties are noticeable. For n-acene in an Ar matrx at absolute zero, the Ar matrix has minimal impact on the radical nature of n-acene, while the co-deposition procedure of n-acene and Ar atoms may affect the IR spectrum of n-acene."}

Includes Supplementary Information. Code available at https://github.com/prasoon-s/QuMorpheus", "summary": "The rigorous description of Conical Intersections (CIs) remains the central challenge of non-adiabatic quantum chemistry. While the ``Yarkony Seam'' -- the $(3N-8)$-dimensional manifold of degeneracy -- is well-understood geometrically, its accurate characterization by high-level electronic structure methods is plagued by numerical instabilities. Specifically, standard Coupled Cluster (CC) theory suffers from root bifurcations near Ground State CIs, rendering the ``Gold Standard'' of chemistry inapplicable where it is needed most. Here, we present \\textbf{QuMorpheus}, an open-source computational package that resolves these singularities by implementing a topological framework based on Dissipative Mixed Hodge Modules (DMHM) [P. Saurabh, arXiv:2512.19487 (2025)]. By algorithmically mapping the CC polynomial equations to a spectral sheaf, we compute the exact Monodromy ($μ$) invariants of the intersection. We demonstrate that this automated algebraic geometry approach correctly identifies the physical ground state topology in the Köhn-Tajti model and resolves the intersection seams of realistic chemical systems, including Ethylene and the Chloronium ion ($\\mathrm{H_2Cl^+}$). Furthermore, we apply QuMorpheus to the photoisomerization of Previtamin D, proving that the experimentally observed Woodward-Hoffmann selection rules are a direct consequence of a topological ``Monodromy Wall'' ($μ=1, γ=π$) rather than purely energetic barriers. This establishes a general software solution to the ``Yarkony Problem,'' enabling the robust, automated mapping of global intersection seams in complex molecular systems. The topological stability of these intersections allows for the control protocols discussed in Ref.[P. Saurabh, Submitted to Phys. Rev. X (2025)]."}

This quantity, which we denote by $ω_{α,β}$, is parameterized by two positive real numbers $α, β$, and can be seen as a ``Rényi-like\" generalization of the modular commutator -- another entanglement probe proposed as a way to compute the chiral central charge from a bulk wave function. We obtain analytic expressions for $ω_{α,β}$ for gapped ground states of non-interacting fermion Hamiltonians as well as ground states of string-net models. In both cases, we find that $ω_{α,β}$ takes a universal value related to the chiral central charge. For integer values of $α$ and $β$, our quantity $ω_{α,β}$ can be expressed as an expectation value of permutation operators acting on an appropriate replica system, providing a natural route to measuring $ω_{α,β}$ in numerical simulations and potentially, experiments."}
