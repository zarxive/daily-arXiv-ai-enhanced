The timelike circular geodesics around LQRNBH and the influence of the model parameters on the circular motion are also discussed. It is found that contrary to the case of the parameter $Q$, the increase of the quantum parameter $\u03b6$ leads to the increase of the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). Then, by considering a thin accretion disk model, various radiation properties of the LQRNBH and the effects of the model parameters on them are studied. Concrete examples are provided for quantitative comparison of the radiation properties between LQRNBH and Schwarzschild black hole. With the ray-tracing method, the isoradial curves, redshift distributions, and the observed radiation fluxes of the direct and secondary images of the LQRNBH with the thin accretion disk for various model parameters and observation angles are numerically calculated and discussed.

Using analytic approximations for the superpotential (power-series and a Picard approximation), we derive closed-form SWKB tunnelling expressions and compute transmission probabilities as functions of the Chaplygin parameters $A$, $B$ and $\u03b1$.

Performance metrics including fidelity, CHSH violation, success probability, circuit depth, and gate counts are evaluated.\n  Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of algorithmic performance on hardware topology and noise characteristics.

We report the first observational evidence of a set of quadratic quasi-normal modes in the gravitational-wave ringdown of a binary black hole merger. Analyzing the signal from GW250114, we detect six nonlinear modes from the quadratic coupling of the fundamental $(2,2,0)$ mode and its first two overtones. At 5 final mass ($M_\\mathrm{f}$) after the merger, the evidence for these nonlinear modes reaches a Bayes factor of 74. To single out these contributions, we employ recent theoretical progress to compute the waveforms and subtract the corresponding nonlinear modes from a numerical relativity surrogate waveform. Our data analysis uses a novel method that incorporates inspiral-merger inference results as a highly constraining prior for the ringdown inference. We further perform a test allowing for phenomenological deviations for the theoretically predicted amplitudes of the quadratic modes. The results show that an amplitude of zero is excluded at $3.0~\u03c3$ significance level, while the theoretical expectation is consistent with the inference.

Notably, the field of topological photonics has emerged in the last decade primarily by simulating tight-binding models of electrons within topologically nontrivial condensed-matter systems. Optical simulation of topologically nontrivial Hamiltonians requires optical resonators with minimal loss and well-matched frequencies whose intersite coupling can also be precisely controlled. The Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics (SNAP) platform satisfies all these requirements, exhibiting ultra-low loss operation and sub-angstrom fabrication precision, making it an excellent platform for AHS. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the first topologically nontrivial photonic SNAP devices by coupling together axial modes of adjacent SNAP microresonators to form a variety of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattices. The devices manifest numerous distinct topological band structures corresponding to each axial mode of the microresonators, enabling us to observe behavior both close to and far from the topological-trivial phase transition. We further expand the scope of topological SNAP systems to contain not just higher-order generalizations of SSH lattices, but junctions between multiband lattices with dissimilar topological phases created by coupling up to 21 uniform and well-matched SNAP microresonators. Analyzing such \"heterojunctions\" necessitated our development of generalized topological polarization methods.

This paper presents a framework for estimating contact points and robot localization in a known planar environment using a single whisker sensor. We develop a family of virtual sensor models. Each model maps robot configurations to sensor observations and enables structured reasoning through the concept of preimages - the set of robot states consistent with a given observation. The notion of virtual sensor models serves as an abstraction to reason about state uncertainty without dependence on physical implementation. By combining sensor observations with a motion model, we estimate the contact point. Iterative estimation then enables reconstruction of obstacle boundaries. Furthermore, intersecting states inferred from current observations with forward-projected states from previous steps allow accurate robot localization without relying on vision or external systems. The framework supports both deterministic and possibilistic formulations and is validated through simulation and physical experiments using a low-cost, 3D printed, Hall-effect-based whisker sensor.

By extending the Einstein-Hilbert action to include quadratic curvature terms as $\\mathcal{L}\\propto R-\u03bbC^2+\u03bcR^2$, the theory introduces two massive modes: a scalar mode and a ghost tensor mode. Using the post-Newtonian expansion method, we derive the explicit expressions for the metric for a general source up to 1.5PN order. Furthermore, for a point-mass source, we extend the solution to 2PN order and evaluate the effective Parameterized Post-Newtonian parameters $\u03b3(r)$ and $\u03b2(r)$. The results show that deviations from General Relativity are exponentially suppressed. The theory has the feature $\u03b3(r)\\equiv 1$ when $m_R=m_W$, and to ensure that gravity remains attractive, we have $m_W>m_R/4$.

Yet their practical usefulness and performance depend critically on reliability, quantified by the noise-to-signal ratios (NSRs), i.e., normalized fluctuations of work and power, where reliability decreases inversely with increasing NSR. We establish fundamental limits to this reliability: both work and power NSRs are universally bounded from below by a function of charging speed, imposing a reliability limit inherent to any quantum battery. More strikingly, we find that a quantum mechanical uncertainty relation forbids the simultaneous suppression of work and power fluctuations, revealing a fundamental trade-off that also limits the reliability of quantum batteries. We analyze the trade-off and limits, as well as their scaling behavior, across parallel (local), collective {(fully non-local)}, and hybrid (semi-local) charging schemes for many-body quantum batteries, finding that increasing power by exploiting stronger entanglement comes at the cost of diminished reliability of power. Similar trends are also observed in the charging of quantum batteries utilizing transverse Ising-like interactions. These suggest that achieving both high power and reliability require neither parallel nor collective charging, but a hybrid charging scheme with an intermediate range of interactions. Therefore, our analysis shapes the practical and efficient design of reliable and high-performance quantum batteries.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we study thin CrSBr layers using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy in an external magnetic field, revealing a step-like reduction in the exciton lifetime from 11 to 7 ps, during the magnetization flip from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase. The reduction of the exciton lifetime in the ferromagnetic phase persists below the N\u00e9el temperature, as evidenced by its strong magnetic-field dependence that disappears in the paramagnetic phase. Ab initio calculations reveal a one-dimensional nature of free excitons accompanied by a pronounced change in the oscillator strength across the magnetic phase transition predicting a shorter radiative lifetime of free excitons in the antiferromagnetic phase of CrSBr contradicting the experimental observations. This discrepancy is explained by strong localization of excitons at low tempature. We show both experimentally and theoretically that the observed magnetic switching of the exciton lifetime is attributed to a larger exciton localization volume leading to a larger oscillator strength in the ferromagnetic phase. The results show that disorder-induced localization effects play a key role in exciton dynamics in CrSBr.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728CrSBr\u5c42\u4e2d\uff0c\u78c1\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\u5bfc\u81f4\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u5bff\u547d\u5448\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u78c1\u6001\u4e0b11\u76ae\u79d2\u8fc5\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u81f37\u76ae\u79d2\uff0c\u78c1\u6027\u9006\u8f6c\u540e\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e0b\u964d\u8d8b\u52bf\u6301\u7eed\u81f3\u4f4e\u6e29\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u975e\u78c1\u6027\u9636\u6bb5\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u5728\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u5149\u81f4\u53d1\u5149\u5149\u8c31scopy\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u5bf9CrSBr\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u78c1\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u5bff\u547d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u78c1\u6027\u7ffb\u8f6c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u5bff\u547d\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u78c1\u6027\u53cd\u8f6c\u540e\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0b\u964d\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u4f4e\u6e29\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u6750\u6599\u53d8\u4e3a\u975e\u78c1\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7684\u5bff\u547d\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u5176\u78c1\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u78c1\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\u5bfc\u81f4\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u5176\u632f\u5e45\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8f90\u5c04\u5bff\u547d\u3002\u8fd9\u6697\u793a\u6750\u6599\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u5176\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u88c5\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This article proposes a method to improve the magnetron output characteristics based on regulating its anode current by a novel active distortion eliminator. It takes advantage of the constant current state of MOSFETs to suppress the anode current ripple and eliminate the magnetron output ripples. An improved switch-mode power supply is applied to a 1-kW commercial S -band magnetron in the experiment. The peak-to-peak anode current ripple is reduced from 31 to 7 mA. The spectral width of the free-running magnetron is decreased from 246 to 87 kHz. In the injection locking state, the spur noise is significantly reduced with a maximum suppression strength of 23 dB at a 100-Hz offset. The peak-to-peak value of the magnetron magnitude and phase jitter are suppressed to 15% and 16% of their original values at a power injection ratio of 0.13.

We show that the symplectic structure induced by the four-dimensional theory coincides with the canonical symplectic form on the Hitchin moduli space in the complex structure corresponding to the moduli space of Higgs bundles. We further provide a direct construction of Hitchin Hamiltonians in terms of the four-dimensional gauge field. Exploiting the freedom in the choice of the meromorphic one-form, we construct a family of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theories depending on a $\\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter. Upon reduction to two dimensions, these descend to a corresponding family of two-dimensional actions on $\u03a3$ whose field equations are again Hitchin's equations. Furthermore, we obtain a family of symplectic structures from our family of four-dimensional theories and show that they agree with the hyperk\u00e4hler family of symplectic forms on the Hitchin moduli space, thereby identifying the $\\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter with the twistor parameter of the Hitchin moduli space.

Nonlinear interactions are a dominant source of low-frequency noise, mixing noise from multiple degrees of freedom. The lowest-order form is bilinear noise, in which the noise from two feedback-controlled subsystems multiplies to mask gravitational waves. Bilinear couplings require control trade-offs that simultaneously balance high- and low-frequency noise. Currently, there is no known lower limit to bilinear control noise. Here, we develop benchmark cost functions for bilinear noise and associated figures of merit. Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control then establishes aggressive feedback that saturates the lower bounds on the cost functions. We then develop a mixed LQG and $H_\\infty$ approach to directly compute stable, robust, and optimal feedback, using the LIGO's alignment control system as an example. Direct computations are fast while ensuring a global optimum. By calculating optimal robust control, it is possible to construct the lower bound on controls noise along the Pareto front of practical controllers for LIGO. This method can be used to drastically improve controls noise in existing observatories as well as to set subsystem control noise requirements for next-generation detectors with parameterized design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\uff0cLIGO\u7b49\u4f4e\u9891\u5e72\u6d89ometer\u7531\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d7\u5230\u4e86\u6781\u5927\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e8c\u9636\u8026\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5e72\u6270\u5230\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0cLIGO\u7b49\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u5bf9\u4f4e\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4e0b\u9650\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\uff08LQG\uff09\u548c\u65e0\u7a77\u8303\u6570\uff08H\u221e\uff09\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u5411\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f4e\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u5584\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\uff08LQG\uff09\u548c\u65e0\u7a77\u8303\u6570\uff08H\u221e\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LIGO\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6240\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9LIGO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e5f\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5404\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d21\u732e\u5728\u4e8e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u5316\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u4f4e\u4f4e\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

When the refractive index varies periodically in time, multiple time-refractions and -reflections interfere, giving rise to photonic time-crystals (PTCs). Importantly, PTCs display momentum bands separated by gaps in which the modes experience exponential amplification, drawing energy from the modulation in a non-resonant fashion. Ordinary nonlinear optics does not operate in this regime: the material response is either very weak or very slow. One of the immediate consequences is that time-reflection of light at optical frequencies has never been observed in experiments. Here, we experimentally realize an order-unity change in the refractive index occurring at sub-cycle rates, and explore the phenomena emerging from it. By varying the duration of the index change from extending over many cycles to being significantly below a single cycle, we observe that the frequency shift of the time-refraction is enhanced as the index variation occurs faster.

Computing excitation spectra in the presence of vortices and persistent currents, we uncover a vortex-driven de-softening mechanism whereby quantized vorticity elevates the gapless Goldstone mode to a finite-energy roton, restoring superfluidity. This effect results in re-entrant supersolid phases as a function of rotation frequency, revealing a fundamental coupling between topological defects and crystalline order.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u65cb\u8f6c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8d85\u51b7\u6c14\u4f53\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6253\u7834\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u8f6c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u5230\u8d85\u56fa\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u65cb\u8f6c\u9891\u7387\uff08\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u8d85\u7c92\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e6\u53d1\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u5230\u8d85\u56fa\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5728\u73bb\u8272-\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\u4f53\u4e2d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e26\u6709\u6da1\u65cb\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u6da1\u65cb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51cf\u8f6f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5373\u91cf\u5316\u6da1\u65cb\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a7a GRAT\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u968f\u7740\u65cb\u8f6c\u9891\u7387\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u56de\u73af\u72b6\u7684\u8d85\u56fa\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u7f3a\u9677\u4e0e\u6676\u4f53\u6709\u5e8f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u5230\u8d85\u56fa\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u6da1\u65cb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51cf\u8f6f\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5728 Understand \u548c \u5e94\u7528 \u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5468\u671f\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u73bb\u8272-\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 vortex core energy \u548c Goldstone mode \u5bfc\u81f4\u7684 scan \u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5982\u65cb\u8f6c\u9891\u7387\u548c\u6da1\u65cb\u6570\u3002", "result": "1. \u8c03\u6574\u65cb\u8f6c\u9891\u7387\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e6\u53d1\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u5230\u8d85\u56fa\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\u30022. \u6d89\u53ca\u6da1\u65cb\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u8ba1\u7b97\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6da1\u65cb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51cf\u8f6f\u673a\u5236\u30023. \u6d89\u53ca\u6da1\u65cb\u6570\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u9891\u7387\u7684\u56de\u73af\u72b6\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u62d3\u6251\u7f3a\u9677\u4e0e\u6676\u4f53\u6709\u5e8f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u65cb\u8f6c\u9891\u7387\u76f4\u63a5\u5f15\u53d1\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u5230\u8d85\u56fa\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6da1\u65cb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51cf\u8f6f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8d85\u56fa\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u76f8\u53d8\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

These devices employ a broadband infrared emitter, thermopile detector, and a spectrally selective bandpass filter tuned to the vibrational resonance of the target analyte. However, the fabrication of these filters is costly and limited to a single frequency. This limitation introduces a fundamental tradeoff, as broadening the optical passband width enhances sensitivity but compromises selectivity, whereas narrowing improves selectivity at the expense of sensitivity. In this work, we validate a filterless NDIR approach using a multi-peak thermal emitter developed through inverse design. This emitter enhances detection sensitivity by targeting multiple absorption bands, demonstrated through the creation of a sensor designed for the C-H vibrational modes of propane. Additionally, a set of single-peak emitters were developed to showcase the capability of designing highly selective sensors operating within close spectral proximity. These emitters, targeting the stretching modes of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, exhibit Q-factors above 50 and minimal crosstalk, enabling accurate detection of the target gas without interference from gases with spectrally adjacent absorption bands. This is enabled by the implementation of an aperiodic distributed Bragg reflectors, which allows for higher Q-factors with fewer layers than a periodic Bragg reflector using the same materials and number of layers, thereby reducing fabrication complexity and cost. Experimental results validate that this approach breaks the tradeoff between sensitivity and selectivity. This work highlights the potential of optimized thermal emitters for more efficient and compact gas sensing applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In contrast, only PFE is observed in the GaN-substrate sample, with a trap energy of 0.75 eV, suggesting that the presence of TAT is related to the higher dislocation density in structures grown on sapphire substrates.

Yet enantiosensitive optical responses are very weak. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework in which a chiral optical cavity under strong coupling directly lifts the degeneracy of opposite enantiomers at the electronic-dipole level. The cavity's parity-breaking field inside the cavity induces distinct site-energy shifts for left- versus right-handed molecules, producing robust enantioselective polariton states that overcome the weakness of traditional chiroptical effects. Using cavity quantum electrodynamics simulations, we show that strong light-matter coupling reshapes the polaritonic energy landscape and leads to enantiomer-specific coherence lifetimes and relaxation pathways. To reveal these dynamics, we propose ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) as a probe, capable of resolving polaritonic splittings on femtosecond timescales. Simulated 2DES spectra exhibit unambiguous enantioselective signatures of the cavity-induced asymmetry. These findings establish that chiral cavities provide a powerful platform for detecting and controlling molecular handedness beyond the limits of conventional optical methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We develop a framework for regulated topology change based on smooth Lorentzian spin cobordisms with interpolating metrics, allowing a transient failure of global hyperbolicity while preserving smoothness, Lorentz signature, and spin compatibility. Within this framework we introduce the Chiral Weyl Curvature Diagnostic, a curvature-based functional that weights topology-changing geometries by conformal curvature, spin admissibility, and topological complexity. The diagnostic functional is built from Weyl curvature invariants and includes a parity-odd dual Weyl term that is sensitive to geometric chirality. Spin consistency is enforced via a Stiefel-Whitney constraint, ensuring that only physically admissible cobordisms contribute. As an example, we construct a smooth spin cobordism between a Morris-Thorne wormhole and asymptotically flat Minkowski spacetime. In the throat region the curvature response is shown to be Weyl-dominated, and the parity-odd Weyl contribution sharply distinguishes chiral knotted embeddings while vanishing for amphichiral configurations. We then show that braids provide a natural language of throat dynamics: evolving wormhole throats trace time-dependent braid movies, with elementary braid generators representing the fundamental topological operations of the cobordism. Replacing crossing number by a braid-based complexity refines the diagnostic functional to operate at the level of these elementary exchanges and extends it naturally to multithroat and networked configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, previous protocols often assume noise affects only the signal accumulation step, while the QEC operations -- including state preparation and measurement -- are noiseless.

In the prepulse scheme, a high-intensity pulse induces Rabi oscillations, modulating the 2D spectral amplitude and lineshape when its spectral bandwidth matches the ensemble full width at half maximum (FWHM). To overcome this limitation, the DP method employs variable inter-pulse delay to generate predetermined periodic spectral modulation without bandwidth constraints. Moreover, tuning the relative phase between DP pulses allows selective switching of frequency components, enabling controlled enhancement or suppression of distinct spectral features.

At low electron densities, the system enters a Wigner regime characterized by dominant 4kF correlations; increasing the electron density leads to a crossover from the Wigner regime to a Friedel regime with dominant 2kF correlations. We support these results through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the interacting ground state under both screened and unscreened Coulomb potentials. We propose experimental signatures of the Wigner-Friedel crossover via charge transport and charge sensing in both zero- and high-magnetic field limits. We also analyze the impact of short-range correlated disorder - including random alloy fluctuations and valley splitting variations - and identify that the Wigner-Friedel crossover remains robust until disorder levels of about 400 micro eV.

The research combines both experimental and theoretical investigations, utilizing the differential microwave dielectrometry method and numerical modeling with COMSOL software. Complex permittivity (CP) values dependence of IgG water solutions on the protein concentration was experimentally obtained at the microwaves using original microwave dielectrometer setup. It was shown that increase of IgG concentration resulted in the CP values of the solutions studied decrease. The experimentally obtained CP data for the IgG water solutions were used as a basis for microwave metal-dielectric metasurface unit cell numerical modeling. The metal-dielectric metasurface consisting of Teflon substrate and plane copper microresonators was combined with a standard 96-well microplate used in clinical laboratories. Optimization of the obtained metasurface unit cell revealed that the size and position of the copper microresonators within the unit cell significantly impact the sensor sensitivity for determining the IgG concentration in aqueous solutions. The metasurface with the unit cell containing four copper microresonators provided the most sensitive platform for detecting variations in the IgG concentration in the sample. The frequency shift of the reflection coefficient was directly related to changes in the protein concentration.

By engineering physically balanced gain and loss following a Fibonacci sequence, we realize two distinct geometrical configurations in which the ring either preserve or explicitly break PT symmetry, and further explore complementary realizations obtained by reversing the signs of the on site potentials. Using the non equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we analyze transmission properties and bond current densities to quantify both transport and circulating currents. A comparison with the Hermitian limit establishes a clear baseline, where the ring supports only weak responses upon introducing disorder. In sharp contrast, non-Hermiticity leads to a pronounced amplification of transport and circular currents, and hence of the induced magnetic field. We further demonstrate that non-Hermitian transport is highly sensitive to gain and loss sign reversal and, in the non-PT-symmetric case, exhibits an unconventional dependence on system size governed by the parity of the Fibonacci sequence and hopping correlations. Remarkably, the current does not decay monotonically with increasing system size, revealing a distinct scaling behavior absent in conventional Hermitian systems.

Our approach leverages the intrinsic ion-phonon interactions, where two trapped ions, each interacting with a shared vibrational mode, are driven on both red- and blue-sideband transitions. This enables the creation of a squeezed state of motion through the dynamic coupling between the ions' internal states and the phonon mode. Unlike traditional methods that require bath engineering, our model demonstrates that squeezed lasing can be achieved through a direct manipulation of ion-phonon interactions, with no external reservoirs required. We explore the steady-state behavior of the system, analyzing the onset of lasing, gain-loss balance, and the role of the squeezing parameter in shaping the phonon field's statistical properties. Furthermore, we show how external coherent drives can stabilize phase coherence and achieve controlled quadrature squeezing, offering a simple yet effective method for achieving squeezed lasing in quantum mechanical systems.

By analyzing the second-order correlation functions, we demonstrate that this enhancement originates from the amplification of intra-mode photon-number correlations, rather than from inter-mode correlations. We further extend our analysis to realistic interferometers with photon loss using a purification-based variational approach. Although loss degrades the achievable precision, the OPA-assisted scheme retains a clear advantage for moderate loss, indicating a degree of robustness against dissipation. Our results clarify the physical mechanism underlying OPA-enhanced multiparameter quantum metrology and provide guidelines for optimizing phase estimation protocols in realistic noisy environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u4e09\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u540c\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e24\u4e2a\u5149\u76f8\u4f4d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5e38\u6709\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u6b63\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u8f93\u51fa\u6001\u7684 Photon \u6570\u77e9\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u91cf\u5b50 Fisher \u4fe1\u606f\u77e9\u9635\u5728\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u5728\u65e0\u635f\u8017\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5e94\u7528\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u65e0\u653e\u5927\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u76f8\u6bd4\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e8c\u9636\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u6e90\u4e8e\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684 photon \u6570\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u53d7\u635f\u8017\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u635f\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u635f\u8017\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u653e\u5927\u60c5\u666f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u6297\u6d88\u6563 robustness\u3002\u63a2\u8ba8\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u5728\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002\u5149\u7167\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5bb9\u9650\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u57fa\u672c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u4e09\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u7684\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u8f93\u51fa\u6001\u7684 photon \u6570\u77e9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u77e9\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5b50 Fisher \u4fe1\u606f\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u5206\u6790\u65e0\u635f\u8017\u548c\u53d7\u635f\u8017\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u53d7\u635f\u8017\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u3002", "result": "\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u65e0\u635f\u8017\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u662f\u65e0\u653e\u5927\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u7684\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e8c\u9636\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u7684 photon \u6570\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u53d7\u635f\u8017\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u635f\u8017\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u653e\u5927\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u6297\u6d88\u6563 robustness\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u7684 photon \u6570\u76f8\u5173\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u5728\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53d7\u635f\u8017\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u65b9\u6848\u4ecd\u7136\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u635f\u8017\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8fd9\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u5728\u6297\u6d88\u6563\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u5149\u53c2\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Its core input model is the block encoding framework, in which non-unitary matrices are embedded into larger unitary matrices. Because the gate complexity of the block-encoding subroutine largely determines the overall cost of QSVT-based algorithms, developing new and more efficient block encodings is crucial for achieving practical quantum advantage. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for constructing quantum circuits that block encode linear combinations of Pauli strings. Our approach relies on two key components. First, we apply a transformation that converts the Pauli strings into pairwise anti-commuting ones, making the transformed linear combination unitary and thus directly implementable as a quantum circuit. Second, we employ a correction transformation based on the stabilizer formalism which uses an ancilla register to restore the original Pauli strings. Our method can be implemented with an ancilla register whose size scales logarithmically with the number of system qubits. It can also be extended to larger ancilla registers, which can substantially reduce the overall quantum circuit complexity. We present four concrete examples and use numerical simulations to compare our method's circuit complexity with that of the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) approach. We find that our method achieves circuit complexities comparable to or better than LCU, with possible advantages when the structure of the target operators can be exploited.

Therefore, any which-way information present in the photons will degrade quantum interference and introduce errors. While quantum error correction can address such errors in principle, it is highly resource-intensive and operates with a low error threshold, requiring numerous high-quality optical components. We experimentally demonstrate scalable, optimal photon distillation as a substantially more resource-efficient strategy to reduce indistinguishability errors in a way that is compatible with fault-tolerant operation. Photon distillation is an intrinsically bosonic, coherent error-mitigation technique which exploits quantum interference to project single photons into purified internal states, thereby reducing indistinguishability errors at both a higher efficiency and higher threshold than quantum error correction. We observe unconditional error reduction (i.e., below-threshold behaviour) consistent with theoretical predictions, even when accounting for noise introduced by the distillation gate, thereby achieving actual net-gain error mitigation under conditions relevant for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

A mode-resolved analysis reveals how propagating and evanescent channels couple across electrostatic interfaces and how channel selectivity governs transport at normal incidence.

This effect is interpreted as a ghost quantum well, namely an effective cavity formed by internal phase coherence inside the barrier, without true bound states and without restoring coupling to decoupled channels. For single- and double-barrier geometries, we derive compact analytical expressions for the transmission and identify the corresponding resonance conditions. Extending the analysis to multibarrier structures using a transfer-matrix approach, we demonstrate how perfect resonances driven by internal phase matching coexist with Fabry-Perot-like resonances arising from inter-barrier interference.

By deriving a complete analytical solution for the two-emitter case and employing a numerically exact method for larger ensembles, we characterize the full transition from Markovian to non-Markovian collective dynamics for systems of up to $10^3$ emitters. Our results reveal three distinct regimes: a Markovian phase exhibiting the standard superradiant burst, a non-Markovian phase featuring spontaneous superabsorption of the emitted field, and a critical regime marked by pulsed collective emission. We show that the critical spectral width separating these behaviors increases monotonically with the number of emitters, demonstrating that environmental memory effects can be enhanced by cooperativity. Finally, we find that the superradiant scaling of the peak intensity progressively degrades with increasing system size, approaching a subquadratic law in the limit of a perfect cavity. In this regime, spontaneous superabsorption emerges as a distinct manifestation of non-Markovian cooperativity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u80fd\u7ea7\u539f\u5b50\u8fde\u540c\u8870\u51cf\u53ef\u9009\u8154\u5916\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8f90\u5c04\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u89e3\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7528\u6570\u503c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4ece\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5230\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u96c6\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u968f Systems \u7684\u6570\u91cf\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ece 10\u00b3 \u5f00\u59cb\u3002 Got three different regimes: \u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u9636\u6bb5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u8109\u51b2\uff0c\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u9636\u6bb5\u51fa\u73b0\u81ea\u53d1\u7684\u4e0a\u5438\u6536\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u6709\u5206\u754c\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u754c\u7684\u8c31\u5bbd\u968f\u539f\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u957f\u3002\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u6700\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5230\u8fbe\u5b8c\u7f8e\u8154\u65f6\uff0c\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u5cf0\u503c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u589e\u5927\u5728\u4e9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u7387\u8d8b\u8fd1\u3002\u201d\u7b49\u7b49\u3002\u6211\u770b\u5230\u7684\u8fd9\u4e2a_rest \u7684\u6587\u672c\u6709\u3002\u5904\u7406\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u534f\u540c\u8f90\u5c04\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u5149-\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u73af\u5883\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6807\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u64cd\u63a7\u548c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u4e24\u539f\u5b50\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u8fbe\u5230 10\u00b3\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e09\u91cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0a\u90fd\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5728\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u8109\u51b2\uff1b\u5728\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u51fa\u73b0\u81ea\u53d1\u7684\u4e0a\u5438\u6536\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u4e2d\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u754c\u70b9\u88ab\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5206\u754c\u8c31\u5bbd\u968f\u539f\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u6240\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u5b8c\u7f8e\u8154\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5927\u5c0f\u552f\u4e00 Daher \u7684\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u5cf0\u503c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u589e\u5927\u9010\u6e10\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5728\u4e9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u7387\u8d8b\u8fd1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u6027\u548c\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u8f90\u5c04\u73b0\u8c61\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5173\u7cfb\u88ab\u63ed\u793a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u73af\u5883\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u8c03\u63a7\u548c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u6765\u64cd\u7eb5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u5730\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u6807\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Distinguishing these two channels is essential for interpreting nonlinear and quantum-optical experiments based on high-$n$ states, yet their temporal, spectral, and power-dependent signatures often overlap. Here we use time-resolved resonant two-photon excitation to cleanly separate SHG and SE and to map how each depends on $n$, temperature, excitation power, and crystal quality. This approach reveals the markedly different sensitivities of the two processes to phonons, defects, and many-body effects, and establishes practical criteria for identifying SE and SHG in a wide range of experimental conditions.

Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of atomic gases have been an ideal platform for studying many-body quantum phenomena, such as superfluidity, and simultaneously providing an opportunity to broaden our understanding of classical hydrodynamics into quantum systems. In this review, we introduce a range of experimental studies on the pattern formation in quantum fluids of atomic gases under external driving, including Faraday waves in one and two dimensions, surface patterns, and counterflow instabilities in a mixture of superfluids. The pattern formation in the quantum system can be understood through the parametric amplification process, where an unstable dynamical mode can be exponentially amplified, similar to classical systems. Remarkably, the governing equations for surface excitations of trapped BECs can be mathematically equivalent to those of shallow water, indicating a universal description of the hydrodynamic instability across classical and quantum domains. However, the condensates, as superfluids, also possess fundamental quantum characteristics, such as quantized vorticity and a distinct dissipation channel. These unique features showcase many-body fragmentation under strong modulation and the generation of vortices in the nonlinear regime, which could offer a pathway to the study of quantum turbulence. Furthermore, the coexistence of long-range phase coherence and density modulation in driven condensates could provide unexplored features, such as those seen in supersolid-like sound modes, within nonequilibrium settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper reviews pattern formation in quantum gases under external driving, highlighting Bose-Einstein condensates as a platform and drawing parallels with classical hydrodynamics.
