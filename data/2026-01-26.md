### [1] [Bichromatic Tweezers for Qudit Quantum Computing in ${}^{87}$Sr](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16328)
*Enrique A. Segura Carrillo,Eric J. Meier,Michael J. Martin*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: A scheme is proposed to enable qudit-based quantum computing by engineering magic trapping conditions using bichromatic tweezers in the 5s5p ³P₂ manifold of ⁸⁷Sr.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advances in quantum computing and metrology benefit from the development of magic trapping techniques, particularly for qudits encoded in hyperfine states.

Method: The method involves using two laser wavelengths with comparable tensor light shift magnitudes, opposite signs, and an appropriate intensity ratio to suppress differential light shifts across all magnetic sublevels of the 5s5p ³P₂ state, facilitating scalar and tensor magic conditions.

Result: This technique enables magic trapping operations at the tensor magic angle (54.7°) with reduced sensitivity to uncertainties in experimental parameters, enhancing the coherence of nuclear spins, loading protocols, and cooling efficiency for qudits in the ⁸⁷Sr 5s5p ³P₂ manifold.

Conclusion: The proposed bichromatic tweezers technique opens new avenues for quantum computing with improved coherence times and robustness in engineering complex quantum states.

Abstract: Neutral atoms have become a competitive platform for quantum metrology, simulation, sensing, and computing. Current magic trapping techniques are insufficient to engineer magic trapping conditions for qudits encoded in hyperfine states with $J \neq 0$, compromising qudit coherence. In this paper we propose a scheme to engineer magic trapping conditions for qudits via bichromatic tweezers. We show it is possible to suppress differential light shifts across all magnetic sublevels of the $5s5p$ $\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$ state by using two carefully chosen wavelengths (with comparable tensor light shift magnitude and opposite sign) at an appropriate intensity ratio, thus suppressing light-shift induced dephasing, enabling scalar magic conditions between the ground state and $5s5p$ $\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$, and tensor magic conditions for qudits encoded within it. Furthermore, this technique enables robust operation at the tensor magic angle 54.7$^\circ$ with linear trap polarization via reduced sensitivity to uncertainty in experimental parameters. We expect this technique to enable new loading protocols, enhance cooling efficiency, and enhance nuclear spins' coherence times, thus facilitating qudit-based quantum computing in ${}^{87}$Sr in the $5s5p$ $\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$ manifold.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We analyze a class of inner-shell x-ray laser systems in which the initial conditions of the emission are set by a resonant x-ray difference-frequency drive. Using a microscopic density-matrix framework, we show that two coherent x-ray fields at frequencies $ω_1$ and $ω_2$, with $ω_1-ω_2=ω_0$, can induce a phase-locked coherence on a core-level transition at $ω_0$ without requiring an external field or nonlinear susceptibility at that frequency. In the presence of population inversion, this driven coherence sets the phase and temporal onset of the amplified field, while gain remains governed by conventional inner-shell lasing mechanisms. We refer to this operating regime as a resonant x-ray difference-frequency laser (re-XDFL). The analysis demonstrates that difference-frequency-driven coherence provides a physically consistent route to controlled inner-shell x-ray laser emission beyond purely ASE-initiated operation.

Abstract: Neutral atoms for quantum computing applications show promise in terms of scalability and connectivity. We demonstrate the realization of a versatile apparatus capable of stochastically loading a 5x5 array of optical tweezers with single $^{88}$Sr atoms featuring flexible magnetic field control and excellent optical access. A custom-designed oven, spin-flip Zeeman slower, and deflection stage produce a controlled flux of Sr directed to the science chamber. In the science chamber, featuring a vacuum pressure of $3 \times 10^{-11}$ mbar, the Sr is cooled using two laser cooling stages, resulting in $\sim 3 \times 10^5$ atoms at a temperature of 5(1) $μ$K. The optical tweezers feature a $1/e^2$ waist of 0.81(2) $μ$m, and loaded atoms can be imaged with a fidelity of $\sim 0.997$ and a survival probability of $0.99^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$.

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: The paper improves the sensitivity of $^7$Be decay spectroscopy with superconducting sensors containing Ta materials, resolving some uncertainties in the observed spectral features. They used the multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock method to compute single and double shake processes in electron capture decay of $^7$Be, and found that the L/K ratio was underestimated previously at 0.070(7), now revised to 0.0756(20). The systematic uncertainties in the measurements come mainly from electron shake-up and shake-off spectra that lack state-of-the-art atomic theory and electron correlations or relativistic effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sterile neutrinos are considered as possible extensions beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, and precise experimental measurements on their existence are necessitated to explore Majorana mass and the mass-gap mechanism of neutrinos.

Method: The authors conducted electronic structure calculations using the multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock formalism to obtain correlated wavefunctions ab initio and calculated all single and double shake processes in the electron capture decay of atomic $^7$Be. They also modified the existing model of the interaction of the sensor materials with $^7$Be electrons to enhance the accuracy of sensitivity.

Result: The proposed approach successfully explains some but not all of the currently observed spectral features. The L/K capture ratio for $^7$Be in Ta was calculated, and it was revised from 0.070(7) to 0.0756(20). The authors highlight systematic uncertainties from modeling only relatively minor electron correlations and relativistic effects as a direction for future measurements.

Conclusion: Future studies should focus on including electron correlations and relativistic effects in atom modeling to improve the accuracy of measurements and more fully account for the modifications to the $^7$Be wavefunctions caused by embedding them in solid-state sensors with Ta materials.

Abstract: The most stringent laboratory-based experimental limits on the existence of sub-MeV sterile neutrinos are currently set by decay spectroscopy of radioactive $^7$Be embedded into superconducting sensors. The systematic uncertainties are dominated by the modeling of the electron shake-up and shake-off spectra that are not based on state-of-the-art atomic theory and do not include electron correlations or relativistic effects. We have used the multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock formalism to obtain correlated wavefunctions ab initio and compute all single and double shake processes in the electron capture decay of atomic $^7$Be. The simulations can explain some but not all of the observed spectral features, likely because the wave functions are modified by the Ta sensor material that the $^7$Be is embedded into. The new models also show that the L/K electron capture ratio of $^7$Be in Ta has previously been slightly underestimated revising the previous value of 0.070(7) to a new value of 0.0756(20).

### [5] [Active learning for photonics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16287)
*Ryan Lopez,Charlotte Loh,Rumen Dangovski,Marin Soljačić*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Active learning for photonic crystals uses analytic LL-BNNs with uncertainty-driven sampling to accelerate band gap prediction, achieving up to 2.6x data efficiency compared to random sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the efficiency of photonic crystal design through machine learning, emphasizing the role of uncertainty in guiding active learning strategies.

Method: The method integrates analytic LL-BNNs with uncertainty-driven sample selection to prioritize high-uncertainty regions, reducing training data while maintaining accuracy.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms random sampling, achieving faster convergence in predicting photonic band gaps.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates the potential of machine learning in accelerating scientific workflows, offering a generalizable method for data-efficient regression in scientific domains.

Abstract: Active learning for photonic crystals explores the integration of analytic approximate Bayesian last layer neural networks (LL-BNNs) with uncertainty-driven sample selection to accelerate photonic band gap prediction. We employ an analytic LL-BNN formulation, corresponding to the infinite Monte Carlo sample limit, to obtain uncertainty estimates that are strongly correlated with the true predictive error on unlabeled candidate structures. These uncertainty scores drive an active learning strategy that prioritizes the most informative simulations during training. Applied to the task of predicting band gap sizes in two-dimensional, two-tone photonic crystals, our approach achieves up to a 2.6x reduction in required training data compared to a random sampling baseline while maintaining predictive accuracy. The efficiency gains arise from concentrating computational resources on high uncertainty regions of the design space rather than sampling uniformly. Given the substantial cost of full band structure simulations, especially in three dimensions, this data efficiency enables rapid and scalable surrogate modeling. Our results suggest that analytic LL-BNN based active learning can substantially accelerate topological optimization and inverse design workflows for photonic crystals, and more broadly, offers a general framework for data efficient regression across scientific machine learning domains.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Single-View Holographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (SHVAM) is a new method for high-fidelity 3D printing at the micro-scale by integrating optical and chemical effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind SHVAM is to overcome the challenge of achieving high fidelity at micro-scale in volumetric additive manufacturing by considering both optical diffraction and chemical effects.

Method: SHVAM uses time-multiplexed, phase-only holograms projected from a single optical axis to shape volumetric dose distributions. The method involves formulating hologram synthesis as a coupled inverse problem, integrating a differentiable wave-optical forward model with a simplified photochemical model to capture inhibitor diffusion and non-linear dose response. This allows pre-compensation for chemical blur, improving print fidelity.

Result: SHVAM enables the fabrication of simple 2D and 3D structures with lateral feature sizes of approximately 10 micrometers within a 0.8mm x 0.8mm x 3mm volume in seconds, demonstrating high print fidelity.

Conclusion: SHVAM represents a significant advancement in volumetric additive manufacturing by achieving near-instantaneous fabrication with high micro-scale fidelity through the integration of optical and chemical principles.

Abstract: Volumetric additive manufacturing promises near-instantaneous fabrication of 3D objects, yet achieving high fidelity at the micro-scale remains challenging due to the complex interplay between optical diffraction and chemical effects. We present \emph{Single-View Holographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing} (SHVAM), a mechanically static system that shapes volumetric dose distributions using time-multiplexed, phase-only holograms projected from a single optical axis. To achieve high resolution with SHVAM, we formulate hologram synthesis as a coupled inverse problem, integrating a differentiable wave-optical forward model with a simplified photochemical model that explicitly captures inhibitor diffusion and non-linear dose response. Optimizing hologram sequences under these coupled constraints allows us to pre-compensate for chemical blur, yielding higher print fidelity than optical-only optimization. We demonstrate the efficacy of SHVAM by fabricating simple 2D and 3D structures with lateral feature sizes of approximately \SI{10}{\micro\meter} within a $\SI{0.8}{\milli\meter} \times \SI{0.8}{\milli\meter} \times \SI{3}{\milli\meter}$ volume in seconds.

Abstract: Electromagnetic hyperbolicity has driven key functionalities in nanophotonics, including super-resolution imaging, efficient energy control, and extreme light manipulation. Central to these advances are hyperbolic polaritons - nanometer-scale light-matter waves - spanning multiple energy-momentum dispersion orders with distinct mode profiles and incrementally high optical momenta. In this work, we report the mode conversion of hyperbolic polaritons across different dispersion orders by breaking the structure symmetry in engineered step-shape van der Waals (vdW) terraces. The mode conversion from the fundamental to high-order hyperbolic polaritons is imaged using scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) on both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide (alpha-MoO3) vdW terraces. Our s-SNOM data, augmented with electromagnetic simulations, further demonstrate the alteration of polariton mode conversion by varying the step size of vdW terraces. The mode conversion reported here offers a practical approach toward integrating previously independent different-order hyperbolic polaritons with ultra-high momenta, paving the way for promising applications in nano-optical circuits, sensing, computation, information processing, and super-resolution imaging.

Abstract: Quantum technologies have surpassed classical systems by leveraging the unique properties of superposition and entanglement in photons and matter. Recent advancements in integrated quantum photonics, especially in silicon-based and lithium niobate platforms, are pushing the technology toward greater scalability and functionality. Silicon circuits have progressed from centimeter-scale, dual-photon systems to millimeter-scale, high-density devices that integrate thousands of components, enabling sophisticated programmable manipulation of multi-photon states. Meanwhile, lithium niobate, thanks to its wide optical transmission window, outstanding nonlinear and electro-optic coefficients, and chemical stability, has emerged as an optimal substrate for fully integrated photonic quantum chips. Devices made from this material exhibit high efficiency in in generating, manipulating, converting, storing, and detecting photon states, thereby establishing a basis for deterministic multi-photon generation and single-photon quantum interactions, as well as comprehensive frequency-state control. This review explores the development of integrated photonic quantum technologies based on both silicon and lithium niobate, highlighting invaluable insights gained from silicon-based systems that can assist the scaling of lithium niobate technologies. It examines the functional integration mechanisms of lithium niobate in electro-optic tuning and nonlinear energy conversion, showcasing its transformative impact throughout the photonic quantum computing process. Looking ahead, we speculate on the developmental pathways for lithium niobate platforms and their potential to revolutionize areas such as quantum communication, complex system simulation, quantum sampling, and optical quantum computing paradigms.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pure-quartic solitons (PQSs) supported by negative fourth-order dispersion have recently attracted considerable interest. In this work, we study both adiabatic and nonadiabatic compression of PQSs in nonlinear optical fibers with pure quartic dispersion in the presence of distributed gain and loss. Within a variational framework, we show that, for weak constant gain, the adiabatic compression dynamics can be mapped onto the motion of an effective particle in a slowly deformed potential, providing an intuitive physical picture. To overcome the long propagation distance required by conventional adiabatic condition, we exploit shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) based on inverse engineering and derive analytical gain-loss profiles, with appropriate boundary conditions that realize a prescribed fast compression over a shorter propagation distance. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions and indicate a minimum propagation distance below which noticeable waveform distortion emerges. Compared with standard adiabatic references, the STA design significantly reduces the required compression distance while maintaining high-fidelity PQS evolution.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Upconversion luminescence consists of the absorption of low-energies photons followed by the emission of a higher energy photon. The process has mainly been studied in lanthanides to upconvert monochromatic near-infrared excitation to near-infrared or visible light, and has been exploited only to a limited extent to upconvert broad excitations to ultra-violet. In addition, upconverting near-infrared and visible light to ultra-violet is crucial for applications such as solar-to-fuel conversion or environmental remediation. However, upconversion luminescence is limited by the low absorption cross-sections of lanthanides. In this work, we engineered Bloch modes in a photonic crystal to assist a multi-wavelength upconversion mechanism and demonstrated a 28-fold enhancement of ultra-violet upconversion luminescence of Yb3+-Tm3+ doped thin films. Materials were selected and optimized to design nanostructures without parasitic absorption losses. The geometric parameters of the photonic crystals were scanned to match a slow-light resonance with an excited-state transition of Tm3+ and thus enhance incident visible light absorption. Ultra-violet light extraction was also enhanced by photonic crystal Bloch modes. Each of these two contributions were quantified and the measured photonic band structures were well reproduced by electromagnetic simulations.

Motivation: 扩展高-调参数及其在实验室中的应用有助于实现紧凑型、低成本的高-能量X射线和极端紫外光源，这具有重要的科学和催化潜力。

Method: 通过时间依赖的Schrödinger方程模拟加上经典轨迹分析和Bohmian量子动力学，研究THz场对高-阶调和生成的影响。

Result: 弱THz场也能显著延长调和截止，产生显著的“鱼骨”结构，饱和度接近I_p + 8 U_p，这表明即使微弱的THz场也能有效控制调和截止。

Abstract: Extending the high-harmonic cutoff with experimentally accessible fields is essential for advancing tabletop coherent extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray sources. Although terahertz (THz) assistance offers a promising route, cutoff extension at weak, laboratory-accessible THz strengths remain poorly understood. In this report, we comprehensively investigate THz-assisted high-order harmonic generation (HHG) using time-dependent Schrödinger equation simulations supported by classical trajectory analysis and Bohmian-based quantum dynamics. By mapping the plateau evolution versus THz strength, we show that even weak THz fields can extend the cutoff, producing a pronounced ``fish-fin'' structure whose prominent rays saturate near $I_p + 8 U_p$. We trace this extension to long electron excursions spanning several optical cycles before recombination, and provide a fully consistent explanation using both classical analysis and Bohmian trajectories flow. Our findings reveal that this cutoff-extension mechanism is remarkably robust, persisting across different atomic species and remaining insensitive to variations in the driving parameters. These results demonstrate that cutoff control is achievable with laboratory-scale THz fields, offering practical guidelines for engineering coherent high-energy HHG, and providing a robust pathway for tracking ultrafast electron motion in real time.

Conclusion: CrSBr提供了一个独特的平台，为研究平坦频段的光子学和极光特性开辟了新的途径，有助于推动光子技术和量子技术的 next-generation 开发。

Abstract: Flat-band bound states in the continuum (BICs) are topological states with suppressed group velocity and robustness against radiation loss, offering a powerful platform for the exploration of non-Hermitian, nonlinear, topological phenomena and device applications. Van der Waals (vdW) metasurfaces have recently emerged as promising candidates for sustaining BICs and hybridizing with material transitions. However, the realization of flat-band BICs remains elusive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate polaritonic high-order BICs on a wide-angle flat band utilizing a subwavelength metasurface made of a vdW magnet CrSBr. The large oscillator strength of direct excitons in CrSBr enables near ultrastrong coupling with BICs, leading to strongly suppressed polaritonic angular dispersions. Remarkably, second-order polaritonic BICs become flat-band across a wide angular range, with corresponding Q factors exceeding 1500. Additionally, we find that these polaritonic BICs vanish in the transverse magnetic configuration, while leading to fascinating surface hyperbolic exciton-polaritons within the Reststrahlen band. Our findings underscore CrSBr as an exceptional platform for exploring flat-band photonics and polaritonics, paving the new avenue for advances in next-generation optical and quantum technologies.

Abstract: Accurate and fast calculations of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in metallic nanoparticles is essential for applications in sensing, nano-optics, and energy harvesting. Although full-wave numerical techniques such as the boundary element method (BEM) or the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) provide high accuracy, their computational cost often hinders rapid parametric studies. Here it is presented an ultrafast method that avoids solving large eigenproblems. Instead, only the dipolar component of the induced surface charge density \((σ_{dipolar})\) is retained through a expansion into Cartesion dipole basis, yielding a compact $3\times3$ geometric formulation that avoids full boundary-integral solves. The spectral response is obtained in a similar way, by projecting the Neumann--Poincaré surface operator onto the dipole subspace and evaluating a Rayleigh quotient, giving geometry-only eigenvalues again without an $N\times N$ eigenproblem. A major advantage of this method is that all geometry-dependent quantities are computed once per nanoparticle, while material dispersion and environmental changes enter only through simple algebraic expressions for the polarizability, enabling rapid evaluation across wavelengths. Retardation effects are incorporated through the modified long-wavelength approximation (MLWA), extending accuracy into the weakly retarded regime. The resulting framework provides a valuable tool for fast modelling and optimization of plasmonic nanoparticles at a significant lesser computational cost than BEM, DDA, and other standard tools.

Abstract: Quartz tuning fork-based atomic force microscopy (QTF-AFM) has become a powerful tool for high-resolution imaging of both conductive and insulating samples, including semiconductor structures and metal-coated surfaces as well as soft matter under ambient conditions, while also enabling measurements in more demanding environments including ultrahigh vacuum and cryogenic conditions where conventional cantilever-based AFM often encounters limitations. However, the broader adoption of QTF-AFM has been constrained by the difficulty of attaching a cantilever tip to a quartz tuning fork (QTF) with the positional and angular precision required for repeatable and reproducible probe fabrication. For stable operation, the tip must be placed precisely at the midline of a single tine, aligned parallel to the prong axis, and rigidly secured. Even slight lateral offsets or angular deviations disrupt the intrinsic antisymmetric flexural mode, induce torsional coupling, and ultimately lead to systematic image distortions and reduced measurement integrity. In this work, we present a comprehensive, semi-automated QTF-tip fabrication system that integrates precision alignment, real-time frequency-sweep monitoring, and controlled Q-factor tuning within a single workflow. Experimental characterization demonstrates consistent probe preparation across multiple trials, preservation of sharp and well-defined resonance responses with deliberately adjustable damping, and high-fidelity, high-resolution imaging in practical scanning tests. This integrated approach provides a reproducible framework to QTF-based probe fabrication, lowering the technical barrier to QTF-AFM implementation and broadening its applicability across diverse sample types and operating environments.

Abstract: Non-volatile Neuromorphic Computing (NC) elements utilizing Spin Orbit Torque (SOT) provide a viable solution to alleviate the memory wall bottleneck in contemporary computing systems. However, the two challenges, low SOT efficiency and the need for in plane symmetry breaking field for perpendicular magnetization switching, greatly limit its practical implementation. In this work, the enhanced SOT efficiency of Platinum (Pt) SOT layer and field free perpendicular magnetization switching are achieved by integrating thin Ruthenium Oxide (RuO2) layer in our material stack. The optimal RuO2 thickness (0.5 nm) enhances 5.2 times Damping Like (DL) SOT efficiency compared with pure SOT layer (Pt), as determined by hysteresis loop shift measurements, with a relatively low resistivity (90 micro-Ohm-cm). Moreover, we achieve 3 times reduction of critical magnetization switching current density compared to reference sample. Our experimental findings also demonstrate Rashba-induced substantial field-free magnetization switching in the presence of an emergent built-in interfacial field. Notably, reliable multi resistance synaptic states are achieved by tailoring the synergistic effects of enhanced SOT and interfacial magnetism. The functionality of synaptic states has been further evaluated by implementing an artificial neural network and achieved image recognition accuracies of approximately 95% and 87% on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively. This systematic study paves the way to energy-efficient, field-free SOT synapses for practical NC applications.

Abstract: Using the example of Ar, Kr, and Xe atoms, it is shown that graphene nanobubbles on flat substrates are multistable systems. A nanobubble can have many stable stationary states, each characterized by the number of layers, $l$, within the cluster of internal atoms. The layers are circular in shape, concentrically stacked on top of each other, forming an $l$-stepped pyramid with a flat top. The covering of this pyramid with a graphene sheet is achieved through its local stretching. The valence bonds of the sheet stretch only over the group of internal atoms; outside the coverage zone, the sheet remains undeformed and lies flush against the substrate. The maximum possible number of layers, $l_m$, increases monotonically with the number of atoms $N$ ($l_m=6$ for $N=4000$). The graphene sheet, interacting with the substrate, compresses the internal atom cluster against it, generating an internal pressure of $P\sim 1$ GPa. Numerical simulations of thermal vibrations reveal that among all $l$-layer configurations of a nanobubble, there is always one "ground"\ state. Upon heating, this ground state smoothly transitions into a layerless liquid state. All other stationary states transform into this ground state once a certain temperature is reached (for $N=4000$, the ground state corresponds to state with $l=4$). The coexistence of several stable states with different numbers of layers at low temperatures leads to the absence of a universal shape for the nanobubbles. In this scenario, the height-to-radius ratio, $H/R$, can vary from 0 to 0.24, depending on the number of layers.

Abstract: We derive a modified Lindblad equation for the state of quantum dot tunnel coupled to a Markovian lead when the spin state of the dot is driven by an oscillating magnetic field. We show that the equation is a completely positive, trace-preserving map and find the jump operators. This is a driven-dissipative regime in which coherent driving is relevant to the tunneling and cannot be treated as simply a rotation modifying the system with a bath derived under a static magnetic field. This work was motivated by an experimental desire to determine the Zeeman splitting of an electron spin on a quantum dot (a spin qubit), and in a related work we show that this splitting energy can be found by measuring the charge occupancy of the dot while sweeping the frequency of the driving field \ arXiv:2503.17481. Here we cover the full derivation of the equation and give the jump operators. These jump operators are potentially useful for describing the stochastic behavior of more complex systems with coherent driving of a spin capable of tunneling on or off of a device, such as in electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy. The jump operators have the interesting feature of combining jumps of electrons onto and off of the device.

Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are characterized by relatively large carrier effective masses and suppressed screening of the Coulomb interaction, which substantially enhances the correlation effects in these structures. The direct band gap allows to effectively optically probe these correlations. Here, we present an experimental observation of Wigner crystallization in monolayer $\mathrm{WSe}_2$ probed by the measurement of the exciton diffraction on the Wigner crystal (WC) periodic potential. We observe the formation of the WC phase in the absence of external magnetic fields at temperature range $T<26~\mathrm{K}$ and carrier concentrations $n$ $<2\times10^{11}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. The direct observation of the exciton diffraction is enabled by the strong exciton longitudinal-transverse splitting induced by the long-range intervalley exchange interaction, leading to the large detuning between main exciton peak and first diffraction peak. Our findings highlight that the valley degree of freedom of charge carriers in TMDs facilitates optical probing of correlated electron phases in these structures.

Abstract: We study current flow around a circular density depletion in a two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The depletion is parametrized by a power-law tail with an exponent $β> 2$. We show that current and electrochemical potential are exponentially suppressed inside a surrounding area much larger than the geometric size of the depletion region. The corresponding ``no-go'' radius grows as a certain power of the magnetic field. Residual current and potential exhibit spiraling patterns inside the no-go region. Outside of it, they acquire corrections inversely proportional to the distance, which is known as the Landauer resistivity dipole. The Landauer dipole is rotated by the angle $π(1 - 1 / β)$ with respect to the direction of the average electric field. We also consider the effect of electron viscosity and show that the variation of the no-go radius with magnetic field becomes more rapid if viscosity is large enough. In that regime the size of the Landauer dipole is set by the Gurzhi length, which is much larger than the no-go radius, which is in turn much larger than the geometric size of the depletion. Our results may be useful for interpreting nanoimaging of current distribution in graphene and other two-dimensional systems.

Motivation: Emerging applications such as photonics, quantum technologies, wireless communications, and sensing require precise control and nanoscale confinement of terahertz fields.

Method: Dipole antenna lobes simultaneously serve as gate electrodes to concentrate THz fields and launch acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs). A full wave and transport thermal simulation is used to reproduce the gate-controlled plasmon wavelength, spatial absorption profile, and nonuniform electron heating.

Result: AGPs form a Fabry-Pérot THz cavity, achieving lateral and vertical confinement factors of 165 and 4000, respectively, for frequencies from 1.83 to 2.52 THz. The device is wafer-scalable, polarization and frequency selective, and can be cooled with liquid nitrogen.

Conclusion: Graphene-based devices can host coherent AGP resonances and show efficient polaritonic enhanced photoresponse under specific conditions, enabling scalable THz detection platforms.

Abstract: Precise control and nanoscale confinement of terahertz (THz) fields are essential requirements for emerging applications in photonics, quantum technologies, wireless communications, and sensing. Here, we demonstrate a polaritonic cavity enhanced THz photoresponse in an antenna coupled device based on chemical vapor deposited (CVD) monolayer graphene. The dipole antenna lobes simultaneously serve as two gate electrodes, concentrate the impinging THz field, and efficiently launch acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs), which drive a strong photo-thermoelectric (PTE) signal. Between 6 and 90 K, the photovoltage exhibits pronounced peaks, modulating the PTE response by up to 40\%, that we attribute to AGPs forming a Fabry Pérot THz cavity in the full or half graphene channel. Combined full wave and transport thermal simulations accurately reproduce the gate controlled plasmon wavelength, spatial absorption profile, and the resulting nonuniform electron heating responsible for the PTE response. The lateral and vertical maximum confinement factors of the AGP wavelength relative to the incident wavelength are 165 and 4000, respectively, for frequencies from 1.83 to 2.52 THz. These results demonstrate that wafer scalable CVD graphene, without hBN encapsulation, can host coherent AGP resonances and exhibit an efficient polaritonic enhanced photoresponse under appropriate gating, antenna coupling, and AGP cavity design, opening a route to scalable, polarization and frequency selective, liquid nitrogen cooled, and low power consumption THz detection platforms based on plasmon thermoelectric transduction.

Abstract: Energy and charge transfer between molecules and metal surfaces underpin heterogeneous catalysis, surface-enhanced spectroscopies and plasmon-driven chemistry, yet the microscopic origins of vibrational excitation at metal interfaces remain unresolved. Here we use temperature-dependent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to directly distinguish plasmon-vibration optomechanical coupling from hot-electron-driven excitation.By probing thionine adsorbed on gold nanostructures at 295 K and 3.5 K, we show that pronounced anti-Stokes scattering at cryogenic temperature arises from optical pumping of vibrational populations, whereas room-temperature spectra are governed by thermal population. Bromide co-adsorbates play a decisive role by guiding molecular alignment, inducing surface atom displacements, and enabling transient adsorption geometries that activate otherwise Raman-inactive vibrational modes. In the absence of bromide, distinct excitation pathways emerge, reflecting competition between optomechanical coupling and charge-transfer processes associated with molecular polarization along the optical field or orientation relative to the metal surface. These results establish molecular optomechanics as a sensitive probe of surface-molecule interactions and demonstrate how anion-mediated surface dynamics regulate energy flow at plasmonic interfaces.

Abstract: Quantum technologies aim to assemble devices whose operation is controlled by the quantum state of individual atoms. Achieving this level of control in a practical, scalable design remains, however, a major obstacle to mass societal adoption. By working at the level of interatomic bonding, molecular engineering has enabled exquisite control over the electronic properties of individual atoms and their interactions with neighboring atoms. This positions molecular electronics as a potentially disruptive quantum technology, but serious technological challenges have prevented it from being included in technical road maps. The main obstacle is that conventional, mass scalable nanodevice technologies utilize resists and solvents that can degrade molecules. Some approaches involve exposing junction interfaces to contaminants (e.g. air, resist etc...), which can be particularly problematic for spintronics. In this technical paper, we present our decade-long work into building a nanotechnological chain that can process entire metal/molecule heterostructures into vertical nanopillars electronic devices. We discuss the advantages and pitfalls of the various iterations of this process that were implemented. We also discuss outlooks for this unique technology.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions and related topological spin textures have emerged as a central topic in condensed-matter physics, combining fundamental significance with potential for transformative applications in spintronics, magnonics, and beyond. Over the past decade, advances in material platforms, imaging techniques, theoretical modeling, and device concepts have established skyrmionics as a rapidly expanding field. At the same time, challenges remain in stabilizing, controlling, and integrating such textures into functional architectures, while novel phenomena such as antiskyrmions, higher-order skyrmions, hopfions, and antiferromagnetic textures arise. The 2026 Skyrmionics Roadmap represents a collective effort of many authors, providing a comprehensive perspective on the current state-of-the-art and the outlook for the coming years. In 33 focused sections, each co-authored by two researchers, we chart progress in theory and modeling, material systems, skyrmion dynamics, and skyrmion technologies. By offering a consolidated vision, this Roadmap aims to guide both fundamental research and application-driven efforts, accelerating the transition of skyrmionics from conceptual breakthroughs toward practical technologies.

Abstract: Exploiting current-induced spin-orbit torques (SOTs) to manipulate the magnetic state of dipolar-coupled nanomagnet systems with in-plane magnetic anisotropy, such as artificial spin ices, provides a route to local, electrically-programmable control of the magnetization, with relevance for applications including neuromorphic computing. Here, we demonstrate how the orientation of a nanomagnet relative to the direction of an applied electrical current impacts the threshold current density needed for all-electrical magnetization switching, and how dipolar coupling between the nanomagnets influences the switching of interacting pairs and ensembles of nanomagnets. Using a material system designed to generate SOTs in response to electrical currents, we find that the current required to switch the magnetization of isolated nanomagnets varies non-monotonically as the angle between the nanomagnet long axis and the current increases. In small artificial spin ice systems, we observe similar angular dependence of the switching current, which can be used to control the magnetization orientation of specific subsets of nanomagnets. These experimental results are supported by micromagnetic modeling, which illustrates how the various current induced torques can be exploited to control magnetization switching in nanomagnetic systems. These results establish SOT switching as a practical method for programmable manipulation of dipolar nanomagnetic systems.

Conclusion: 范德华晶体中孤立平坦带的性质及其在光致发射中的应用得到了详细研究。这些发现提供了新的研究方向，并且完善了范德华晶体的表征手段。

Abstract: Dispersionless electronic bands lead to an extremely high density of states and suppressed kinetic energy, thereby increasing electronic correlations and instabilities that can shape emergent ordered states, such as excitonic, ferromagnetic, and superconducting phases. A flat band that extends over the entire momentum space and is well isolated from other dispersive bands is, therefore, particularly interesting. Here, the band structure of the van der Waals crystal NbOCl$_2$ is revealed by utilizing photoelectron momentum microscopy. We directly map out an electronic band that is flat throughout the entire Brillouin zone and features a width of only $\sim$100 meV. This band is well isolated from both the conduction and remote valence bands. Moreover, the quasiparticle band gap shows a high tunability upon the deposition of caesium atoms on the surface. By combining the single-particle band structure with the optical transmission spectrum, the optical gap is identified. The fully isolated flat band in a van der Waals crystal provides a qualitatively new testbed for exploring flat-band physics.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles study of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) for a wide range of twist angles, with a focus on structural and electronic properties. By employing density functional theory (DFT) with an optimized local basis set, we simulate tBLG, obtaining fully relaxed commensurate structures for twist angles down to 0.987°. For all angles the lattice relaxation agrees well with continuum elastic models. For angles accessible to plane-wave DFT (VASP), we provide a detailed comparison with our local basis DFT (SIESTA) calculations, demonstrating excellent agreement in both the atomic and electronic structure. The dependence of the Fermi velocity and band width on the twist angle shows qualitative agreement with results from an `exact' $\mathbf{k \cdot p}$ continuum model, but reveals a small twist angle offset. Additionally, we provide details of the low-energy wavefunction character, band inversion and symmetries. Our results provide an ab initio reference point for the microscopic structure and electronic properties of tBLG which will serve as the foundation for future studies incorporating many-body effects.

Abstract: Magnetotactic bacteria synthesize linear chains of magnetite nanoparticles within their bodies, which allow the bacteria to navigate the Earth's magnetic field in search of the best habitat. Biogenic magnetite particles, called magnetosomes, are very promising for use in biomedicine. Magnetosome chains have also been found in ancient fossils and sediments. The study of magnetofossils provides valuable information about the Earth's biological past. The presence of biogenic magnetite in ancient rock samples can be detected by measuring ferromagnetic resonance spectra, first-order magnetization reversal curves, or quasi-static hysteresis loops. Theoretical analyses of these experiments generally assume that magnetosomes are spherical nanoparticles, although the shape of some types of magnetosomes is close to spheroidal one. In this work, simple formulas for describing the magneto-dipole interaction of oriented spheroids are obtained and quasi-static hysteresis loops of randomly oriented magnetosome chain assembly consisting of elongated spheroids are calculated.

TL;DR: Hybrid band systems with coexisting hole bands significantly impact magnetotransport, leading to enhanced resistivity and Hall effects when considering particle-particle collisions in high temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding electron interactions in hybrid band systems is essential for advancing knowledge of magnetotransport properties.

Method: Theoretically analyzed with a frictional mechanism model and experimentally validated in a 6.3 nm HgTe quantum well.

Result: Experimentally observed contributions to magnetoresistivity and Hall effect align with theoretical predictions involving different band dispersions.

Conclusion: Hybrid band electrons with both linear and parabolic bands exhibit distinct transport characteristics in high temperatures due to collisions between particles with varying dispersions.

Abstract: While electron-electron (e-e) interactions are known to influence resistivity in non-Galilean invariant two-dimensional (2D) systems, their effect on magnetotransport is not fully understood. Conventional models for simple bands often predict a vanishing magnetoresistivity from e-e interactions alone. In this work, we investigate magnetotransport in a gapless 6.3 nm HgTe quantum well, a hybrid 2D band system that hosts coexisting holes with both linear (Dirac-like) and parabolic energy bands. Focusing on the high temperature regime where particle-particle collisions dominate scattering, we observe significant corrections to both the magnetoresistivity and the Hall effect. The high temperature transport coefficients are in good agreement with the theoretical model describing transport in massive-massless fermion mixtures governed by a frictional mechanism and intervalley scattering. Our findings provide strong experimental validation for this theoretical framework, demonstrating that collisions between particles with different dispersions are a key mechanism governing magnetotransport in hybrid band semimetals.

Abstract: Radiofrequency (RF) systems play a critical role in particle accelerators by enabling the acceleration, manipulation, and diagnosis of charged particle beams. At the heart of many of these systems lies the RF cavity, whose effective design requires close collaboration among RF designers, beam physicists, and mechanical engineers. This chapter presents the fundamental principles of RF systems, with particular emphasis on RF cavities, and underscores the interdisciplinary effort involved in their development. The SwissFEL X-ray free-electron laser at the Paul Scherrer Institut serves as a key example to illustrate these concepts.

### [31] [Fractals in rate-induced tipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16373)
*Jason Qianchuan Wang,Yi Zheng,Eduardo G. Altmann*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: 参数变化足够快时，即使没有分歧也可能发生临界转变，这被称为率诱导式转变。这种现象在动力系统理论中是已知的，常见于从简单的差分方程到复杂的气候科学和生态系统模型。尽管大多数例子都显示出在临界变化率处发生转变，但这里发现当自治系统的相空间中存在非吸引的分形集合时，这个简单的图景会改变，这些分形会引发参数空间中分形的转变控制条件，以及如何由分形集合和其参数空间中的分形转变控制条件如何产生和相互关联。通过三个典型的一维分段线性映射、二维henon映射和受迫摆系统，我们说明了这种分形产生的机制以及分形集合的分形维数之间的关系。

Abstract: When parameters of a dynamical system change sufficiently fast, critical transitions can take place even in the absence of bifurcations. This phenomenon is known as rate-induced tipping and has been reported in a variety of systems, from simple ordinary differential equations and maps to mathematical models in climate sciences and ecology. In most examples, the transition happens at a critical rate of parameter change, a rate-induced tipping point, and is associated with a simple unstable orbit (edge state). In this work, we show how this simple picture changes when non-attracting fractal sets exist in the autonomous system, a ubiquitous situation in non-linear dynamics. We show that these fractals in phase space induce fractals in parameter space, which control the rates and parameter changes that result in tipping. We explain how such rate-induced fractals appear and how the fractal dimensions of the different sets are related to each other. We illustrate our general theory in three paradigmatic systems: a piecewise linear one-dimensional map, the two-dimensional Hénon map, and a forced pendulum.

### [32] [Magnetic structure of EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ single-crystal thin-film](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16365)
*Yu Wei Soh,Hsiang Lee,Eugen Weschke,Shinichi Nishihaya,Mikhael T. Sayat,Masaki Uchida,Jian-Rui Soh*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper discusses EuZn2Sb2 as a magnetic topological material, presenting first-principles calculations and experiments showing that its electronic structure depends on the magnetic order of europium: A-type AFM gives a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal, while FM order yields a Weyl semimetal. Neutron diffraction reveals AFM and FM orders separated along the crystal c-axis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the magnetic and topological properties of EuZn2Sb2 is important for understanding how magnetic order influences electronic band structures, with potential applications in quantum materials.

Method: Used ab-initio calculations and neutron diffraction measurements to study the magnetic and electronic properties of EuZn2Sb2, linking magnetic order to topology.

Result: The paper conclusively identifies the relationship between magnetic order (A-type AFM and FM) and the resulting electronic states (topological crystalline insulator, Dirac semimetal, Weyl semimetal). It also demonstrates spatial separation of AFM and FM orders along the crystal c-axis.

Conclusion: EuZn2Sb2 exhibits a rich magnetic topological phase diagram, with distinct electronic states arising from magnetic ordering in different layers along the crystal axis. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of how magnetic order controls electronic topology in this material.

Abstract: Magnetic topological materials are a class of compounds which can host massless electrons controlled by the magnetic order. One such compound is EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$, which has recently garnered interest due to its strong interplay between the Eu magnetism and charge carriers. However the topology of the electronic band structure, which depends on the ground state magnetic configuration of the europium sublattice, has not been determined. Based on our \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we find that an in-plane and out-of-plane \textit{A}-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order generates a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal respectively, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM) order stabilizes a Weyl semimetal. Our resonant x-ray elastic scattering measurements of single-crystal thin film EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ reveal both a sharp magnetic peak at $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,\frac{1}{2})$ and broad $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,1)$ below $T_{\mathrm{N}}=12.9$\,K, which is associated with an \textit{A}-type AFM and FM order, respectively. Our measurements indicate that the FM and AFM layers are spatially separated along the crystal $c$ axis, with the former limited to the top three atomic layers. We propose that EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ behaves as a Weyl semimetal in the surface FM layers, and as a topological crystalline insulator in the lower AFM layers.

Abstract: We present an efficient implementation of ab initio many-body quantum embedding and local correlation methods for infinite periodic systems through translational symmetry adapted interpolative separable density fitting, an approach which reduces the scaling of the calculations to only linear with the number of k-points. Employing this methodology, we compute correlated ground-state coupled cluster energies within density matrix embedding and local natural orbital correlation frameworks for both weakly and strongly correlated solids, using up to 1000 k-points. By extrapolating the local correlation domains and k-point sampling we further obtain estimates of the full coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples ground-state energies in the thermodynamic limit.

TL;DR: Kondo coupling stabilizes magnetic order in the spin-(1/2,1) Kondo necklace model when spin-1 or higher moments couple, but not when spin-1/2 moments couple.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Kondo effect's usual role in suppressing magnetism is contradicted by recent findings suggesting it can enhance magnetic order under specific conditions.

Method: A Ni-based complex system realizes a spin-only Kondo necklace model, isolating quantum spin correlations by eliminating charge degrees of freedom.

Result: Thermodynamic measurements identify a magnetic phase transition and a field-induced quantum phase transition. Perturbative analysis shows that Kondo coupling mediates effective antiferromagnetic interactions between spin-1 sites, stabilizing Néel order across the entire chain. The study establishes a universal boundary in Kondo physics, where coupling to spin-1/2 yields singlets, but coupling to spin-1 and higher stabilizes magnetic order.

Conclusion: Kondo systems with spin-1/2 give rise to singlets, while spin-1 or higher spins enable stable magnetic order through effective antiferromagnetic coupling.

Abstract: The interplay between Kondo screening and magnetic order has long been a central issue in the physics of strongly correlated systems. While the Kondo effect has traditionally been understood to suppress magnetism through the formation of local singlets, recent studies suggest that Kondo interactions may enhance magnetic order under certain conditions. However, these scenarios often rely on complex electronic structures, including orbital and charge degrees of freedom, making the essential mechanisms difficult to isolate. Here we report the realization of a spin-(1/2,1) Kondo necklace model in a Ni-based complex-a minimal spin-only analog of the Kondo lattice that isolates quantum spin correlations by eliminating charge degrees of freedom. Thermodynamic measurements identify a magnetic phase transition and a field-induced quantum phase transition. Perturbative analysis reveals that the Kondo coupling mediates effective antiferromagnetic interactions between the spin-1 sites, stabilizing the Néel order across the entire chain. Our results establish a universal boundary in Kondo physics, where coupling to spin-1/2 moments yields singlets, but to spin-1 and higher stabilizes magnetic order.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring geometrically frustrated quantum spin systems and their potential for emerging quantum phases.

Method: Synthesis of a verdazyl-based complex (m- Py-V)_3[Ni(NO3)_2], molecular orbital calculations, magnetic measurements, and ESR analysis.

Result: Strong AF interactions between radical pairs form spin-1/2 singlet dimers; frustrated triangular units with spin-1 moments; phase transition to AF order suppressed by magnetic fields; field-induced decoupling and easy-axis anisotropy identified through ESR.

Conclusion: This work presents a rare example of a geometrically frustrated quantum spin chain with potential applications for studying frustration-induced quantum phases in low-dimensional materials.

Abstract: We successfully synthesized a verdazyl-based complex, ($m$-Py-V)$_3$[Ni(NO$_3$)$_2$], in which Ni$^{2+}$ ions and verdazyl radicals form a one-dimensional, triangular spin necklace consisting of spin-1/2 and spin-1 units. Molecular orbital calculations reveal strong antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions between inversion-related radical pairs that form spin-1/2 singlet dimers. The remaining verdazyl and Ni$^{2+}$ spins form frustrated triangular units, creating a distinctive spin network. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements identify a phase transition to an AF order. The application of magnetic fields suppresses the phase transition signal, suggesting field-induced decoupling of the spin-1 moments. Electron spin resonance measurements are used to evaluate the easy-axis anisotropy of spin-1, which may promote the AF order. This work provides a rare example of a geometrically frustrated quantum spin chain realized via molecular design, thereby offering a platform for exploring frustration-driven quantum phases in low-dimensional materials.

Result: 初始化方法可以显著减少DMFT迭代次数，尤其是g-RISB在大多数情况下效果最佳。

Conclusion: 增加DMFT计算的效率，特别是通过g-RISB实现，这是一种有效的策略，尤其是在莫伊特绝缘体到金属相变中，通过非互作用极限的初始化可以解决DMFT的符号问题。

Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is a cornerstone technique for studying strongly correlated electronic systems. However, each DMFT step is computationally demanding, and many iterations can be required to achieve convergence. Here, we accelerate the convergence of DMFT by initializing its self-consistent cycle with solutions from computationally cheaper and more approximate methods. We compare the initialization with the non-interacting solution to a range of quantum embedding compatible approaches: Hartree-Fock, the Hubbard-I approximation, rotationally invariant slave bosons (RISB), and its ghost extension (g-RISB). We find that these initializations can reduce the number of DMFT iterations by up to an order of magnitude, with g-RISB providing the most effective and reliable benefits. In most regimes, initializing with g-RISB and performing a single DMFT iteration suffices to recover the full dynamical structure. The improvement in convergence is controlled by the initial solution's accuracy in the low-energy part of the self-energy, on the scale of the non-interacting bandwidth. This strategy is especially effective at the Mott insulator-metal transition, where an initialization from the non-interacting limit can lead to a breakdown of DMFT due to the sign problem. Our results establish the usage of accurate yet cheaper quantum embedding methods as a powerful means to substantially reduce the computational cost of DMFT, particularly in regimes where convergence is slow or prone to failure.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了电子自旋对在整数量子霍尔效应阶段导电性的影响。

Abstract: We numerically investigate the effect of electron correlation on the integer quantum Hall effect in a square lattice. Increasing the correlation strength via the effective onsite repulsion parameter $U$ degrades the quantization of $ν= 1$ transverse conductance due to the interplay of correlation and the external magnetic field, which together induce periodic modulations in renormalized hopping parameters and site energies. Overall, this work demonstrates that the strength of electron correlation can significantly impact conductivity in the integer quantum Hall regime.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the origin of pairing potential and pseudogap in magic-angle graphene using Spin-valley Anderson impurities (SVAIM) with anti-Hund's splitting. It derives and analytically solves low-energy Kondo theories for SVAIM at half-filling, focusing on two anti-Hund's regimes: a valley doublet and a trivial singlet. In the doublet regime, a novel pair Kondo scattering λ_x is identified, which drives a phase transition. The paper also presents a Fermi liquid solution in the pair-Kondo resonance and identifies a second-order phase transition between Kondo Fermi liquid and a local singlet phase in the singlet regime.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the origin of pairing potential and pseudogap in magic-angle graphene is a key topic in condensed matter physics. This paper provides a theoretical explanation using SVAIM with anti-Hund's splitting, which is a novel approach.

Method: The authors derive low-energy Kondo theories for SVAIM at half-filling and analyze two anti-Hund's regimes. They use renormalization group (RG) calculations based on the Coulomb gas analog to study the phase transition driven by λ_x. They present a Fermi liquid solution via bosonization-refermionization along a solvable fixed line, mapping many-body interaction λ_x into a pseudo-fermion bilinear. They also apply RG analysis to the singlet regime and identify a phase transition.

Result: The paper reveals that anti-Hund's splitting leads to pairing potential and pseudogap in magic-angle graphene. It identifies a novel pair Kondo scattering λ_x in the doublet regime, which drives a phase transition. The Fermi liquid solution in the pair-Kondo resonance provides a complete characterization of the phases. A second-order phase transition between Kondo Fermi liquid and local singlet phase is identified in the singlet regime.

Conclusion: The paper offers a comprehensive theoretical framework using SVAIM and anti-Hund's splitting to explain the pairing potential and pseudogap in magic-angle graphene. The results suggest that the interplay between spin and valley degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding the electronic properties of this material.

Abstract: Spin-valley Anderson impurities (SVAIM) with (anti-)Hund's splitting provide a natural explanation to the origin of pairing potential and pseudogap in the magic-angle graphene. In this work, we derive and analytically solve the low-energy Kondo theories for SVAIM at half-filling, with especial focus on the two anti-Hund's regimes: the impurity is either dominated by a valley doublet, or a trivial singlet. In the doublet regime, we reveal that a novel pair Kondo scattering $λ_x$ is required to flip the valley doublet, which involves a quartic operator of bath electrons. Our renormalization group (RG) calculation based on the Coulomb gas analog shows $λ_x$ drives a phase transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. One side of the transition is an anisotropic doublet phase, characterized by non-universal phase shifts of bath electrons and non-analytic impurity susceptibilities, while the other is a Fermi liquid formed by pair-Kondo resonance. The finite-size many-body spectrum, thermodynamic quantities, and correlation functions for both phases are analytically solved. Remarkably, the solution in the pair-Kondo Fermi liquid is achieved via the constructive approach of bosonization-refermionization along a solvable fixed line, where the many-body interaction $λ_x$ is mapped into a pseudo-fermion bilinear in a rigorous manner. Finally, we also apply the RG analysis to the singlet regime, and identify a second-order phase transition between the Kondo Fermi liquid and a local singlet phase.

Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity under strong Zeeman fields--particularly beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit--remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. The exotic Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, in particular, remains in need of definitive study within fundamental electronic models. Here we employ state-of-the-art finite-temperature and ground-state tensor network approaches to systematically explore the superconducting (SC) phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model subjected to Zeeman fields. We find that zero-momentum $d$-wave superconductivity persists until the spin gap closes, coexisting with charge density waves. A novel $d$-wave FFLO phase emerges under a higher Zeeman field even above the Pauli limit, concomitant with a field-enhanced spin density waves. We identify these phases, characterized by the simultaneous presence of pairing condensate and density wave orders, as charge-2e supersolids. Analysis of Matsubara Green's function reveals that the FFLO pairing momentum is locked to the underlying Fermi surface. Our results provide microscopic insights into field-induced unconventional pairing mechanisms and reveal the long-sought FFLO state in a fundamental correlated electron model, offering a promising route for its realization in ultracold atom optical lattice.

Abstract: We define unconventional non-collinear magnetic ground states on the maple leaf lattice (MLL) distinguished by the selective breaking or preservation of time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and parity ($\mathcal{P}$). Depending on the nature of $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-breaking, linear spin-wave theory reveals momentum-dependent non-relativistic magnon spin splitting at different high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. From a mean-field analysis of the Hubbard model at weak coupling, we reveal itinerant $\mathcal{P}$-preserving $q=0$ altermagnetic (A$l$M)-type order, while we expect $\mathcal{P}$-broken canted-$120^\circ$ A$l$M-type order at strong coupling. Our findings establish the MLL as a prime platform for exploring phase transitions and frustration phenomena emanating from competing non-collinear A$l$M-type orders.

Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states host fractionally charged anyons with exotic exchange statistics. Of particular interest are FQH phases supporting non-Abelian anyons, which can encode topologically protected quantum information. In this work, we construct quasihole bases for a broad family of non-Abelian FQH states using parton wave functions, which reproduces the fusion-space dimensionality expected from their underlying conformal field theory, consistent with level-rank duality across the parton family. As an application, we numerically compute braiding matrices for representative parton states for large systems, providing a general framework for diagnosing non-Abelian characteristics in candidate FQH states.

TL;DR: The paper presents evidence for fractionalized excitations in α-RuCl₃ under a magnetic field. The analysis involves neutron spectroscopic maps showing a disordered phase with field-induced changes in the spin excitation spectrum. The results suggest that the spin liquid behavior persists at high fields, with broad and flat excitation modes that cannot be explained by a magnon-decay picture but align with a fractionalized excitation scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper contributes to our understanding of quantum spin liquids and magnetic ordering in α-RuCl₃, a material of interest in condensed matter physics. The demonstration of fractionalized excitations is a significant step towards understanding complex magnetic states and their potential applications.

Method: Inelastic neutron scattering experiments were conducted in various magnetic fields, along different high-symmetry directions, to map the spin excitation spectrum. Data analysis involved detailed studies of the field dependence and momentum-space characteristics of the excitations.

Result: At high magnetic fields (~8-13.5 T), the spin excitation spectrum is gapped and becomes increasingly sharp with field. However, even at very high fields (~13.5 T), the excitations remain broad. In-plane excitations persist up to ~10 T, showing enhanced two-dimensional behavior. Out-of-plane excitations diminish in the 7-10 T regime, with broad and flat spectra that contradict a magnon-decay interpretation.

Conclusion: The data strongly support the existence of fractionalized excitations in α-RuCl₃ under a magnetic field. These excitations are associated with a spin liquid-like state, with the field-dependent broadening and kinematics pointing to a continuum of fractionalized particles, possibly including bound states, which account for the observed spectral features.

Abstract: We present comprehensive inelastic neutron spectroscopic maps of the magnetic field-induced disordered phase of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate material $α$-RuCl$_3$. For fields along both in-plane high-symmetry directions we observe that the spin excitation spectrum at and above a magnetic field of 8~T is gapped. Excitation modes then sharpen for increasing field but are consistently broader than experimental resolution even at 13.5~T. The out-of-plane dispersion diminishes in the 7-10~T regime, signifying enhanced two-dimensional behavior as the in-plane liquid correlations are established. In this regime, excitations are very broad and largely flat for all accessible energy-momenta, which is kinematically at odds with a magnon-decay picture. By contrast, a continuum of fractionalized excitations naturally yields a broad continuum response, which crucially may be accompanied by sharper modes of bound states of fractionalized excitations. Their damping by the continuum accounts for the observed spectral broadening and field dependence. Our results provide strong evidence for the existence of fractionalized excitations in $α$-RuCl$_3$ in a magnetic field.

Abstract: We present results for the phase diagram of the parent compound LaCrAsO under electron doping using the matrix random-phase approximation. At low doping levels, the system stabilizes an antiferromagnetic state in which different Cr sublattices carry opposite spins, consistent with experimental observations. As the doping concentration increases, a stripe-type antiferromagnetic phase becomes favored. At even higher doping, the system repeats the two former magnetic states, but with incommensurate magnetic ordering vectors. The commensurate magnetic phases are associated with more localized electrons in the Cr $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital, whereas the incommensurate phases are linked to the $d_{xy}$ orbital, whose stronger overlap favors itinerant-electron magnetism.

Abstract: We investigate the boundary critical phenomena of the one-dimensional quantum Ashkin-Teller model using boundary conformal field theory and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. Based on the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold of the $c=1$ compactified boson boundary conformal field theory, we construct microscopic lattice boundary terms that renormalize to the stable conformal boundary conditions,, utilizing simple current extensions and the underlying $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry to explicitly characterize the four-state Potts point. We validate these theoretical identifications via finite-size spectroscopy of the lattice energy spectra, confirming their consistency with $D_4$ symmetry and Kramers-Wannier duality. Finally, we discuss the boundary renormalization group flows among these identified fixed points to propose a global phase diagram for the boundary criticality.

Method: 在GaAs/AlGaAs微腔中制备极化子混合物，通过角分辨光致发光技术观察极化子的相对浓度变化，在不同温度条件下测量极化子的光致发光强度和宽度。利用 taylor 展开或其他数学工具对实验数据进行处理，确定极化子的相对浓度随温度的变化关系。

Result: 当极化子数量相当时，温度条件下下极化子和上极化子之间会互相替代。低温时下极化子主导，高温时上极化子主导，出现了下极化子极化子凝集的不稳定性现象。这表明极化子之间存在激烈竞争。

Conclusion: 在相同极化子数量的混合物中，通过温度调控可实现极化子间的转换。低温时下极化子主导，高温时上极化子主导，中间温度下极化子的动态不稳定状态较易观察。这些发现为极化子基元行为和微腔光子ics设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We report temperature-dependent switching between lower and upper polariton condensation in a GaAs/AlGaAs microcavity when both of these species have comparable populations in a mixture. Using angle-resolved photoluminescence, we observe that at low temperatures, condensation occurs in the lower polariton branch, while at elevated temperatures, the upper polariton branch can become favored. At an intermediate temperature, we observe instability in the condensate formation, characterized by metastable correlations of the fluctuations in intensity and linewidth of the lower and upper polariton branches.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate ground-state properties and collective excitations of one-dimensional quantum droplets in asymmetric Bose-Bose mixtures with unequal intraspin interactions. Using the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation supported by variational and sum-rule methods, we show that the intraspin interaction ratio substantially alters the droplet's density profile, driving a transition from Gaussian-like to flat-top shapes. By examining two experimentally relevant parameter regions, we analyze density profiles, radii, peak densities, and excitation spectra to distinguish quantum phases and to depict phase diagrams in the space of asymmetric interaction ratio and total atom number. We carefully study the frequencies of both well-known dipole and breathing modes and less-explored spin dipole and spin breathing modes. The breathing mode frequency decreases monotonically with interaction ratio, approaching asymptotically the result of a conventional weakly interacting Bose gas. It varies non-monotonically with total atom number, peaking at a critical point that highlights the crucial role of quantum fluctuations. In contrast, spin modes display distinct temporal spin density distributions and reveal in-phase and out-of-phase relative dynamics between components. Their frequencies depend instead monotonically on the interaction ratio and atom number. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of asymmetric quantum droplets and link to experimentally accessible regimes in ultracold $^{39}$K atomic gases.

Abstract: Heat generation and temperature reading at the nanoscale have attracted increasing attention due to their direct relevance in thermal therapeutic approaches. Consequently, huge progress has been made toward the design of dual-function nanoplatforms that integrate heating and thermometry capabilities at the nanoscale. However, in most cases, dual nanoheater nanothermometer platforms rely either on specifically engineered materials or on complex readout schemes, which limits translational potential due to complex implementation procedures. To overcome these challenges, we present a methodology for directly extracting temperature information based on dynamical magnetization measurements of cobalt ferrite magnetic nanoflowers. We demonstrate that these nanocrystals monitor temperature changes through variations in their magnetization cycles measured under alternating magnetic fields. Importantly, this thermometric functionality is preserved after surface functionalization and under chemical variations in the nanoparticle environment. Interestingly, we show that we can simultaneously generate heat and report temperature changes within the same agent. This is thanks to the photothermal conversion of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles subjected to near infrared irradiation and the tight reported relationship between magnetization dynamics and Brownian relaxation. Together, these results establish cobalt ferrite magnetic nanoparticles as a label-free platform for simultaneous heat generation and intrinsic temperature readout, enabling real-time nanoscale thermal control.

Abstract: Does gravity care about electric charge? Precision tests of the weak equivalence principle achieve remarkable sensitivity but deliberately minimize electric charge on test masses, leaving this fundamental question experimentally open. We present a minimalist framework coupling electromagnetism to linearized gravity through conservation of a complex charge-mass current, predicting charge-dependent violations $Δa/g = κ(q/m)$. Remarkably, this prediction occupies unexplored experimental territory precisely because precision gravity tests avoid charge variation. We identify this as a significant gap and propose a modified torsion balance experiment where $q/m$ is treated as a controlled variable. Such an experiment could test whether gravitational acceleration depends on electric charge, probing physics in genuinely new parameter space. This work exemplifies how theoretical minimalism can reveal overlooked opportunities in fundamental physics.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate neutron stars (NSs) in the strong field regime within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, considering three representative models: linear, logarithmic, and exponential. While Bayesian studies of NS observations are well established in General Relativity and curvature based modified gravity theories, such analyses in $f(Q)$ gravity remain largely unexplored. We perform a Bayesian inference analysis by confronting theoretical NS mass-radius predictions with NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0437+4715, and PSR J0614+3329. The dense matter equation of state is fixed to DDME2 in order to isolate the effects of modified gravity on NS structure. Our results show that the exponential $f(Q)$ model is statistically preferred over the linear and logarithmic cases, as confirmed by Bayes factor comparisons, and exhibits well-constrained. For this model, we obtain a radius and tidal deformability at $1.4\,M_\odot$ of $R_{1.4} = 11.27^{+0.53}_{-0.36}\,\mathrm{km}$ and $Λ_{1.4} = 156.95^{+84.02}_{-41.73}$, respectively, consistent with current observational constraints. These results highlight the potential of NSs as powerful probes of symmetric teleparallel gravity in the strong field regime.

### [50] [Static hairy black hole in 4D General Relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16254)
*Marco Astorino*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a new four-dimensional black hole solution in general relativity by adding a new parameter (gravitational 'hair'), transitioning the metric from Petrov type D to type I. This hair allows the black hole to exist in a non-asymptotically flat spacetime, violating the no-hair theorem. The paper discusses the geometry's deformation, its thermodynamic properties, including reduced area and altered entropy, and the effects of this 'hair' on spacetime singularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The no-hair theorem in general relativity states that black holes are fully described by only a few parameters. Violating this theorem could open new avenues for understanding black hole physics and quantum gravity.

Method: The authors generalized the Schwarzschild metric by introducing a new constant to account for the 'hair.' They studied the resulting spacetime's properties, such as curvature and singularities, to analyze its impact on black hole behavior.

Result: The new solution demonstrates that black holes can possess additional properties beyond the standard parameters, challenging the no-hair theorem. The 'hair' introduces hyperbolic features compared to Witten's bubble of nothing, with no exterior singularities. The study shows that the black hole's geometry deforms, affecting its area and thermodynamic properties like entropy.

Conclusion: This paper contributes to the understanding of black hole uniqueness in general relativity and challenges existing theories by introducing new parameters. The results suggest that black holes might have more complex structures than previously thought, requiring reevaluations of current models.

Abstract: In four-dimensional vacuum general relativity the only known static, exact and analytical black hole solution is given by the Schwarzschild spacetime. In this paper this renowned metric is generalised by adding another integrating constant, a hair that switches the metric from the Petrov type D to the type I. This new parameter represents the intensity of an external gravitational field, which can be considered the hyperbolic generalisation of the Witten's bubble of nothing. No curvature or conical singularities are present outside the event horizon. The no hair arguments are circumvented because the metric is not asymptotically flat, and neither the black hole is spherical. The gravitational hair continuously deforms the Schwarzschild geometry: the horizon becomes oblate, while its area is reduced. Conserved charges and thermodynamic properties of the black hole are studied.

Abstract: In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of null geodesics, critical photon orbits, and shadow formation associated with a wormhole generated by a geometric defect. The propagation of light in this spacetime is examined through the deflection angle in both weak- and strong-field regimes. Analytical expansions are derived in each regime and employed to characterize gravitational lensing observables. By varying the global monopole charge, we evaluate its impact on these observables and determine parameter ranges that may be accessible to current or future observational probes. Finally, we calculate the quasinormal modes as well as the time-domain solution for scalar perturbations as well.

### [52] [Thick Lunar Crust Amplifies Gravitational-Wave Signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16567)
*Lei Zhang,Han Yan,Xian Chen,Jinhai Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that the Moon can act as a resonant gravitational wave detector for waves in the 1e-3 to 0.1 Hz range by creating the first high-resolution, structurally realistic model of the lunar response through a combination of spectral-element simulations and normal-mode perturbation theory. The model reveals that the Moon's surface topography and interior structure significantly enhance the detection of such GWs, with amplification factors up to tenfold in certain regions. The findings provide a quantitative guide for selecting optimal landing sites for lunar gravitational wave detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational waves (GWs) in the 1e-3 to 0.1 Hz range are predicted to offer insights into the early universe and merging compact objects, yet they remain undetectable with current instruments. The Moon's potential as a resonant detector for such GWs has been hypothesized, but doubts linger due to the unknown effects of its rugged surface and heterogeneous interior. This paper addresses these doubts by constructing a detailed lunar GW response model.

Method: The research combines high-fidelity spectral-element simulations and normal-mode perturbation theory to model the lunar GW response. The simulations resolve topographical effects down to a 3.7 km grid spacing and reveal systematic signal amplification in thick-crust regions. The amplification is attributed to mode-coupling processes involving hybridized eigenmodes of the Moon.

Result: The study successfully constructs a high-resolution lunar GW response model, demonstrating that the Moon can detect GWs in the 1e-3 to 0.1 Hz range. The model shows significant amplification of GW signals in specific regions, with up to tenfold amplification near certain eigen-frequencies. This confirms the Moon as a highly effective and calibrated gravitational wave detector with quantitative insights for optimal site selection.

Conclusion: The Moon is identified as a potentially promising site for detecting low-frequency gravitational waves due to its structured surface and interior. The detailed modeling provides a scientific basis for selecting landing sites and optimizing the detection process.

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) in the $10^{-3}-0.1$ Hz band encode unique signatures of the early universe and merging compact objects, but they are beyond the reach of existing observatories. Theoretical models suggest that the Moon could act as a resonant detector, but the unknown influence of its rugged surface and heterogeneous interior has cast doubt on this prospect. Here, we resolve this long-standing uncertainty by constructing the first high-resolution, structurally realistic model of the lunar GW response. We achieve this by combining high-fidelity spectral-element simulations with the analytical power of normal-mode perturbation theory, thereby resolving topographical effects down to $3.7$ km grid spacing while maintaining the capacity to discern global free-oscillation patterns. This dual-methodology approach not only recovers the expected predominant quadrupole ($l=2$) oscillation mode, but also exposes a systematic signal amplification of $(10-20)\%$ in thick-crust regions. This enhancement is traced by our normal-mode analysis to a mode-coupling process, in which the original quadrupolar oscillation induced by the passing GWs distributes energy into a series of higher-order modes, the hybridized eigenmodes of the laterally heterogeneous Moon. Near certain eigen-frequencies and at specific locations, we observe up to tenfold amplification, highlighting the power of numerical simulations in resolving these structurally fine-tuned features. Our work establishes the Moon as an accurately calibrated resonant GW detector, and the resulting amplification maps provide quantitative guide for the optimal landing site selection.

Abstract: We investigate the gravitational lensing effects of a static spherically symmetric black hole (BH) within the framework of the revised Deser-Woodard (D-W) nonlocal gravity. By analyzing the deflection angle in both the weak and strong field limits, we derive several distinguishing features of the model. In the weak field limit, we report a leading-order correction to the deflection angle directly attributed to the non-local nature of the theory. In the strong field limit, we find that the lensing corrections are almost linearly dependent on the coupling parameter $ζ$ while being exponentially suppressed by the exponent parameter $n$. Furthermore, the gravitational lensing effect in the revised D-W model at a given time shares similar scale-invariant behavior to General Relativity and conformal gravity, offering a potential pathway to distinguish it from other alternatives using astronomical observations.

Conclusion: 此方法为研究标量-张量理论中的量子效应提供了强有力的工具，如Phantom交叉和奇点避免问题，可为宇宙演化提供了新的视角和理论基础。

Abstract: We develop a general canonical quantization scheme for $k$-essence cosmology in scalar-tensor theory. Utilizing the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, we construct the Hamiltonian associated with the cosmological field equations and identify the first- and second-class constraints. The introduction of appropriate canonically conjugate variables with respect to Dirac brackets, allows for the canonical quantization of the model. In these new variables, the Hamiltonian constraint reduces to a quadratic function with no potential term. Its quantum realization leads to a Wheeler-DeWitt equation reminiscent of the massless Klein-Gordon case. As an illustrative example, we consider the action of a tachyonic field and investigate the conditions under which a phantom crossing can occur as a quantum tunneling effect. For the simplified constant potential case, we investigate the consequences of different boundary conditions on the singularity avoidance and to the mean expansion rate.

Abstract: We investigate the cosmic censorship conjecture in a spherically symmetric collapse with shear and bulk viscosity, heat flux, and pressure anisotropy, imposing physically reasonable energy conditions. Using the semi-tetrad covariant formalism, we derive the dynamics of the collapsing fluid, including a master equation for the evolution of the Weyl curvature, to examine the role of viscosity. The analysis of null geodesic geometry uncovers a novel curvature-balance mechanism between Ricci (matter) and Weyl (free gravitational field) curvature on the apparent horizon; this balance determines the causal nature of the horizon and thereby governs the visibility of the singularity. We then derive necessary and sufficient covariant conditions for the central singularity to be locally naked. Our findings support a weaker form of cosmic censorship and extend the covariant censorship analysis to realistic dissipative, viscous collapse.

Abstract: We explore dark matter like fluids in a spherically symmetric Lemaitre Tolman Bondi (LTB) minisuperspace, tracking how symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian constraint control the emergence of effective dark sources in General Relativity (GR) and Horava Lifshitz (HL) gravity. We first deform the GR Hamiltonian by adding an extra weight $+1$ density to the potential. We show that potential deformations of this type leave the (reduced) Dirac algebra unchanged and the modification is naturally reinterpreted as an effective anisotropic stress energy contribution. While the fluid reproduces an isothermal-like mass scaling, its pressure anisotropy prevents it from giving flat rotation curves. We then turn to HL gravity, where the deformed Dirac algebra induces a controlled nonconservation law for an emergent dust component. Generalizing earlier results, we identify a restricted class of LTB backgrounds for which the HL source term yields a positive scaling dark matter density, consistent with ghost-freedom, and recovery of GR in the infrared. The analysis is conditional on a prescribed background: obtaining a fully backreacted areal radius solution consistent with the HL field equations is left as a natural direction for future work.

Abstract: Building on our previous work [1], where the Local Sum Rules (LSR) were established, we investigate the construction of compact objects in Randall-Sundrum braneworlds supported by matter fields that are dynamically consistent and localizable. We begin by revisiting the Chamblin et al. black string, highlighting its role as a foundational higher-dimensional solution. We then show that the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole can be consistently embedded in this framework via a localized free scalar field, providing a simple yet nontrivial example of a braneworld compact object. Finally, we derive two novel black string solutions sourced by a localized nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) theory with Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{F}) = -β\sqrt{\mathcal{F}}$, corresponding to purely magnetic and dyonic configurations. The purely magnetic solution reproduces the classical Letelier string cloud on the brane, while the dyonic solution generalizes it to include electric charge, closely paralleling the Letelier-Alencar construction. Both NED solutions reduce smoothly to the Chamblin et al. black string in the limit $β\to 0$, illustrating how localized higher-dimensional matter fields can consistently support braneworld compact objects and connect higher-dimensional physics with well-known four-dimensional solutions.

Motivation: Understanding classical black hole scattering at high post-Minkowskian orders is essential for gravitational wave predictions and testing general relativity.

Method: Utilizes worldline quantum field theory, involving non-planar Feynman integrals with loop calculations beyond previous attempts.

Result: Obtains precise expressions incorporating multiple polylogarithms and K3 periods, resolving spurious divergences via conservative memory contributions.

Conclusion: Achieves physically consistent results, validated by low-velocity checks against post-Newtonian theory.

Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the conservative scattering angle and impulse for classical black hole scattering at fifth post-Minkowskian (5PM) order by providing the second self-force (2SF) contributions. This four-loop calculation involves non-planar Feynman integrals and requires advanced integration-by-parts reduction, novel differential-equation strategies, and efficient boundary-integral algorithms to solve a system of hundreds of master integrals in four integral families on high-performance computing systems. The resulting function space includes multiple polylogarithms as well as iterated integrals with a K3 period, which generate a spurious velocity divergence at $v/c=\sqrt{8}/3$. This divergence is present in the potential region and must be cancelled by conservative memory contributions from radiative regions. We find that the standard use of Feynman propagators to access the conservative sector fails to ensure this cancellation. We propose a conservative propagator prescription which realises both cancellations leading to a physically sensible answer. All available low-velocity checks of our result against the post-Newtonian literature are satisfied.

Abstract: Gapped two-dimensional gauge theories with massless fermions generically have rich vacuum structures consisting of many degenerate vacua related by the action of topological line operators. The algebra of such operators has been used to calculate ratios of vacuum expectation values of local operators and to predict nontrivial particle-soliton degeneracies. In this paper, we use recently-developed tensor network methods to study several examples of such theories via their Hamiltonian lattice descriptions. Our lattice results agree with all previously-made predictions. Furthermore, we identify the lattice strong-coupling states that can be adiabatically continued to the degenerate vacua in the continuum limit. We conjecture a procedure, referred to as a lattice decay rule, for how this identification works in general. This rule allows us to compute the continuum vacuum degeneracy by studying the lattice Hamiltonian in the strong-coupling limit.

Abstract: We develop a systematic approach to the computation of gauge invariant quartic interactions between reducible massive and massless higher spin fields. Extending the BRST formulation of existing cubic results, we obtain a single constraint for each off-shell quartic vertex that ensures both the gauge invariance of the Lagrangian and associativity of the gauge transformations at quartic order. A solution to these equations is presented. The general equation is then reduced to an on-shell version to reduce complexity. We find example solutions for the off-shell and on-shell quartic vertices in low spin examples relevant to the problem of black hole scattering.

Abstract: We reexamine the energy-momentum tensor in classical electrodynamics from the perspective of spacetime-dependent translations, i.e., diffeomorphism invariance in flat spacetime. When energy-momentum is identified through local translations rather than constant ones, a unique, symmetric, and gauge-invariant energy-momentum tensor emerges that satisfies a genuine off shell Noether identity without invoking the equations of motion. For the free electromagnetic field, this tensor coincides with the familiar Belinfante-Rosenfeld and Bessel-Hagen expressions, but arises here directly from spacetime-dependent translation symmetry rather than from improvement procedures or compensating gauge transformations. In interacting classical electrodynamics, comprising a point charge coupled to the electromagnetic field, diffeomorphism invariance yields well-defined energy-momentum tensors for the field and the particle, while the interaction term itself generates no independent local energy-momentum tensor. Its role is instead entirely encoded in the coupled equations of motion governing energy-momentum exchange, thereby resolving ambiguities in energy-momentum localization present in canonical and improvement-based approaches.

Abstract: Fundamental scale invariance implies the scale invariant standard model.
  Both the Fermi scale and the Planck mass are given by fields, and their ratio is dictated by a dimensionless cosmon-Higgs coupling. For an ultraviolet fixed point of quantum gravity this coupling is an irrelevant parameter of the renormalization flow and becomes predictable. An analytic scaling solution for quantum gravity admits no free parameter for the mass term of the Higgs boson. If the largest intrinsic mass scale generated by the renormalisation flow away from the fixed point is sufficiently below the Fermi scale, the couplings of the scale invariant standard model are determined by the scaling solution. For a given short distance model remaining valid to infinitely small distances the ratio Fermi scale over Planck mass can be predicted. With reasonable assumptions for an ultraviolet fixed point a numerical solution finds a tiny value for the ratio between the Fermi and Planck scales, very close to a second order quantum electroweak phase transition. This could explain the observed gauge hierarchy.

Abstract: The Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky (AKSZ) construction encodes all the data of a topological sigma-model in the finite-dimensional symplectic $Q$-manifold. Relaxing the nondegeneracy condition i.e. considering a presymplectic form instead, extends the construction to non-topological models. The gauge-invariant action functional of (presymplectic) AKSZ sigma model is written in terms of space-time differential forms and can be seen as a covariant multidimensional analogue of the usual 1st order Hamiltonian action. In this work, we show that the AKSZ construction has a natural generalisation where the target space $Q$-manifold is equipped with a form of arbitrary degree $Ω$ (possibly inhomogeneous) which is $(\mathrm{d}+L_Q)$-closed. This data defines a higher-derivative generalisation of the AKSZ action which is still invariant under the natural gauge transformations determined by $Q$ and which is efficiently formulated in terms of a version of Chern-Weil map introduced by Kotov and Strobl. It turns out that a variety of interesting gauge theories, including higher-dimensional Chern-Simons theory, MacDowell-Mansouri-Stelle-West action and self-dual gravity as well as its higher spin extension, can be concisely reformulated as such multisymplectic AKSZ models. We also present a version of the construction in the setup of PDE geometry and demonstrate that the counterpart of the multisymplectic AKSZ action is precisely the standard multisymplectic formulation, where the Chern-Weil map corresponds to the usual pullback map.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Massive deformations usually destroy t'Hooft-like hidden zeros in color-ordered amplitudes unless masses are set in a symmetry-preserving manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how massive particles affect the structure of color-ordered amplitudes is crucial in quantum field theory, especially for theories like massless QCD or scalar $	ext{Tr} Φ^3$ models.

Method: The kinematic mesh construction was employed to analyze the behavior of hidden zeros under various massive deformations, considering both planar and non-planar variables in different theories.

Result: Hidden zeros persist only when masses are introduced in a manner that respects underlying symmetries. For the $	ext{Tr} Φ^3$ model with uniform mass and the NLSM with specific mass terms, zeros and their factorization patterns survive. Symmetry-breaking masses typically disrupt these zeros. Spurion-induced masses and specific reduction mechanisms (like Kaluza-Klein) preserve zeros in certain limits. Massive Yang-Mills and spontaneously broken gauge theories exhibit different behaviors, with the former lacking hidden zeros and the latter preserving them.

Conclusion: Massive deformations of color-ordered amplitudes generally disrupt t'Hooft-like hidden zeros unless masses are added in a symmetry-respecting way, with notable exceptions in specific theories.

Abstract: We investigate whether the hidden zeros and associated factorisations found for massless colour-ordered amplitudes persist under massive deformations. Using the kinematic mesh construction, we show that hidden zeros survive only for symmetry controlled mass generation. For massive $\text{Tr} Φ^3$ with a uniform mass, the zeros and their factorisation patterns are inherited after a massive shift of planar variables, and an analogous statement holds for Kaluza-Klein reductions where the relevant non-planar variables are modified by conserved mode numbers. For the non-linear sigma model (NLSM), a naive pion mass term generically spoils hidden zeros, while a spurion induced potential restores them. This allows factorisation near zeros, including odd point channels described by an appropriately mass deformed NLSM + $φ^3$ theory, and leads to a hidden zero based on-shell recursion for massive NLSM amplitudes. For spin-one, a simple massive Yang-Mills theory fails to exhibit hidden zeros, while spontaneously broken gauge theories preserve them.

Conclusion: crelax 未受到耦合环境的细节影响，并认为是表征边界条件下减缓和瞬态 Relaxation 的一个通用界面观察量

Abstract: Motivated by recent results in spin chains we study dissipation and relaxation in a two-dimensional holographic interface conformal field theory (ICFT) in which degrees of freedom on one side of the interface are coupled to an external bath, while the other side remains isolated. In the bulk description this setup is realized by gluing a supersymmetric Janus geometry to a BTZ black hole region, with the coupling implemented through a double-trace deformation. We determine the quasinormal modes in the bulk by solving the double-trace matching conditions of the system and bath. The lowest imaginary part of the modes defines a Liouvillian gap, and following earlier work in spin chains we introduce the dimensionless ratio crelax as a measure of interface-induced suppression of relaxation. Numerically we find that, crelax is independent of coupling details to the bath. It is a strong candidate for a universal interface observable characterizing dissipation and relaxation across the interface.

Abstract: Supergravity theories in de Sitter spacetime are known to be very constrained, and rather unnatural within String/M Theory. We revisit the seminal paper by Pilch, van Nieuwenhuizen and Sohnius, where the possible existence of a real Lagrangian for ${\cal N}=2$ pure supergravity in four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime was pointed out. We clarify several issues related to the non-unitarity of the theory and explicitly construct the unique, complete theory searched for long ago by the aforementioned authors. We argue that the lack of unitarity of the Lorentzian theory may be revisited in the Euclidean approach to de Sitter quantum gravity, where alternative definitions of unitarity can be introduced.

Abstract: Symplectic quantization is a functional approach to quantum field theory that allows sampling of quantum fluctuations directly in Minkowski space-time by means of a generalized microcanonical ensemble similar to the one of the standard microcanonical approach to lattice field theory. In a previous paper we showed that, for an interacting scalar field theory in 1+1-dimensions, this formalism allows to capture numerically some crucial real-time features inaccessible to any Euclidean approach to lattice field theory. Yet, the new approach was plagued by two main limitations: an ill-defined non-interacting limit and the absence of a direct formal correspondence between its correlation functions and those generated by the Feynman path integral approach. In this paper, we introduce the new \emph{"constrained symplectic quantization"} approach, for which the perfect equivalence with the Feynman path integral is proved and which is perfectly well defined for the free theory. This new approach is characterized by the analytical continuation of all fields and of the action from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{C}$ and the presence of some constraints which guarantee the stability of the generalized Hamiltonian dynamics and the convergence of the corresponding generalized microcanonical partition function, hence the name of the theory. We show the application of this formalism to the quantum harmonic oscillator on a Minkowskian-time lattice, finding perfect agreement between one- and two-point numerical correlators and the exact quantum-mechanical results. We observe genuine real-time features such as the oscillatory propagator and the discrete excited-state energy spectrum. Our results provide strong numerical evidence that constrained symplectic quantization can sample real-time quantum-mechanical observables, offering a concrete route to overcome the limitations of Euclidean-time importance sampling.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation in photonic architectures relies on the efficient preparation of high-fidelity logical magic states under realistic constraints imposed by finite squeezing and photon loss. In this work, we study logical T-gate magic-state preparation in GKP-encoded photonic qubits using a repeat-until-success injection protocol combined with outer surface-code protection. We develop an architecture-level modeling framework based on a lightweight density-matrix simulator implemented with standard numerical linear algebra. Finite squeezing is mapped to effective logical dephasing, depolarizing noise is included at the logical level, and photon loss is treated as a heralded erasure process. This approach avoids explicit continuous-variable wavefunction simulation, hardware-specific photonic models, and quantum software frameworks, enabling transparent and computationally efficient exploration of architectural trade-offs. We perform systematic parameter sweeps over squeezing values from 8 to 16 dB, baseline loss probabilities between 0.01 and 0.03, and surface-code distances d = 1, 3, 5, and 7. Across this regime, we evaluate repeat-until-success probability, average injection overhead, and logical magic-state fidelity. We find that success probabilities exceed 0.94 across all studied parameters, with an average overhead close to unity. After outer-code protection, logical fidelities reach approximately 0.77 to 0.80 and show weak sensitivity to moderate photon loss but a strong dependence on squeezing. Phase-boundary analysis identifies minimum squeezing requirements needed to simultaneously achieve high success probability and logical fidelity. These results provide quantitative design guidance for scalable photonic fault-tolerant quantum architectures.

Conclusion: Quantum cellular automata offer a promising framework for scalable quantum information systems, with this experimental work providing a foundational approach to implementing and studying such systems at larger scales.

Abstract: As quantum devices scale to larger and larger sizes, a significant challenge emerges in scaling their coherent controls accordingly. Quantum cellular automata (QCAs) constitute a promising framework that bypasses this control problem: universal dynamics can be achieved using only a static qubit array and global control operations. We realize QCAs on a dual-species Rydberg array of rubidium and cesium atoms, leveraging independent global control of each species to perform a myriad of quantum protocols. With simple pulse sequences, we explore many-body dynamics and generate a variety of entangled states, including GHZ states, 96.7(1.7)%-fidelity Bell states, 17-qubit cluster states, and high-connectivity graph states. The versatility and scalability of QCAs offers compelling routes for scaling quantum information systems with global controls, as well as new perspectives on quantum many-body dynamics.

Abstract: We combined experimental and theoretical investigations of an effective two-level atomic system operating in the near-infrared telecom wavelength regime, realized using hot rubidium vapor confined within a sub-micron-thick cell. In this strongly confined geometry, atomic coherence is profoundly influenced by wall-induced relaxation arising from frequent atom-surface collisions. By analyzing both absorption and fluorescence spectra, we demonstrate that the optical response is dominated by a closed cycling transition, which effectively isolates the atomic dynamics to a two-level configuration despite the presence of multiple hyperfine states. This confinement-induced selection suppresses optical pumping into uncoupled states and enables robust, controllable light-matter interaction at telecom wavelengths within a miniature atomic platform. Our results establish a practical route to realizing near-infrared atomic two-level systems in compact vapor-cell devices, opening new opportunities for integrated quantum photonic technologies, including on-chip quantum memories, telecom-band frequency references, and scalable quantum information processing.

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is a natural generalization of bipartite entanglement, but is relatively poorly understood. In this paper, we develop tools to calculate a class of multipartite entanglement measures - known as multi-invariants - for stabilizer states. We give an efficient numerical algorithm that computes multi-invariants for stabilizer states. For tripartite stabilizer states, we also obtain an explicit formula for any multi-invariant using the GHZ-extraction theorem. We then present a counting argument that calculates any Coxeter multi-invariant of a q-partite stabilizer state. We conjecture a closed form expression for the same. We uncover hints of an interesting connection between multi-invariants, stabilizer states and topology. We show how our formulas are further simplified for a restricted class of stabilizer states that appear as ground states of interesting models like the toric code and the X-cube model.

Abstract: Conformal field theories (CFTs) feature prominently in high-energy physics, statistical mechanics, and condensed matter. For example, CFTs govern emergent universal properties of systems tuned to quantum phase transitions, including their entanglement, correlations, and low-energy excitation spectra. Much of the rich structure predicted by CFTs nevertheless remains unobserved in experiment. Here we directly observe the energy excitation spectra of emergent CFTs at quantum phase transitions -- recovering universal energy ratios characteristic of the underlying field theories. Specifically, we develop and implement a modulation technique to resolve a Rydberg chain's finite-size spectra, variably tuned to quantum phase transitions described by either Ising or tricritical Ising CFTs. We also employ local control to distinguish parities of excitations under reflection and, in the tricritical Ising chain, to induce transitions between distinct CFT spectra associated with changing boundary conditions. By utilizing a variant of the modulation technique, we furthermore study the dynamical structure factor of the critical system, which is closely related to the correlation of an underlying Ising conformal field. Our work not only probes the emergence of CFT features in a quantum simulator, but also provides a technique for diagnosing a priori unknown universality classes in future experiments.

Abstract: Non-adiabatic dynamics at molecule-metal interfaces govern diverse and technologically important phenomena, from heterogeneous catalysis to dye-sensitized solar energy conversion and charge transport across molecular junctions. Realistic modeling of such dynamics necessitates taking into account various charge and energy transfer channels involving the coupling of nuclear motion with a very large number of electronic states, leading to prohibitive cost using classical computational methods. In this work we introduce a generalization of the Anderson-Newns Hamiltonian and develop a highly optimized quantum algorithm for simulating the non-adiabatic dynamics of realistic molecule-metal interfaces. Using the PennyLane software platform, we perform resource estimations of our algorithm, showing its remarkably low implementation cost for model systems representative of various scientifically and industrially relevant molecule-metal systems. Specifically, we find that time evolution for models including $100$ metal orbitals, $8$ molecular orbitals, and $20$ nuclear degrees of freedom, requires only $271$ qubits and $7.9 \times 10^7$ Toffoli gates for $1000$ Trotter steps, suggesting non-adiabatic molecule-metal dynamics as a fruitful application of first-generation fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Abstract: Informationally overcomplete POVMs are known to outperform minimally complete measurements in many tomography and estimation tasks, and they also leave a purely classical freedom in shadow tomography: the same observable admits infinitely many unbiased linear reconstructions from identical measurement data. We formulate the choice of reconstruction coefficients as a convex minimax problem and give an algorithm with guaranteed convergence that returns the tightest state-independent variance bound achievable by post-processing for a fixed POVM and observable. Numerical examples show that the resulting estimators can dramatically reduce sampling complexity relative to standard (canonical) reconstructions, and can even improve the qualitative scaling with system size for structured noncommuting targets.

Abstract: Noise and errors are unavoidable in any realistic quantum process, including processes designed to reduce noise and errors in the first place. In particular, quantum thermodynamical protocols for cooling can be significantly affected, potentially altering both their performance and efficiency. Analytically characterizing the impact of such errors becomes increasingly challenging as the system size grows, particularly in deep quantum circuits where noise can accumulate in complex ways. To address this, we introduce a general framework for approximating the cumulative effect of gate-dependent noise using a global depolarizing channel. We specify the regime in which this approximation provides a reliable description of the noisy dynamics. Applying our framework to the thermodynamical two-sort algorithmic cooling (TSAC) protocol, we analytically derive its asymptotic cooling limit in the presence of noise. Using the cooling limit, the optimal cooling performance is achieved by a finite number of qubits--distinguished from the conventional noiseless TSAC protocol by an infinite number of qubits--and fundamental bounds on the achievable ground-state population are derived. This approach opens new avenues for exploring noisy quantum thermodynamical processes.

Abstract: We introduce a method for engineering discrete local dynamics in globally-driven dual-species neutral atom experiments, allowing us to study emergent digital models through uniform analog controls. Leveraging the new opportunities offered by dual-species systems, such as species-alternated driving, our construction exploits simple Floquet protocols on static atom arrangements, and benefits of generalized blockade regimes (different inter- and intra-species interactions). We focus on discrete dynamical models that are special examples of Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA), and explicitly consider a number of relevant examples, including the kicked-Ising model, the Floquet Kitaev honeycomb model, and the digitization of generic translation-invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians (e.g., for Trotterized evolution). As an application, we study chaotic features of discretized many-body dynamics that can be detected by leveraging only demonstrated capabilities of globally-driven experiments, and benchmark their ability to discriminate chaotic evolution.

Abstract: Intrinsic randomness is generated when a quantum state is measured in any basis in which it is not diagonal. In an adversarial scenario, we quantify this randomness by the probability that a correlated eavesdropper could correctly guess the measurement outcomes. What if the eavesdropper is never wrong, but can sometimes return an inconclusive outcome? Inspired by analogous concepts in quantum state discrimination, we introduce the unambiguous randomness of a quantum state and measurement, and, relaxing the assumption of perfect accuracy, randomness with a fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes. We solve these problems for any state and projective measurement in dimension two, as well as for an isotropically noisy state measured in an unbiased basis of any dimension. In the latter case, we find that, given a fixed amount of total noise, an eavesdropper correlated only to the noisy state is always outperformed by an eavesdropper with joint correlations to both a noisy state and a noisy measurement. In fact, we identify a critical error parameter beyond which the joint eavesdropper achieves perfect guessing probability, ruling out any possibility of private randomness.

TL;DR: We demonstrate a substantial reduction in two-level system loss in Ta-based waveguide resonators by incorporating an ultrathin titanium sacrificial layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superconducting qubits are critical for quantum computing, and reducing losses improves their coherence time, T1.

Method: Used ultrathin titanium films to chemically modify the Ta oxide interface, then removed the titanium layer and annealed to suppress losses.

Result: Achieved an average Qi of 1.5 million, which is 28% higher than devices without the titanium layer.

Conclusion: Surface chemistry at the Ta-Air interface critically influences superconducting loss. Atomic-scale engineering can improve coherence in quantum circuits.

Abstract: We demonstrate a substantial reduction in two-level system loss in tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates through the use of an ultrathin titanium sacrificial layer. A 0.2nm titanium film, deposited atop pre-sputtered α-tantalum, acts as a solid-state oxygen getter that chemically modifies the native Ta oxide at the metal-air interface. After device fabrication, the titanium layer is removed using buffered oxide etchant, leaving behind a chemically reduced Ta oxide surface. Subsequent high-vacuum annealing further suppresses two-level system loss. Resonators treated with this process exhibit internal quality factors Qi exceeding an average of 1.5 million in the single-photon regime across ten devices, over three times higher than otherwise identical devices lacking the titanium layer. These results highlight the critical role of interfacial oxide chemistry in superconducting loss and reinforce atomic-scale surface engineering as an effective approach to improving coherence in tantalum-based quantum circuits. The method is compatible with existing fabrication workflows applicable to tantalum films, offering a practical route to further extending T1 lifetimes in superconducting qubits.

Motivation: 随着5G网络对频谱共享的需求增加，特别是在高流量基站需要同时访问多个信道时，提高资源利用效率显得尤为重要。标准QAOA方法由于引入惩罚项来限制多信道访问，导致有效搜索空间过大，影响了算法效率。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了在CBRS信道分配问题中的受限QAOA方法的潜在优越性，特别是在量子计算环境下，该方法有效地解决了多信道约束问题。

Abstract: Efficient spectrum sharing in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band is essential for maximizing 5G network capacity, particularly when high-traffic base stations require simultaneous access to multiple channels. Standard formulations of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) impose such multi-channel constraints using penalty terms, so most of the explored Hilbert space corresponds to invalid assignments. We propose a subspace-confined QAOA tailored to CBRS multi-channel allocation, in which each node-wise channel register is initialized in a Generalized Dicke state and evolved under an intra-register XY mixer. This ansatz confines the dynamics to a tensor product of Johnson graphs that exactly encode per-node Hamming-weight constraints. For an 8-node CBRS interference graph with 24 qubits, the effective search space is reduced from the full Hilbert space of size $2^{24}$ to 2916 feasible configurations. Within this subspace, the algorithm converges rapidly to low-conflict assignments without large penalty coefficients. Simulations on instances with up to eight nodes show that the proposed ansatz achieves near-optimal conflict levels and consistently outperforms standard penalty-based QAOA and a greedy classical heuristic in terms of feasibility. Noise simulations with depolarizing channels further indicate that the constraint-preserving structure maintains a high feasibility ratio in NISQ-relevant error regimes.

Abstract: Airbridges are essential for creating high-performance, low-parasitic interconnects in integrated circuits and quantum devices. Conventional multi-step fabrication methods hinder miniaturization and introduce process-related defects. We report a simplified process for fabricating nanoscale airbridges using only a single electron-beam lithography step. By optimizing a multilayer resist stack with a triple-exposure-dose scheme and a thermal reflow step, we achieve smooth, suspended metallic bridges with sub-200-nm features that exhibit robust mechanical stability. Fabricated within a gradiometric SQUID design for superconducting transmon qubits, these airbridges introduce no measurable additional loss in the relaxation time $T_1$, while enabling a 2.5-fold enhancement of the dephasing time $T_2^*$. This efficient method offers a practical route toward integrating high-performance three-dimensional interconnects in advanced quantum and nano-electronic devices.

Abstract: The efficient generation of random quantum states is a long-standing challenge, motivated by their diverse applications in quantum information processing tasks. In this work, we identify entanglement as the key resource that enables local random unitaries to generate global random states by effectively gluing randomness across the system. Specifically, we demonstrate that approximate random states can be produced from an entangled state $|ψ\rangle$ through the application of local random unitaries. We show that the resulting ensemble forms an approximate state design with an error saturating as $Θ(e^{-\mathcal{N}_2(ψ)})$, where $\mathcal{N}_2(ψ)$ is the second Rényi entanglement entropy of $|ψ\rangle$. Furthermore, we prove that this tight bound also applies to the second Rényi entropy of coherence when the ensemble is constructed using coherence-free operations. These results imply that, when restricted to resource-free gates, the quality of the generated random states is determined entirely by the resource content of the initial state. Notably, we find that among all $α$-Rényi entropeis, the second Rényi entropy yields the tightest bounds. Consequently, these second Rényi entropies can be interpreted as the maximal capacities for generating randomness using resource-free operations. Finally, moving beyond approximate state designs, we utilize this entanglement-assisted gluing mechanism to present a novel method for generating pseudorandom states in multipartite systems from a locally entangled state via pseudorandom unitaries in each of parties.

Abstract: This note introduces a family of circulant quantum channels -- a subclass of the mixed-permutation channels -- and investigates its key structural and operational properties. We show that the image of the circulant quantum channel is precisely the set of circulant matrices. This characterization facilitates the analysis of arbitrary $n$-th order Bargmann invariants. Furthermore, we prove that the channel is entanglement-breaking, implying a substantially reduced resource cost for erasing quantum correlations compared to a general mixed-permutation channel. Applications of this channel are also discussed, including the derivation of tighter lower bounds for $\ell_p$-norm coherence and a characterization of its action in bipartite systems.

Motivation: The paper aims to compare the efficiency of different quantum setups in spectroscopy when idler photons are not fully detected.

Method: The authors use theoretical analysis, focusing on calculating the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for each configuration under varying conditions of parametric gain and loss levels.

Result: The study reveals that the optimal configuration depending on the specific conditions of gain and loss. For low to moderate gains and under 99% loss, the SU(1,1) interferometer yields the highest QFI. At higher gains with moderate loss, the induced-coherence setup performs best. Conversely, the distributed-loss scheme becomes the most effective under extreme attenuations.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into selecting the best quantum configuration based on the specific parameters of the system under investigation, enhancing information retrieval in absorption spectroscopy.

Abstract: We theoretically compare the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for three configurations of absorption spectroscopy with undetected idler photons: an SU(1,1) interferometer with inter-source idler loss, an induced-coherence (IC) setup in which the idler partially seeds a second squeezer together with a vacuum ancilla, and a distributed-loss (DL) scheme with in-medium attenuation. We calculate the QFI as a function of parametric gain for both full and signal-only detection access. For losses below 99% and low to moderate gain, the SU(1,1) configuration provides the largest QFI. At high gain and intermediate loss, the IC scheme performs best, while under extreme attenuation (transmission $<$ 1%) the DL model becomes optimal. These results delineate the measurement regimes in which each architecture is optimal in terms of information theory.

Abstract: Quantum phase estimation is an important routine in many quantum algorithms, particularly for estimating the ground state energy in quantum chemistry simulations. This estimation involves applying powers of a unitary to the ground state, controlled by an auxiliary state prepared on a control register. In many applications the goal is to provide a confidence interval for the phase estimate, and optimal performance is provided by a discrete prolate spheroidal sequence. We show how to prepare the corresponding state in a far more efficient way than prior work. We find that a matrix product state representation with a bond dimension of 4 is sufficient to give a highly accurate approximation for all dimensions tested, up to $2^{24}$. This matrix product state can be efficiently prepared using a sequence of simple three-qubit operations. When the dimension is a power of 2, the phase estimation can be performed with only three qubits for the control register, making it suitable for early-generation fault-tolerant quantum computers with a limited number of logical qubits.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Indefinite causal order (ICO) has been studied via higher-order quantum processes (e.g.\ the quantum switch), process matrices, and quantum-gravity proposals involving superposed causal structure, yet the meaning of ``indefiniteness'' and its relation to definite-order explanations often remain opaque.
  Part~I develops a category-theoretic formulation of definite-order explainability as a gluing problem: each definite causal ordering (a partial order/DAG type) is treated as a context, and causal separability amounts to a consistent global section (possibly after convex mixing), whereas causal nonseparability is a failure-to-glue. We also introduce a compact seven-valued contextual classifier -- an intuitionistic elaboration -- that separates variation across contexts from genuine indeterminacy.
  Part~II applies this framework to a quantum-gravity motivated setting where the fundamental time is a parametric ordering variable $τ$, distinct from geometric (spacetime) time. Adopting a stochastic-quantization perspective on spin-network dynamics (Hilbert space not assumed fundamental) and reading the Wheeler--DeWitt condition as an equilibrium/stationarity constraint, we interpret ICO as indeterminacy of the parametric order of coarse-grained relational interventions, even when the microscopic update process is globally ordered by $τ$. Together, the two parts provide a common language for comparing ICO criteria and for stating precisely what ``no hidden definite order'' means.

Motivation: Understanding noise resistance in two-photon interferometry is crucial for optimizing quantum sensing applications in real-world scenarios where noise is inevitable.

Method: The research evaluates the sensitivity of HOM and N00N interferometry concerning phase noise under both spectrally resolved and non-resolved detection. It assesses their performance in noise across the biphoton coherence duration.

Result: HOM is insensitive to phase noise, making it suitable for scenarios with low noise, while N00N is more sensitive, ideal for high noise environments. Additionally, resolved detection outperforms non-resolved detection across all noise levels and durations beyond the coherence time of biphotons.

Conclusion: The findings offer an optimal strategy for applying two-photon interferometric sensing in various noise scenarios, utilizing HOM and N00N based on expected noise levels, and preferring resolved detection for extended durations beyond coherence time.

Abstract: Quantum sensing based on two-photon interferometry manifests quantum superiority beyond the classical precision limit. However, this superiority is usually diminished inevitably by the noise. Here, we analyze the sensitivity of two typical two-photon interferometries to the noise, that is, Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) and N00N state interferometry. It is found that HOM (N00N state) interference, which depends on the biphoton frequency difference (sum), is insensitive (sensitive) to the phase noise in both the manners of spectrally non-resolved and resolved detections in practice, suggesting their potential applications of sensing for different noise scenarios. Furthermore, spectrally resolved detection outperforms spectrally non-resolved one for the two interferometries, especially for the scope that exceeds the coherence time of biphotons. The findings provide an optimal strategy for the practical applications of two-photon interferometric sensing in diverse noise environments.

Motivation: This work aims to address critical limitations of trapped-ion arrays and quantum computing systems by improving entangling capabilities and efficiency.

Method: A novel entangling scheme is proposed, combining a stationary trapped-ion qubit array with a mobile shuttled ion. The scheme focuses on maintaining uniform motion of the mobile ion to minimize motional heating during quantum operations.

Result: Theoretical modeling demonstrates gate error rates of approximately 0.01%, indicating the feasibility of achieving highly accurate quantum operations within current technological constraints.

Conclusion: The suggested architecture offers a scalable and resource-efficient approach, minimizing thermal noise while enabling qubit communication and distribution for future quantum computing advancements.

Abstract: Towards the scalable realization of a quantum computer, a quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) based on ion shuttling has been considered a promising approach. However, the processes of detaching an ion from an array, reintegrating it, and driving non-uniform motion introduce severe heating, requiring significant time and laser power for re-cooling and stabilization. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel entangling scheme between a stationary ion qubit and a continuously transported mobile ion, which remains in uniform motion and minimizes motional heating. We theoretically demonstrate a gate error on the order of 0.01%, within reach of current technology. This approach enables resource-efficient quantum operations and facilitates long-distance entanglement distribution, where stationary trapped-ion arrays serve as memory units and mobile ions act as communication qubits passing beside them. Our results pave the way for an alternative trapped-ion architecture beyond the QCCD paradigm.

Abstract: The accurate characterization of quantum systems is essential for the advancement of quantum technologies. In particular, certifying convex functions of quantum states plays a central role in many applications. We present a certification method for experimentally prepared quantum states that accounts for both shot noise and measurement imperfections in the data-acquisition stage. Building upon previous work, our method extends confidence regions to accommodate imperfect control over measurements. The values of the functions can then be bounded using convex optimization techniques. We provide explicit prescriptions for quantifying the noise contribution from finite statistics and for estimating the effect of measurement imperfections. By jointly incorporating statistical and systematic errors, the method yields a robust certification framework for quantum experiments.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) provide expressive probabilistic models by leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement, yet their practical training remains challenging due to highly oscillatory loss landscapes and noise inherent to near-term quantum devices. Existing training approaches largely rely on gradient-based procedural optimization, which often suffers from slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and instability near sharp minima. In this work, we propose an alternative inverse-probability algebraic learning framework for QNNs. Instead of updating parameters through incremental gradient descent, our method treats learning as a local inverse problem in probability space, directly mapping discrepancies between predicted and target Born-rule probabilities to parameter corrections via a pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian. This algebraic update is covariant, does not require learning-rate tuning, and enables rapid movement toward the vicinity of a loss minimum in a single step. We systematically compare the proposed method with gradient descent and Adam optimization in both regression and classification tasks using a teacher-student QNN benchmark. Our results show that algebraic learning converges significantly faster, escapes loss plateaus, and achieves lower final errors. Under finite-shot sampling, the method exhibits near-optimal error scaling, while remaining robust against intrinsic hardware noise such as dephasing. These findings suggest that inverse-probability algebraic learning offers a principled and practical alternative to procedural optimization for QNN training, particularly in resource-constrained near-term quantum devices.

A single-photon quantum pulse of light excites the TLS, which subsequently transfers its excitation to the isolated battery. The TLS may also decay into the electromagnetic environment. We obtain analytical solutions for the dynamics of the battery and determine the optimal pulse shape that maximizes the stored energy. The optimal pulse saturates a universal bound for the stored energy, determined by the TLS decay rates into the pulse and the environment. Furthermore, we derive the minimum charging time and establish a quantum speed limit at the exceptional point, where a critical transition occurs in the system's dynamics. We also present analytical expressions for the charging power and investigate the pulse duration that maximizes it.

Result: Improved stability across tested systems with effective regularization strength.

Conclusion: Classical regularization enhances VQE reliability without altering the quantum circuit.)

Abstract: While quantum computers are a very promising tool for the far future, in their current state of the art they remain limited both in size and quality. This has given rise to hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the quantum device performs only a small but vital part of the overall computation. Among these, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which combine a classical optimization procedure with quantum evaluation of a cost function, have emerged as particularly promising. However, barren plateaus and ill-conditioned optimization landscapes remain among the primary obstacles faced by VQAs, often leading to unstable convergence and high sensitivity to initialization. Motivated by this challenge, we investigate whether a purely classical remedy, standard L2 squared-norm regularization, can systematically stabilize hybrid quantum-classical optimization. Specifically, we augment the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) objective with a quadratic penalty proportional to the squared norm of the parameters, without modifying the quantum circuit or measurement process. Across all tested Hamiltonians, H2, LiH, and the Random Field Ising Model (RFIM), we observe improved performance over a broad window of the regularization strength. Our large-scale numerical results demonstrate that classical regularization provides a robust, system-independent mechanism for mitigating VQE instability, enhancing the reliability and reproducibility of variational quantum optimization without altering the underlying quantum circuit.

Abstract: Quantum linear system (QLS) solvers are a fundamental class of quantum algorithms used in many potential quantum computing applications, including machine learning and solving differential equations. The performance of quantum algorithms is often measured by their query complexity, which quantifies the number of oracle calls required to access the input. The main parameters determining the complexity of QLS solvers are the condition number $κ$ and sparsity $s$ of the linear system, and the target error $ε$. To date, the best known query-complexity lower bound is $Ω(κ\log(1/ε))$, which establishes the optimality of the most recent QLS solvers. The original proof of this lower bound is attributed to Harrow and Kothari, but their result is unpublished. Furthermore, when discussing a more general lower bound including the sparsity $s$ of the linear system, it has become folklore that it should read as $Ω( κ\sqrt{s}\log(1/ε))$. In this work, we establish the rigorous lower bound capturing the sparsity dependence of QLS. We prove the lower bound of $Ω(κ\sqrt{s})$ for any quantum algorithm that solves QLS with constant error. While the dependence on all parameters $κ,s,ε$ remains an open problem, our result provides a crucial stepping stone toward the complete characterization of QLS complexity.

Conclusion: The study contributes to cavity quantum electrodynamics by highlighting the role of geometric and parity factors in entanglement harvesting.

Abstract: So far, entanglement harvesting has been extensively studied in free space setups. Here, we provide a detailed analytical and numerical analysis of entanglement harvesting in cavities. Specifically, we adiabatically couple the quantized electromagnetic field to two identical Gaussian detectors located on the symmetry axis of a cylindrical cavity. Our numerical investigations reveal a strong dependence on the cavity length, while showing invariance under changes in the cavity radius in regimes of maximal entanglement. Moreover, we identify different scalings of the detector system parameters for entanglement inside and outside the light cone. Finally, we uncover a strong dependence of the harvested correlations on the cavity induced parity of the electromagnetic field.

It enables both low-level operations, such as vector addition, linear transformations, and Hadamard products, as well as high-level algorithms, including the approximation of linear equations, eigenvalue computations, and exponentially efficient Fourier transforms. This library can be used for traditional quantum many-body physics applications and also for quantum-inspired numerical analysis problems, such as solving PDEs, interpolating and integrating multidimensional functions, sampling multivariate probability distributions, etc.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that leverage on classical optimization tools to find the optimal parameters for a parameterized quantum circuit. One relevant application of VQAs is the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which aims at steering the output of the quantum circuit to the ground state of a certain Hamiltonian. Recent works have provided global convergence guarantees for VQEs under suitable local surjectivity and smoothness hypotheses, but little has been done in characterizing convergence of these algorithms when the underlying quantum circuit is affected by noise. In this work, we characterize the effect of different coherent and incoherent noise processes on the optimal parameters and the optimal cost of the VQE, and we study their influence on the convergence guarantees of the algorithm. Our work provides novel theoretical insight into the behavior of parameterized quantum circuits. Furthermore, we accompany our results with numerical simulations implemented via Pennylane.

Abstract: In the NISQ-era, there is a wide variety of hardware manufacturers building quantum computers. Each of these companies may choose different approaches and hardware architectures for their machines. This poses a problem for quantum software engineering, as the retargetability of quantum programs across different hardware platforms becomes a non-trivial challenge. In response to this problem, various retargetable quantum compilers have been presented in the scientific literature. These promise the ability to compile software for different hardware platforms, enabling retargetability for quantum software. In this paper, we develop and apply a metric by which the retargetability of the quantum compilers can be assessed. We develop and run a study to analyze key aspects regarding the retargetability of the compilers Tket, Qiskit, and ProjectQ. Our findings indicate that Tket demonstrates the highest level of retargetability, closely followed by Qiskit, while ProjectQ lags behind. These results provide insights for quantum software developers in selecting appropriate compilers for their use-cases, and highlight areas for improvement in quantum compilers.

Abstract: Developing high-performance materials is critical for diverse energy applications to increase efficiency, improve sustainability and reduce costs. Classical computational methods have enabled important breakthroughs in energy materials development, but they face scaling and time-complexity limitations, particularly for high-dimensional or strongly correlated material systems. Quantum computing (QC) promises to offer a paradigm shift by exploiting quantum bits with their superposition and entanglement to address challenging problems intractable for classical approaches. This perspective discusses the opportunities in leveraging QC to advance energy materials research and the challenges QC faces in solving complex and high-dimensional problems. We present cases on how QC, when combined with classical computing methods, can be used for the design and simulation of practical energy materials. We also outline the outlook for error-corrected, fault-tolerant QC capable of achieving predictive accuracy and quantum advantage for complex material systems.

TL;DR:  protocols for sharing genuine multipartite entanglement using copies of biseparable states are presented, with implications for quantum information processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the generation and use of genuine multipartite entanglement is crucial in quantum information theory.

Method: A protocol for three-qutrit systems is introduced, requiring two copies of rank-two biseparable states for activation. The method is generalized to arbitrary number of parties without using joint measurements.

Result: The protocol shows that genuine multipartite entanglement can be activated with fewer copies compared to some qubit scenarios, leading to nonlocal correlations stronger than genuine multipartite entanglement alone.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for enhancing entanglement activation and nonlocal resource generation in quantum systems.

Abstract: Sharing genuine multipartite entanglement by considering collective use of copies of biseparable states, which are entangled across all bipartitions but lack genuine multipartite entanglement at the single-copy level, plays a central role in several quantum information processing protocols, and has been referred as genuine multipartite entanglement activation. We present a protocol for three-qutrit systems showing that two copies of rank-two biseparable states, entangled across every bipartition, are sufficient to generate a genuinely multipartite entangled state with nonzero probability. This contrasts with the three-qubit scenario where many copies of biseparable states might be required for sharing genuine multipartite entanglement. We subsequently generalize our protocols to the case of an arbitrary number of parties. Our protocol does not rely on the implementation of joint measurements on the copies of states. Interestingly, the proposed construction naturally leads to the activation of genuinely nonlocal correlations, yielding a result that is stronger than genuine multipartite entanglement activation alone.

Abstract: Control over the internal states of trapped ions makes them the ideal system to generate single and two-photon states. Coupling a single ion to an optical cavity enables efficient emission of single photons into a single spatial mode and grants control over their temporal shape, phase and frequency. Using the long coherence time of the ion's internal states and employing a scheme to protect the coherence of the ion-cavity interaction, we demonstrate the generation of a two-photon entangled state with full control over the phase. Initially, ion-photon entanglement is generated. A second photon is subsequently generated, mapping the ion's state onto the second photon. By adjusting the drive field the phase of the entangled state can be fully controlled. We implement this scheme in the most resource efficient way by utilizing a single $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion coupled to an optical cavity and demonstrate the generation of a two-photon entangled stated with full phase control with a fidelity of up to 82\%.

Abstract: Many applications require or benefit from being able to securely localize remote parties. In classical physics, adversaries can in principle have complete knowledge of such a party's devices, and secure localization is fundamentally impossible. This limitation can be overcome with quantum technologies, but proposals to date require trusting vulnerable hardware. Here we develop and experimentally demonstrate a protocol for device-independent quantum position verification that guarantees security with only observed correlations from a loophole-free Bell test across a quantum network. The protocol certifies the position of a remote party against adversaries who, before each instance of the test, are weakly entangled, but otherwise have unlimited quantum computation and communication capabilities. Our demonstration achieves a one-dimensional localization that is 2.47(2) times smaller than the best, necessarily non-remote, classical localization protocol. Compared to such a classical protocol having identical latencies, the localization is 4.53(5) times smaller. This work anchors digital security in the physical world.

Conclusion: 该论文为分析Wigner熵猜想提供了一个新的方法，得出了几个有用的下限结果，并指出了未来研究方向和潜在的改进空间。

Abstract: We present analytical results toward the Wigner entropy conjecture, which posits that among all physical Wigner non-negative states the Wigner entropy is minimized by pure Gaussian states for which it attains the value $1+\lnπ$.Working under a minimal set of constraints on the Wigner function, namely, non-negativity, normalization, and the pointwise bound $πW\le 1$, we construct an explicit hierarchy of lower bounds $B_n$ on $S[W]$ by combining a truncated series lower bound for $-\ln x$ with moment identities of the Wigner function.This yields closed-form purity-based sufficient conditions ensuring $S[W]\ge 1+\lnπ$.In particular, we first prove that all Wigner non-negative states with $μ\le 4-2\sqrt3$ satisfy the Wigner entropy conjecture. We further obtain a systematic purity-only relaxation of the hierarchy, yielding the simple sufficient condition $μ\le 2/e$. On top of aforesaid results, our analysis clarifies why additional physicality constraints are necessary for purity-based approaches that aim to approach the extremal case $μ\leq1$.

TL;DR: The paper experimentally investigates the classical-light emulation of nonclassicality using different setups based on polarization and mode degrees of freedom. They model experimental noise and find that their results violate noise-robust inequalities, suggesting inconsistencies with certain physical principles. The findings are relevant for quantum communication primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding nonclassicality through classical means is important for applications like quantum communication.

Method: They use prepare-and-measure setups with two setups exploiting polarization and Hermite-Gaussian modes, and model noise with an all-optical setup.

Result: Their results align with previous theoretical findings, showing that even with noise, statistical violations occur, implying limitations on noncontextuality and ontological distinctness.

Conclusion: Their work bridges classical and quantum resources, showing that nonclassicality can be emulated in simple scenarios with potential applications in quantum communication tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we experimentally investigate the classical-light emulation of different notions of nonclassicality in the simplest scenario. We implement this prepare-and-measure scenario involving four preparations and two binary-outcome measurements using two distinct experimental setups that exploit different degrees of freedom of light: polarization and first-order Hermite-Gaussian transverse modes. We additionally model experimental noise through an all-optical setup that reproduces the operational effect of a depolarizing channel. Our experimental results are consistent with the findings of Khoshbin et al. [Phys. Rev. A 109, 032212 (2024)]: under the assumption that the two measurements performed form a tomographically complete set, the observed statistics violate their noise-robust inequalities, indicating inconsistencies with preparation noncontextuality and bounded ontological distinctness for preparations. Although our implementation uses classical light, it reproduces the statistics predicted for the simplest scenario. Since the states and measurements of this scenario underpin computational advantages in tasks such as two-bit quantum random access codes -- among the simplest communication primitives enabling semi-device-independent certification of nonclassicality -- our implementation is directly relevant for such applications.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement distributed via satellites enable global-scale quantum communication. However, onboard sources are susceptible to misalignment due to dynamical orbital conditions. Here, we present two recalibration techniques for efficient generation of high quality entanglement using a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN)-based spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) source with minimum intervention. The first is a heuristic algorithm (HA) which mimics the manual alignment process in a laboratory. The second is based on reinforcement learning (RL). Our simulation demonstrates superior performance of RL with AUC=0.9119 compared to HA's 0.7042 in the modified ROC analysis (60 min threshold). RL achieves perfect alignment in 10 min as opposed to HA's 30 min. Both the methods operate within feasible satellite constraints, offering scalable automation for complex quantum communication scenarios.

Abstract: Quantum combs are powerful conceptual tools for capturing multi-time processes in quantum information theory, constituting the most general quantum mechanical process. But, despite their causal nature, they lack a meaningful physical connection to time -- and are, by and large, arguably incompatible with it without extra structure. The subclass of quantum combs which assumes an underlying process is described by the so-called process tensor framework, which has been successfully used to study and characterise non-Markovian open quantum systems. But, although process tensors are motivated by an underlying dynamics, it is not a priori clear how to connect to a continuous process tensor object mathematically -- leaving an uncomfortable conceptual gap. In this work, we take a decisive step toward remedying this situation. We introduce a fully continuous process tensor framework by showing how the discrete multi-partite Choi state becomes a field-theoretic state in bosonic Fock space, which is intrinsically and rigorously defined in the continuum. With this equipped, we lay out the core structural elements of this framework and its properties. This translation allows for an information-theoretic treatment of multi-time correlations in the continuum via the analysis of their continuous matrix product state representatives. Our work closes a gap in the quantum information literature, and opens up the opportunity for the application of many-body physics insights to our understanding of quantum stochastic processes in the continuum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners need guidance on choosing the best MLIP for their simulations, as MLIPs have become a critical tool in materials science and related fields.

Method: A systematic benchmarking study involving 15 pretrained MLIPs was conducted, evaluating each on accuracy, speed, memory, and simulation stability.

Result: Model parameters and training dataset size correlate strongly with accuracy. Training on charged molecules and Coulomb energy inclusion aren't as impactful as expected. Speed and memory are significantly influenced by architecture and model size.

Conclusion: MLIP selection should balance model customization with the selection of factors like number of parameters and training data size, recognizing limitations in speed and memory influenced by architecture.

Abstract: The rapid development of pretrained Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) that cover a wide range of molecular species has made it challenging to select the best model for a given application. We benchmark 15 pretrained MLIPs, evaluating each one on accuracy, speed, memory use, and ability to produce stable simulations. This provides an objective basis for practitioners to select the most appropriate MLIP for their own simulations, and offers insight into which factors most strongly influence model accuracy. We find that the number of model parameters and the size of the training set are both strongly correlated with accuracy, while training on charged molecules and including explicit Coulomb energy terms are less essential than one might expect. Speed and memory use are determined as much by the model architecture as by the size of the model.

Abstract: Transition states (TSs) govern the rates and outcomes of chemical reactions, making their accurate prediction a central challenge in computational chemistry. Although recent machine-learning models achieve near chemical accuracy in the prediction of TS structures and the associated reaction barriers for small organic reactions, their ability to generalize beyond the training domain remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce targeted benchmarks to probe chemical and structural novelty in generative TS prediction. Building on Transition1x, a large-scale dataset of reactions involving small organic molecules, we construct curated extensions incorporating controlled elemental substitutions and diverse transition-metal complexes (TMC). These benchmarks reveal fundamental limitations of generative models in the generalization to previously unseen elements. As a result, they produce unphysical geometries and large energetic errors, even for reactions structurally similar to well-predicted organic systems. To address this challenge, we introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on equilibrium conformers that exposes generative TS models to novel chemical environments prior to targeted fine-tuning. Across the newly proposed benchmarks, self-supervised pretraining substantially improves TS prediction for previously unseen systems, lowering the median RMSD of TS geometries on T1x-TMC reactions from 0.39 to 0.19 $\mathring{A}$ and reducing fine-tuning data requirements by up to 75%, enabling reliable performance even in low-data regimes. Overall, the integration of generative TS models with self-supervised pseudo-reaction pretraining provides an efficient, scalable, and chemically robust framework for elucidating TSs well beyond the small organic molecule domain, establishing a foundation for investigating complex and catalytically relevant reaction landscapes.

*Fabian M. Faulstich,Svala Sverrisdóttir*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory, which significantly reduces the computational complexity by leveraging SU(2)-invariant properties. The approach uses excitation rings and Veronese squares of Grassmannians to define spin-adapted truncation varieties, leading to substantial dimension and degree reductions compared to spin-generalized methods. Scalability studies and practical computations for molecules like water and lithium hydride demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: spin-adapted CC theory is critical for accurate quantum chemistry calculations, especially for light atoms where spin-symmetry is significant. Reducing computational complexity while maintaining accuracy is a key challenge in this field.

Method: the authors employ an algebraic-geometric approach, specifically using excitation rings and Veronese squares of Grassmannians, to define spin-adapted truncation varieties. This method leverages SU(2)-invariant properties of the electronic Hamiltonian to construct a lower-dimensional space for computations.

Result: The proposed framework significantly reduces the dimension and degree of the truncation variety. This leads to a reduction in the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions, improving computational efficiency by orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: This work represents a major advancement in the computational efficiency of CC theory for spin-adapted systems, enabling more accurate calculations of molecular properties for molecules of increased complexity.

Abstract: We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.

Abstract: Quantum geometrical molecular dynamics provides a quantum geometric picture for understanding reactive dynamics, especially excited-state conical intersection dynamics, and also a numerically exact method for strongly correlated electron-nuclear dynamics. However, there are substantial challenges in describing medium-sized molecules with tens of nuclear degrees of freedom. The main challenge is that it uses a discrete variable representation to discretize the molecular configuration space, and thus requires a tremendous number of quantum chemistry calculations to construct the electronic overlap matrix. Moreover, the expansion coefficients scale exponentially with molecular size for direct-product basis sets. We address these challenges by first introducing a coarse-grained local diabatic ansatz, followed by a tensor network representation of the expansion coefficients and the molecular time-evolution operator. With a full 24-dimensional demonstration using the pyrazine molecule, we show that such developments provide a highly accurate and computationally tractable method for high-dimensional, fully quantum, strongly coupled electron-nuclear dynamics from first principles.

Motivation:  researchers need efficient and accurate methods to compute optical properties for large molecules under intense fields. Current methods have limitations, so they developed RT-TDA to overcome these.

Method:  RT-TDA combines linear-response TDDFT with TDA and adiabatic approximation. Uses real-time propagation in many-electron basis, accelerated by GPUs.

Result:  successfully simulated absorption spectrum, Rabi oscillations, and nonlinear 2-photon absorption of a 120-atom molecule, showing AC Stark effect.

Conclusion:  RT-TDA is efficient, accurate, and scalable for simulating complex optical properties in intense fields and large molecules.

Abstract: Time-dependent electronic structure methods provide an efficient, accurate, and robust alternative to traditional time dependent methods for computing both linear and non-linear optical properties. With this in mind, we have developed the real-time Tamm-Dancoff approximation (RT-TDA). This is an approach to model electron dynamics by propagating the linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) amplitudes within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) and adiabatic approximation. Because the electronic structure is propagated in real-time in a many-electron basis, RT-TDA overcomes known limitations of adiabatic Kohn-Sham RT-TDDFT for describing dynamics in intense fields. Acceleration by graphic processing units (GPUs) enables simulations of larger molecules and on longer timescales. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present the calculations of the linear absorption spectrum of a large organic molecule (120 heavy atoms), of Rabi oscillations, and of nonlinear 2-photon absorption, in which we observe the AC Stark effect.

Abstract: We report on the operation of a 13 g PbWO$_4$ crystal, grown from archaeological Pb and operated as a cryogenic calorimeter in an underground environment. Read out with a Ge thermistor, the detector achieves a low energy threshold and, for the first time, enables the derivation of a dark matter exclusion limit using PbWO$_4$ as target material, for both spin-dependent interactions on neutrons and spin-independent interactions. Although limited in mass and not representative of the final RES-NOVA detector design, this prototype demonstrates effective control of mechanical vibrations and low-energy noise in a cryogenic system, which is a key requirement for rare-event searches. The experiment therefore provides a proof of principle for the RES-NOVA detection concept, validating the use of archaeological Pb-based PbWO$_4$ crystals, low-background operation, and robust data-analysis procedures. These results establish a solid technological and methodological foundation for future RES-NOVA detectors employing larger target masses and advanced thermal readout technologies.

Abstract: The Superconducting Quasiparticle-Amplifying Transmon (SQUAT) is a new sensor architecture for THz (meV) detection based on a weakly charge-sensitive transmon directly coupled to a transmission line. In such devices, energy depositions break Cooper pairs in the qubit capacitor islands, generating quasiparticles. Quasiparticles that tunnel across the Josephson junction change the transmon qubit parity, generating a measurable signal. In this paper, we present the design of first-generation SQUATs and demonstrate an architecture validation. We summarize initial characterization measurements made with prototype devices, comment on background sources that influence the observed parity-switching rate, and present experimental results showing simultaneous detection of charge and quasiparticle signals using aluminum-based SQUATs.

Motivation: 探测器的光检测性能依赖于材料在VUV范围内的反射率，而当前实验值因表面终止结构而高度不一致，因此开发精确测量系统具有重要意义。

Method: 该研究采用角 resolved测量系统，利用德uterium灯和分光 spectrometer，通过旋转 PMT测量广泛的角度范围内的反射光分布。实验在氩气环境中进行，测量了铝和不锈钢材料在UV-VIS和VUV范围内的反射率。

Result: 铝在UV-VIS范围内的反射率为60%，在VUV范围为10-15%；不锈钢在UV-VIS为40%，在VUV同样为10-15%。反射光分布显示出镜面和散射混合特征。

Conclusion: 这些结果不仅验证了现有实验值，还揭示了材料表面在不同波段下的反射特性，有助于更精确的探测器模拟和预期光 yield的计算。

Abstract: Accurate knowledge of material reflectance in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) range is crucial for optimizing photon detection in noble gas detectors such as DUNE. Despite its importance, reflectance values for detector materials in the VUV region remain poorly characterized, with literature values showing significant variation depending on surface termination and finish. We present an angular-resolved reflectance measurement system developed at IFIC that operates in a gaseous argon atmosphere, enabling realistic measurements of detector materials under controlled conditions. The setup couples a deuterium lamp to a monochromator and employs a motorized PMT rotating around the sample to measure reflected light distributions across a wide angular range. We have characterized two key DUNE materials -- aluminum field cage profiles and stainless steel cryostat membranes -- in both the UV-VIS (300-500 nm) and VUV (128-200 nm) ranges. In the UV-VIS region, we confirm literature values of approximately 60% reflectance for aluminum and 40% for stainless steel. Preliminary VUV measurements at 45° angle of incidence yield reflectance values of 10-15% for both materials, significantly lower than their UV-VIS counterparts. The reflected light distributions exhibit a mixed character between specular and diffuse reflection. These results have direct implications for detector simulations and light yield predictions in next-generation experiments.

Abstract: We present a detailed characterization of a new generation of athermal-phonon single-charge sensitive Si HVeV detectors, the best of which achieved 612 meV $\pm$ 4 meV baseline resolution. Our sub-eV energy resolution enables precise measurements of single-photon events and reveal consistent energy losses of 0.81 eV $\pm$ 0.03 eV per charge excitation across two facilities. We demonstrate that the noise for these detectors is well described using a standard Transition Edge Sensor noise model. We also place upper bounds on the nominal phonon collection efficiency of 45\%, establishing these detectors as the most efficient athermal phonon detectors to date, limited only by intrinsic limitations of quasiparticle generation.

Abstract: The NA64 experiment at CERN H4 beamline recently started a high-energy positron-beam program to search for light dark matter particles through a thick-target, missing-energy measurement. To fulfil the energy resolution requirement of the physics measurement $σ_E/E\simeq2.5\%/\sqrt{E\mathrm{[GeV}]} \oplus 0.5\%$ and cope with the constraints and performance requests of the NA64 setup, a new high-resolution homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter PKR-CAL has been designed. The detector is based on PbWO$_4$ crystals, each read by multiple SiPM sensors to maximize the light collection. The PKR-CAL design has been optimized to mitigate and control unavoidable SiPM saturation effects at high light levels, as well as to minimize the gain fluctuations induced by instantaneous variations of the H4 beam intensity. The $R\&D$ program culminated in the construction of a small-scale prototype, POKERINO. In this work, we present the results from the experimental characterization campaign of the POKERINO aiming at demonstrating that the obtained performances are compatible with the application requirements.

Conclusion: 4H-SiC二极管传感器是未来高辐射条件下应用的潜在材料，尤其是考虑到其优异的性能和材料稳定性。

Abstract: The Low Gain Avalanche Diodes (LGADs) are promising particle detectors for timing resolution better than $50$ ps under a high radiation environment. This study investigates n-in-p LGAD architecture, focusing on ultra-thin sensors of thickness less than $50\ μ$m using the WeightField2 program. The capabilities of WeightField2 are demonstrated by comparing its results with irradiation measurements from an FBK LGAD wafer, showing good agreement across unirradiated and neutron-irradiated conditions. This paper presents device simulations in High Luminosity LHC conditions (lifetime integrated fluence $ \mathcal{O} (10^{14})\ \mathrm{n_{eq}~cm^{-2}}$, temperature $ \approx 243\ \mathrm{K} $), and taking into account radiation damage, gain reduction due to fluence, and lattice defects. It is shown that a 20 $μ$m thick sensor achieves the best timing performance. Among Silicon (Si), Diamond (C), and 4H-Silicon Carbide (4H-SiC), we found 4H-SiC to be the most promising: it provides the highest gain value for a fixed thickness and gain implant layer configuration, and best retains high charge collection value and timing capability under increasing fluence up to $50\times10^{14}\ \mathrm{n_{eq}~cm^{-2}}$. A time resolution less than 25 ps is reported with different gain implant concentrations for a $20 μ$m 4H-SiC sensor. This work presents the potential of SiC-based LGADs in high-radiation collider environments.

Abstract: We report on the measurement of neutron energy spectra at the newly established Yemi Underground Laboratory (Yemilab) in the Republic of Korea, designed to host dark matter and rare-event search experiments. A high-sensitivity neutron spectrometer was employed, consisting of ten cylindrical {}^{3}He proportional counters, eight of which were embedded in cylindrical high-density polyethylene moderators of various sizes. To quantify and mitigate contributions from internal α-backgrounds, each detector underwent a dedicated background measurement using a cadmium-shielded box. These backgrounds, primarily originating from trace amounts of U and Th in the stainless-steel housings, were characterized and subtracted during data analysis. Neutron measurements were carried out at three locations within the Yemilab between March to October 2023. After waveform-based event selection and correction for \alphasym-backgrounds, neutron count rates were estimated and corresponding energy spectra were reconstructed using the unfolding method. The total neutron fluence rates were measured ranged from (3.24 $\pm$ 0.11) to (4.01 $\pm$ 0.10) $\times~10^{-5}~ {cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$, with thermal and fast neutron components (1 - 10 MeV) ranging from (1.32 $\pm$ 0.05) to (1.51 $\pm$ 0.05) $\times 10^{-5}~{cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$ and (0.27 $\pm$ 0.03) to (0.34 $\pm$ 0.10) $\times~10^{-5}~{cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$, respectively.

*Hriticka Dhiman,Soniya Chaudhary*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents an analytical model for investigating qP wave interactions at a bonded interface between a thermo-piezoelectric half-space and a functionally graded piezoelectric half-space, utilizing fractional order Lord Shulman generalized thermoelasticity theory. The model incorporates rotational effects and initial stress, and numerical simulations demonstrate the impact of these factors on wave reflection and transmission. The findings are relevant to smart sensors, aerospace structures, vibration control systems, and energy harvesting devices using functionally graded materials under fractional order effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to understand and model the behavior of coupled thermo-electromechanical waves, specifically qP waves, at a bonded interface between materials with special properties, such as functionally graded materials and materials subjected to initial stress. This understanding is critical for the design and analysis of advanced materials and structures in smart sensor technology, aerospace engineering, vibration control, and energy harvesting.

Method: The method involves developing an analytical model based on fractional order Lord Shulman generalized thermoelasticity theory. The model incorporates rotational effects into the constitutive relations and equations of motion for both media and assumes the lower half-space is under initial stress. The paper derives closed-form solutions for reflection and transmission coefficients, as well as energy partition factors, using these models. Numerical simulations in MATLAB are employed to demonstrate the influence of initial stress, fractional order parameters, and thermal relaxation times on wave interactions.

Result: The numerical simulations reveal that reflection and transmission responses to qP waves are strongly influenced by initial stress, fractional order parameter, and thermal relaxation time. Notably, the energy ratios of scattered waves satisfy the energy conservation condition, which validates the mathematical consistency of the formulation. Additionally, the results suggest promising applications in the design and analysis of smart sensors, rotating and aerospace structures, vibration control systems, and energy harvesting devices using functionally graded thermo-piezoelectric materials.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive analysis of qP wave interactions at a bonded interface between a thermo-piezoelectric half-space and a functionally graded piezoelectric half-space. The results highlight the significance of considering fractional order effects, rotational effects, and initial stress in modeling such wave interactions. The findings offer valuable insights and practical guidance for integrating these materials and structures into advanced smart sensor technologies and energy harvesting systems.

Abstract: An analytical model is developed to investigate the interaction of quasi longitudinal (qP) waves with a perfectly bonded interface between a thermo piezoelectric half space and a functionally graded piezoelectric half space. The formulation is based on the fractional order Lord Shulman generalized thermoelasticity theory, which provides an enhanced description of coupled thermo electro mechanical wave behaviour. Rotational effects are incorporated into the constitutive relations and equations of motion for both media, while the lower half space is assumed to be subjected to initial stress. Closed form solutions for reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained, together with associated energy partition factors, allowing a comprehensive assessment of interface wave characteristics. Numerical simulations carried out using MATLAB demonstrate that the reflection and transmission responses are strongly influenced by initial stress, fractional order parameter, and thermal relaxation time. The calculated energy ratios of scattered waves satisfy the energy conservation condition, confirming the mathematical consistency of the formulation. The findings of this study are relevant to the design and analysis of smart sensors, rotating and aerospace structures, vibration control systems, and energy harvesting devices employing functionally graded thermo piezoelectric materials under fractional order effects.
