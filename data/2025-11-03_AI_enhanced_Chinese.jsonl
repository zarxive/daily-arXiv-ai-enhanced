A dynamical\nseparation of scales leads to macrophysics with long-range order, which is\ninsensitive to the highly entropic microphysical processes. Since the total von\nNeumann entropy is conserved on a fundamental level for the quantum system, our\nanalysis reveals a reciprocal connection between the emergence of macroscopic\nstructure and microscopic disorder.

In sharp contrast to this,\nwe report a spin-split dispersion effect of leaky surface plasmons in an\ninversion-symmetric one dimensional plasmonic grating system. In our system,\nthe signature of spin-momentum locking and the resulting spin-polarization\ndependent splitting of dispersion of the surface plasmons are observed through\nthe leakage radiation detected in a Fourier (momentum) domain optical\narrangement. The setup enables single-shot recording of the full\npolarization-resolved dispersion (frequency vs transverse momentum (k)) of the\nleaky surface plasmons. Momentum domain polarization analysis identified a\ntransverse momentum (k) dependent linear birefringence-linear dichroism effect\n(referred to as the geometric LB-LD effect) responsible for the observed\nspin-split dispersion. This unconventional SOI effect is reminiscent of the\nrecently reported LB-LD effect resulting in giant chirality in centrosymmetric\ncrystal, albeit with geometric origin. It is demonstrated that the interplay of\nthe geometrical polarization transformation in focused polarized light and\nsubsequent interaction of the structured field polarization with the plasmonic\ngrating leads to the evolution of strong geometrical phase gradient or\nspin(circular polarization)-dependent transverse momentum of light resulting in\nspin-split dispersion.

However, this fast industrialisation has had a\nsignificant impact on quality control. Several studies have been carried out to\ncharacterise and minimise different types of cutting defects. Reviews published\nbetween 2008 and 2022 highlight that research often focuses on single-criterion\n___quality' approaches, aiming to minimise specific defects such as the\nHeat-Affected Zone, surface roughness, or kerf geometry. Consequently, efforts\nhave been directed at optimising specific aspects of quality rather than\nadopting a complete approach. Furthermore, these reviews reveal that cutting\nquality can be enhanced through the careful selection of laser manufacturing\nparameters and part parameters. However, while parameters such as material and\nthickness have been investigated, the influence of part morphology on cutting\nquality remains underexplored.___ Although some studies have examined the\neffects of material and thickness, part morphology is often limited to simple\nsegments with varying cutting lengths or angles. While other research has\ninvestigated the impact of angle size on cutting quality, no established method\nexists to systematically determine the influence of each part morphology on\ncutting quality.______ In response to this gap, the present study proposes to\nevaluate the criticality of cutting defects, as defined by existing standards,\nacross various part morphologies using a method adapted from Failure Modes,\nEffects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). The objective is to develop a global\napproach that examines the influence of all morphologies on all types of\ncutting defects. An industrial application shows that cutting defects,\nparticularly thermal ones, are strongly influenced by morphologies, while\nthickness affects them irregularly. Improvement priorities target critical\ndefects shaped by both factors. Burrs and adherent slag are critical in angles\nand arcs, while segments, often used in studies, are less sensitive._________\nThese observations lead to the definition of design limits. This method offers\na detailed analysis of the influence of design data on quality, providing\npractical tools for improving industrial processes._________", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates how different part morphologies affect laser cutting quality and proposes a method using FMECA to systematically evaluate the influence of part morphology on cutting defects.", "motivation": "The metallurgical industry's rapid adoption of laser cutting has led to issues with quality control, motivating this study to address the gap in understanding the impact of part morphology on cutting defects.", "method": "The study uses a method adapted from Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) to evaluate the criticality of cutting defects across various part morphologies in an industrial context.", "result": "The study finds that part morphology significantly influences cutting defects, particularly thermal ones, and proposes design limits for improved industrial processes.", "conclusion": "This research provides a framework for evaluating the impact of part morphology on laser cutting quality, offering practical insights for process improvement."}}

The need\nfor the muon veto in CROSS is caused by a comparatively high residual cosmic\nmuon flux at the experimental site ($\\sim$20 $\\mu$/m$^2$/h), being a dominant\nbackground in the region of interest (ROI) at $\\sim$3 MeV. Thus, we installed\nthe muon veto system around the CROSS low-background setup, forming four\nlateral, one top, and four bottom sectors. In this paper we describe the\ndesign, construction and operation of the CROSS muon veto system, as well as\nits optimization and validation by comparing dedicated Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulations of muons with low-temperature measurements in the setup. We\ndemonstrate a stable operation of the veto system with the average trigger\nrates compatible with MC simulations. Also, we investigated two muon trigger\nlogics based on coincidences with either 2 sectors or a single sector of the\nveto. The MC study shows that, in combination with the multiplicity cut of\nthermal detectors, these trigger logics allow to reject 99.2\\% and 99.7\\% of\nmuon-induced events in the ROI, respectively.

Comparison with recent experimental data [Nwachuwku et al.\nSubmitted, 2025] reveals that the Stokes model partially fails to capture key\ntrends, while the Brinkman model, with permeability accurately reproduces\nobserved transport behavior on various porous media. Our simulations predict\nthat both paramagnetic (MnCl2) and diamagnetic (ZnCl2) ions may form\nfield-induced clusters under magnetic gradients over a range of concentrations\nof 1mM-100mM and magnetic field gradients of up to 100 T2/m. The dominant\ndriving force is found to be the magnetic gradient (Kelvin) force, while the\nparamagnetic force from concentration gradients contributes minimally. In\nbinary mixtures, hydrodynamic interactions between paramagnetic and diamagnetic\nclusters significantly alter transport dynamics. Specifically, paramagnetic\nclusters can pull diamagnetic clusters along the magnetic field gradient,\nenhancing diamagnetic migration and suppressing the motion of paramagnetic\nspecies.

Compared to its predecessor, ITS2 offers\nsubstantial improvements in pointing resolution, tracking efficiency at low\ntransverse momenta, and readout-rate capabilities. The detector employs silicon\nMonolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) featuring a pixel size of\n26.88$\\times$29.24 $\\mu$m$^2$ and an intrinsic spatial resolution of\napproximately 5 $\\mu$m. With a remarkably low material budget of 0.36% of\nradiation length ($X_{0}$) per layer in the three innermost layers and a total\nsensitive area of about 10 m$^2$, the ITS2 constitutes the largest-scale\napplication of MAPS technology in a high-energy physics experiment and the\nfirst of its kind operated at the LHC. For stable data taking, it is crucial to\ncalibrate different parameters of the detector, such as in-pixel charge\nthresholds and the masking of noisy pixels. The calibration of 24120 monolithic\nsensors, comprising a total of 12.6$\\times$10$^{9}$ pixels, represents a major\noperational challenge.

Neural Network Backflow\n(NNBF) is a powerful variational ansatz that enhances mean-field wave functions\nby introducing configuration-dependent modifications to single-particle\norbitals. Although NNBF is theoretically universal in the limit of large\nnetworks, we find that practical gains saturate with increasing network size.\nInstead, significant improvements can be achieved by using a multi-determinant\nansatz. We explore efficient ways to generate these multi-determinant\nexpansions without increasing the number of variational parameters.

This phenomenon, known as quantum entanglement,\nis a fundamental resource for quantum computation and emerging quantum\ntechnologies. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the generation of\nentanglement in particle interactions requires a quantitative description of\nthe entanglement produced by fundamental interactions. For the strong\ninteraction, this work presents an analysis of the flavor entanglement\ngenerated in pion-pion scattering at one-loop order in chiral perturbation\ntheory. The amount of entanglement is quantified using the quantum mutual\ninformation, expressed in terms of the von Neumann entropy. The calculation is\nperformed under fixed pion momenta and initial flavor indices, with the\nincoming pions assumed to be in a pure, unentangled state.

In\nthe 4-wave-mixing scheme, two lasers drive the system, coherently trapping the\nsystem in a dark ground-state and coupling a signal transition, that may be in\nthe terahertz, to an idler transition that may be in the optical. The\nphoton-mediated dipole-dipole interactions between emitters generate collective\nsuper-/subradiant dipolar modes, both on the signal and the idler transition.\nAs the array is cooperative with respect to the signal transition, an incident\nsignal photon can efficiently couple into the array and is admixed into dipolar\nidler modes by the drive. Under specific criticality conditions, this admixture\nis into a superradiant idler mode which primarily decays into a specific,\nhighly directional optical photon that propagates within the array plane.\nOutside of the array, this photon may then be coupled into existing quantum\ndevices for further processing. Using a scattering-operator formalism we derive\nresonance and criticality conditions that govern this two-step process and\nobtain analytic transduction efficiencies. For infinite lattices, we predict\ntransduction efficiencies into specific spatial directions of up to 50%, while\nthe overall, undirected transduction efficiency can be higher.

We demonstrate this capability in a finite-size, three-qubit\nsystem described by the transverse-field Floquet Ising model. In this system,\nwe identify a period-doubling (PD) dynamical phase that exhibits a stark\nasymmetry in metrological sensitivity to the magnetic field applied on the\nqubits and to the coupling strength between the qubits. The PD phase originates\nfrom $\\pi$-pairing, where the initial state exhibits strong overlap with\n$\\pi$-paired Floquet eigenstates, leading to robust period-doubled dynamics and\nenhanced metrological sensitivity. The analysis of quantum Fisher information\nreveals that the PD regime significantly enhances precision for estimating the\nIsing interaction strength while simultaneously suppressing sensitivity to the\ntransverse magnetic field. Conversely, non-PD regimes are optimal for sensing\nthe transverse field. This filtering effect is robust for larger system sizes\nand is quantifiable using experimentally accessible observables, such as\nmagnetization and two-qubit correlations, via the classical Fisher information.\nOur work shows that distinct dynamical regimes in finite-size Floquet systems\ncan be harnessed for targeted quantum sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684Floquet\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5468\u671f\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u7531\u6a2a\u573aIsing\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u4e09\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d1\u751f\u500d\u9891\uff08PD\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u76f8\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u65bd\u52a0\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u4e0a\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u95f4\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002PD\u76f8\u6e90\u4e8e\u03c0\u5bf9\uff0c\u5373\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u7684\u03c0\u5bf9Floquet\u672c\u5f81\u6001\u53e0\u52a0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u500d\u9891\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684 metrological \u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50 Fisher \u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cPD\u76f8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9 Ising \u4ea4\u4e92\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u5bf9\u6a2a\u573a\u78c1\u611f\u5e94\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u4e0e\u6b64\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u975e-PD\u76f8\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5bf9\u6a2a\u573a\u78c1\u611f\u5e94\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u662f\u7a33\u5065\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u78c1\u5316\u7387\u548c\u4e24\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178 Fisher \u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684 Floquet \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u6001\u9636\u6bb5\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7279\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5468\u671f\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6a2a\u573aIsing\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5176Floquet\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u53c2\u6570\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50 Fisher \u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0b\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPD\u76f8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9Ising\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a2a\u573a\u78c1\u611f\u5e94\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u679c\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8Floquet\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

The nominal design reached simulated\nefficiencies of 52 %, while measurements confirmed robust performance with up\nto 32 % efficiency at the target 1540 nm wavelength and 46 % at shifted\nwavelengths. Without scaling and contour biasing, the measured efficiency at\nthe target wavelength drops to only 4.4 %.

Phys.: X); 95 pages; 36 figures", "summary": "Light is the fundamental medium through which we perceive the world around\nus. In the modern era, light can not only be used in its raw form but can also\nbe used as a versatile tool. Generally, light fields carry energy and momentum\n(both linear and angular). Due to the transfer of linear momentum from light to\nmatter, the radiation pressure is exerted, whereas, the intrinsic spin angular\nmomentum (SAM) is associated with the polarization states of light. Light\nfields embedded with optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) -- also known as\noptical vortices or phase singular beams -- have truly revolutionized the field\nof optics and extended our basic understanding of the light-matter interaction\nprocess across various scales. Optical vortices -- spatially characterized by\nthe presence of twisted phase fronts and a central intensity null -- have found\na myriad of applications starting from microparticle trapping and manipulation\nto microscopy, optical communication, and quantum information science, among\nothers. Here, we revisit some of the fundamental concepts on optical vortices\nand discuss extensively on how this new dimension of light i.e., the OAM, has\nbeen exploited in both linear and nonlinear optical regimes.

The central result is obtained by analyzing\nthe amplitude of spinfoam stack in the limit where an upper cut-off on the area\nof internal faces is taken to infinity.

This work characterizes phase synchronization\nof an effective spin-1 system, which is realized by coupling three quantum\nstates with infinite lifetime to auxiliary excited states that have a finite\nlifetime. Integrating out the excited states, the effective spin-1 model\nfeatures coherent and incoherent effective couplings. Our key findings are: (i)\nPhase synchronization can be controlled by adjusting the phases of the\ncouplings to the excited states. (ii) Unlike in the paradigmatic spin-1 system\nstudied in the literature, where the dissipative couplings describe decay into\nthe limit cycle state, the effective spin-1 model investigated in this work is\ngoverned by a competition between dissipative decay into and out of the limit\ncycle state, with the dissipative decay out of the limit cycle state playing a\ncritical role. (iii) We identify a parameter regime where phase synchronization\nof the effective spin-1 system is -- in the absence of coherent effective\ncouplings -- governed entirely by the effective dissipators. The effective\nspin-1 model is benchmarked through comparisons with master equation\ncalculations for the full Hilbert space. Physical insights are gained through\nanalytical perturbation theory calculations.

Non-collinearity of ingoing photons causes the existence of\ntwo different quantum paths they can follow upon scattering, this producing\ninterference effects in the detection of the above three processes which is\ngoverned by the wavepacket spectral symmetry. By exploiting rotational\ninvariance, we show that different classes of scattering geometries exist such\nthat the coincidence detection of the scattered photons shows perfect\nconstructive or destructive (Hong-Ou-Mandel) interference, both for symmetric\nand antisymmetric wavepackets. To assess the impact of matter dispersion/losses\non quantum interference effects accompanying photons detection, we analyze the\nscattering of narrow band two-photon wavepackets by high-index dielectric lossy\nspheres. We show that classical Mie resonance peaks, due to their Fano-like\ntraits, yield very strong constructive and destructive interference effects,\noccurring when the wavepacket carrier frequency matches the resonance frequency\nand side Fano dip frequency, respectively.

This approach extends conventional\nquantum resource theories by incorporating secondary resource extraction from\nresidual states, thereby enhancing overall resource utility. As a concrete\nexample, we investigate the distillation of private randomness from the\nresidual states remaining after quantum key distribution (QKD). More\nspecifically, we quantitatively show that after performing a well-known\ncoherent Devetak-Winter protocol one can locally extract private randomness\nfrom its residual. We further consider the Gottesman-Lo QKD protocol, and\nprovide the achievable rate of private randomness from the discarded states\nthat are left after its performance.
