### [1] [Complete Weierstrass elliptic function solutions and canonical coordinates for four-wave mixing in nonlinear optical fibres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11740)
*Graham Hesketh*

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: 论文提供了一种完整的解析解来描述非线性光学光纤中的拟连续波四波混频现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四波混频在光纤通信和光孤子研究中具有重要意义，开发完整的解析解有助于更深入地理解其动态行为。

Method: 论文使用了Weierstrass椭圆函数（$/wp$, $/zeta$, $/sigma$）求解四波混频的微分方程，通过一系列坐标变换得到了规范形式，揭示了新的不变性。

Result: 在任意初始条件下，四波的全包络解被找到，坐标变换依赖于传播变量但仍保持了方程的结构。规范形式下的解是单值亚纯的Kronecker theta函数，这将四波混频与其它可积的非线性光学系统联系起来。

Conclusion: 该研究表明四波混频现象具有独特的不变性，其解析解可表示为Kronecker theta函数，为实验和理论研究提供了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Complete analytic solutions to quasi-continuous-wave four-wave mixing in nonlinear optical fibres are presented in terms of Weierstrass elliptic $\wp$, $ζ$, and $σ$ functions, providing the full complex envelopes for all four waves under arbitrary initial conditions. A sequence of coordinate transformations reveals a canonical form with universal parameter-free structure. Remarkably, these transformations depend explicitly on the propagation variable yet preserve the structural form of the differential equations, an invariance property not previously reported for four-wave mixing. In the canonical coordinates, solutions become single-valued meromorphic Kronecker theta functions, establishing connections with other integrable nonlinear optical systems. The Hamiltonian conservation is shown to arise from the Frobenius-Stickelberger determinant. Numerical validation confirms the solutions using open-source Python libraries.

Abstract: Double ramification (DR) hierarchies associated to rank-$1$ F-CohFTs are important integrable perturbations of the Riemann--Hopf hierarchy. In this paper, we perform bihamiltonian tests for these DR hierarchies, and conjecture that the ones that are bihamiltonian form a $2$-parameter family. Remarkably, our computations suggest that there is a $1$-parameter subfamily of the rank-$1$ F-CohFTs, where the corresponding DR hierarchy is conjecturally Miura equivalent to the Camassa--Holm hierarchy. We also prove a conjecture regarding bihamiltonian Hodge hierarchies. Finally, we systematically study Miura invariants, and for another $1$-parameter subfamily propose a conjectural relation to the Degasperis--Procesi hierarchy.

Abstract: Recently, researchers have proposed the Asymmetric Bethe ansatz method - a theoretical tool that extends the scope of Bethe ansatz-solvable models by "breaking" partial mirror symmetry via the introduction of a fully reflecting boundary. Within this framework, the integrability conditions which were originally put forward by Gaudin have been further generalized. In this work, building on Gaudin's generalized kaleidoscope model, we present a detailed investigation of the relationship between DN symmetry and its integrability. We demonstrate that the mathematical essence of integrability in this class of models is characterized by a newly proposed Kaleidoscope Yang-Baxter Equation. Furthermore, we show that the solvability of a model via the coordinate Bethe ansatz depends not only on the consistency relations satisfied by scattering matrices, but also on the model's boundary conditions and the symmetry of the subspace where solutions are sought. Through finite element method based numerical studies, we further confirm that Bethe ansatz integrability arises in a specific symmetry sector. Finally, by analyzing the algebraic structure of the Kaleidoscope Yang-Baxter Equation, we derive a series of novel quantum algebraic identities within the framework of quantum torus algebra.

Conclusion: 多支UMklapp散射和WCs中的新激发态提供对2D量子材料量子调控的新途径。

Abstract: Strong Coulomb interactions in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors give rise to tightly bound excitons, exciton polarons, and correlated electronic phases such as Wigner crystals (WCs), yet their mutual interplay remains poorly understood. Here we report the observation of multi-branch excitonic Umklapp scattering in both electron and hole WCs realized in ultraclean monolayer WSe$_2$, exhibiting exceptionally high melting temperatures (T$_c$ $\approx$ 20-30 K). Robust Wigner crystallization activates multiple finite-momentum optical resonances, including quasilinearly dispersing, light-like excitons and exciton polarons, extending far beyond the single excitonic Umklapp feature reported previously. Helicity-resolved magneto-optical measurements reveal a pronounced valley dependence of the scattering processes. Combined experiment and theory identify a polaron-induced brightening mechanism in which exciton polarons transfer oscillator strength from bright zero-momentum states to otherwise dark finite-momentum states, explaining the emergence of multiple Umklapp branches where conventional exciton-WC scattering is ineffective. These results establish WC polarons as a new quasiparticle paradigm and introduce polaron-induced Umklapp scattering as a general route to accessing finite-momentum many-body excitations in 2D quantum materials.

Abstract: The quantum Hall effect is a fascinating electrical transport phenomenon signified by precise quantization of Hall conductivity $σ_\mathrm{xy}$ and vanishing longitudinal conductivity $σ_\mathrm{xx}$. Laughlin proposed an elegant explanation in which adiabatic insertion of a flux tube pumps charge through the system. This analysis unveils the fundamental role of gauge invariance and provides a compelling argument about the fractional charge of fractional quantum Hall states. While it has been used extensively as a theoretical tool, a quantitative experimental investigation is lacking despite multiple attempts. Here we report successful realizations of Laughlin pumping in several integer and fractional quantum Hall states. One essential technical innovation is using surface acoustic waves to periodically clear the charges accumulated during the pumping process. Magnetic fluxes are inserted at a constant rate so there is no need to perform complicated data fitting. Furthermore, our setting can reliably extract $σ_\mathrm{xx}$ that is several orders of magnitude lower than the limit of conventional techniques. Effective energy gaps can be deduced from the temperature dependence of $σ_\mathrm{xx}$, which are drastically different from those provided by conventional transport data. This work not only brings a famous gedanken experiment to reality but also serves as a portal for many future investigations.

Abstract: We present a theory of the emission spectrum of magnetoexcitons interacting with a $ν= 1$ quantum Hall state of massive Dirac fermions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides in high magnetic fields. Using an ab initio-parametrized massive Dirac fermion model including valley and spin degrees of freedom, combined with exact diagonalization techniques, we show that interband emission from the massive Dirac Fermion magnetoexciton interacting with $ν= 1$ state directly probes intra-conduction-band excitations of the $ν= 1$. Many-body interactions with the filled massive Dirac fermion $ν= 1$ level yield a strong renormalization of the emission spectrum, including fully polarized emission, a pronounced redshift, and broadening relative to neutral and charged excitons. The calculated spectra are consistent with recent experiments [1-3], establishing magneto-spectroscopy as a probe of finite carrier densities in massive Dirac systems.

Abstract: We develop a theory of the ratchet effect in a lateral plasmonic crystal (LPC) formed by a two dimensional electron gas under a periodic dual-grating gate. The system is driven by terahertz radiation, and the spatial asymmetry required for the generation of dc photocurrent is introduced by a phase shift between the radiation's near-field modulation and the static electron density profile. In contrast to the commonly used perturbative "minimal model" of the ratchet effect, which assumes weak density modulation, we solve the problem exactly with respect to the static gate-induced potential while treating the radiation field perturbatively. This approach reveals a dramatic enhancement of the plasmonic contribution to the ratchet current due to the interference of "bright" and "dark" plasmon modes, which are excited on an equal footing in the asymmetric LPC. Specifically, we predict a parametric growth of the plasmonic peak as compared with the Drude peak with increasing coupling, and the appearance of a dense super-resonant structure when the spacing between plasmonic sub-bands becomes larger than the damping rate. Hence, the dc response exhibits both resonant and super-resonant regimes observed in recent experiments on the radiation transmission through the LPC. The interplay of bright and dark modes, together with their interference, provides a powerful mechanism for controlling the magnitude and sign of the photocurrent by gate voltages and the radiation frequency.

Conclusion: 零偏异常的特征在引入前后端口后依然显著，这对理解复杂量子结构中的强共轭效应有重要价值。

Abstract: The combination of disorder and interactions is known in many systems to produce a feature in the single-particle density of states, the shape and parameter dependence of which act as signatures of the underlying electronic state. Strong Coulomb repulsion gives rise to a host of novel phenomena, among these is a unique zero-bias anomaly. While understanding of the anomaly in bulk materials remains incomplete, a version of this anomaly can be found in an ensemble of two-site systems and hence has been predicted to be observable in parallel-coupled double quantum dots. However, prior work did not include the influence of the leads. Here we show that the presence of the leads results in changes to the projected stability diagrams but that the signature of the strongly-correlated zero-bias anomaly nonetheless remains clearly visible.

Abstract: Spin-wave spectrum of monolayer CrSBr waveguides was studied by numerically diagonalizing the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian derived from linearising the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. In contrast to its short-range counterparts, the long-range dipolar field acts statically as a confining potential for spin wave, while the dynamic part couples the spin and orbit degrees of freedom, thus giving rise to spin-orbit coupling for spin wave. Due to the inversion symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the spinor structure of the wave function, spin-wave eigenstates form doublets with definite parity. Micromagnetic simulation tallies well with numerical calculation. Our study on spin-wave eigenstates in CrSBr waveguides sheds light on the nature of exchange-dipole spin wave in ferromagnetic slabs. We confirm particularly that the robustness of the Damon-Eshbach mode is not derived from topology, but rather from the static dipolar field. Moreover, a thorough knowledge on spin wave in monolayer CrSBr itself represents a step forward to understanding the more complicated antiferromagnetic resonance in bulk CrSBr.

Motivation: Understanding the optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides is important for their potential use in optoelectronics, and this study specifically targets zero-phonon lines, which are crucial for single photon emitters.

Method: The research compares linewidths of zero-phonon lines extracted from optical spectra with those inferred from first-order autocorrelation functions of photoluminescence, using theoretical models including the independent boson model and GW/Bethe-Salpeter equation approximations.

Result: The study provides quantitative bounds on homogeneous broadening and phonon-assisted contributions, which are discussed in detail using both theoretical frameworks.

Conclusion: This comprehensive study enhances our understanding of the optical behavior in MoS$_2$ under helium-ion treatment and provides valuable insights for future research in transition metal dichalcogenides.

Abstract: We explore the zero-phonon line of single photon emitters in helium-ion treated monolayer MoS$_2$, which are currently understood in terms of single sulfur-site vacancies. By comparing the linewidths of the zero-phonon line as extracted directly from optical spectra with values inferred from the first-order autocorrelation function of the photoluminescence, we quantify bounds of the homogeneous broadening and of phonon-assisted contributions. The results are discussed in terms of both the independent boson model and ab-initio results as computed from GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation approximations.

Abstract: This work investigates the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) through computational calculations, with the aim of understanding the emergence of flat bands and conditions favorable for superconductivity close to the magic angle. This study utilizes a k\cdot p continuum model, and the low-energy Hamiltonians are derived from angle-dependent datasets provided by Carr et al. Using this model, the band structure, density of states (DoS), and Fermi velocity are systematically calculated across a range of twist angles. The calculations are performed by discretizing high-symmetry paths in the moire Brillouin zone for band structure calculations, uniformly sampling a square grid for DoS analysis, and employing finite-difference methods to evaluate the Fermi velocity near the Dirac points. The results identify a narrow magic-angle window around $θ\approx 0.98^\circ-1.00^\circ$, where the bands become nearly dispersionless, the DoS exhibits a sharp peak, and the Fermi velocity is strongly suppressed. This computational framework does not directly predict superconductivity, but rather establishes the electronic foundation for exploring flat-band physics and correlation-driven phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene.

Abstract: Recent observations of large unconventional spin-orbit torques in van der Waals (vdW) materials are driving intense interest for energy-efficient spintronic applications. A key limitation of ferromagnet (FM)/vdW heterostructures is their lower value of damping-like torque conductivity ($σ{\rm_{DL}^{y}}$) compared to the conventional heavy metal-based systems, limiting their prospects for commercial spintronic devices. Here, we report both a giant $σ{\rm_{DL}^{y}}$ of $-(1.25 \pm 0.11)\times 10^{5}~\hbar/ 2e~Ω^{-1}$m$^{-1}$ and an unconventional spin-orbit torque in a heterostructure comprising an FM (Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$) and the vdW material GeTe. The value of $σ{\rm_{DL}^{y}}$ represents the highest reported torque conductivity for any FM/vdW interface and is comparable to benchmark heavy metal heterostructures. First-principles calculations reveal that this substantial torque originates from the cooperative interplay of the spin Hall effect, orbital Hall effect, and orbital Rashba effect, assisted by interfacial charge transfer. These findings demonstrate the potential of carefully engineered vdW heterostructures to achieve highly efficient electrical manipulation of magnetization at room temperature, paving the way for next-generation low-power spintronic devices.

Abstract: We identify a previously unrecognized spin-lattice coupling that is allowed in the presence of broken inversion symmetry that can be considered as a lattice analogue to the electronic Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In the low-frequency regime with magnons integrated out, the interfacial spin-lattice coupling is shown to engender a kineo-elastic term in the phonon Lagrangian that couples the strain on the lattice to its velocity and thereby gives rise to a nonreciprocity in transverse phonon velocity. We further analyze the full magnon-phonon spectrum and uncover directional hybridization and absorption, leading to asymmetric phonon propagation lengths for opposite directions. Our results indicate that such interfacial spin-lattice coupling can serve as an efficient route to achieve nonreciprocal phonon propagation properties in magnetic heterostructures with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding relativistic quantum transport in 2D materials, particularly the Klein tunneling phenomenon, is crucial for advancing nanotechnology and electronic devices.

Method: A parabolic model is used to systematically understand the combined effects of mass asymmetry and quantum geometry.

Result: Mass asymmetry primarily shapes the transmission profile, including angular distribution and resonance channels. Quantum geometry modulates tunneling efficiency without changing energy dispersion. Quantum geometry also influences resonance angles through interference effects.

Conclusion: Combining band structure analysis with quantum geometry is essential for comprehensively describing quantum transport phenomena like Klein tunneling.

Abstract: Klein tunneling stands as a fundamental probe of relativistic quantum transport in two-dimensional materials. We investigate this phenomenon in quadratic band-touching systems, where the Hilbert-Schmidt quantum distance plays a central role in the underlying mechanism. By employing a generic parabolic model, we systematically disentangle the cooperative effects of intrinsic mass asymmetry and tunable quantum geometry. We demonstrate that mass asymmetry sets the overall transmission profile, including the angular distribution and the resonance channels. In contrast, we show that quantum geometry provides a universal parameter that modulates tunneling efficiency by tuning the quantum distance, while leaving the energy dispersion unchanged. Specifically, quantum geometry plays a dual role: it governs the overall transmission amplitude through pseudospin mismatch, while its interplay with Fabry-Perot interference induces observable shifts in resonance angles. Our findings reveal that incorporating quantum geometry alongside band structure is essential for a complete description of quantum transport.

Abstract: We propose a method to prepare and certify Gaussian quantum states of the ferromagnetic resonance spin-wave modes in ferromagnets using a longitudinal drive. Contrary to quantum optics-based strategies, our approach harnesses a purely magnonic feature - the spin-wave nonlinearity - to generate magnon squeezing. This resource is used to prepare vacuum-squeezed states, as well as entangled states between modes of different magnets coupled via a microwave cavity. We propose methods to detect such states with classical methods, such as ferromagnetic resonance or local pickup coils, and quantify the required detection efficiency. We analytically solve the case of ellipsoidal yttrium iron garnet ferrimagnets, but our method applies to a vast range of shapes and sizes. Our work enables quantum magnonics experiments without single-magnon sources or detectors (qubits), thus bringing the quantum regime within reach of the wider magnonics community.

TL;DR: A universal plasmon-enhanced Raman spectroscopy strategy using gold or silver nanocavities is developed to detect interlayer layer breathing (LB) vibrations in two-dimensional materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to overcome the inherent limitations of conventional Raman spectroscopy in detecting interlayer layer breathing (LB) vibrations, which are weak or Raman inactive in two-dimensional materials.

Method: The method involves using plasmon-enhanced Raman spectroscopy with gold or silver nanocavities to enhance the detection of LB modes in multilayer graphene, hBN, and their van der Waals heterostructures. The electric-field-modulated interlayer bond polarizability model is developed to quantitatively explain the observed intensity profiles.

Result: The results demonstrate that the developed method successfully detects LB modes with strong electron-phonon coupling or Raman activity, and the model quantitatively describes the behavior across different material systems and nanocavity geometries.

Conclusion: This work overcomes traditional detection barriers for interlayer coupling and stacking dynamics, providing a versatile platform for Investigating hidden interfacial phonons and advancing the characterization of layered quantum materials.

Abstract: Conventional Raman spectroscopy faces inherent limitations in detecting interlayer layer breathing (LB) vibrations with inherently weak electron-phonon coupling or Raman inactivity in two-dimensional materials, hindering insights into interfacial coupling and stacking dynamics. Here we demonstrate a universal plasmon-enhanced Raman spectroscopy strategy using gold or silver nanocavities to strongly enhance and detect LB modes in multilayer graphene, hBN, and their van der Waals heterostructures. Plasmonic nanocavities even modify the linear and circular polarization selection rules of the LB vibrations. By developing an electric-field-modulated interlayer bond polarizability model, we quantitatively explain the observed intensity profiles and reveal the synergistic roles of localized plasmonic field enhancement and interfacial polarizability modulation. This model successfully describes the behavior across different material systems and nanocavity geometries. This work not only overcomes traditional detection barriers but also provides a quantitative framework for probing interlayer interactions, offering a versatile platform for investigating hidden interfacial phonons and advancing the characterization of layered quantum materials.

Abstract: Quantum dot-superconductor hybrids have been established as a suitable platform for realizing Kitaev chains hosting Majorana bound states. Implementing these structures in a qubit architecture is expected to result in coherence times that scale exponentially with the lengths of the chains. To scale to longer systems, the phase differences between all superconducting segments in the chain need to be controlled. While this control has been demonstrated by using an external magnetic flux, ideally it can be achieved with control over intrinsic system parameters. In this work, we investigate whether the relevant phase differences can be tuned through the spin degree of freedom in each QD, or the chemical potential of the discrete bound states in the hybrid sections. We confirm that both these tuning knobs allow for controlling the phase difference in the couplings between neighbouring QDs, bypassing the requirement to tune an external flux. However, we find that the amplitude of the phase shifts can deviate from a discrete $π$-shift. We introduce a spatial variation in the spin-orbit field as a possible mechanism to explain the observed behaviour and comment on the consequences for experimentally creating long Kitaev chains.

Abstract: Giant Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations (SdHO) with V-shaped minima are experimentally studied in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas based on GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. A phenomenological model with two parameters (transport momentum relaxation time $τ_{\text{tr}}$ and quantum scattering time $τ_q$) is developed, accurately describing experimentally measured magnetoresistance over an unexpectedly wide range of magnetic fields (up to 3.5 T) and temperatures (from 2 K to 15 K). The model combines: (i) a quasiclassical density of states with a magnetic-field-dependent Gaussian broadening of Landau levels, (ii) a momentum relaxation time scaling with the density of states, and (iii) oscillations of the Fermi level at a fixed electron density. This model reproduces V-shaped oscillation minima with zero-resistance points, a smooth background of positive magnetoresistance, and enables the extraction of $τ_q$ and $τ_{\text{tr}}$ even in microstructures where ballistic and viscous effects dominate at low fields. As expected, the temperature dependence reveals that $τ_{\text{tr}}$ scales inversely with temperature due to acoustic phonon scattering, while $τ_q$ remains temperature-independent.

*Chen Zhao,Zhaowen Miao,Zhen Ma,Ying-Hai Wu,Ming Lu,Jin-Hua Gao,X. C. Xie*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The key finding is that in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), a magnetic field can induce correlated Chern insulator (CCI) states through a mechanism involving spin and valley Zeeman effects, which are critical in shaping the material's Hofstadter spectrum. The critical field arises when the Zeeman-induced crossings between flavor-polarized Hofstadter spectra become non-degenerate, causing the emergence of CCI states only above this threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the precise origin of correlated electronic states like Chern insulators is central to advancing condensed matter physics and harnessing novel electronic phenomena in materials science.

Method: The study employs a theoretical framework combining insights from low-energy effective theory, projection onto Landau levels, and exact diagonalization techniques. The analysis of the Hofstadter spectrum and its flavor resolution is pivotal in the approach.

Result: The proposed mechanism explains the observed critical field phenomenon in CCI states of MATBG through magnetic field-induced Zeeman effects, providing a unified theory that accounts for various experimental observations.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between theory and experiment, offering a comprehensive explanation for the critical field phenomenon in correlated Chern insulators, which has implications for both theoretical condensed matter physics and experimental materials science.

Abstract: The magnetic-field-induced correlated Chern insulator (CCI) states in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) have been intensively studied in experiments, but a simple and clear understanding of their origin is still lacking. Here, we propose a unified theoretical framework for the CCI states in MATBG that successfully explains most experimental observations. The key insight of our theory is that, due to the very narrow bandwidth of MATBG, correlation-enhanced valley and spin Zeeman terms are critical for shaping the intricate Hofstadter spectrum, resulting in an interwoven, flavor-resolved (spin and valley) Hofstadter spectrum that can well describe the observed CCI states. Crucially, due to the Zeeman effect, the crossings between these flavor-polarized Hofstadter spectra are magnetic-field-dependent, causing certain CCI states to emerge only above a critical field. This is the main mechanism underlying the critical field phenomenon of the CCI states observed in experiments. Our theory provides a clear and unified physical picture for the correlated Hofstadter spectrum in MATBG.

Abstract: We investigate the topological electronic properties of the $K_4$ crystal by constructing a tight-binding model. The bulk band structure hosts Weyl nodes with higher and conventional chiralities ($χ= \pm 2$ and $χ= \pm 1$) located at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. Through analytical evaluation of the Berry curvature, we identify the positions and chiralities of these Weyl nodes. Furthermore, slab calculations for the (001) surface reveal Fermi arcs that connect Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, including those linking $χ= \pm 2$ nodes with pairs of $χ= \mp 1$ nodes. These results demonstrate that the $K_4$ crystal is a spinless Weyl semimetal featuring topologically protected surface states originating from multiple types of Weyl nodes.

Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators are lattice analogs of fractional quantum Hall states that realize fractionalized quasiparticles without an external magnetic field. A key strategy to understand and design these phases is to map Chern bands onto Landau levels (LLs). Here, we introduce a universal framework that variationally decomposes Bloch bands into generalized LLs, providing a controlled and quantitative characterization of their effective LL nature. Applying this approach to twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ modeled by first-principles-derived moiré Hamiltonians, we find that the first moiré valence band is dominated by the generalized zeroth LL across a broad range of twist angles, facilitating the formation of Abelian fractional Chern insulators in the Jain sequences. The second moiré band, renormalized via Hartree-Fock calculations at hole filling $ν_h = 2$, is dominated by the generalized first LL at twist angles $θ= 2.45^\circ$ and $2.13^\circ$. At $θ= 2.45^\circ$, we find numerical evidence for a non-Abelian Moore--Read (MR) state at $ν_h = 5/2$, with consistent signatures in both the energy spectrum and the particle entanglement spectrum. Interpolation studies further demonstrate an adiabatic connection between this state and the MR state in the conventional first LL. In contrast, at $θ= 2.13^\circ$, a charge-density-wave state prevails in the competition with the MR state due to the larger bandwidth. Our variational mapping provides a theoretical framework for exploring exotic fractionalized phases, including non-Abelian states, in realistic systems.

TL;DR: This paper presents a mechanism for inducing magnetism in two-dimensional materials called moiré Mott-Wigner crystals. The magnetism is attributed to the rotation of electrons and their polarization, and it can be triggered by specific photoexcitation of chiral phonons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding magnetism in 2D materials is important for developing new electronic devices. This paper offers a novel explanation for how geometric valley-orbit coupling and phonon zero-point energy can lead to magnetism.

Method: The paper uses a combination of theoretical analysis and proposed experimental methods to investigate electron-phonon interactions and their role in generating magnetism.

Result: In a moiré Mott-Wigner crystal, magnetism arises due to electron polarization and the Berry phase effect. This magnetization can be induced by controlling the polarization of the material. The paper also suggests engineering this effect via photonic stimulation of chiral phonons.

Conclusion: This study reveals a new pathway for generating permanent magnetism in specific 2D materials and provides potential applications for manipulating magneto-optical devices.

Abstract: We show that magnetism in moiré Mott-Wigner crystals can be induced by the collective vibration of electrons around their equilibrium positions (i.e., electronic phonons), even without spin interactions between electrons. Due to a geometric valley-orbit coupling from the Berry phase effect, the zero-point energy of electronic phonons reaches minimum when electrons are fully valley polarized. This leads to a spontaneous magnetization when below a critical temperature. We also propose to engineer the magnetism through the photoexcitation of chiral electronic phonons.

Abstract: The interplay between the curved spacetimes of general relativity and quantum mechanical systems is an active field of research. However, analysis of relativistic gravitation on extended quantum systems remains understudied. To this end, we study here the effects of a general relativistic curved spacetime on the topological phases of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and Kitaev superconducting wire. We find that the topological states remain robust and well localized. In the topological insulator we find that the energy level of the topological state becomes shifted away from zero according to the gravitational redshift, breaking the system's chiral symmetry. In contrast, the Majorana zero mode of the topological superconductor remains at zero energy. Furthermore, within the topological superconductor, we identify the possibility of a gravitationally induced topological phase transition leading to the formation of a domain wall, shifting one of the boundary Majorana zero modes into the bulk.

Abstract: Probabilistic computers replace logic gates with networks of interacting random variables, creating bidirectional systems that can back-derive inputs from outputs. Such architectures enable efficient generation of random samples, implementations of novel algorithms, and natural solutions to classically hard problems such as prime factorization. We present a new physical implementation for these networks: ferromagnetic disks whose magnetization switching process is triggered by current pulses, skewed by external magnetic fields, and randomized by ambient thermal noise. We show that geometry-dependent magnetostatic interactions between these magnetic cells lead to system behavior that emulates deterministic logic gates. Furthermore, by chaining multiple "gates," we achieve a highly accurate bidirectional one-bit full-adder, a proof of concept for complex multi-gate logic functions with reversible information flow. This analog magnetic probabilistic computer methodology improves on other implementations in speed, tunability, and energy efficiency, thereby enabling a powerful new pathway towards practical solution of classically hard problems.

Motivation: The research is motivated by the potential to control phonon properties through surface magnetization, which could have applications in phononics and related fields.

Method: The study employs theoretical analysis based on the Nieh-Yan action to derive the phonon Hall viscosity and investigate its effects on acoustic phonons.

Result: The research demonstrates that phonon Hall viscosity leads to the emergence of chiral and nonreciprocal phonon modes when the surface magnetization is parallel or anti-parallel.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for controlling phonon dynamics through surface engineering in magnetic topological insulators, offering a promising pathway for future phononics applications.

Abstract: The surface half-quantum Hall effect, a hallmark consequence of axion electrodynamics, can be induced by gapping out the surface states of topological insulators through surface magnetization, and has led to a variety of topological response phenomena observed in experiments. In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons. Surface phonon Hall viscosity provides a mechanism to control phonon chirality and nonreciprocity via surface magnetization configurations in magnetic topological insulator films.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate loopless multiterminal hybrid superconducting devices at odd fermion parity with time-reversal symmetry. We find that the energy-phase relationship has a double minimum corresponding to opposite windings of the superconducting phases. Spin-orbit coupling adds multi-axial spin splittings, which contrasts with two-terminal devices where spin dependence is uniaxial. Capacitive shunting localizes quantum circuit states in the wells and exponentially suppresses their splitting. For weak spin-orbit strength, the system has a four-dimensional spin-chirality low-energy subspace which can be universally controlled with electric fields only.

Abstract: We investigated the electrical conductivity of platinum nanowires with heights ranging from 2 nm to 200 nm, deposited by focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID). Post-deposition processing was employed to enhance the electrical conductivity of the platinum nanowires. Thermal annealing of as-deposited nanowires in air at 225$^{\circ}$C for 4 hours increased electrical conductance by up to five orders of magnitude. After annealing, 22.5 $\mathrm{μm}$-long nanowires with a height of 36 nm exhibited resistances of approximately 10 k$Ω$. This nanowire underwent a reduction in height to one-quarter of its original value, a reduction in width to one half, and a reduction in cross-sectional area by approximately one order of magnitude. The platinum-to-carbon weight ratio increased from 35:65 to 85:15. The electrical resistance decreased monotonically as temperature was lowered from room temperature to 100 mK, confirming that annealed FEBID platinum nanowires are promising building blocks for nanoelectronic devices operating at millikelvin temperatures.

They measured the acoustic response at room and millikelvin temperatures and evaluated the intrinsic quality factors. They also modeled the coupling of their resonators to a superconducting transmon qubit.

Result: The resonator cavities achieved high-quality factors of approximately 6000 at the single phonon level, indicating strong confinement. They successfully modeled the integration of these resonators with superconducting transmon qubits, suggesting potential for quantum acoustic devices.

Conclusion: The study explores the acoustic behavior of phononic devices for quantum integration and demonstrates promising results through high-quality factor cavities and successful modeling of their coupling potential.

Abstract: Phononic nanodevices offer a promising route toward quantum technologies, as phonons combine strong confinement within matter with broad coupling capabilities to various quantum systems. In particular, the piezoelectric response of materials such as lithium niobate enables coupling between superconducting qubits and gigahertz-frequency phonons. However, bulk lithium niobate phononic devices typically rely on surface acoustic waves and are therefore inherently subject to leakage from the surface into the bulk substrate. Here, we explore the acoustic behavior of resonator cavities supporting GHz-frequency Lamb waves in a 200 nm-thick suspended lithium niobate layer. We characterize the acoustic response at both room and millikelvin temperatures. We find that our resonator cavities with strong confinement reach intrinsic quality factors of approximately 6000 at the single phonon level. We use the measured parameters of the resonators to model their coupling to a superconducting transmon qubit, allowing us to evaluate their potential as quantum acoustic devices.

Motivation: The paper explores the properties of spin-orbit interactions (SOI) in heterostructures, which are crucial for future technologies, and aims to find a method to distinguish different types of SOI.

Method: The authors use the NSdH effect, a quantum oscillatory phenomenon second-order in the electric field, to analyze spin textures arising from SOI. They compare the phase and beating of NSdH oscillations for linear and cubic Rashba couplings in germanium heterostructures.

Result: The study shows that NSdH oscillations can clearly differentiate between linear and cubic Rashba couplings, providing a clear distinction based on phase and beating patterns.

Conclusion: The NSdH effect offers a new, powerful framework for characterizing materials with different spin-orbit interactions, essential for spintronics and quantum information technologies.

Abstract: The coupling of spin and electronic degrees of freedom via the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is an essential ingredient for many proposed future technologies. However, probing the strength and nature of SOI is a significant challenge, especially in heterostructures. Here, we consider the nonlinear Shubnikov-de Haas (NSdH) effect, a quantum oscillatory effect that occurs under conditions similar to those of the well-known SdH effect, but is second order in the applied electric field. We demonstrate that, unlike its linear counterpart, the NSdH effect is highly sensitive to the spin textures that arise from SOI. In particular, we show that the phase and beating of NSdH oscillations in nonlinear conductivities can clearly distinguish between different types of SOI. As a demonstration, we show how NSdH can distinguish between the linear and cubic Rashba couplings that are expected in germanium heterostructures. Our results establish the NSdH effect as a powerful and sensitive probe of SOI, offering a new framework for characterizing materials relevant to topology, spintronics, and solid-state quantum information technologies.

Abstract: We studied transport of indirect excitons (IXs) and IX mediated spin transport in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure in magnetic fields up to 8 T. We observed the long-range IX transport and the long-range IX mediated spin transport in the magnetic fields. The IX transport and spin transport are characterized by the 1/e decay distances reaching $\sim$ 100 micrometers. The decay distance of the spin transport correlates with the decay distance of IX transport. These decay distances first increase and then decrease with increasing IX density for all studied magnetic fields. The long-range IX transport and the long-range spin transport in the magnetic fields are consistent with the similar long-range transport in zero magnetic field.

Abstract: In recent years, the planar Hall effect (PHE) has become a key probe of Berry curvature and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Threefold-symmetric signals under in-plane fields are often attributed to such quantum mechanisms. Here, we establish a purely classical origin for a three-fold-symmetric PHE. The idea is simple yet decisive: a third-order expansion of the Boltzmann equation in the magnetic field reveals that the threefold component originates from the relative positions of the mirror planes in the crystals with respect to the measurement setups. Remarkably, the threefold contribution should be ubiquitous because this symmetry condition can be realized across a broad range of crystals. Numerical estimates based on concrete models further show that its amplitude is comparable to that expected from the AHE.

Abstract: Twisted bilayer systems host a wealth of emergent phenomena, such as flat-band superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and ferroelectricity, arising from moiré superlattices and unconventional interlayer coupling. Despite their central role, direct and quantitative access to the out-of-plane atomic structure in these systems has remained elusive due to their nanoscale dimensions. Here, we introduce an automated dark-field electron tomography technique that enables three-dimensional structural analysis of atomically thin materials with sub-angstrom precision. Applying this method to twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we uncover a significant expansion of the interlayer spacing compared to the bulk configuration, exceeding 0.1 angstrom, along with a remarkable temperature-driven interlayer decoupling unique to the twisted bilayer. Ultrafast measurement further reveals optically induced interlayer separation of ~0.2 angstrom on the picosecond timescale, attributed to transient exciton formation. These findings not only establish a powerful approach for visualizing hidden out-of-plane structures in atomically thin micro-flake materials, but also uncover the intrinsic fragility and dynamical tunability of interlayer coupling in moiré-engineered 2-dimensional materials.

Abstract: This work theoretically demonstrates that a spin qubit in a parabolic quantum wire driven by a bichromatic field exhibits a confinement-tunable synthetic gauge field, leading to novel Floquet topological phenomena. The study presents the underlying mechanism for topological protection of qubit states against time-periodic perturbations. The analysis reveals a confinement-induced topological Landau-Zener transition, marked by a shift from preserved symmetries to chiral interference patterns in Landau-Zener-St$\ddot{u}$ckelberg-Majorana interferometry. Notably, the emergence of non-Abelian geometric phases under cyclic evolution in curved confinement and phase-parameter space is identified, enabling holonomic quantum computation. Additionally, the prediction of unconventional Floquet-Bloch oscillations in the quasi-energy and resonance transition probability spectra as a function of the biharmonic phase indicates exotic properties, including fractal spectra and fractional Floquet tunneling. These phenomena provide direct evidence of coherent transport in the synthetic dimension. Collectively, these findings position quantum wire materials has a versatile platform for Floquet engineering, topological quantum control, and fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

Abstract: Contact electrification give rise to charge accumulation at the interface when two materials are brought into contact with each other. The charge accumulation at the interface will diffuse to the interior of the conducting material if the dimensions of the contacting conducting material is of the order of an unknown critical length scale. This contact electrification induced interlayer charge transfer will modify the fundamental physical properties of both the contacting materials. This review first discusses the reported experimental evidence of flexoelectricity induced contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer in conducting thin film based heterostructures. The interlayer charge transfer creates a gradient of charge carrier in both the thin films constituting the heterostructure and also modifies the electron-electron interactions. Further, the interlayer charge transfer changes the electron-phonon coupling, spin-phonon coupling and magnetoelectronic coupling that give rise to new physical behavior, which did not exist prior to the interlayer charge transfer. The new physical behaviors from interlayer charge transfer and their mechanistic origins are reanalyzed and discussed, which include spin-Hall effect of charge carriers, topological Hall effect of magnetoelectronic electromagnon, inhomogeneous magnetoelectronic multiferroic effect, flexoelectronic proximity effect and topological spin texture. This review article presents a unified picture of current status and future directions that will provide the scientists a stepping stone for research in the field of flexoelectricity mediated contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer mediated behavior in the micro/nanoscale heterostructures of the conducting materials.

Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator is uniquely characterized by the topological Chern number C. Controlling the Chern number is a key step toward functional topological electronics and enables access to exotic quantum phases beyond the traditional quantum Hall physics. Here, we report a series of QAH insulators in twisted rhombohedral graphene family, in which the Chern number can be tuned through layer configuration, in-situ electrostatic doping, and displacement field. Specifically, in twisted monolayer-rhombohedral N-layer graphene, denoted as (1+N) L, we observe QAH states with C=N at moire filling v=1, where N=3,4,5 represents the layer number of rhombohedral graphene. These results are experimentally confirmed by quantized Hall resistance and the Streda formula. In twisted monolayer-trilayer graphene, we also observe states with |C|=3 at v=3, whose sign can be switched by either electrostatic doping or displacement field. Furthermore, in twisted Bernal bilayer-rhombohedral tetralayer graphene denoted as (2+4) L, we demonstrate a displacement-field-driven topological phase transition between two distinct QAH states with C=3 and C=4 at v=1. Our work establishes twisted rhombohedral graphene as a highly versatile, layer-engineered platform for designing and dynamically controlling high-Chern-number topological matters.

Abstract: We propose an electrically controlled protocol to detect weak Lorentz-violating (LV) backgrounds through the second-order shift photocurrent in noncentrosymmetric crystals. Using a spinful Rice--Mele model, we show that a stationary LV background induces a momentum-odd correction to the Bloch Hamiltonian, which generates an odd-in-field contribution to the shift current. This leads to a directional asymmetry, whereby the photocurrent distinguishes opposite orientations of an applied static field. The effect originates from an LV-induced deformation of the interband phase and can be isolated experimentally by comparing field-reversed configurations, with vanishing response at transverse orientations, providing an internal consistency check. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear optical responses offer a practical and symmetry-selective route for probing LV effects in solid-state systems.

Abstract: The vibrational landscape of adsorbed molecules is central to understanding surface interactions at the atomic scale, influencing phenomena from catalysis to molecular electronics. Recent advances in atomic-scale tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) have enabled vibrational mapping of single molecules with sub-nanometer spatial resolution, providing unprecedented insights into molecule-surface interactions by confining light in plasmonic picocavities. Here, we exploit TERS in a cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope junction to perform Raman hyperspectral mapping of single iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules in three non-equivalent adsorption configurations on Ag surfaces. We explore the changes in the vibrational modes of FePc molecules adsorbed on two distinct silver crystal terminations with differing symmetry, Ag(111) and Ag(110), revealing how subtle variations in the adsorption geometry due to substrate anisotropy can strongly influence molecular vibrations, lifting the degeneracy of individual normal modes. Our findings not only demonstrate the first use of sub-nanometer TERS mapping across different symmetry configurations but also provide a deeper understanding of how site-specific vibrational properties are intimately linked to local atomic environments. This capability paves the way for precisely tailoring surface interactions and controlling chemical reactions at the atomic scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the desire to leverage the complementary properties of QDs and graphene for advancing low-cost, scalable synthesis of hybrid materials in light harvesting and optoelectronic applications

Method: A covalent-linking based approach was used to functionalize the rGO surface with mercapto-silane linkers, enabling the formation of QD-rGO hybrids with various QD sizes, compositions, and shapes

Result: The results show a controlled QD coverage on rGO sheets, efficient electronic coupling between materials, and a significant quenching of QD photoluminescence emissions. The study also reveals that the transfer efficiency from QD to rGO can be tuned by modifying the shell thickness of core-shell QDs, with efficiencies ranging from 95% to 30%.

Conclusion: This research provides a promising strategy for the functionalization of rGO with QDs, demonstrating the potential for creating efficient QD-rGO composites for applications in light energy harvesting and optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Quantum dot - graphene hybrid materials have raised significant interest due to the unique synergy of the optical properties of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) and the transport properties of graphene. This stimulated the development of low-cost and up-scalable solution-processed strategies for hybrid materials with potential application in light harvesting and opto-electronic devices. Here we report a versatile covalent-linking based approach for the functionalization of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), to prepare a variety of QD-rGO hybrid dispersions with QDs of different size and composition (PbS, PbS/CdS and CdSe QDs), and shape (CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods). We achieved a well-controlled QD coverage of the rGO sheets by functionalizing the rGO surface with mercapto-silane linkers. A further spectroscopic investigation of near-infrared PbS QD-rGO materials demonstrates efficient electronic coupling between both materials. The QD photoluminescence emission quenching and exciton lifetime shortening up to 95%, together with subtle graphene Raman G-band shifts upon QD linking, supports electron transfer as the dominant relaxation pathway from the QD to the rGO. The use of core/shell PbS/CdS QDs allows tuning of the transfer efficiency from 94% for a 0.2 nm thin CdS shell, down to 30% for a 1.1 nm thick shell.

Result: 系统性分析显示，体积/剪切形变势和压电通道分别主导了不同结构的耦合机制。在GaAs量子点中，体积应变引起强线性能量位移，在剪切应变和压电场下出现二次响应。频率叠加效应导致光子响应频率双倍，同时线性和二次效应共同作用时产生非谐波时间轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过透射矩阵和敏感度分析，深入理解了量子点与声子的耦合机制，为设计量子点和波导结构以及优化acousto-optic量子界面提供了新的思路。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of quantum dot (QD) coupling to various phononic modes in a phononic waveguide, combining multiband kp and configuration-interaction (CI) QD state simulations with finite-element waveguide mode modeling. We consider self-assembled Stranski-Krastanov InGaAs/GaAs as well as local droplet-etched GaAs/AlGaAs structures. Using kp-CI calculations, we quantify the strain and piezoelectric responses of InAs and GaAs QDs. By systematically isolating volumetric/shear deformation-potential and piezoelectric channels, we demonstrate how mode symmetries dictate distinct coupling mechanisms. We identify the dominant coupling channels and characterize their observable signatures in the QD response. We predict strong linear energy shifts under volumetric strain and quadratic behavior under shear strain, especially in GaAs QDs. The piezoelectric effect is dominated by polarizability, which also leads to a quadratic response. The simulations show energy modulations up to 0.7 meV for an acoustic wave with 0.1 nm amplitude. The quadratic response to shear strain and piezoelectric field leads to frequency doubling in the QD response to a mechanical wave and to non-harmonic time traces when linear and quadratic effects contribute to a similar degree. The deep understanding of QD-acoustic couplings opens pathways to the optimal design of QD and waveguide structures, as well as to improved engineering of acousto-optic quantum interfaces.

Abstract: This study explores the construction, validity and the properties of Boson or Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) stars under the framework of de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) like massive gravity, employing the Kuchowicz metric potential to model their internal structure. This gravitational framework accounts for a massive graviton while ensuring the absence of ghost instabilities during propagation. The BEC stellar configuration in this study was obtained by determining the solutions characterized by static and spherical symmetric metric. This study provides a detailed account of the stellar structure, highlighting the roles played by massive gravity and the Kuchowicz metric through a combination of analytical and numerical solutions. Our work specifically utilizes the Colpi-Wasserman-shapiro (CWS) and Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations of state (EoS) to model the internal thermodynamic behavior of the BEC. We have evaluated the physical viability of the BEC stellar framework by analyzing the energy conditions, and the EoS parameter along with the gradients of the energy-momentum tensor. The stability criteria such as the study of surface redshift, adiabatic index and squared sound velocity were utilized to confirm that our proposed model is both stable and physically consistent. Hence, this study offers a definitive structural analysis of the BEC stars, providing precise results in this massive gravity environment.

Conclusion: 该研究为二体黑洞定律信号提供了基础性理论模型，特别是早期合并及振荡阶段，工作是向精确解析模型发展的重要一步。

Abstract: We study the early-time component of the Green's function of a Schwarzschild black hole, traveling on the curved light cone and usually denoted as the prompt response. Working in a post-Minkowskian approximation, we show for the first time that the prompt response is given by the residue of poles at $ω=0$ present in the complex Fourier domain. The contribution of the high-frequency arcs, previously assumed to generate the prompt response, vanishes. The analytical expression of the prompt response in this scheme is a polynomial of order $\ell$ in the observer's retarded time, with $\ell$ the multipole number. We validate the model against numerical predictions, obtaining good agreement for a compact source far from the black hole. We provide a phenomenologically-corrected expression to improve the match as the source is moved closer. We investigate the polynomial structure of the prompt response for sources close to the black hole through a series of numerical fits. Our work is a fundamental step in the broader effort to develop first-principles, analytical models for binary black hole coalescence signals, valid close to the merger and during the early ringdown stage.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding black hole stability is crucial for developing accurate models in gravitational wave physics and astrophysics.

Method: Refined analysis of quartic equation's coefficients to remove unnecessary restrictions.

Result: Improved stability bounds achieved by relaxing explicit negativity constraints.

Conclusion: Simpler constraints provide better understanding of stability margins.

Abstract: We revisit the recent work of Huang on the superradiant stability of Kerr black holes coupled to massive scalar fields. While their analysis provides sufficient conditions for stability, it imposes an unnecessarily strong requirement by demanding that two roots of the relevant quartic equation be explicitly negative. By instead analyzing the polynomial's coefficients, we show that simpler constraints already exclude additional positive turning points, thereby slightly enlarging the region of guaranteed stability. We further present a near-extremal estimate that tightens the stability bound for rapidly spinning black holes. These refinements sharpen the analytic stability limits without introducing extra assumptions.

TL;DR: L Chernyagin et al. investigate the superradiant instability of scalar clouds in Kerr black hole spacetimes and find that such fields can produce detectable electromagnetic signals. They show that the growth dynamics are significantly influenced by the matter distribution, pointing to a distinguishing observational signature for fundamental scalar fields compared to other light bosons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of fundamental scalar fields in strong gravitational fields is crucial for exploring phenomena in both astrophysics and cosmology. The potential for these fields to produce detectable electromagnetic signals makes them a fascinating subject for research.

Method: The authors employ numerical simulations of the scalar-tensor theory's equations of motion in the Kerr spacetime. They also apply analytic techniques to analyze the instabilities observed in their simulations.

Result: The key findings are that scalar clouds can exhibit superradiant instabilities leading to electromagnetic emissions. The growth rate and stability of these clouds are influenced by the surrounding matter's distribution, which is shaped by the scalar-matter coupling in modified gravity theories. This provides a potential way to distinguish fundamental scalar fields from other light bosons through astrophysical observations.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for testing modified gravity theories through the observation of scalar-tensor interactions in astrophysical systems like black holes. The results could also contribute to our understanding of dark matter candidates and early universe phenomena.

Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories predict fundamental scalar fields of considerable interest in astrophysics and cosmology. We investigate the superradiant instability of scalar clouds around Kerr black holes, showing that stimulated decay generates detectable electromagnetic signals. The growth of the superradiant scalar cloud differs from that of other bosonic fields and depends sensitively on the matter distribution surrounding the black hole, which originates from the scalar-matter coupling realized by the chameleon mechanism in modified gravity theories. In non-uniform matter distributions, stimulated emission from scalar clouds offers an observational signature that distinguishes fundamental scalars from other light bosonic fields.

Abstract: We present a numerical study of the evolution of the Hawking mass for closed nonspherical surfaces evolved under a class of expanding flows in Minkowski spacetime. Although formal monotonicity of the Hawking mass under smooth inverse mean curvature flow is well established in the Riemannian setting, comparatively little is known about the robustness of this behavior in discrete numerical implementations applied to explicitly embedded surfaces away from exact symmetry. We consider surfaces defined by small spherical harmonic perturbations of a round sphere and evolve them under an in-slice, time-flat flow analogous to inverse mean curvature flow. We examine the behaviour of the Hawking mass under the flow and find that monotonicity persists for a class of nonspherical perturbations and is robust under variations in perturbation amplitude and angular frequency. We also identify regimes in which numerical instabilities arise, highlighting practical challenges associated with extending such flows beyond simple symmetry assumptions. These results provide a concrete computational testbed for future investigations of uniformly expanding flows and quasi-local mass in more general spacetime settings.

Abstract: We derive the affine tensor associated with the energy and momentum densities of both gravitational and matter fields, the complex pseudo-tensor, for $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity, the straightforward extension of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR), characterized by a flat, torsion-free, non-metric connection. The local conservation of energy-momentum complex on-shell is satisfied through a continuity equation. An important analogy is pointed out between gravitational pseudo-tensor of teleparallel $f(T)$ gravity, in the Weitzenböck gauge, and the same object of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, in the coincident gauge. Furthermore, we perturb the gravitational pseudo-tensor $τ^α_{\phantomαλ}$ in the coincident gauge up to the second order in the metric perturbation, obtaining a useful expression for the power carried by the related gravitational waves. We also present an application of the gravitational pseudotensor, determining the gravitational energy density of a Schwarzschild spacetime in STEGR gravity, adopting the concident gauge. Finally, analyzing the conserved quantities on manifolds, the Stokes theorem can be formulated for generic affine connections

Abstract: We investigate the effective quantum evolution of the Bianchi type I cosmological model within the Brans-Dicke framework using an effective Hamiltonian approach that includes expectation values, quantum dispersions and cross-correlation terms between different degrees of freedom. For the case $ω< -3/2$, where energy conditions are violated and bouncing solutions exist classically, we demonstrate that quantum backreaction effects significantly smooth the bounce of directional scale factors, with the bounce occurring at scales set by the quantum state width. For the conformally invariant case $ω= -3/2$, quantum corrections cause scale factors to enter accelerated expansion phases more rapidly than in the classical limit. Most significantly, we show that cross-correlation terms between canonical variables are essential for obtaining physically consistent effective dynamics: neglecting these terms leads to spurious divergences and unphysical behavior. When correlations are included, small-amplitude oscillations appear shortly after the bounce, rapidly damping to classical trajectories. We interpret these oscillations as quantum remnant effects encoding information about correlations between gravitational and scalar field degrees of freedom. Our results demonstrate that cross-correlations carry crucial quantum information that substantially influences cosmological dynamics, with implications for quantum gravity phenomenology near singularities.

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe within the framework of Generalized Proca (GP) theory, a comprehensive vector-tensor theory. By adopting two distinct dark energy models in GP, we derive the corresponding modified Friedmann equations, the thermodynamic first law for the apparent horizon, and the equation of state for these models. For the first model, characterized by power-law couplings and an ansatz linking the Proca field to the Hubble parameter, we analytically demonstrate the existence of a critical point in the pressure-volume$(P-V)$ diagram, indicating a $P-V$ phase transition. For the second model, defined by a Proca field marginal coupled to curvature, we show that there is no phase transition when the coupling constants are selected within the range permitted by observations. This investigation not only extends the FRW thermodynamics to vector-tensor theories but also demonstrates that cosmological phase transitions can serve as a powerful diagnostic tool for distinguishing viable dark energy models in GP theory.

Abstract: We present a consistent relativistic formulation of Mach principle within a geometric theory of gravitation. In this approach, neither inertia nor free fall is assumed a priori. Instead, the motion of any local system arises from its dynamical interdependence, direct or indirect, with the rest of the Universe. This viewpoint provides a sharp criterion for what qualifies as a genuinely Machian gravitational theory. A theory is Machian only if the global mass energy distribution underwrites the very existence of the pseudo Riemannian structure of spacetime, rather than merely determining local features such as curvature on a pre existing background. We analyze the resulting cosmological model and discuss its phenomenological implications. In the appropriate local limit, the theory reduces to General Relativity, thereby preserving agreement with all Solar System tests.

Abstract: We investigate scalarization of charged quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder extremal (cqOSe)-black hole in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory with a nonlinear electrodynamics term.
  This black hole is described by quantum parameter $α$ and magnetic charge $P$. It is equivalent to the qOS-extremal black hole whose action is still unknown when imposing a relation of $(3αP^2)^{1/4}\to 3M/2$. Focusing on the onset of scalarization, we find the single branch of scalarized cqOS extremal (scqOSe)-black holes. To obtain a scalar cloud (seed) for the single branch, however, we have to consider its near-horizon geometry of the Bertotti-Bobinson (BR) spacetime. In this case, two scalar clouds for positive and negative coupling constant $λ$ are found to represent two branches.
  Applying Sen's entropy function approach to this theory, we obtain the entropy which is the only physical quantity to describe the scqOSe-black holes.
  We find that the positive branch is preferred than the negative branch.

TL;DR: .analysis of Exact Einstein-Maxwell Solutions


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates how modulating a plane electromagnetic wave with a weak transverse envelope affects exact Einstein-Maxwell solutions. This has applications in areas like gravitational lensing or scattering.

Method: The authors use perturbation techniques within the aligned null pp-wave ansatz to induce a weak transverse modulation in an otherwise flat profile. They derive conditions on the modulation profile $f(x,y)$ for Maxwell's equations to hold to first order in $γ$, and find that $f$ must be of a very restricted form.

Result: The first-order corrections to Maxwell's equations constrain the modulation profile $f(x,y)$ to be divergence-free and curl-free in the transverse plane. Consequently, the transverse part of $f$ must be a harmonic function. This result shows the limitations of using arbitrary transverse modulations to preserve Maxwell's equations to first order.

Conclusion: The analysis provides a precise characterization of the conditions required for plane electromagnetic waves with weak transverse modulations to remain solutions of Maxwell's equations in Einstein's theory of gravity. The main finding is that such modulations can only tolerate a very restricted class of profiles.

Abstract: Electrovac pp--waves in Brinkmann form provide exact Einstein--Maxwell solutions for co--propagating null radiation. Motivated by lensing or scattering, one often ``modulates'' a plane electromagnetic wave by a weak transverse envelope $1+γf(x,y)$. We show that, within the aligned null pp--wave ansatz ($A_v=0$, no $v$--dependence, $F_{xy}=0$) and enforcing the source--free Maxwell equations to $\mathcal O(γ)$, a generic profile $f(x,y)$ is incompatible with Maxwell: the transverse field $F_{ui}$ must be both divergence--free and curl--free on the transverse plane, hence $F_{ui}=\partial_iΦ$ with $Δ_\perpΦ=0$.
  We give a minimal, polarization--agnostic gauge completion of the modulated potential and prove a cancellation theorem: under standard decay/regularity (or zero--mode) conditions that exclude additional harmonic transverse modes, all $\mathcal O(γ)$ dependence on $f$ drops out of $F_{ui}$ and therefore out of the electrovac source $T_{uu}$. Consequently, the electromagnetic contribution to the Brinkmann profile is universal at $\mathcal O(γ)$: the familiar cycle--averaged isotropic $r^2$ term plus an isotropic oscillatory correction at frequency $2ω$, present only for non-circular polarisation. We isolate the residual Maxwell--admissible freedom as harmonic (holomorphic) transverse data and, by Kerr--Schild linearity, superpose an arbitrary co--propagating vacuum gravitational pp--wave, relating TT--gauge strain to Brinkmann amplitudes. Modelling genuinely localised beams, therefore, requires currents, non-null components, or more general Kundt/gyraton geometries.

Abstract: We analyze the propagation and polarization properties of high-frequency gravitational waves in Einstein-Æther theory on vorticity-free and slowly-varying backgrounds at both leading and next-to-leading orders within the geometric optics approximation. The linear perturbation analysis is performed in the background Æther-orthogonal frame, in which the axes of the gravitational wave sound cones remain perpendicular to these hypersurfaces, thereby simplifying the analysis. The leading-order results show that Einstein-Æther theory admits two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one scalar mode, consistent with the findings in the flat spacetime background. We further derive the dispersion relations and linear stability conditions for these modes in curved backgrounds. At next-to-leading order, we obtain the amplitude evolution equations, finding that the graviton number is conserved for the tensor modes but not for the vector and scalar modes. Next-to-leading-order effects also induce mixing among polarization modes. Our study demonstrates that, after imposing the GW170817 constraint on the propagation speed of gravitational waves, the vector modes mixed with the leading-order tensor modes cannot be used to distinguish between general relativity and Einstein-Æther theory. On the other hand, the mixing between scalar modes and the leading-order tensor modes leads to distinct predictions in the two theories, providing a promising avenue to test Einstein-Æther gravity through the detection of polarization mixing in gravitational waves.

Abstract: This work aims to present the quantum aspects of a non-commutative gauge gravity formulation of a Schwarzschild-like black hole constructed via the Moyal twist $\partial_t \wedge \partial_θ$. Particle creation is estimated for bosonic and fermionic fields using the quantum tunneling method, with divergent integrals treated through the residue prescription. Since the surface gravity is well defined for this configuration, the corresponding emission rates and evaporation lifetimes are also computed. In addition, previously reported results in the literature on gauge gravity Schwarzschild black holes are revisited. Finally, we infer constraints on the non-commutative parameter $Θ$ from solar-system tests.

Abstract: The binary black hole signal GW250114, the clearest gravitational wave detected to date, offers a unique opportunity to test general relativity in the relativistic strong-gravity regime. How well does GW250114 agree with Einstein's predictions in the plunge-merger-ringdown stage? To address this point, we constrain deviations from general relativity across the plunge-merger-ringdown stage of spin-precessing binaries with a parametrized waveform model within the effective-one-body formalism. We find that deviations from the peak gravitational-wave amplitude and instantaneous frequency of the $(\ell, |m|)=(2,2)$ mode are constrained to about $10\%$ and $4\%$, respectively, at $90\%$ credible level. These constraints are, respectively, two and four times more stringent than those obtained by analyzing GW150914. We also constrain, for the first time, the instantaneous frequency of the $(\ell, |m|)=(4,4)$ mode at merger to about $6\%$, and the time at which the gravitational-wave amplitude peaks to about $5~\mathrm{ms}$. These results are the most precise tests of general relativity in the nonlinear regime to date, and can be employed to constrain extensions of Einsten's theory.

Abstract: We continue our series of papers where we study the quasinormal modes, and their excitation, of black holes in the simplest beyond general relativity model in which first-principle calculations are tractable: a nonrotating black hole in an effective-field-theory extension of general relativity with cubic-in-curvature terms. In this theory, the equivalence between the quasinormal mode spectra associated with metric perturbations of polar and axial parities ("isospectrality") of the Schwarzschild black hole in general relativity no longer holds. How does this loss of isospectrality translate into the time-domain ringdown of gravitational waves? Given such a ringdown, can we identify the two "fundamental quasinormal modes" associated to the two metric-perturbation parities? We study these questions through a large suite of time-domain numerical simulations, by a prescription on how to relate the gauge-invariant master functions that describe metric perturbations of each parity with the gravitational polarizations. Under the assumptions made in our calculations, we find that it is in general difficult to identify either of the two fundamental modes from the time series, although finding evidence for a non-general-relativistic mode is possible sometimes. We discuss our results in light of our assumptions and speculate about what may occur when they are relaxed.

Abstract: We show that regularizing $(2+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with a finite-resolution Gaussian probe, analogous to Weyl-Heisenberg (Gabor) signal analysis and related quantization, induces a curved geometry with a topological defect. The regularized metric replaces $r^2$ by $r^2+σ^2$ in the angular part, where $σ$ is the resolution scale from the width of the Gaussian probe. The resulting Gaussian curvature integrates to $-2π$, independently of $σ$, and including the boundary contribution, yields Euler characteristic $χ=0$, corresponding to a punctured plane. This curvature defines an effective stress-energy source with total energy $E_{\text{eff}}=-1/(4G)$, universal and $σ$-independent. Spatial slices embed isometrically as helicoids, and geodesics exhibit a characteristic swirling motion. These results show that finite spatial resolution measurement does not merely smooth singularities but imprints topological defects with fixed physical consequences, suggesting that observational limitations fundamentally shape spacetime geometry. We show how our Gabor regularisation is extendable to $(3+1)$ Minkowski space-time.

TL;DR: The paper examines the quasinormal modes of polar metric-dilaton perturbations around dEH black holes, presenting results from two numerical methods with excellent agreement. The black holes are stable as all quasinormal frequencies have negative imaginary parts. The results show differences in behavior between ε=1 and ε=-1, especially near extremality.

Motivation: Understanding the stability and behavior of black holes under various perturbations is crucial for testing theories of gravity and quantum effects near event horizons.

Method: Numerical techniques include direct integration and matrix continued fractions, ensuring robust computation of quasinormal modes.

Result: Stability confirmed with negative imaginary quasinormal frequencies. Behavior differs between ε=1 and ε=-1, particularly in damping rates near extremality.

Conclusion: The dEH black hole with dilaton hair is stable against polar metric-dilaton perturbations, with distinct characteristics based on the coupling parameter ε.

Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes of polar metric-dilaton perturbations around the dilaton-Euler-Heisenberg (dEH) black holes with dilaton hair obtained from the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with two dilaton coupling constants ($α,β$) to the nonlinear Euler-Heisenberg term. We compute the quasinormal mode spectra by making use of two numerical techniques: direct integration and matrix values continued fraction methods. An excellent agreement is found between two approaches, confirming the robustness of our computation. We present the fundamental quasinormal frequencies for both gravitational and dilaton modes and analyze their dependence on the magnetic charge ($Q_m$), angular momentum quantum number $(l)$, and coupling parameter ($ε=α-β$). All negative imaginary quasinormal frequencies imply that the dEH black hole with dilaton hair is stable against polar metric-dilaton perturbations. Also, our results reveal distinct qualitative behaviors between $ε=1$ and $ε=-1 $, particularly in the damping rates near the extremality.

Abstract: A newly born neutron star is expected to exhibit significant deviations from spherical symmetry, which decay with time. Determining how much deformation remains at present is crucial for gravitational-wave astronomy. This study is the first investigation into the evolution of quadrupole deformation during the solid crust formation phase to obtain a plausible value at present. The equilibrium structure before solidification is modeled using a fluid description, and the deformation is introduced through an assumed driving force. As the star cools, this force weakens, leading to a gradual decay of the deformation. Eventually, the deformation vanishes in the fluid region but partially remains in the crust, sustained by elastic forces, after solidification. By comparing the equilibrium models before and after solidification, we estimate the residual ellipticity and demonstrate that the spatial profile of the elastic shear is imprinted in the crust. The relic ellipticity is only a few percent of the original value, with its absolute magnitude depending on the deformation mechanism during the hot era, which cannot be specified owing to the lack of elaborate models. This work provides a first step toward linking early neutron star deformation with future gravitational-wave observations.

*Siyuan Chen,Karan Jani,Thomas W. Kephart*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Black holes contain more entropy than the universe, and gravitational waves from LIGO/Virgo help update the entropy budget. Binary mergers add entropy, valid in the second law of thermodynamics. This study updates the entropy budget for stellar to intermediate-mass black holes (5-300 solar masses) from supernovae or binary mergers using population synthesis models. Key insights: Binary mergers surpass entropy from cosmic microwave background at z~12, primordial black holes as dark matter contribute early entropy, and gravitational wave energy production is inefficient compared to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy generation. Entropy calculations show thermodynamic asymmetry in black hole mergers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the entropy budget of the universe, especially the role of black holes, is crucial for refining cosmological models and exploring the connection between gravity and thermodynamics. Combining gravitational wave observations with population synthesis models provides new insights into the history of black hole mergers and their thermodynamic impact.

Method: This study employs population synthesis models and numerical relativity-based phenomenological fits to calculate the entropy budget for black holes in the 5-300 solar masses range. The models include contributions from supernovae and binary mergers. The analysis considers entropy contributions from binary mergers, comparing them to entropy from relic radiation and from primordial black holes that could be dark matter.

Result: Binary black hole mergers contribute significantly to the early entropy budget of the universe, surpassing entropy from cosmic microwave background radiation around z~12. The study reveals that mergers play a dominant role in shaping the thermodynamic state of the early universe, especially if primordial black holes constitute a non-zero fraction of dark matter. Additionally, it is found that gravitational wave energy is less efficiently generated compared to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes. These findings enhance our understanding of the thermodynamic processes occurring in the early universe and the role of black holes in entropy generation.

Conclusion: This research highlights the critical role of black hole mergers in the early universe's entropy budget, providing new constraints on the abundance and role of primordial black holes in dark matter. The findings also emphasize the thermodynamic asymmetry in black hole mergers, where gravitational wave energy generation is less efficient compared to entropy production via the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. These results contribute to refining theoretical models of the universe's thermodynamic evolution and the role of black holes within it.

Abstract: Black holes contain more entropy than any other component of the observable universe. Gravitational-wave observations from LIGO and Virgo have shown evidence of a previously unknown black hole mass range, which provides new information to update the entropy budget. Increases in entropy due to binary black hole mergers, as implied in the second law of thermodynamics, should also be added to the budget. In this study, we update the cosmological entropy budget for black holes in the stellar to lite-intermediate-mass range $(5-300~M_\odot)$, originating from either supernovae or binary mergers, by utilizing a suite of population synthesis models and phenomenological fits derived from numerical relativity. We report three new insights: Firstly, the cumulative entropy from merging black holes surpasses the total entropy from cosmic microwave background photons around the onset of the Over-massive Black Hole Galaxy phase at $z\sim 12$, suggesting that mergers played a more significant role in shaping the thermodynamic state of the early universe than relic radiation. Secondly, if primordial black holes constitute a nonzero fraction of dark matter, their early binary mergers establish an ``entropy floor" in the Dark Ages and can dominate the cumulative merger-generated entropy history even for small abundances. Thirdly, by computing the cosmological density parameters, we highlight the thermodynamic asymmetry in black hole mergers, where the production of gravitational-wave energy is inefficient compared to the immense generation of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

Conclusion: 该研究通过观测数据（LIGO/Virgo 超级望远镜）束缚了 EUP 参数范围，验证了广义扩展不确定性原理在黑洞研究中的有效性。

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenological implications of quantum gravity on rotating black holes within the framework of the Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (GEUP), which incorporates both minimal length (ultraviolet) and large-scale (infrared) corrections. Lacking a full non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity, we adopt a metric-based approach. We construct a stationary, axisymmetric ansatz via the Newman-Janis algorithm to model the kinematic features of a rotating black hole subject to Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (GEUP) corrections. The thermodynamic analysis reveals that in the infrared-dominated regime, the Hawking temperature scales as $T_H \sim M^{-3}$, leading to a rapid cooling phase that significantly prolongs the lifetime of supermassive black holes. We derive the modified Teukolsky Master Equation for gravitational perturbations and demonstrate that the background geometry preserves the isospectrality between axial and polar modes. In the eikonal limit, the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum exhibits orthogonal shifts: the minimal length parameter $β$ induces a spectral blueshift and enhanced damping, while the large-scale parameter $α$ induces a spectral redshift and suppressed damping. Finally, we constrain the theory using observational data from LIGO/Virgo and the Event Horizon Telescope. We establish that the shadow of M87* is approximately $10^6$ times more sensitive to large-scale corrections than Sgr A*, placing stringent bounds on the EUP parameter, while gravitational wave spectroscopy provides complementary constraints on the GUP sector.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for Bayesian inference when the likelihood is analytically intractable or computationally prohibitive. By leveraging machine-learning techniques and neural density estimators, it enables flexible likelihood or posterior modeling directly from simulations. We introduce Residual Neural Likelihood Estimation (RNLE), a modification of Neural Likelihood Estimation (NLE) that learns the likelihood of non-Gaussian noise in gravitational-wave detector data. Exploiting the additive structure of the signal and noise generation processes, RNLE directly models the noise distribution, substantially reducing the number of simulations required for accurate parameter estimation and improving robustness to realistic noise artifacts. The performance of RNLE is demonstrated using a toy model, simulated gravitational-wave signals, and real detector noise from ground based interferometers. Even in the presence of loud non-Gaussian transients, glitches, we show that RNLE can achieve reliable parameter recovery when trained on appropriately constructed datasets. We further assess the stability of the method by quantifying the variability introduced by retraining the conditional density estimator on statistically identical datasets with different optimization seeds, referred to as training noise. This variability can be mitigated through an ensemble approach that combines multiple RNLE models using evidence-based weighting. An implementation of RNLE is publicly available in the sbilby package, enabling its deployment within gravitational-wave astronomy and a broad range of scientific applications requiring flexible, simulation-based likelihood estimation.

Abstract: We consider corrections to the Bekenstein Hawking Area Formula for black hole entropy, which have inverse powers of the horizon area for very large horizon areas, for classical spherically symmetric black hole solutions of F(R) modified gravity theory, using the Wald formula for the entropy function with modifications suggested by Jacobson, Kang and Myers. Requiring that the coefficient of such corrections be absolutely consistent with gravitational wave observational results validating the Hawking Area Theorem for binary black hole coalescences, implies constraints on parameters of F(R) gravity. For the sake of comparison, we present a computation of inverse area corrections for quantum black holes in quantum general relativity, using the It from Bit approach of Wheeler modified by some tenets of Loop Quantum Gravity.

Abstract: This paper studies the effect of extra dimensions on the arrow of time within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. We demonstrate that the observed irreversibility of physical processes can be explained by the monotonic growth of the extra-dimensional space. Unlike traditional cosmological approaches, our model does not link the arrow of time to the entropy of matter or radiation; rather, it identifies it with the Bekenstein-Hawking-Wald entropy of the geometric background. We establish a formal relation between the volume of the multidimensional manifold and the statistical weights of its geometric states. This leads to a fundamental relationship where the flow of time is intrinsically linked to the growth of multidimensional entropy.
  A key consequence of our framework is that the arrow of time remains a persistent feature for a 4D observer situated on a brane, even in the complete absence of matter or radiation. This directionality is driven by the dominant entropy production in the higher-dimensional bulk, which dominates local statistical fluctuations and ensures a stable causal direction.

Conclusion: 提出了一种通过解析解和非相对论极限下洛伦兹 boost 来建模随时间和空间变化的3维 peculiar 速度场的方法，并通过 CMB 数据验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Peculiar velocities are analyzed through cosmological perturbations in the Newtonian longitudinal gauge characterized by irrotational shear-free congruences in an Eulerian frame. We show that non-trivial peculiar velocity fields can be generated through Lorentzian boosts in the non-relativistic limit, where the Eulerian frame is obtained from analytic solutions of Einstein's equations sourced by an irrotational shear-free fluid with nonzero energy flux. This approach provides a physically viable interpretation of these analytic solutions, which (in general) admit no isometries, thus allowing, in principle, for modeling time and space varying 3-dimensional fields of peculiar velocities that can be contrasted with observational data on our local cosmography. As a ``proof of concept'' we examine the peculiar velocities of varying dark matter and dark energy perfect fluids with respect to the CMB frame using a simple, spherically symmetric particular solution. The resulting peculiar velocities are qualitatively compatible with observational data on the CMB dipole.

Abstract: We explore the space of non-gravitational, maximally supersymmetric, planar 4d effective field theories (EFTs) that have $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) at leading order. We show that in the weakly-coupled regime, highly non-trivial nonlinear constraints on the 4-point Wilson coefficients follow from enforcing $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetry and $SU(4)$ R-symmetry together with the requirement of standard tree-level factorization on the massless poles of the 4-, 5-, and 6-point EFT scattering amplitudes. Additionally, when these novel constraints are combined with positivity, the resulting bounds on the 4-point Wilson coefficients converge to the values of the open string Veneziano amplitude. Our results strongly suggest that supersymmetry, R-symmetry, and positivity are sufficient to single out this unique UV completion at tree level. Our findings, moreover, highlight the power of higher-point amplitudes in constraining EFT data and imply that the space of consistent quantum field theories is even more restricted than previously suggested by causality or swampland-based approaches.

Abstract: The problem of solving non-linear equations would be considerably simplified by a possibility to convert known solutions into the new ones. This could seem an element of art, but in the context of ADHM-like equations describing quiver varieties there is a systematic approach. In this note we study moduli spaces and dualities of quiver gauge theories associated to effective dynamics of D-branes compactified on Calabi-Yau resolutions. We concentrate on a subfamily of quivers $\mathfrak{Q}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ covering Dynkin diagrams for simple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$, where the respective BPS algebra is expected to be the Yangian algebra $Y(\mathfrak{g})$. For Yangians labeled by quivers their representations are described by solutions of ADHM-like equations. As quivers substitute Dynkin diagrams a generalization of the Weyl group $\mathcal{W}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ acts on the ADHM solutions. Here we work with the case $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ and treat this group as a group of electro-magnetic Seiberg-like dualities (we call them Weyl mutations) on the respective quiver gauge theories. We lift it to the case of higher representations associated to rectangular Young diagrams. An action of Weyl mutations on the BPS Yangian algebra is also discussed.

Abstract: The action of tensionless spinning string invariant under reparametrizions, both local supersymmetry and dilatations, is considered. The density of energy-momentum tensor is constructed and vanishing of its covariant divergence is proved. This result arises from mutual cancellation of the bosonic and fermionic contributions. Differences in the geometry of worldsheets swept by tensionless and tensionfull spinning strings are analyzed. Shown is emergence of covariant trace of a torsion tensor on w-s of the tensionless spinning string. It is derived from the condition for the fermionic scalar density to be a composite one including the 2-dim. w-s density simulating the 4-dim. Rarita-Schwinger field. The said condition is accompanied with the Noether condition for covariant divergence of the vector metric density to vanish.

Abstract: We identify a minimal superspace projector that uniquely selects the Rarita Schwinger mass bilinear in four-dimensional N=1 supergravity. Working in a reduced superspace with a single fermionic direction, we show that Berezin projection of a canonical even supergeometric form isolates the unique Lorentz-invariant fermionic bilinear compatible with local supersymmetry. The construction is predynamical: it fixes the algebraic structure of the gravitino mass term independently of supersymmetry breaking mechanisms, background geometry, or matter couplings. We show that this projector embeds consistently into curved superspace, extends to N>1 theories, and clarifies the universality of the gravitino mass structure in supergravity.

Abstract: Using instanton partition function for five dimensional $U(1)$ gauge theory with eight supercharges and a single adjoint massive hypermultiplet on the $Ω$ background, we give explicit expression for non-perturbative corrections to the topological string theory in the holomorphic limit. It was argued that in this case the theory is compactified on the twisted affine line bundle over $\mathbb{C}\times T^2$. We perform calculations in two ways. First we modify the integration contour by adding poles responsible for non-perturbative physics in accordance with a recent proposal. Then, we compute the genus zero Gopakumar-Vafa invariants for our case and evaluate the non-perturbative corrections to the partition function. We check that both calculations give the same result.

Abstract: For a quantum field of arbitrary mass and spin in the static patch of de Sitter spacetime, the Euclidean partition function receives contributions from edge modes localized on the horizon, expressible in terms of the Harish-Chandra character of the de Sitter group. Considering the flat limit and summing over all string fields, we obtain the partition function of edge modes in string theory near the Minkowski-Rindler horizon. Application of the Kronecker limit formula naturally yields a modular invariant one-loop partition function. The resulting expression generalizes the edge contribution of a massive vector boson in a spontaneously broken gauge theory to the infinite tower in string theory. It is naturally ultraviolet finite and amenable to a state-counting interpretation.

Abstract: We study the isentropic processes in a class of Anti de Sitter black holes coupled to non-linear electrodynamics. We demonstrate that such processes are classically forbidden but can proceed via quantum mechanical tunnelling. We compute the Euclidean action associated with the tunnelling process and analyze its dependence on the black hole charge, horizon radius, and the non-linear electrodynamics parameters characterizing each model. We find that the tunnelling probability is increasingly suppressed as the strength of the non-linearity is enhanced. We further find that smaller black holes exhibit a significantly higher tunnelling probability compared to larger ones, indicating a departure from classical behaviour. We conjecture that this behaviour may be universal across a broad class of black hole spacetimes. We discuss the implications of our results for entropy bounds and their potential relevance to the black hole information loss paradox.

Abstract: Discrete finite-group global symmetries may suffer from nonperturbative 't-Hooft anomalies. Such global anomalies can be canceled by anomalous symmetry-preserving topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which contain no local point operators but only extended excitations such as line and surface operators. In this work, we study mixed gauge-gravitational nonperturbative global anomalies of Weyl fermions (or Weyl semimetals in condensed matter) charged under discrete Abelian internal symmetries in four-dimensional spacetime, with spacetime-internal fermionic symmetry $G=$Spin$\times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}}\mathbb{Z}_{2m}^{\rm F}$ or Spin$\times\mathbb{Z}_n$ that contains fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\rm F}$. We determine the minimal finite gauge group $K$ of anomalous $G$-symmetric TQFTs that can match the fermionic anomaly via the symmetry-extension construction $1 \to K \to G_{\rm Tot} \to G \to 1$, where the anomaly in $G$ is trivialized upon pullback to $G_{\rm Tot}$, computed by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta invariant. This allows one to replace a $G$-symmetric four-dimensional Weyl fermion by an anomalous $G$-symmetric discrete-$K$-gauge TQFT as an alternative low-energy theory in the same deformation class. As an application, we show that the four-dimensional Standard Model with 15 Weyl fermions per family, in the absence of a sterile right-handed neutrino $ν_R$, exhibits mixed gauge-gravitational global anomalies between baryon and lepton number symmetries $({\bf B \pm L})$ and spacetime diffeomorphisms. We identify the corresponding minimal $K$-gauge fermionic TQFT that cancels these anomalies and can be interpreted as a gapped, topologically ordered dark sector replacing missing Weyl fermions via symmetry extension, without invoking conventional Anderson-Higgs symmetry breaking.

Abstract: This study investigates the elastic response of a two-dimensional semi-infinite medium subjected to a moving surface load with a prescribed displacement profile. As a fundamental step, we derive analytical Green's functions for the displacement and stress fields generated by a point load traveling at a constant velocity along the surface, explicitly incorporating elastodynamic effects through Mach number dependence. These moving-load solutions serve as building blocks for constructing more general loading scenarios via linear superposition. Based on Green's functions, an inverse problem is formulated to reconstruct the unknown surface traction responsible for a given surface displacement. The inverse analysis is performed through a Fourier-domain inversion with regularization, which enables a direct and computationally efficient determination of the contact pressure without iterative forward simulations. This framework is applied to a rigid wheel-ground contact problem, where the imposed displacement is dictated by the wheel geometry. The reconstructed surface traction exhibits a smooth, symmetric distribution within the contact region, while the resulting subsurface stress fields are obtained in closed analytical form and involve dilogarithm functions. The principal stress difference reveals characteristic spatial patterns similar to photoelastic fringes, and their asymmetry increases with the Mach number, reflecting the dynamic nature of the moving contact.

TL;DR:  paper discusses ytterbium atom transitions for new physics searches, reports measurements of inner-shell transitions, and a precise frequency ratio determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Understanding and measuring light emission from ytterbium atoms, especially transitions involving inner-shell electrons, could advance searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. This paper presents high-precision measurements of the 431 nm transition, determining its linewidth to be 4.3 Hz, with relative error of approximately 5.6e-15 compared to the 578 nm transition. The reduced differential static polarizability of the 431 nm transition suggests better sensitivity to potential new physics effects due to lower blackbody radiation sensitivity.

Method:  The authors used lattice-trapped 174Yb atoms to observe the 431 nm transition. They employed highly resolving spectrometry techniques and performed frequency ratio measurements between the 431 nm and 578 nm transitions, achieving an uncertainty of 9E-15. The determination of the 431 nm transition frequency was made with a relative error of approximately 6.3e-10, and the relative error of the differential static polarizability was found to be ~1e-7.

Result: The paper reports the observation of high-quality 431 nm transition spectra with a linewidth of 4.3 Hz, the precise determination of the differential static polarizability (-2.10(4) kHz/(kV/cm)^2) for the 431 nm transition, and the measurement of a frequency ratio between the 431 nm and 578 nm transitions with an uncertainty of 9E-15. The relative error in the 431 nm transition frequency determination is approximately 6.3e-10, making it one of the most precise such measurements to date.

Conclusion: This work provides a significant advance in the use of atomic clocks based on ytterbium transitions for fundamental physics searches. The high resolution and precision achieved in these measurements offer new tools for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model by minimizing systematic uncertainties such as blackbody radiation effects through the comparison of transitions with differing polarizabilities.

Abstract: Additional clock transitions of ytterbium atoms based on inner-shell orbital transition could benefit the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Observation of these transitions with high resolution is a prerequisite for making precise frequency measurements. Here, we observe 4.3 Hz-linewidth spectra of the inner-shell orbital transition at 431 nm in lattice-trapped 174Yb. With high-resolution spectra, we precisely determine the differential static polarizability of the transition to be -2.10(4) kHz/(kV/cm)^2. The magnitude of this polarizability is approximately 1/17 of that of the well-known clock transition in 171Yb at 578 nm, indicating a reduced sensitivity to blackbody radiation. We carry out a frequency ratio measurement between the two clock transitions of ytterbium atoms with an uncertainty of 9E-15. The frequency of the 431 nm transition is determined to be 695 175 030 801 776.5(6.3) Hz. These results represent a step forward in future studies on the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Abstract: Biological matrices are rich in information related to life processes, serving as invaluable media for assessing an individual's overall physiological status and its dynamic fluctuations, as well as crucial foundations for disease diagnosis. However, the inherent complexity of these matrices, coupled with our incomplete understanding of their full composition, presents significant challenges for comprehensive analysis and accurate diagnostic interpretation. The advent of single-molecule technologies has revolutionized biomedical research, enabling the direct observation of life processes at the molecular scale. We have proposed an Intelligent Nano-Fingerprinting strategy based on single-molecule nanopore technology, designed to capture the global molecular fingerprints of complex plasma matrices. Furthermore, we developed an intelligent algorithmic model capable of achieving precise classification of plasma samples. This approach is characterized by its simplicity, efficiency, and considerable potential for large-scale adoption and transferable applications.

### [82] [Supercontraction-Induced Twist in Spider Silk Is a Dual Poynting Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13924)
*V. Fazio,G. Puglisi,G. Saccomandi*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the mechanism behind the torsional actuation in spider silk supercontracts caused by humidity changes, specifically the superconducting silk (spider dragline silk) under varying humidity conditions. The study reveals that humidity-induced shortening of the amorphous matrix in the silk matrix, combined with mechanically constrained fibers, leads to a dual Poynting effect, resulting in torsional actuation. The model developed in the paper successfully reproduces experimental measurements and provides a minimal, physically grounded framework for understanding humidity-driven torsional actuation in matrix-fiber systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the physical mechanisms behind the torsional actuation in spider silk is important for gaining insights into natural silk fibers and potential applications in bio-inspired materials and actuators. This paper specifically focuses on how humidity changes affect the behavior of spider silk supercontracts, which are known for their exceptional tensile strength and elongation.

Method: The researchers conducted experiments measuring the torsional response of spider silk supercontracts under varying humidity conditions. They developed a comprehensive physical model to explain the observed torsional behavior, incorporating factors such as matrix anisotropic elasticity, water uptake diffusion, and irreversible matrix remodeling.

Result: The study successfully demonstrates that the torsional actuation in spider silk supercontracts is primarily driven by a dual Poynting effect. This effect arises due to humidity-induced matrix shortening and the constraints imposed by the mechanically rigid and axially aligned β-sheet-rich fibers. The model predicts the quantitative torsional measurements observed experimentally, and the parameter values used are consistent with existing experimental material parameters.

Conclusion: This study provides a novel explanation for the torsional actuation in spider silk supercontracts, highlighting the dual Poynting effect as a key mechanism. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of silk mechanics and open up potential applications in bio-inspired materials, particularly in the development of actuators and materials with tunable mechanical properties based on environmental conditions.

Abstract: Spider dragline silk supercontracts as humidity increases, displaying large axial shortening together with a reproducible macroscopic twist. The physical origin of this torsion remains debated and is often attributed to helically arranged load-bearing elements, despite the lack of direct evidence for helicity in the native fiber. Here we show that torsion can arise generically from nonlinear anisotropic elasticity: humidity-driven shortening of the amorphous matrix, mechanically constrained by stiff, axially aligned $β$-sheet--rich load-bearing segments and their experimentally induced prestretch, drives the system into a dual Poynting regime in which axial shortening couples to spontaneous twist. Coupling a diffusion-based water-uptake law to irreversible matrix remodeling and fiber plasticity, the model quantitatively reproduces monotonic and cyclic torsional measurements using parameter values consistent with available experimental material parameters. These results identify supercontraction-induced torsion in spider silk as a manifestation of a dual Poynting effect and provide a minimal, physically grounded framework for humidity-driven torsional actuation in matrix--fiber architectures.

Abstract: The current study reports the design of advanced light-weight materials for high-energy accelerator beampipe applications. The objective is to optimize the combined requirements of high radiation length and stiffness properties of the designed materials. The present study targets conventional beampipe materials such as aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel as primary performance benchmarks. These conventional beampipes are used at synchrotron radiation sources, such as Indus-1 and Indus-2 in India, the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider Facility in Russia, and the ring synchrotron facility SIS 100/300 at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Germany. In this context, a series of ternary Mg--Al--Li alloys is systematically investigated to enhance the figure of merit. Two aluminum--rich alloys, A1 ($\mathrm{Al_{61.5}Li_{10.8}Mg_{27.7}}$) and A2 ($\mathrm{Al_{66}Li_{19.4}Mg_{14.6}}$), along with three magnesium-rich alloys, M1 ($\mathrm{Al_{23.9}Li_{29.3}Mg_{46.8}}$), M2 ($\mathrm{Al_{19}Li_{20.6}Mg_{60.4}}$), and M3 ($\mathrm{Al_{39.8}Li_{20.1}Mg_{40.1}}$) are explored. Thermodynamic stability, density, liquidus temperature, and phases are evaluated using Latin hypercube sampling within the Thermo-Calc TC-Python framework. Elastic properties are obtained from density functional theory calculations performed using the Vienna \textit{Ab Initio} Simulation Package. Our results show that, although the elastic moduli ($E$) of the investigated Mg-Al-Li alloys are comparable to those of conventional beampipe materials, their significantly higher radiation lengths ($X_0$) lead to an overall improvement in the figure of merit $X_0 E^{1/3}$.

Abstract: The rarely used Hamilton-Jacobi equation has been utilized as an elegant way to find the trajectories of mechanical systems and to derive symplectic maps. Further, the exact solution in kick approximation of Hamilton's equations of motion in interaction representation is written as a generalized one-turn twist map.
  One can imagine that the nonlinear kick comes first, followed by the one-period rotation along the machine circumference, or a second alternative in which the one-period rotation occurs before the kick. There is a difference in the result of solving Hamilton's equations between the two cases, which is expressed in obtaining a standard forward twist map in the first case, or alternatively a backward map in the second one. This nontrivial and intuitively unclear peculiarity is usually ignored/overlooked in practically all specialized references on the topic.
  Finally, the statistical properties and the behavior of the density distribution of a particle beam in configuration space under the influence of an isolated sextupole have been studied.

Abstract: Multi-turn charge-exchange injection is the primary method of creating high-intensity hadron beams in circular accelerators, and phase space painting during injection enables tailoring of the accumulated phase space distribution. A technique we call eigenpainting allows injection of particles into a single mode of a coupled ring, providing full four-dimensional control of the phase space distribution. Under ideal conditions, uniform eigenpainting generates a linear-force equilibrium distribution in the transverse plane, with zero volume in four-dimensional transverse phase space, even including space charge. We have implemented eigenpainting for the first time in the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Accumulator Ring. Injecting 8.8 $μ$C of 800 MeV beam, we obtain a final ratio of intrinsic transverse emittances of $\approx$2.4. We analyze the effect of space charge on the final distribution through comparison of the reconstructed phase space to particle-in-cell simulations.

Abstract: The discovery of nickelate superconductors has opened a new arena for studying the behavior of correlated electron liquids that give rise to unconventional superconductivity. While critical information about a material's charge dynamics is encoded in its plasmons, collective modes of the electron gas, these excitations have not yet been observed in nickelate materials. Here, we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to detect plasmons in the metallic, low-valence nickelate Pr4Ni3O8. Although qualitatively similar to those in cuprates, the nickelate plasmons are more heavily damped and have a lower velocity than those in a cuprate at comparable doping, which we attribute to reduced electronic hopping and enhanced screening of the long-range Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, the plasmons in Pr4Ni3O8 soften with increasing temperature, in contrast to the cuprate, where plasmons remain at nearly fixed energy but become more strongly damped. Taken together, these results reveal a distinct charge-screening landscape in nickelates and place quantitative constraints on analogies to cuprates.

*Chandra M. Varma*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Berry curvature's effects are seen in fermions with closed momentum paths, such as around impurities, leading to persistent phase coherence over macroscopic lengths in a quasi-2D metal with chiral boundaries and a magnetic field inducing loop-current order with long coherence lengths despite short mean-free paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the role of Berry curvature in maintaining phase coherence in metals, particularly in topological or quasi-topological states, and relates this to experimental observations of flux quantization and loop-current order.

Method: The authors employ theoretical analysis, likely involving tight-binding models or quantum transport theory, focusing on Berry curvature in momentum space and its effects on boundary currents and phase coherence. They solve for the relevant length scales and scattering processes using methods common in condensed matter theory, such as Green's functions or scattering theory.

Result: Analytical calculations show that the Berry curvature in a quasi-2D metal leads to long coherence lengths for chiral currents at its domain boundaries, compatible with experimental findings of loop-current order and flux quantization over several microns in a material with a surprisingly short mean-free path (0.01 microns).

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges theory and experiment, providing a coherent framework for understanding how Berry curvature contributes to macroscopic quantum effects like flux quantization in a system with short mean-free path through the creation of chiral boundary states induced by a magnetic field.

Abstract: Berry curvature does not show itself in the relative phase correlation of wave-functions at different spatial points in a metal unless the fermions have closed trajectories in momentum space, for example those around isolated impurities. But these, just as the Bloch phase correlations, disappear at lengths larger than the diffusion length. If a quasi-two dimensional metal with Berry curvature has a set of domains, their boundaries necessarily carry chiral currents precluding back-ward scattering. The Berry induced phase coherence then persists over length scales of order the scale at which the chiral one-dimensional states scatter into the bulk states, which can be macroscopic. The conditions for their occurrence and the lengths and the orientation of such states are derived. These calculations are used to understand the remarkable aspects of a recent experiment in an anisotropic metal, reported to have loop-current order, with mean-free path of about 0.01 $μ$m which exhibits flux quantization in some transport properties over lengths of several $μ$m. %It is also shown that generating the appropriately oriented channels in the plane by the field applied is plausible.

Abstract: Entanglement entropy (EE) is a fundamental probe of quantum phases and critical phenomena, which was thought to reflect only bulk universality for a long time. Very recently, people realized that the microscopic geometry of the entanglement cut can induce distinct entanglement-edge modes, whose coupling to bulk critical fluctuations may alter the scaling of the EE. However, this perception is very qualitative and lacks quantitative consideration. Here, we investigate this problem through high-precision quantum Monte Carlo simulations combined with the analysis of scaling theory to build a quantitative understanding. By considering three distinct bipartitions corresponding to three surface criticality types, we reveal a striking dependence of the constant term γ on the microscopic cut at the quantum critical point. Notably, cuts that generate extra gapless edge modes yield a sign reversal in γ compared to those producing gapped edges. We explain this behavior via a modified scaling form that incorporates contributions from both bulk and surface critical modes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the derivative of EE robustly extracts the bulk critical point and exponent ν regardless of the cut geometry, providing a reliable diagnostic of bulk universality in the presence of strong surface effects. Our work for the first time establishes a direct quantitative connection between surface criticality and entanglement scaling, challenging the conventional view that EE solely reflects bulk properties and offering a refined framework for interpreting entanglement in systems with boundary-sensitive criticality.

Abstract: We develop a self-consistent first-principles framework for determining the screened Coulomb interaction strength (U) based on constrained dynamical mean-field theory (cDMFT). Unlike conventional approaches, this method incorporates essential vertex corrections within the same embedded-DMFT formalism used for the electronic structure calculation. Using the cDMFT-derived interaction strengths as input to embedded DMFT yields spectral functions in excellent agreement with photoemission experiments across a wide range of materials, spanning 3d to 5d transition-metal compounds, including correlated metals, Mott insulators, altermagnets, and unconventional superconductors. This unified many-body framework establishes a systematic first-principles route for determining interaction strengths in correlated materials and substantially enhances the predictive power of DFT+DMFT and its extensions.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent progress in the moiré superlattice systems and spin-1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnets, we revisit the triangular-lattice spin liquids and study their magnetic responses. While the magnetic responses on the ordered phases can be mundane, the orbital magnetic flux and the Zeeman coupling have synergetic effects on the internal gauge flux generations in the relevant spin liquid phases. The former was known to induce an internal U(1) gauge flux indirectly through the charge fluctuations and ring exchange, and thus could lead to the formation of a chiral spin liquid. The latter could spontaneously generate a uniform field-dependent internal gauge flux, driving a conically-ordered state. The competition and interplay between these two field effects are discussed through a generic spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_χ$ model and with the experimental consequences. Our results could find applications in the moiré superlattice systems with the Hofstadter-Hubbard model as well as the triangular lattice antiferromagnets.

Abstract: Mapping spins to fermions via the Jordan-Wigner (JW) transformation can render mean-field (Hartree-Fock, HF) descriptions effective for strongly correlated spin systems. As established in recent work, the application of such approaches is not limited by the nonlocal structure of JW strings or by site ordering, because string operators can be absorbed into Thouless rotations of a Slater determinant, and the variational optimization of a unitary Lie-Algebraic similarity transformation removes any ordering dependence. Leveraging these ideas, we develop a self-consistent field (SCF) scheme that expresses the mean-field energy as a functional of the single-particle density matrix, providing an alternative to gradient-based optimization of Thouless parameters. We derive the analytic orbital Hessian to diagnose HF stability and compute ground-state correlation energy through the random-phase approximation (RPA). Benchmark results for the XXZ and J1-J2 model on one- and two-dimensional lattices demonstrate that RPA significantly improves mean-field accuracy.

Abstract: Understanding unconventional superconductivity (SC) driven by strong electronic correlations is a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In this work, we employ sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to systematically investigate a bilayer fermionic model featuring strong interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange and on-site repulsive Hubbard interactions. This system serves as a prototypical model for realizing a symmetric mass generation (SMG) insulator. Our numerically exact results unambiguously demonstrate that robust superconducting pairing emerges upon doping the SMG phase. Remarkably, we find that the SC order is significantly enhanced by the repulsive Hubbard interaction. Given its potential relevance to the essential features of the high-$T_c$ superconductor $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ under pressure, our study establishes a new paradigm for superconductivity arising from a doped SMG parent state and provides key theoretical guidance for future experimental investigations.

Abstract: We use determinant quantum Monte Carlo to study the half-filled `bond-Holstein' model on a square lattice. We find that the model exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) phase transition with a critical temperature $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ considerably higher than that of the canonical `site-Holstein' model. Using a finite-size scaling analysis of the charge structure factor $S_{\rm cdw}$, we obtain $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ to greater than one percent accuracy. At the same time, local observables also show clear signatures consistent with the transition temperatures inferred from our scaling analysis. We attribute the enhanced CDW tendencies to a phonon-mediated nearest-neighbor electron repulsion that is directly proportional to the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $λ$ in the atomic ($t\rightarrow 0$) limit. This behavior contrasts with the site-Holstein case, where the same limit yields only an on-site attraction. We supplement our analysis with results from several unsupervised machine learning methods, which not only confirm our estimates of $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ but also provide insight into the high-temperature crossover between a metallic and bipolaron liquid regime.

Abstract: Correlated materials with competing spin-orbit and crystal-field interactions can host composite spin-orbital magnons that are highly susceptible to structural and electronic perturbations, enabling control of magnetic dynamics beyond spin-only physics. Using Raman spectroscopy on Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, we show that the partial substitution of Ru by Mn reconstructs the magnon spectrum and leads to one-magnon modes that are hidden in the undoped state. We demonstrate that the transition-metal substitution activates otherwise symmetry-forbidden magnon modes through mirror-symmetry breaking of the underlying spin-orbital configuration. This effect can be theoretically explained by the local structural distortions induced in the RuO$_6$ octahedra near the dopant, that enable the observation of mixed-parity one-magnon modes. The uncovered mechanism demonstrates how spin-orbit-lattice entanglement can be exploited to control collective magnetic excitations in spin-orbit correlated materials.

Abstract: We study the Lanczos coefficients in a quadratic model given by an impurity interacting with a multi-mode field of fermions, also known as single impurity Anderson model. We analytically derive closed expressions for the Lanczos coefficients of Majorana fermion operators of the impurity for different structures of the coupling to the hybridisation band at zero temperature. While the model remains quadratic, we find that the growth of the Lanczos coefficients structurally depends strongly on the chosen coupling. Concretely, we find $(i)$ approximately constant, $(ii)$ exactly constant, $(iii)$ square root-like as well $(iv)$ linear growth in the same model. We further argue that in fact through suitably chosen couplings, essentially arbitrary Lanczos coefficients can be obtained in this model. These altogether evince the inadequacy of the Lanczos coefficients as a reliable criterion for classifying the integrability or chaoticity of the systems. Eventually, in the wide-band limit, we find exponential decay of autocorrelation functions in all the settings $(i)-(iv)$, which demonstrates the different structures of the Lanczos coefficients not being indicative of different physical behavior.

TL;DR: We introduce two-point stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) and its mutual counterpart to detect magic in quantum fermionic systems, demonstrating their effectiveness in characterizing quantum phase transitions and detecting topological order in the fractional quantum Hall regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding non-stabilizerness in interacting fermionic systems is crucial for quantum resource theories and topological order detection. However, extracting high-order correlations from quantum Monte Carlo simulations is challenging. We aim to develop new probes to identify and quantify magic in such systems.

Method: We define the two-point stabilizer Rényi entropy and its mutual counterpart as new metrics. We derive local estimators suitable for advanced numerical methods and apply them to the one-dimensional spinless t-V model and the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice using determinant quantum Monte Carlo. We also analyze the fractional quantum Hall regime to uncover spatial textures of magic in the Laughlin state.

Result: Our results show that these new metrics effectively characterize quantum phase transitions, such as the Luttinger liquid to charge density wave transition, and accurately capture critical exponents. They also reveal a non-trivial spatial texture of magic in the Laughlin state, indicating the presence of short-range exclusion correlations.

Conclusion: Two-point SRE provides a versatile and sensitive diagnostic tool for identifying and analyzing magic in interacting fermionic systems, bridging quantum resource theory, critical phenomena, and topological order.

Abstract: Quantifying non-stabilizerness (``magic'') in interacting fermionic systems remains a formidable challenge, particularly for extracting high order correlations from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In this Letter, we establish the two-point stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) and its mutual counterpart as robust, computationally accessible probes for detecting magic in diverse fermionic phases. By deriving local estimators suitable for advanced numerical methods, we demonstrate that these metrics effectively characterize quantum phase transitions: in the one-dimensional spinless $t$-$V$ model, they sharply identify the Luttinger liquid to charge density wave transition, while in the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice via determinant quantum Monte Carlo, they faithfully capture the critical exponents of the Gross-Neveu-Ising universality class. Furthermore, extending our analysis to the fractional quantum Hall regime, we unveil a non-trivial spatial texture of magic in the Laughlin state, revealing signatures of short-range exclusion correlations. Our results validate the two-point SRE as a versatile and sensitive diagnostic, forging a novel link between quantum resource theory, critical phenomena, and topological order in strongly correlated matter.

Abstract: We report magnetic susceptibility, isothermal magnetization, and specific-heat measurements on the rare-earth hexaaluminate SmMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$, where Sm$^{3+}$ realizes a strongly quenched Kramers doublet on a triangular lattice with an exceptionally weak net exchange scale. The Curie--Weiss analysis yields strongly reduced ground-doublet $g$ factors, $g_{ab}\simeq 0.65$ and $g_{c}\simeq 0.70$.
  This indicates that the low-temperature response is governed primarily by single-ion physics, with crystal-field splitting and $J$-multiplet mixing jointly renormalizing the Sm$^{3+}$ moment, rather than collective exchange. For $H \parallel c$, the specific heat shows no $λ$-type anomaly down to 0.35~K but evolves into a well-defined two-level Schottky peak whose gap grows linearly with field, yielding $g_c\simeq0.62$ and recovering nearly all of $R\ln2$ at high fields, thereby confirming an effective $S_{\mathrm{eff}}=\tfrac12$ Kramers doublet description for $T\lesssim10$~K.
  Together, these results establish SmMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ as a weak-exchange, nearly single-ion triangular Kramers magnet in which frustration produce an anisotropic low-field correlated regime without inducing long-range order.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of ferroelastic domain walls in SrTiO3 is driven by the potential to develop new insights into quantum fluctuations and electronic transport in correlated oxides.

Method: The paper reviews recent experimental findings on SrTiO3, analyzes the interplay between nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and strain fields, and proposes a new paradigm for studying electronic transport under local polar order.

Result: The emergence of polarity at ferroelastic domain walls, along with strain fields and quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations and memory effects in carrier transport.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive review of these phenomena, emphasizing the complexity of charge carrier dynamics in polar environments and their relevance to broader materials science.

Abstract: Strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$), famously described by Nobel laureate K. A. Müller as the "drosophila of solid-state physics", has been extensively investigated over the last seventy five years for its intricate coupling of structural, electronic, and dielectric properties and continues to serve as a foundational platform for advancing oxide electronics. In its pristine form, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits quantum paraelectric behavior below 35 K and undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition near 105 K. This transition generates ferroelastic twin domains separated by a dense network of domain walls, which function as nanoscale structural defects with far-reaching consequences. While the static influence of ferroelastic domain walls on carrier transport in electron-doped SrTiO$_3$ is well established, recent experimental results show that the emergence of polarity at these walls, combined with strain fields and inherent quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations of electrons and memory effects. In this review, we highlight these recent advances, focusing on the subtle interplay between the emergence of nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and long-range strain fields. We propose that understanding charge carrier dynamics in the background of these complex ferroelastic domain wall landscapes offers a new paradigm for exploring electronic transport in the presence of local polar order and quantum fluctuations, with broad implications for correlated oxides.

Abstract: In modern technology, the optical readout of magnetic information is conventionally achieved by the magneto-optical Kerr effect, i.e., the polarization rotation of reflected light. The Kerr rotation is sensitive to time-reversal symmetry breaking and generally proportional to magnetization, enabling optical readout of the up and down spin states in ferromagnets. By contrast, antiferromagnets with a collinear antiparallel spin arrangement have long been considered inactive to such magneto-optical responses, because of Tt-symmetry (time-reversal T followed by translation t symmetry) and lack of macroscopic magnetization. Here, we report the observation of giant magneto-optical Kerr effect in a room-temperature antiferromagnetic insulator alpha-Fe2O3. In this compound, the up-down and down-up spin states induce the opposite sign of spontaneous Kerr effect, whose Kerr rotation angle turned out to be exceptionally large (~ 80 mdeg, comparable to typical ferromagnets). Our first-principles calculations successfully reproduce both the absolute magnitude and spectral shape of the Kerr rotation and ellipticity with remarkable accuracy, which unambiguously proves that it originates from a Tt-symmetry-broken collinear antiferromagnetic order, rather than magnetization. This compound hosts temperature-dependent transition between easy-plane and easy-axis antiferromagnetic states, and their contrasting behaviors are also investigated in detail. The present results demonstrate that even a simple collinear antiferromagnetic order can induce a giant magneto-optical Kerr effect, and highlight Tt-symmetry-broken antiferromagnets as a promising material platform for highly sensitive optical detection of up-down and down-up spin states.

Abstract: For quantum spin models defined on a two-dimensional lattice, we look for the best numbering of the lattice sites (a layout) that, at fixed bond dimension and other parameters of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm, gives the lowest value of the variational energy, maximum entropy and truncation error. We consider the conjecture that the optimal layout is a Hamiltonian path, and that it optimizes a simply computable geometric cost function. Finding the minimum of such a function, which is a variant of the minimum linear arrangement problem, provides the DMRG with an efficient layout of the lattice and improves both accuracy and convergence time. We present applications to the antiferromagnetic and spin glass spin-1/2 models on the square and triangular lattices.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the deconfined quantum critical point in a Bose-Hubbard model on the kagome lattice using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Key findings include logarithmic correction coefficients for entanglement entropy and the U(1) disorder operator that align with a unitary CFT, and an enhanced central charge compared to the 3D O(2) Wilson-Fisher fixed point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of quantum phase transitions and critical phenomena, particularly in low-dimensional systems, provides insights into the behavior of quantum matter under varying parameters.

Method: Quantum Monte Carlo simulations are employed to study the entanglement entropy and U(1) disorder operator in the extended hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on the kagome lattice.

Result: The results show that the logarithmic correction coefficients are positive, consistent with a unitary conformal field theory, and the central charge is enhanced by a factor of approximately 4/3 relative to the conventional 3D O(2) Wilson-Fisher fixed point.

Conclusion: The findings provide evidence that the quantum phase transition at the DQCP is genuine, characterized by coexisting fractionalized excitations and modified critical properties, consistent with a recent observation of a low-energy excitation spectrum featuring two distinct linearly dispersing modes with a velocity ratio of approximately three.

Abstract: We investigate the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) candidate in the extended hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on the kagome lattice, employing quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study the entanglement entropy and the $U(1)$ disorder operator. In stark contrast to findings in $J$-$Q$ models and other candidates, the universal logarithmic correction coefficients for both quantities are found to be {positive}, consistent with a unitary conformal field theory (CFT). Crucially, the current central charge $C_J$, extracted from the small-angle behavior of the disorder operator, is enhanced by a factor of approximately {4/3} compared to that of the conventional 3D $O(2)$ Wilson-Fisher fixed point. This enhancement {implies} a consistent explanation in the recently observed low-energy excitation spectrum at this DQCP, which features {two distinct linearly dispersing modes} with a velocity ratio of approximately three. Our results provide evidence that this quantum phase transition constitutes a genuine DQCP, characterized by coexisting fractionalized excitations that collectively modify its critical properties.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Presented equations of motion for parity-violating fermionic mean-field theory (PV-FMFT) that efficiently models spin-1/2 Hamiltonians, including non-interacting and interacting cases, with emphasis on post-quench dynamics and applications to the Ising model in various geometries and field configurations. The method scales as $O(N^3)$ and can handle arbitrary initial states without relying on symmetries, though it has limitations in capturing certain behaviors like 2D correlation functions constrained by spin-to-fermion mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancements in quantum field theories and computational methods enable modeling complex fermionic systems. This paper addresses the challenge of parity-violating fermionic mean-field theory, offering a numerically efficient framework for studying dynamic properties of such systems, which is crucial for understanding fundamental physics and developing quantum technologies.

Method: The authors developed the equations of motion for PV-FMFT, building upon previous work in parity-preserving fermionic mean-field theory (PP-FMFT). They introduced parity-violating fermionic Gaussian states and extended the variational ansatz to include fermionic displacement operators, enabling application to general spin-1/2 Hamiltonians without relying on symmetries. The method is validated by exactly capturing the dynamics of non-interacting spin-1/2 systems and is computationally efficient with a scaling of $O(N^3)$. Simulations of the Ising model in 1D and 2D with longitudinal and transversal fields are used to benchmark the method against other numerical approaches.

Result: The study shows that PV-FMFT is capable of accurately modeling the real- and imaginary-time evolution of spin-1/2 systems. The method achieves significant computational efficiency, as it scales cubically with the number of spins or fermionic modes. Simulations reveal the dynamics of the Ising model in various configurations, including single-site magnetization and correlation functions. Notably, in 2D systems, the spin-to-fermion mapping introduces limitations by breaking rotational symmetry, which affects the accuracy of calculated correlation functions. However, the method outperforms existing state-of-the-art numerical techniques in capturing dynamic properties of the systems studied.

Conclusion: This work establishes parity-violating fermionic mean-field theory (PV-FMFT) as a powerful benchmark for studying the dynamics of spin-1/2 Hamiltonians. It provides a versatile and computationally efficient framework that can be applied to a wide range of systems, including those with arbitrary geometries and field configurations. While it excels in handling non-interacting and moderately interacting systems, its limitations in capturing certain 2D correlation functions highlight the need for further extensions and improvements of the method to address more complex scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce equations of motion for a parity-violating fermionic mean-field theory (PV-FMFT): a numerically efficient fermionic mean-field theory based on parity-violating fermionic Gaussian states (PV-FGS). This work provides explicit equations of motion for studying the real- and imaginary-time evolution of spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with arbitrary geometries and interactions. We extend previous formulations of parity-preserving fermionic mean-field theory (PP-FMFT) by including fermionic displacement operators in the variational Ansatz. Unlike PP-FMFT, PV-FMFT can be applied to general spin-1/2 Hamiltonians, describe quenches from arbitrary initial spin-1/2 product states, and compute local and non-local observables in a straight-forward manner at the same modest computational cost as PP-FMFT -- scaling as $O(N^3)$ in the worst case for a system of $N$ spins or fermionic modes. We demonstrate that PV-FMFT can exactly capture the imaginary- and real-time dynamics of non-interacting spin-1/2 Hamiltonians. We then study the post quench-dynamics of the one- and two-dimensional Ising model in presence of longitudinal and transversal fields with PV-FMFT and compute the single site magnetization and correlation functions, and compare them against results from other state-of-the-art numerical approaches. In two-dimensional spin systems, we show that the employed spin-to-fermion mapping can break rotational symmetry within the PV-FMFT description, and we discuss the resulting consequences for the calculated correlation functions. Our work introduces PV-FMFT as a benchmark for other numerical techniques and quantum simulators, and it outlines both its capabilities and its limitations.

Abstract: We present a method for performing a full graph expansion for light-matter systems, utilizing the linked-cluster theorem. This method enables us to explore $1/N$ corrections to the thermodynamic limit $N\to \infty$ in the number of particles, giving us access to the mesoscopic regime. While this regime is yet largely unexplored due to the challenges of studying it with established approaches, it incorporates intriguing features, such as entanglement between light and matter that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. As a representative application, we calculate physical quantities of the low-energy regime for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising chain in the paramagnetic normal phase by accompanying the graph expansion with both exact diagonalization (NLCE) and perturbation theory (\pcst), benchmarking our approach against other techniques. We investigate the ground-state energy density and photon density, showing a smooth transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic regime up to the thermodynamic limit. Around the quantum critical point, we extract the $1/N$ corrections to the ground-state energy density to obtain the critical point and critical exponent using extrapolation techniques.

Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of a doped one-dimensional excitonic insulator. Employing matrix-product-state-based methods, we compute the single-particle spectrum and optical conductivity in a correlated two-band model. Our numerical calculation reveals the emergence of a correlation-driven in-gap branch in the doped state. The origin of the in-gap branch is examined by decomposing the propagation dynamics of a single particle, elucidating that the doping-induced branch is associated with excitonic correlations. Our demonstrations suggest that the doping-induced branch can serve as an indicator of electron-hole correlations.

Abstract: Most fractional quantum Hall states have been traditionally identified within a single energy band, such as the lowest Landau level or topological flat band. As more particles are introduced, they inevitably populate higher energy bands. Whether the inclusion of multiple topological bands leads to new physics remains an open question. Here, we propose a universal picture applicable at higher filling factors $ν\geq 1$ in bosonic systems: the occupied bands tend to coalesce into an effective single topological band characterized by a total Chern number $\vert C\vert$, the sum of the Chern number of all occupied lower topological flat bands. Using a Kekulé lattice model with two lower flat bands featuring a total Chern number $C=1$, regardless of their specific configurations, we identify the emergence of a $\frac{1}{2}$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI) state at integer filling factor $ν=1$, followed by the Jain sequence states $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{3}{4}$ at filling $ν=\frac{4}{3}$ and $\frac{6}{4}$. That is a $ν+ν$ picture, rather than the generally expected $1+ν^{\prime}$ picture, where $ν^{\prime}$ is the permitted FCI filling factor in the single second topological flat band. Our findings deepen the understanding of FCI states and open avenues for discovering exotic fractional topological phases in multiband systems.

Considering only nearest-neighbor hoppings within the lattice, we show a phase transition from the nonmagnetic to a unique AM isolated band metal phase (AMIM), allowing clear identification of spin-split states. Additionally, the AM metallic phase (AMM) is also shown to appear as an intermediate phase during the transition from the normal metal to the AMIM in the presence of the diagonal hopping within each unit cell of the Lieb-$5$ lattice. The manifestation of distinct AM phases and the phase transitions, driven by Hubbard interaction and hopping integrals, have been explored in terms of spin-resolved band structure, spectral function, and the behavior of the AM order parameter. The stability of these AM phases against the spin-orbit coupling and temperature is also established.

Abstract: Integer and fractional Chern insulators exhibit a nonzero quantized anomalous Hall conductivity due to a spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry. To identify nontrivial topology in their time-reversal symmetric many-body spectra, we introduce many-body Euler numbers as a counterpart to many-body Chern numbers. Exemplarily, we perform calculations in a topological Hubbard model that can realize Chern and fractional Chern insulating phases. Furthermore, we lay out a classification scheme to realize different topological phases in interacting systems using symmetry indicators in analogy to topological band theory.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: AllShowers is a unified generative model for calorimeter shower simulations in collider experiments that uses a continuous normalizing flow model with a Transformer architecture to simulate showers across multiple particle types in a single model. It improves upon previous approaches by enabling scalability, reusability, and high fidelity across various particle types and conditions. The model's key innovations include layer embeddings, custom attention masking, and optimal transport mapping for training and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating accurate and efficient detector showers is crucial for modern collider experiments, and the increasing complexity of detectors and particle physics demands require more scalable and reusable simulation methods. Existing surrogate models have limitations in terms of scalability and applicability, which motivated the development of AllShowers to address these issues.

Method: AllShowers employs a continuous normalizing flow model with a Transformer architecture. It uses layer embeddings to learn all relevant calorimeter layer properties, a custom attention masking scheme to reduce computational demands and introduce inductive bias, and a shower- and layer-wise optimal transport mapping to improve training convergence and sample quality. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of simulated showers in the highly granular ILD detector.

Result: AllShowers successfully demonstrates the ability to generate realistic showers for electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons across a wide range of incident energies and angles without retraining. It outperforms previous single-particle-type models for hadronic showers in terms of fidelity. The model's unified approach for multiple particle types and scalability make it a significant advancement in the field of calorimeter shower simulations.

Conclusion: AllShowers marks a significant step towards developing a universal model for calorimeter shower simulations in collider experiments. Its innovative architecture and training methodology enable efficient and accurate shower simulations, which are essential for advancing our understanding and capabilities in high-energy physics experiments.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient detector simulation is essential for modern collider experiments. To reduce the high computational cost, various fast machine learning surrogate models have been proposed. Traditional surrogate models for calorimeter shower modeling train separate networks for each particle species, limiting scalability and reuse. We introduce AllShowers, a unified generative model that simulates calorimeter showers across multiple particle types using a single generative model. AllShowers is a continuous normalizing flow model with a Transformer architecture, enabling it to generate complex spatial and energy correlations in variable-length point cloud representations of showers. Trained on a diverse dataset of simulated showers in the highly granular ILD detector, the model demonstrates the ability to generate realistic showers for electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons across a wide range of incident energies and angles without retraining. In addition to unifying shower generation for multiple particle types, AllShowers surpasses the fidelity of previous single-particle-type models for hadronic showers. Key innovations include the use of a layer embedding, allowing the model to learn all relevant calorimeter layer properties; a custom attention masking scheme to reduce computational demands and introduce a helpful inductive bias; and a shower- and layer-wise optimal transport mapping to improve training convergence and sample quality. AllShowers marks a significant step towards a universal model for calorimeter shower simulations in collider experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dark matter detection requires extreme electrical performance in liquid argon-based detectors for WIMP searches. Ensuring reliable high-voltage systems is crucial for sensitivity.

Method: The study involved testing the DS-20k cathode HV system in liquid argon, simulating and measuring down to -100 kV using a dedicated test setup.

Result: The system's performance met expectations, showing stable operation at the tested voltage levels.

Conclusion: Validation of the DS-20k HV system enhances the detector's sensitivity for WIMP detection.

Abstract: DarkSide--20k (DS--20k) is a next--generation dual--phase liquid argon (LAr) time projection chamber (TPC) devoted to the direct--detection of dark matter. The detector is currently under construction in Hall--C at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy, at a depth of approximately 3500 m water equivalent. The detector will instrument 49.7~t of low--radioactivity underground LAr contained within an acrylic TPC and is designed to reach a WIMP--nucleon spin--independent cross--section sensitivity down to $10^{-48}\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for a WIMP mass of $0.1\,\mathrm{TeV}/c^{2}$ in a 200~tonne--year run. In DS--20k a uniform electric drift field is established in the active volume to transport ionization electrons toward the electroluminescence region, with the required high voltage delivered to the TPC cathode through a custom cable and stress--cone assembly. At the University of California, Davis, a dedicated test setup was developed to reproduce the DS--20k cathode high--voltage connection in LAr, matching the local electric--field conditions. This work summarizes the results of a comprehensive test campaign validating the operation of the DS--20k cathode HV system in LAr up to $-100$~kV.

Abstract: DEAP--3600 is a single--phase liquid argon (LAr) direct--detection dark matter experiment operating 2~km underground at SNOLAB (Sudbury, Canada). The detector consists of 3.3~tons of LAr contained in a spherical acrylic vessel. At a WIMP mass of 100~GeV, DEAP--3600 has a projected sensitivity of $10^{-46}\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for the spin--independent elastic scattering cross section of WIMPs. Radioactive sources have been used for the energy calibration and to test the detector performance.

The simultaneous emission of three $γ$'s by the source provides an excellent tagging for the $^{22}\mathrm{Na}$ decay. The results concerning the energy response of the detector and the agreement between data and Monte Carlo simulations in DEAP--3600 are investigated in this study.

TL;DR: The study proves that BIC-based models better match experiment data for neutron yields, while fine-tuning simulation parameters can enhance predictability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding underground phenomenon relying on accurate neutron modeling is essential, given neutrons are a crucial background source for experiments like neutrino oscillations and dark matter detection.

Method: Observed neutron counts from Daya Bay experiment, compared against GEANT4 simulations and BERT/BIC models following TALYS-based cross-section adjustments.

Result: BIC models show better consistency, yet simulations still under or over-predict single vs multiple neutron events.

Conclusion: Establish benchmarking framework for future RNG models with targeted refinement strategies towards accurate neutron yield simulations.

Abstract: Neutrons produced by cosmic ray muons constitute a significant background for underground experiments investigating neutron oscillations, neutrinoless double beta decay, dark matter, and other rare event signals. This work benchmarks measured neutron yields and neutron multiplicities--with a focus on data from the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment--against comprehensive simulations using three GEANT4 hadronic physics lists. These simulations are further refined via a TALYS-based adjustment of hadronic cross sections. For the BERT-based models, the adjustment reduces the discrepancy in the total neutron yield from about 20% to approximately 6%, while for the BIC-based models it improves the agreement from roughly 13% to the sub-percent level (~0.3%), indicating a markedly better consistency of the BIC-based models with the experimental data. Nevertheless, a clear tension persists: simulations systematically underproduce single-neutron events while overproducing multi-neutron events. The study establishes a reproducible benchmark for cosmogenic neutron modeling and proposes a targeted refinement strategy--including channel-specific reweighting and intranuclear cascade parameter tuning--to guide future model development.

TL;DR: The PandaX-xT uses R12699-406-M4 PMTs with optimized voltage-divider bases to achieve a broad dynamic range, from SPE sensitivity to 30nC charge. The design addresses saturation and suppression effects, supported by simulation and bench testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Major advancements in direct dark matter and neutrino physics require precise photon detection in the sub-keV to multi-MeV energy range. High-quality photon sensors optimized for such ranges are essential for accurate measurements and reducing background noise. The PandaX-xT experiment aims to address this need by developing robust PMTs tailored for extreme energy ranges, particularly crucial for neutrinoless double beta decay (NLDBD) studies. The motivation stems from the need for highly sensitive and reliable photon detection to validate beyond Standard Model physics hypotheses.

Method: The research focuses on the selection and characterization of Hamamatsu R12699-406-M4 PMTs for PandaX-xT. The study involves developing a voltage-divider base optimized for a broad dynamic range, covering both single-photoelectron (SPE) sensitivity and up to 30nC charge (matching the 2.5MeV Q-value of ^^136Xe NLDBD). Through a dedicated test bench, saturation and suppression responses of the PMTs are characterized. A circuit simulation model is created to reproduce the physical mechanisms behind these effects, with key parameters tuned based on experimental data. The combination of simulation and bench testing guides the base design and optimization for improved detector performance, enabling better handling of saturation and suppression effects in future data analysis.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that the optimized voltage-divider bases for the R12699-406-M4 PMTs achieve the desired broad dynamic range, with excellent performance in both low-energy (SPE) and high-energy photon detection. The simulation model accurately captures the saturation and suppression effects, validating the design approach. This development enhances the overall performance of PandaX-xT, ensuring reliable and precise photon detection in the challenging energy range. The outcomes support the experimental goals of the PandaX-xT collaboration and contribute to advancing direct dark matter and neutrino physics searches.

Conclusion: The research successfully develops and characterizes PMTs with optimized voltage-divider bases tailored for PandaX-xT's needs. Through bench testing, simulation, and parameter tuning, the detector components meet the required performance for both low-energy and high-energy photon detection. This optimized PMT design improves the detector's dynamic range and enables effective correction of saturation and suppression effects. The findings support PandaX-xT's goals of advancing sub-keV to multi-MeV direct dark matter and neutrino physics research.

Abstract: The next-generation liquid xenon experiments like PandaX-xT target an energy range from sub-keV to multi-MeV to address the requirement of multiple physics searches. The Hamamatsu R12699-406-M4 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) were developed and selected as photon sensors for PandaX-xT. Their voltage-divider base is optimized for a broad dynamic range, from single-photoelectron (SPE) sensitivity to 30~nC collected charge (matching the 2.5~MeV Q-value of $^{136}$Xe neutrinoless double beta decay~(NLDBD)). Using a dedicated test bench, we characterize the saturation and suppression responses of R12699-406-M4 PMTs with this base design. Based on measured PMT-base responses, we develop a circuit simulation model that accurately reproduces the physical mechanisms underlying these effects with key parameters tuned via experimental data. The combined simulation and bench-test approach guides base design and optimization, enabling improved detector dynamic range and supporting future saturation and suppression correction studies in data analysis.

Result: A small-scale prototype was successfully tested, achieving the objective of measuring charged particle times for identification.

Conclusion: The tested system effectively demonstrates the feasibility of Cherenkov-based timing for RICH detectors in high-energy physics applications.

Abstract: A dedicated R\&D is ongoing for the charged particle identification system of the \mbox{ALICE 3} experiment proposed for the LHC Run 5 and beyond. One of the subsystems for the high-energy charged particle identification will be a Ring-Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector. The possibility of integrating Cherenkov-based charged particle timing measurements is currently under study. The proposed system is based on a proximity-focusing RICH configuration including an aerogel radiator separated from a SiPM array layer by an expansion gap. A thin high-refractive index window of transparent material, acting as a second Cherenkov radiator, is glued on the SiPM array to enable time-of-flight measurements of charged particles by exploiting the yield of Cherenkov photons in the thin window. We assembled a small-scale prototype instrumented with different Hamamatsu SiPM array sensors with pitches ranging from 1 to 3 mm, readout by custom boards equipped with the front-end Petiroc 2A ASICs to measure charges and times. The primary Cherenkov radiator consisted of a 2 cm thick aerogel tile, while various window materials, including SiO$_2$ and MgF$_2$, were used as secondary Cherenkov radiators. The prototype was successfully tested in a campaign at the CERN PS T10 beam line with pions and protons. This paper summarizes the results achieved in the 2023 test beam campaign.

Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration is proposing a completely new apparatus, ALICE 3, for the LHC Run 5 and beyond. A key subsystem for charged particle identification will be a Ring-Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector consisting of an aerogel radiator and a photosensitive surface based on Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays in a proximity-focusing configuration. A thin high-refractive index slab of transparent material (window), acting as a second Cherenkov radiator, is glued on the entrance face of the SiPM arrays to achieve precise charged particle timing. Requiring time matching between aerogel Cherenkov photon and track hits leads to an improvement of pattern recognition by discarding the uncorrelated SiPM dark count hits. In this work we present the current status of the R\&D performed for the ALICE 3 RICH detector prototype and the expected full scale system performance. A special focus will be given to the beam test results obtained with a small-scale prototype instrumented with various array of Hamamatsu SiPMs with pitches ranging from 1 to 3 mm. The Cherenkov radiator consisted of a 2 cm thick aerogel tile with a refractive index of 1.03 at 400 nm wavelength. For timing measurements SiPM arrays coupled with two different window materials (SiO$_2$ and MgF$_2$) were used. The prototype was successfully tested in beam test campaigns at the CERN PS T10 beam line. The data were collected with a complete chain of front-end and readout electronics based on the Petiroc 2A and Radioroc 2 together with a picoTDC to measure charges and times. We measured a charged particle detection efficiency above 99\% and a single photon angular resolution better than 4.2 mrad at the Cherenkov angle saturation with a time resolution better than 70 ps for charged particles.

We measured a single photon angular resolution of 3.8~mrad at the Cherenkov angle saturation value of 242~mrad, as well as the expected scaling of the angular resolution with the increasing number of detected photons. We also studied the contribution of uncorrelated and correlated background sources with respect to the signal and proved the effectiveness of time matching between charged tracks and photon hits to achieve efficient suppression of the SiPM dark count rate background. In this paper, the detector concept, the description of the tested prototype layout and the main beam test results are reported.

Motivation: Improving GEM performance is crucial for high-precision measurements in challenging environments requiring stable, long-term operation.

Method: Utilized ANSYS Mechanical APDL and ANSYS Maxwell for finite element modeling and electrostatic field analysis. Additionally, ANSYS Maxwell was used for simulating field distributions and integrating them with Garfield++ for performance evaluation.

Result: The proposed optimized GEM geometries showed enhanced detector efficiency, reduced ion backflow, and improved gain, making them valuable for next-generation gaseous detectors.

Conclusion: The modified GEM geometries provide significant performance improvements, offering a viable solution for enhancing MPGD performance in high-energy physics applications.

Abstract: Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGDs) are extensively employed in modern high-energy and nuclear Physics experiments because of their excellent spatial resolution, high rate capability, and operational stability. Among these, the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted MPGD technologies. Despite their widespread adoption, GEM detectors based on the conventional bi-conical hole geometry do not always achieve optimal performance, particularly in maximizing effective gain while suppressing ion backflow. One of the primary factors limiting a GEM's performance is ion backflow. The accumulation and gradual discharge of these ions might alter the local electric field, resulting in a temporary dead time and complicating responses to subsequent events. These limitations pose challenges for applications requiring high precision and stable long-term operation. In this work, we address these issues by investigating modified GEM geometries designed to enhance gain performance and reduce ion backflow, thereby improving overall detector performance. The current study investigates geometric optimization strategies for a triple-GEM detector to enhance performance, mitigate ion backflow, and augment gain. The detector structures were designed using the ANSYS Mechanical APDL, and the associated electrostatic field configurations were computed using the ANSYS Maxwell. A thorough investigation of gain and ion backflow calculations was carried out when the generated field maps were interfaced with Garfield$^{++}$. The potential enhancements in detector efficiency and stability that the proposed modifications to the GEM foil geometry offers a valuable insights for the design of next-generation gaseous detectors.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了有效的工具，有助于通过利用220Rn短半衰期来加速辐射研究和改进低背景实验的探测与管理。

Abstract: Measuring radon emanation from detector materials is a key method for controlling radon, a significant background in rare-event physics experiments. Methods for measuring radon emanation are well-established but have predominantly focused on the 222Rn isotope, the dominant radon isotope for these backgrounds. However, measurements of 220Rn (thoron), the second most abundant radon isotope, remain relatively unexplored. 220Rn emanation measurements are challenging because the 220Rn must be transferred from the emanation chamber to the active detector within its short 55 s half-life. In this study, a direct in-chamber approach for measuring 220Rn emanation is presented in which the sample is placed directly within the active detector chamber, thereby minimising losses during transfer. The method was demonstrated with a DURRIDGE RAD8 electrostatic radon detector, which measured 220Rn emanation from low-activity thoriated rods with an activity of 76 +/- 20 mBq. Compared with a conventional flowthrough 220Rn emanation setup, the in-chamber method increased sensitivity by a factor of 3. Using helium as the carrier gas provided a further sensitivity increase, giving an overall sensitivity gain of ~5. These results indicate that in-chamber 220Rn emanation measurements provide an effective tool for low-background experiments and have the potential to accelerate radon studies by exploiting the shorter half-life of 220Rn.

Abstract: The problem of spatially selective radio-frequency (RF) pulse design in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically stated in the form of determining, analytically or numerically, RF waveforms to be applied in synchrony with one or more predetermined gradient waveforms. In most cases, the dynamics of the nuclear spin magnetization under the RF and gradient fields is described in a global rotating frame that cancels the effect of the static (main) magnetic field B0. In this work, we consider an alternative frame of reference, which can be called a local rotating frame where total longitudinal magnetic field (B0 plus gradient) in every voxel is zero. In this frame, the effect of time-dependent gradient field is integrated out, and the remaining magnetization dynamics, governed by much weaker RF fields, becomes both simpler and slower. We show that recasting existing RF design methods in such a frame provides useful insights and techniques that are not obvious in the conventional description. The methods we consider include (i) two-dimensional spatial RF pulse design in the excitation k-space, (ii) Shinnar-Le Roux RF design, (iii) residual phase calculation in slice-selective excitation, and (iv) iterative and numerical solutions for multi-coil RF pulse design. In particular, we show that the new formalism can substantially reduce the Bloch simulation time which can greatly benefit iterative pulse designs in parallel transmit. In all, the proposed framework provides considerable theoretical insights and practical utility for RF pulse design in MRI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to ensure the reliability of the COSINE-100U detector for dark matter searches under extreme conditions.

Method: The study involved two phases: a 110-day room temperature monitoring followed by a 150-day cold and liquid scintillator operation. The module's optical performance was checked throughout to confirm stability.

Result: The results demonstrated that the detector module maintained optimal performance even when subjected to cold conditions and liquid scintillator, confirming the suitability for the physics run.

Conclusion: This project validated the design and functionality of the COSINE-100U detector under the required conditions, paving the way for its effective use in future dark matter research.

Abstract: The COSINE-100U (upgrade) will enhance the sensitivity of the COSINE-100 dark matter search by operating the detector array immersed in liquid scintillator (LS) at $-30^oC$. To validate the detector design for these conditions, we constructed a module using the COSINE-100U encapsulation and performed a dedicated long-term stability study. The module was first monitored at room temperature for ~110 days in air, followed by a one-week immersion in LAB-based LS to verify initial compatibility. Upon confirming stable optical performance, the temperature was lowered to $-33^oC$. During approximately 150 days of continuous operation at low temperature, we observed no degradation in performance.

Abstract: Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) are new and promising imaging sensors. These sensors are sensitive enough to detect individual photons hitting each pixel, with extreme temporal resolution and without readout noise. Thus, SPADs stand out as an optimal choice for low-light imaging. Due to the high price and limited availability of SPAD sensors, the demand for an accurate data simulation pipeline is substantial. Indeed, the scarcity of SPAD datasets hinders the development of SPAD-specific processing algorithms and impedes the training of learning-based solutions.
  In this paper, we present a comprehensive SPAD simulation pipeline and validate it with multiple experiments using two recent commercial SPAD sensors. Our simulator is used to generate the SPAD-MNIST, a single-photon version of the seminal MNIST dataset, to investigate the effectiveness of convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers on reconstructed fluxes, even at extremely low light conditions, e.g., 5 mlux. We also assess the performance of classifiers exclusively trained on simulated data on real images acquired from SPAD sensors at different light conditions. The synthetic dataset encompasses different SPAD imaging modalities and is made available for download. Project page: https://boracchi.faculty.polimi.it/Projects/SPAD-MNIST.html.

Abstract: The ion beam induced charge technique with proton microprobe is used to characterise newly developed p-n junction large area silicon carbide detectors. They were recently produced as part of the ongoing program to develop a new particle identification wall for the focal plane detector of the MAGNEX magnetic spectrometer at INFN - Laboratori Nazionali del Sud in view of the NUMEN experimental campaigns. Four silicon carbide devices are studied. Proton beams over a 1.26 to 6.00 MeV incident energy range are used to probe the active area and the depletion depth of each device. The energy loss tables for the silicon carbide material are checked, finding an empirical correction that is then used to quantify the depletion depth at the full depletion voltage through energy loss measurements of 3.40 MeV proton beams irradiating the back side of the devices. It is possible to fully deplete the devices provided that the epitaxial layer is grown properly on the substrate.

Abstract: This paper presents AAFIYA (Antenna Analysis in Frequency-domain for Impedance and Yield Assessment), a modular Python toolkit for automated characterization of radio-frequency antennas using measurement and simulation data. The toolkit provides a unified workflow for processing S-parameters, impedance, realized gain, beam patterns, polarization metrics, and calibration-based yield estimation, with support for standard Touchstone files and beam pattern data. AAFIYA is validated using measurements from an electromagnetic anechoic chamber involving Log Periodic Dipole Array (LPDA) reference antennas and Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) Bottom Vertically Polarized antennas over 100-850 MHz. Extracted metrics, including impedance matching, realized gain patterns, vector effective lengths, and cross-polarization ratio, are compared against full-wave simulations from HFSS and WIPL-D, showing good agreement across frequency and angle. The results demonstrate that AAFIYA enables accurate, reproducible, and publication-ready antenna analysis, and provides a flexible foundation for future extensions, including automated optimization and data-driven antenna design.

Main category: nlin.CD

Motivation: 该研究通过引入 memristive 函数来动态调整系统参数，使得模型能够表现出更复杂的动力学行为，如均匀和混沌的神经元活动过渡，丰富了神经网络研究的视角。

Method: 研究方法包括：1. 采用 Rulkov 模型，将其一个控制参数替换为 memristive sigmoid 函数；2. 分析新模型的动力学特性，包括均匀和混沌过渡；3. 考察 memristive 函数变化速率和内部状态数量对系统行为的影响；4. 进行数值模拟，观察不同参数下系统的动力学行为。

Result: 研究结果表明，引入 memristive 函数后，模型不仅保留了原有神经元行为的稳定性，还引入了动态变化的复杂性，能够通过调节 memristive 函数的参数实现更丰富的神经元活动模式。

Conclusion: 该研究通过 memristive 函数的引入，展示了如何动态地改变神经网络模型的参数，从而揭示了系统参数动态变化对复杂神经活动的影响，为神经网络研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: The Rulkov model, which simulates the behavior of biological neurons, is modified by replacing one of its control parameters with a memristive, sigmoid-type function of finite memory. This modification causes the parameter to vary according to the system's history throughout the simulation. Previous works usually modify the Rulkov model by introducing additional parameters altering its behavior. Here, by contrast, we retain the original equations and allow the control parameters to vary in time, thereby preserving the model's fundamental properties. In this sense, the proposed model is locally equivalent in time to the original one. However, unlike the original model, which reproduces a single neuronal regime per simulation, the new memristive version exhibits both uniform and chaotic transitions among multiple neuronal activity regimes. Its dynamics are examined with respect to the rate at which the memristive function changes and the number of internal states it stores. Three distinct scenarios emerge around a bifurcation point. Before the bifurcation, the system undergoes uniform transitions toward a stable bursting regime. After the bifurcation, it shows uniform transitions toward a final spiking or silent regime. At the bifurcation point, highly complex transitions arise. As examples, we present trajectories in which the neuron chaotically switches between regimes without ever settling, and trajectories for which it requires around 140000 map iterations to reach a stationary regime.

Abstract: We study the escape of particles in the lemon billiard, a two-parameter family of billiard systems defined by the intersection of two identical circles. Using numerical simulations, we explore how the survival probability depends on the position and size of the hole, as well as on the billiard shape parameter. We find that the survival probability exhibits a two-stage decay pattern: an initial exponential regime followed by a long-time power-law tail, a signature of the stickiness effect. Our results show that the short-time exponential decay rate follows a power-law dependence on the hole size, with different scaling exponents for holes placed in chaotic regions versus mixed phase space regions. For holes located in mixed phase space regions, the decay exponent of the long-time power-law tail remains approximately constant, while the amplitude follows a power-law scaling with hole size. We also examine the dependence of short-time exponential decay rate on the billiard shape parameter and observe scaling behavior for small values of this parameter, which breaks down as the parameter increases.

Motivation: Studying and characterizing entanglement in multipartite high-dimensional quantum systems is a core challenge in quantum information theory. Detecting and quantifying entanglement is crucial for understanding quantum correlations and their applications in tasks like quantum teleportation, distributed computing, and quantum cryptography.

Method: The paper introduces a Mathematica codebase utilizing tensor-flattening techniques to compute $	ld$-multilinear ranks ($	ld$-multiranks) of multiqudit quantum states. The method involves calculating the ranks of all bipartition-induced matricizations (i.e., unfolding the tensor across different bipartitions). By automating the process of generating all necessary tensor reshapes, the code provides an efficient and systematic approach to determine the GME status of $d$-dimensional local quantum systems.

This capability enables the efficient detection and characterization of genuinely multipartite entangled states in high-dimensional systems, advancing the understanding of complex quantum correlations.

Conclusion: The presented Mathematica-based approach represents a significant advancement in the computational tools available for analyzing entanglement in multipartite quantum systems. By leveraging tensor-flattening techniques, the code simplifies the process of identifying GME states and provides a valuable resource for quantum information theorists and physicists working in related fields.

Abstract: We present a Mathematica codebase for computing $\ell$-multilinear ranks ($\ell$-multiranks) of multiqudit quantum states using tensor-flattening techniques.

Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state platform for room-temperature quantum magnetometry owing to its long spin coherence times, optical spin initialization and readout, and high sensitivity to magnetic, electric, and thermal perturbations. As NV-based optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) systems transition from controlled laboratory environments toward portable and field-deployable sensors, a detailed understanding of realistic noise sources and experimental imperfections becomes essential for optimizing performance and sensitivity. In this work, we present a comprehensive simulation framework, i.e., a digital twin, for continuous-wave wide-field ODMR in NV-center ensembles. The model is built upon a physically consistent seven-level description of the NV center and incorporates a broad range of experimentally relevant noise and imperfection mechanisms as modular, parameterized components. These include laser and microwave amplitude fluctuations, microwave phase noise, uncertainty in the NV gyromagnetic ratio, spin dephasing, temperature-induced shifts of the ground-state zero-field splitting, surface-induced magnetic field perturbations, and photon shot noise. Power broadening and contrast degradation arising from optical and microwave driving are captured self-consistently through linewidth calculations. Also, the spatial inhomogeneity is modeled via a Gaussian laser intensity profile across the sensing region...

Abstract: We report the experimental realization of strong longitudinal (ZZ) coupling between two superconducting transmon qubits achieved solely through capacitive engineering. By systematically varying the qubit frequency detuning, we measure cross-Kerr inter-qubit interaction strengths ranging from 10 MHz up to 350 MHz, more than an order of magnitude larger than previously observed in similar capacitively coupled systems. In this configuration, the qubits enter a strong-interaction regime in which the excitation of one qubit inhibits that of its neighbor, demonstrating a dynamical blockade mediated entirely by the engineered ZZ coupling. Circuit quantization simulations accurately reproduce the experimental results, while perturbative models confirm the theoretical origin of the energy shift as a hybridization between the computational states and higher-excitation manifolds. We establish a robust and scalable method to access interaction-dominated physics in superconducting circuits, providing a pathway towards solid-state implementations of globally controlled quantum architectures and cooperative many-body dynamics.

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) constitute a subtle violation of ergodicity through a set of non-thermal eigenstates, referred to as scar states, which are embedded in an otherwise thermal spectrum. In a broad class of known examples, these scar states admit a simple interpretation: they are magnon excitations of fixed momentum on top of a ferromagnetic background. In this paper we prove that any Hamiltonian hosting such ``ferromagnetic scar states'' necessarily admits a structural decomposition into a Zeeman term and an ``annihilator'' that annihilates the entire scar manifold. Moreover, we show that this annihilator must itself decompose into a sum of terms built from local projectors that locally annihilate the scar states. This architecture is closely related to the Shiraishi--Mori construction, and our main theorem establishes that an appropriate generalization of that construction is in fact essentially exhaustive for this class of scar states.

Abstract: Eliminating cryogenic operating requirements while preserving microsecond-scale quantum coherence and enabling CMOS scalability remains a central challenge for telecom quantum technologies. Addressing this, we introduce a CMOS-compatible quantum system comprising single-erbium-(Er)-ion qudits (five-level systems) operating across the visible and telecom C-band. Through innovative nanofabrication, we achieve self-aligned ion placement, enabling spatial isolation of single-Er ions and suppressing dephasing. We realize individually addressable single-Er-devices with record-long optical coherence times in the telecom C-band exceeding 500 μs at ambient conditions, a performance previously limited to vacuum conditions at temperatures over 900 times lower. Furthermore, we present the first demonstration of background-free, upconversion-enabled single-photon Er-emissions providing coherent, high-contrast optical readouts. This work showcases the first room-temperature single-Er-qudit system with unprecedented properties enabling next-generation cryogen-free telecom quantum technologies.

Abstract: We demonstrate a neutral atom networking node that combines high photon collection efficiency with high atom photon entanglement fidelity in a compact, fiber integrated platform. A parabolic mirror is used both to form the trap and to collect fluorescence from a single rubidium atom, intrinsically mode matching $σ$ polarized emitted photons to the fiber and rendering the system largely insensitive to small imperfections or drifts. The core optics consist of millimeter scale components that are pre aligned, rigidly bonded on a monolithic invacuum assembly, and interfaced entirely via optical fibers. With this design, we measure an overall photon collection and detection efficiency of $3.66\%$, from which we infer an overall collection efficiency of $6.6\%$ after the single--mode fiber coupling. We generate atom photon entangled states with a raw Bell state fidelity of 0.93 and an inferred fidelity of 0.98 after correcting for atom readout errors. The same node design has been realized in two independent setups with comparable performance and is compatible with adding high NA objective lenses to create and control atomic arrays at each node. Our results establish a robust, cavity free neutral atom interface that operates near the limit set by the collection optics numerical aperture and provides a practical building block for scalable quantum network nodes and repeaters.

TL;DR: Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) significantly outperform traditional CNNs in radar-based occupancy classification, achieving superior accuracy while drastically reducing parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance privacy-preserving monitoring in challenging environments like elder care using radar sensing, which is effective under low SNR and without cameras or wearables.

Method: Benchmarked a 2-qubit HQNN against CNNs using a physics-informed 60GHz digital twin and real radar data, with both clean conditions and noisy evaluations.

Result: In clean conditions, HQNN achieves 99.7% (synthetic) and 97.0% (real) accuracy with 170x fewer parameters. Under noisy conditions, HQNN starts recovery earlier and has a more stable performance compared to CNNs.

Conclusion: HQNN offers a compact solution with better parameter efficiency and stability in privacy-preserving radar sensing, establishing a strong baseline for hybrid quantum models.

Abstract: Indoor occupancy classification enables privacy-preserving monitoring in settings such as remote elder care, where presence information helps triage alarms without cameras or wearables. Radar suits this role by sensing motion through occlusions and in darkness. Modern deep-learning pipelines are the standard for interpreting radar returns effectively; however, they are often parameter-heavy and sensitive at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), motivating compact alternatives like Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs). A two-qubit HQNN is benchmarked against convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using a physics-informed 60GHz digital twin and real radar measurements under matched training protocols. In clean conditions, the HQNN achieves high accuracy (99.7% synthetic; 97.0% real) with up to 170x fewer parameters (0.066M). Its parameter efficiency is shown to be structural, as an ablation of the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) causes sharp performance drops on real data (to 68.5% and 31.5% for the control heads). A domain-dependent sensitivity emerges under additive-noise evaluation, where the HQNN begins recovery earlier in synthetic data while CNNs recover more steeply and peak higher on real measurements. In label-fraction ablations, CNNs prove more sample-efficient on real Range-Doppler Maps (RDMs), with the performance gap being most pronounced (at 50% labels, BA 0.89-0.99 vs. HQNN 0.75). On synthetic data, this gap narrows significantly, largely vanishing by the 50% label mark. Overall, the HQNN's value lies in parameter efficiency and a compact inductive bias that shapes its distinct sensitivity profile; this work establishes a rigorous baseline for hybrid quantum models in privacy-preserving radar occupancy sensing.

Abstract: Superradiance is a hallmark of cooperative quantum emission, where radiative decay is collectively enhanced by coherence among emitters. Here, extending superradiant effects to photon pair generation from multi-level atoms, two-photon process offers a pathway to novel quantum light sources and a useful case for practical superradiance. We report bright heralded single-photon superradiance via spontaneous four-wave mixing in a 1-mm-long, high-density cesium vapor cell. By reducing the average distance between atoms in the atomic vapor to 0.29 times the idler photon wavelength, we observe a dramatic narrowing of the temporal two-photon wavefunction. This compression of temporal two-photon wavefunction evidences the superradiance of heralded photons in the collective two-photon emission dynamics. Furthermore, our heralded single-photon superradiance is accompanied by a coincidence-to-accidental ratio of 200 and the detected photon-pair counting exceeding 10^6 pairs/s. These findings establish dense thin atomic vapors as a practical, robust medium for realizing superradiant photon sources, with immediate relevance for quantum optics and the development of efficient photonic quantum technologies.

Abstract: It is widely recognized that finite temperatures degrade quantum coherence and can induce thermalization. Here, we study the effect of finite temperature on a kicked Tonks--Girardeau gas, which is known to exhibit many--body dynamical localization and delocalization under periodic and quasiperiodic kicks, respectively. We find that many--body dynamical localization persists at finite--and even high--temperatures, although the coherence of the localized state is further degraded. In particular, we demonstrate a modified effective thermalization of the localized state by considering the initial temperature. Moreover, we show many--body dynamical localization transition at intermediate temperature. Our work extends the study of many--body dynamical localization and delocalization to the finite--temperature regime, providing comprehensive guidance for cold--atom experiments.

TL;DR: Dimensionality reduction using PCA improves HEP data processing with QML, but increasing qubits can cause plateaus. Circuit depth is key for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HEP data is complex; QML offers a new approach, but optimizing it for NISQ devices is essential.

Method: PCA reduced 30 features to 4 or 8 qubits. Tested three circuit configurations with varying depth and qubit count.

Result: Configuration B (deeper 4-qubit) achieved 56.2% accuracy, higher than others. 8-qubit had 50.6% due to plateaus.

Conclusion: Circuit depth and entanglement are more crucial than qubit count for anomaly detection in HEP.

Abstract: High-Energy Physics (HEP) experiments, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), generate massive datasets that challenge classical computational limits. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers a potential advantage in processing high-dimensional data; however, finding the optimal architecture for current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices remains an open challenge. This study investigates the performance of Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC) in detecting Higgs Boson signals using the ATLAS Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge 2014 experiment dataset. We implemented a dimensionality reduction pipeline using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to map 30 physical features into 4-qubit and 8-qubit latent spaces. We benchmarked three configurations: (A) a shallow 4-qubit circuit, (B) a deep 4-qubit circuit with increased entanglement layers, and (C) an expanded 8-qubit circuit. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing circuit depth significantly improves performance, yielding the highest accuracy of 56.2% (Configuration B), compared to a baseline of 51.9%. Conversely, simply scaling to 8 qubits resulted in a performance degradation to 50.6% due to optimization challenges associated with Barren Plateaus in the larger Hilbert space. These findings suggest that for near-term quantum hardware, prioritizing circuit depth and entanglement capability is more critical than increasing qubit count for effective anomaly detection in HEP data.

Abstract: We present a systematic method for constructing universal composite phase gates with a continuously tunable target phase. Using a general Cayley--Klein parametrization of the single-pulse propagator, we design gates from an even number of nominal $π$ pulses and derive analytic phase families by canceling, order by order in a small deviation parameter, the leading contributions to the undesired off-diagonal element of the composite propagator, independently of the dynamical phase. The resulting sequences provide intrinsic robustness against generic control imperfections and parameter fluctuations and remain valid for arbitrary pulse shapes. Numerical simulations in a standard two-level model confirm high-order error suppression and demonstrate broad, flat high-fidelity plateaus over wide ranges of simultaneous pulse-area and detuning errors, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed universal composite phase gates for resilient phase control in quantum information processing.

Abstract: Eigenvalue transformations appear ubiquitously in scientific computation, ranging from matrix polynomials to differential equations, and are beyond the reach of the quantum singular value transformation framework. In this work, we study the efficiency of quantum algorithms based on contour integral representation for eigenvalue transformations from both theoretical and practical aspects. Theoretically, we establish a complete complexity analysis of the contour integral approach proposed in [Takahira, Ohashi, Sogabe, and Usuda. Quant. Inf. Comput., 22, 11\&12, 965--979 (2021)]. Moreover, we combine the contour integral approach and the sampling-based linear combination of unitaries to propose a quantum algorithm for estimating observables of eigenvalue transformations using only $3$ additional qubits. Practically, we design contour integral based quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation, matrix polynomials, and solving linear ordinary differential equations, and show that the contour integral algorithm can outperform all the existing quantum algorithms in the case of solving asymptotically stable differential equations.

Abstract: Quantum-correlated states of light, such as squeezed states, constitute a fundamental resource for quantum technologies, enabling enhanced performance in quantum metrology, quantum information processing, and quantum communications. The practical deployment of such technologies requires squeezed-light sources that are compact, efficient, low-cost, and robust. Here we report a compact narrowband source of two-mode squeezed light at 795 nm based on four-wave mixing in hot 85Rb atomic vapor. The source is implemented in a small, modular architecture featuring a single fiber-coupled input, an electro-optic phase modulator combined with a single Fabry-Perot etalon for probe generation, and two free-space output modes corresponding to the signal and conjugate fields. Optimized for low pump power, the system achieves up to -8 dB of intensity-difference squeezing at an analysis frequency of 0.8 MHz with a pump power of only 300 mW. The intrinsic narrowband character of the generated quantum states makes this source particularly well suited for atomic-based quantum sensing and quantum networking, including interfaces with atomic quantum memories. Our results establish a versatile and portable platform for low-SWaP squeezed-light generation, paving the way toward deployable quantum-enhanced technologies.

Abstract: Quantum nonlocality manifests in multipartite systems through entanglement, Bell's nonlocality, and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering. While Peres's positive-partial-transpose criterion provides a simple and powerful test for entanglement, a comparably elegant spectral criterion for detecting EPR steering remains an open challenge. In this work, we systematically explore whether a Peres-type criterion can be established for EPR steering in the two-qubit system. Focusing on rank-2 (including rank-1) states and the two-qubit Werner state, we analyze the eigenvalues of their partially transposed density matrices and construct a significant steering criterion based on symmetric combinations of these eigenvalues. We prove that this criterion serves as a necessary and sufficient condition for steerability for the Werner state, all two-qubit pure states, all two-qubit rank-2 states. Furthermore, we validate the criterion for higher-rank states (rank-3 and rank-4) and show that the results align with known steering inequalities. Our findings suggest a more unified framework for detecting quantum nonlocality via partial transposition and open avenues for further theoretical and numerical investigations into steering detection.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A unique postulate is shown to underly the whole quantum mechanics theory: the invariance of the Heisenberg uncertainty inequality under a group of special nonlinear gauge transformations (NLGT). With this postulate, the quantum mechanics of a free particle is derived from classical mechanics, including the statements of the postulates of quantum mechanics, except for the wave-function-collapse postulate. An explanatory mechanism for the latter postulate is derived by performing an analytical continuation of the NLGTs. This extension results in a Schrödinger-bridge process, intertwined under the NLGT with the standard unitary quantum evolution, and revealing non-quantum (or beyond-quantum) phenomena. Mechanisms of that latter kind, like the ones associated to the quantum measurement process, occur in a new space-like dimension and hence are non causal in nature, in opposition to a time evolution. The present exercice focusses on the free particle in order to highlight the features of the performed derivation in the simplest possible way. Work is in progress to extend the performed derivation beyond that simple case.

Abstract: The quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) is the cornerstone of multiparameter quantum metrology. In this work, we investigate multiparameter quantum estimation in baryon-antibaryon (B bar-B) pairs produced via the e+ e- -> J/psi -> B bar-B process at the BESIII experiment, utilizing the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) formalism. Moreover, the QFIM defines the quantum Cramer-Rao bound and dictates the choice of optimal probe states. We compare individual and simultaneous estimation strategies for two key physical parameters: the scattering angle phi and the decay parameter alpha_psi. The estimation variances are found to depend strongly on the explored region of the (phi, alpha_psi) parameter space and to display markedly different temporal dynamics. In general, higher true values of a parameter increase the system's sensitivity, thereby significantly reducing the associated variance. While both variances increase with evolution time, they do so at distinct rates, revealing parameter-dependent information loss driven by environmental decoherence. These findings demonstrate the utility of the QFIM framework for multiparameter quantum estimation in realistic open systems and provide new insights into the ultimate precision limits achievable for hyperon decay parameters.

Abstract: The color code model is a crucial instance of a Calderbank--Shor--Steane (CSS)-type topological quantum error-correcting code, which notably supports transversal implementation of the full Clifford group. Its robustness against local noise is rooted in the structure of its topological excitations. From the perspective of quantum phases of matter, it is essential to understand these excitations in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we analyze the color code model on an infinite lattice within the quasi-local $C^{*}$-algebra framework, using a cone-localized Doplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) analysis. We classify its irreducible anyon superselection sectors and construct explicit string operators that generate anyonic excitations from the ground state. We further examine the fusion and braiding properties of these excitations. Our results show that the topological order of the color code is described by $\mathsf{Rep}(D(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)) \simeq \mathsf{Rep}(D(\mathbb{Z}_2)) \boxtimes \mathsf{Rep}(D(\mathbb{Z}_2))$, which is equivalent to a double layer of the toric code and consistent with established analyses on finite lattices.

Abstract: Two-photon interference is a cornerstone of photonic quantum technologies. However, its practical implementation in promising hybrid architectures is severely constrained by the requirement of photon wavepacket indistinguishability, in particular, in terms of the photon linewidth and associated time scale. While narrowband filtering can improve interference visibility, it introduces significant photon loss - a critical limitation for applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an efficient approach to enable non-classical two-photon interference between spectral-bandwidth mismatched photons using an electro-optic time lens. We increase the visibility of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between photons of 10-fold spectral bandwidth mismatch by more than 12 times, achieving non-classical two-photon interference visibility without spectral filtering. This result opens the possibility to efficiently integrate quantum systems operating at different time scales for hybrid quantum communication, teleportation, entanglement swapping, distributed sensing, and hybrid quantum computing.

Abstract: I define a notion of locality LOC, closely modelled on the Bell principle of Local Causality, construed as the condition that single case probabilities cannot be modified by actions at spacelike separation. The new principle, like that of Bell, forces Bell inequalities, but with two loopholes: one is violation of measurement independence, known to Bell, but the other is non-uniqueness of remote outcomes, a loophole only for LOC, not for Local Causality. I also set out a theory of physical probability, applicable to the Everett interpretation, in which the Born rule is derived, and which therefore violates Bell inequalities. I show it is consistent with LOC. Surprisingly, both loopholes are exploited. I conclude not only that physical probability in the Everett interpretation involves no action at a distance, but that the observed violation of Bell inequalities is powerful evidence for many worlds.

Abstract: We investigate strategies for simulating open quantum systems coupled to dissipative baths by comparing explicit wave function-based discretization [via multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH)] and the implicit density matrix-based master equation method [via tree tensor network hierarchical equations of motion (TTN-HEOM)]. For dissipative baths characterized by exponentially decaying bath correlation functions, the implicit discretization approach of HEOM -- rooted in bath correlation function decompositions -- proves significantly more efficient than explicit discretization of the bath into discrete harmonic modes. Explicit methods, like ML-MCTDH, require extensive mode discretization to approximate continuum baths, leading to computational bottlenecks. Case studies for two-level systems and a Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex model highlight TTN-HEOM's superiority in capturing dissipative dynamics with relaxations with a minimal number of auxiliary modes, while the explicit methods are as exact as the HEOM in pure dephasing regimes. This comparison is enabled by the TENSO package, which has both ML-MCTDH and TTN-HEOM implemented using the same computational structure and propagation strategy.

Abstract: Quantum amplifiers are intrinsically nonlinear systems whose performance limits are set by quantum mechanics. In quantum measurement, amplifier operation is conventionally optimized in the linear regime by maximizing signal-to-noise ratio, an objective that is well-suited to parameter estimation but is typically insufficient for more general tasks such as arbitrary quantum state discrimination. Here we show that single-shot quantum state classification can benefit from operating a quantum amplifier outside the linear regime, when the measurement chain is optimized end-to-end for a task-specific cost function. We analyze a realistic superconducting readout architecture that includes state preparation, cryogenic nonlinear amplification, and room-temperature detection with finite noise. By introducing performance metrics tailored to state discrimination, we identify operating regimes in which nonlinear amplification provides a measurable advantage and clarify the trade-offs that ultimately limit classification fidelity. Our results propose the utility of practical nonlinear quantum amplifiers for quantum state discrimination, and are the first step in a broader research program aimed at developing a general framework for end-to-end, resource-limited optimization of nonlinear quantum amplifiers for such quantum information processing applications.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement offers an incredible resource for enhancing the sensing and spectroscopic probes. Here we develop a microscopic theory for the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) using entangled photons. We demonstrate that the time-energy correlation of the photon pairs can optimize the signal for polyatomic molecules. Our results show that the spectral-line intensity of the entangled-photon SRS (ESRS) is of the same order of magnitude as the one for the entangled two-photon absorption (ETPA); the parameter window is thus identified to do so. Moreover, the vibrational coherence is found to play an important role for enhancing the ESRS against the ETPA intensity. Our work paves a firm road for extending the schemes of molecular spectroscopy with quantum light, based on the observation of the ETPA in experiments.

*Spandan Das,Ennis Mawas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study of topological quantum computing topology sensitivity shows that different geometries (Mobius strip, loop, trefoil knot) have varying signal-to-noise ratios and similar coherence times, suggesting that device-level parameters may be necessary to distinguish genuine topological effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding topological quantum computing's sensitivity to noise and geometry differences is crucial for advancing quantum technology and reducing decoherence issues.

Method: Three geometries were studied using quantum capacitance measurements, extracting power vs. frequency spectra, and fitting Lorentzian line shapes to quantify linewidth, amplitude, signal-to-noise ratio, and coherence time.

Result: Coherence times across all three topologies are similar, while the signal-to-noise ratio varies, particularly for E0 = 10 micro-eV and Z = -1, following the order Trefoil, Mobius, and Loop.

Conclusion: These findings provide a baseline for future experiments to separate genuine topological effects from device-dependent parameters.

Abstract: Topological quantum computing is expected to be less sensitive to noise because information is stored in global states rather than local features. To examine whether different device topologies show measurable differences, we study three geometries with distinct topological invariants: a Mobius strip, a loop, and a trefoil knot, which have been proposed in electronic-structure settings. From quantum capacitance measurements, we extract power versus frequency spectra and fit Lorentzian line shapes to obtain the linewidth, amplitude, signal-to-noise ratio, and coherence time. The signal-to-noise ratio quantifies the ratio of the parity measurement signal to background noise and serves as an indicator of readout quality, while the coherence time characterizes the timescale for decoherence of the quantum state. Across all three topologies, coherence times are similar, with no clear dependence on geometry. In contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio differs in the regime E0 = 10 micro-eV and Z = -1, following the ordering Trefoil, Mobius, and Loop. These results provide a reference point for future experiments aimed at separating genuine topological effects from device-level parameters.

Motivation: Improving the efficiency and precision of quantum technologies through non-Gaussian states is a key focus in current research.

Method: The authors use the Full Counting Statistics model, inspired by the Jaynes-Cummings model, to analyze energy exchanges between qubits and a single-mode field.

Result: Sequential protocols with non-Gaussian states maximize charging precision, even in sub-optimal conditions.

Conclusion: Non-Gaussian states offer a robust quantum advantage in precision, making them ideal for high-accuracy tasks.

Abstract: Precision, robustness, and efficiency are crucial aspects in the design of quantum technologies. Here, we show how genuine quantum features, together with non-Gaussianity, can be the key elements to achieve the best of these three aspects during a quantum battery-charging process. Taking inspiration from a light-matter interaction paradigm, i.e., the Jaynes-Cummings model, we employ the Full Counting Statistics to study the stochastic exchanges of energy between an entire stack of qubits and a single-mode electromagnetic field (or mechanical oscillator). Our study allows to conclude that charging the battery through a sequential protocol involving a quantum non-Gaussian field state guarantees extremely high-performances in the charging process, whose precision is maximized even under sub-optimal operating conditions. These results highlight the potential of non-Gaussian quantum state charging to achieve a robust quantum precision advantage over Gaussian states of the field by suppressing detrimental quantum fluctuations, thus making it suitable to ultimate tasks for which a significant degree of accuracy is required.

Abstract: Quantum simulation provides a powerful route for exploring many-body phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computation. Existing approaches typically proceed in the forward direction: a model Hamiltonian is specified, implemented on a programmable quantum platform, and its phase diagram and properties are explored. Here we present a quantum algorithmic framework for inverse quantum simulation, enabling quantum material design with desired properties. Target material characteristics are encoded as a cost function, which is minimized on quantum hardware to prepare a many-body state with the desired properties in quantum memory. Hamiltonian learning is then used to reconstruct a low-energy Hamiltonian for which this state is an approximate ground state, yielding a physically interpretable model that can guide experimental synthesis. As illustrative applications, we outline how the method can be used to search for high-temperature superconductors within the fermionic Hubbard model, enhancing $d$-wave correlations over a broad range of dopings and temperatures, design quantum phases by stabilizing a topological order through continuous Hamiltonian modifications, and optimize dynamical properties relevant for photochemistry and frequency- and momentum-resolved condensed-matter data. These results extend the scope of quantum simulators from exploring quantum many-body systems to designing and discovering new quantum materials.

Abstract: Causality underpins all logical reasoning. However, the causal structure in quantum processes can be far from intuitive, often differing from its classical counterpart in relativity, which is defined by the light cone. In particular, in systems with measurement and post-selection, causal influence can occur between spacelike separated regions. In this work, we study the causal structure and emergent "arrow of time" in monitored quantum dynamics, particularly their dependence on initial and final states. We propose a new measure, the cross-entropy quantum causal influence, to quantify the extent of causal influence, whose simulation demonstrates exotic causal structures, such as inverted light cones. This quantity can be measured in current quantum computing platforms. Additionally, we provide an analytical understanding of the relation between time arrow and entropy by studying two types of models that are analytically tractable: a quantum Brownian evolution model and a dual-unitary circuit model.

Abstract: We investigate quantum correlations in a hybrid qubit-qutrit system subject to both axial and planar single-ion anisotropies, dipolar spin-spin interactions, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) coupling. Using Negativity, Measurement-Induced Non-locality (MIN), Uncertainty-Induced Nonlocality (UIN), and Bell nonlocality (as quantified by the CHSH inequality) as measures, we analyze the interplay between anisotropy parameters, magnetic fields, and temperature on the survival of quantum correlations. Our results demonstrate that Bell nonlocality and entanglement (Negativity) are highly sensitive to temperature and anisotropy, exhibiting sudden death under thermal noise, whereas MIN and UIN are significantly more robust. In particular, these discord-like and information-theoretic measures provide the largest baseline and persist even in parameter regions where entanglement vanishes, highlighting their suitability as a quantumness witness in realistic conditions. Notably, our Bell nonlocality study is tailored to the asymmetric qubit-qutrit setting by exploiting a recently developed qubit-qudit CHSH maximization framework. However, Bell nonlocality is confirmed to be the most fragile, surviving only in narrow parameter windows at low temperature. A key finding of this work is that we observe the fragility hierarchy: Bell nonlocality < Negativity < UIN(MIN) in the qubit-qutrit setting. These results provide deeper insight into the relative robustness of distinct quantum resources in anisotropic qubit-qutrit models, suggesting that quantum discord-like measures, such as MIN and UIN, may serve as more practical resources than entanglement for quantum information tasks in thermally active spin systems.

*Eyal Buks*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper examines the spontaneous disentanglement hypothesis in quantum mechanics, which attempts to address issues like quantum measurement by modifying Schrödinger and master equations using nonlinear disentanglement operators. Two operators are explored: one causing matrix deranking and another suppressing correlations. Using a two-spin system near the Hartmann-Hahn resonance, it shows that disentanglement allows for limit cycle solutions not possible in standard quantum mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by unresolved issues in standard quantum mechanics, particularly the quantum measurement problem.

Method: The study employs nonlinear disentanglement operators to modify Schrödinger and master equations, then applies these methods to a two-spin system near the Hartmann-Hahn double resonance.

Result: The research demonstrates that under the spontaneous disentanglement hypothesis, limit cycle steady state solutions become feasible, a finding that is exclusive to standard quantum mechanics.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the spontaneous disentanglement hypothesis provides a novel framework for circumventing the limitations of standard quantum mechanics by enabling new types of quantum state evolutions.

Abstract: The spontaneous disentanglement hypothesis is motivated by some outstanding issues in standard quantum mechanics, including the problem of quantum measurement. The current study compares between some possible methods that can be used to implement the hypothesis. Disentanglement is formulated using a nonlinear operator, which can be used to modify both the Schrödinger equation for the quantum state vector, and the master equation for the density operator. Two types of nonlinear disentanglement operators are explored. The first one gives rise to matrix deranking, and the second one to correlation suppression. Both types are demonstrated using a two spin system that is driven close to the Hartmann--Hahn double resonance. It is shown that limit cycle steady state solutions, which are excluded by standard quantum mechanics, become possible in the presence of disentanglement.

Abstract: Extending corresponding results for matrix product states [Verstraete and Cirac, PRB 73, 094423 (2006); Schuch et al. PRL 100, 030504 (2008)], it is shown how the approximation error of tree tensor network states (TTNS) can be bounded using Schmidt spectra or Rényi entanglement entropies of the target quantum state. Conversely, one obtains bounds on TTNS bond dimensions needed to achieve a specific approximation accuracy. For tree lattices, the result implies that efficient TTNS approximations exist if $α<1$ Rényi entanglement entropies for single-branch cuts obey an area law, as in ground and low-energy states of certain gapped systems.

Abstract: We investigate operator delocalization in disordered one-dimensional spin chains by introducing -- besides the already known operator mass -- a complementary measure of operator complexity: the operator length. Like the operator nonstabilizerness, both these quantities are defined from the expansion of time-evolved operators in the Pauli basis. They characterize, respectively, the number of sites on which an operator acts nontrivially and the spatial extent of its support. We show that both the operator mass and length can be computed efficiently and exactly within a matrix-product-operator (MPS) framework, providing direct access to their full probability distributions, without resorting to stochastic sampling. Applying this approach to the disordered XXZ spin-1/2 chain, we find sharply distinct behaviors in non-interacting and interacting regimes. In the Anderson-localized case, operator mass, length, and operator entanglement entropy rapidly saturate, signaling the absence of scrambling. By contrast, in the many-body localized (MBL) regime, for arbitrarily weak interactions, all quantities exhibit a robust logarithmic growth in time, consistent with the known logarithmic light cone of quantum-correlation propagation in MBL. We demonstrate that this behavior is quantitatively captured by an effective $\ell$-bit model and persists across system sizes accessible via tensor-network simulations.

Abstract: Standard quantum metrology relies on ensemble-averaged quantities, such as the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI), which often mask the fluctuations inherent to single-shot realizations. In this work, we bridge the gap between quantum information geometry and stochastic thermodynamics by introducing the Conditional Quantum Fisher Information (CQFI). Defined via the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative, the CQFI generalizes the classical stochastic Fisher information to the quantum domain. We demonstrate that the CQFI admits a decomposition into incoherent (population) and coherent (basis rotation) contributions, augmented by a transient interference cross-term absent at the ensemble level. Crucially, we show that this cross-term can be negative, signaling destructive interference between classical and quantum information channels along individual trajectories. Leveraging this framework, we construct a stochastic information geometry that defines thermodynamic length and action for single quantum trajectories. Finally, we derive fundamental quantum speed limits valid at the single-trajectory level and validate our results using the quantum jump unraveling of a driven thermal qubit.

TL;DR: Quantum error correction is a key ingredient for large scale quantum computation. Topological stabilizer codes are particularly appealing, but decoding them is a bottleneck. QuantumSMoE, a quantum vision transformer decoder, outperforms machine learning and classical-based decoders by incorporating code structure and lattice connectivity.

Motivation: Large-scale quantum computing requires robust and efficient error correction mechanisms. The challenge of decoding topological codes efficiently is a bottleneck, prompting the development of novel decoding techniques. With increasing code sizes and lattice distances, the need for improved decoders becomes critical.

Method: QuantumSMoE is designed as a quantum vision transformer, utilizing plus-shaped embeddings and adaptive masking to capture local interactions and lattice structure. The decoder employs a mixture of experts layer with a novel auxiliary loss function to enhance scalability.

Result: Experiments on the toric code demonstrate that QuantumSMoE outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning decoders and widely employed classical baselines, highlighting the potential of transformer-based approaches in quantum error correction.

Conclusion: The success of QuantumSMoE suggests that integrating topological code structural insights into modern machine learning models can significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of quantum error correction processes.

Abstract: Quantum error correction is a key ingredient for large scale quantum computation, protecting logical information from physical noise by encoding it into many physical qubits. Topological stabilizer codes are particularly appealing due to their geometric locality and practical relevance. In these codes, stabilizer measurements yield a syndrome that must be decoded into a recovery operation, making decoding a central bottleneck for scalable real time operation. Existing decoders are commonly classified into two categories. Classical algorithmic decoders provide strong and well established baselines, but may incur substantial computational overhead at large code distances or under stringent latency constraints. Machine learning based decoders offer fast GPU inference and flexible function approximation, yet many approaches do not explicitly exploit the lattice geometry and local structure of topological codes, which can limit performance. In this work, we propose QuantumSMoE, a quantum vision transformer based decoder that incorporates code structure through plus shaped embeddings and adaptive masking to capture local interactions and lattice connectivity, and improves scalability via a mixture of experts layer with a novel auxiliary loss. Experiments on the toric code demonstrate that QuantumSMoE outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning decoders as well as widely used classical baselines.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了量子混沌与量子魔性之间的重要联系，为理解超越经典描述的量子复杂性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Under unitary evolution, chaotic quantum systems initialized in simple states rapidly develop high complexity, precluding any efficient classical description. Quantum chaos is traditionally characterized by spectral properties of the Hamiltonian, most notably through the spectral form factor, while the hardness of classical simulation within the stabilizer formalism, commonly referred to as quantum magic, can be quantified by the stabilizer Rényi entropy. In this Letter, we propose a relation between the dynamics of the stabilizer Rényi entropy for thermofield double states and the spectral form factor, based on general arguments for chaotic systems with all-to-all interactions. This relation implies that the saturation of the stabilizer Rényi entropy is governed by a first-order dynamical transition. We then demonstrate this relation explicitly in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, using an auxiliary-spin representation of the stabilizer Rényi entropy that exhibits an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry. We further find that, in the high-temperature regime of the SYK model, the transition occurs at a finite time, with the long-time phase marked by spontaneous $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. In contrast, at low temperatures, the transition is pushed to times exponentially long in the system size. Our results reveal an intriguing interplay between quantum chaos and quantum magic.

Abstract: We investigate how quantum coherence scales and is redistributed in quantum communication protocols, using superdense coding and quantum teleportation as paradigmatic case studies. Employing the relative entropy of coherence as a circuit-level resource measure, we show that multipartite resource states relevant to generalized superdense coding can enable scalable communication while exhibiting only logarithmic or even constant coherence growth, depending on their entanglement structure. In sharp contrast, quantum teleportation displays an unavoidable, protocol-induced coherence cost that grows linearly with the number of teleported qubits and is independent of the input state. Through a stage-resolved analysis of the teleportation circuit, we separate protocol-generated coherence from message-dependent contributions and identify a universal two-bit coherence offset per teleported qubit at the maximal-coherence stage. We further demonstrate explicitly that this extensive intermediate coherence generation is fully consistent with information-theoretic bounds, including the Holevo limit, and does not correspond to an increase in accessible classical information.

Motivation: The paper likely aims to generalize quantum filtering techniques to include squeezed states, which are important in quantum optics and quantum information theory.

Method: The authors use Bogoliubov transformations and Tomita-Takesaki theory; the quantum stochastic model is formulated as an Araki-Woods type representation; the filter is constructed using the quantum reference probability technique.

Result: They derive a new quantum filter that works for quadrature measurements with squeezed inputs and ensure representation independence by fixing a specific quadrature.

Conclusion: This paper extends quantum filtering results to include squeezed states, broadening their applicability in quantum optics and information science; their approach using Bogoliubov transformations and Tomita-Takesaki theory seems solid and generalizable.

Abstract: We derive the quantum filter for a quantum open system undergoing quadrature measurements (homodyning) where the input field is in a general quasi-free state. This extends previous work for thermal input noise and allows for squeezed inputs. We introduce a convenient class of Bogoliubov transformations which we refer to as balanced and formulate the quantum stochastic model with squeezed noise as an Araki-Woods type representation. We make an essential use of the Tomita-Takesaki theory to construct the commutant of the C*-algebra describing the inputs and obtain the filtering equations using the quantum reference probability technique. The derived quantum filter must be independent of the choice of representation and this is achieved by fixing an independent quadrature in the commutant algebra.

Abstract: Computation of Uhlmann fidelity between many-body mixed states generally involves full diagonalization of exponentially large matrices. In this work, we introduce a polynomial-time algorithm to compute certified lower and upper bounds for the fidelity between matrix product density operators (MPDOs). Our method maps the fidelity estimation problem to a variational optimization of sequential quantum circuits, allowing for systematic improvement of the lower bounds by increasing the circuit depth. Complementarily, we obtain certified upper bounds on fidelity by variational lower bounds on the trace distance through the same framework. We demonstrate the power of this approach with two examples: fidelity correlators in critical mixed states, and codeword distinguishability in an approximate quantum error-correcting code. Remarkably, the variational lower bound accurately track the universal scaling behavior of the fidelity with a size-consistent relative error, allowing for the extraction of previously unknown critical exponents. Our results offer an exponential improvement in precision over known moment-based bounds and establish a scalable framework for the verification of many-body quantum systems.

Its scalability and efficiency make it a valuable tool for advancing quantum computing and simulation technologies.

Abstract: Quantum systems governed by time-dependent Hamiltonians pose significant challenges for the accurate computation of unitary time-evolution operators, which are essential for predicting quantum state dynamics. In this work, we introduce a physics-informed deep learning approach based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks to estimate these operators over the full time domain. By incorporating physical constraints such as unitarity and leveraging the second-order Magnus expansion on the evolution operator, the proposed framework enables the estimation of unitary matrices at different time intervals. The model is trained using simulated unitary operators and evaluated on quantum systems ranging from 2 to 6 qubits. For larger many-body systems, specifically those with 7 and 8 qubits, the same methodology is employed to reconstruct an effective time-dependent Hamiltonian, from which the corresponding time-evolution operator is computed over the entire temporal domain. The proposed framework achieves fidelities exceeding 0.92 using a limited number of unitary samples, indicating a potential reduction in measurement and data acquisition costs. These results highlight the effectiveness of the approach for data-driven simulation and identification of quantum dynamical systems, with direct relevance to quantum computing and quantum simulation applications.

Conclusion: ParaQNN 提供了一种高效的方法，能够从噪声数据中提取量子系统的固有特性，并在 extrapolation 区域保持高精度的动力学行为。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of open quantum systems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices constitutes a major challenge, as high noise levels and environmental degradations lead to the decay of pure quantum states (decoherence) and energy losses. This situation represents one of the most important problems in the field of quantum information technologies. While existing data-driven methods struggle to generalize beyond the training data (extrapolation), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) require predefined governing equations, which limit their discovery capability when the underlying physics is incomplete or unknown. In this work, we present the ParaQNN (ParaQuantum neural network) architecture, an equation-free framework for physical discovery. ParaQNN disentangles multi-scale dynamics without relying on a priori laws by employing a dialetheist logic layer that models coherent signal and decoherent noise as independent yet interacting channels. Through extensive benchmark tests performed on Rabi oscillations, Lindblad dynamics, and particularly complex ``mixed regimes'' where relaxation and dephasing processes compete, we show that ParaQNN exhibits a consistent performance advantage compared to Random Forest, XGBoost, and PINN models with incomplete physical information. Unlike its competitors, ParaQNN succeeds in maintaining oscillatory and damping dynamics with high accuracy even in extrapolation regions where training data are unavailable, by ``discovering'' the underlying structural invariants from noisy measurements. These results demonstrate that paraconsistent logic provides a structurally more stable epistemic foundation than classical methods for learning quantum behavior in situations where mathematical equations prove insufficient.

*Jeongho Bang,Kyoungho Cho,Jeongwoo Jae*

TL;DR: No-signaling prevents a quantum search algorithm from exponentially speeding up by enforcing a lower bound on reflection circuit complexity and limiting state learning to O(sqrt(N)/log N) samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the limits of quantum learning algorithms and their interplay with physical laws.

Method: Bao-Bouland-Jordan framework with amplify-learn architecture and sample complexity calculations.

Result: No-signaling fixes reflection complexity and tightens state learning bounds, collapsing query, gate, and sample complexities into a causality-compatible framework.

Conclusion: No-signaling acts as a regulator, balancing quantum speedups with learnability constraints.

Abstract: What ultimately fixes the sample cost of quantum learning -- algorithmic ingenuity or physical law? We study this question in an arena where computation, learning, and causality collide. A twist on Grover's search that reflects about an a priori unknown state can collapse the query complexity from $O(\sqrt{N})$ to $O(\log N)$ over a search space $N$, i.e., an exponential speedup. Yet, standard quantum theory forbids such a unknown-state reflection (no-reflection theorem). We therefore build a state-learning-assisted architecture, called ``amplify-learn,'' which alternates the coherent amplitude amplification with state learning. Embedding this amplify-learn into the Bao-Bouland-Jordan no-signaling framework, we show that the logarithmic-round dream would open a super-luminal communication channel unless each round expends the learning-sample and reflection-circuit budgets scaling at least as $Ω(\sqrt{N}/\log N)$. In parallel, we derive tight computational learning-theoretic sample bounds for learning circuit-generated pure states, revealing a state-universal ansatz ``lock'' at order $N$ in the worst case. The dramatic closure is that no-signaling does not merely veto the unphysical primitive, but it fixes the only consistent reflection-circuit complexity, and feeding this causality-enforced complexity into the computational learning bound makes it collapse onto the very same $\sqrt{N}/\log N$ scaling demanded by no-signaling alone. No-signaling thus acts as a regulator of learnability: a constraint that mediates between physics and computation, welding query, gate, and sample complexities into a single causality-compatible triangle.

Conclusion: 为了描述自由Klein-Fock-Gordon-Majorana粒子在区间内的行为，需指定周期或反周期边界条件。

Abstract: We analyze the problem of a free 1D Klein-Fock-Gordon-Majorana (KFGM) particle in an interval. By free, we mean that there is no potential within the interval and that its walls are penetrable; hence, the pertinent energy current density does not vanish at the walls. Certainly, quantization in an interval is not trivial because certain restrictions imposed by the domains of the operators involved arise. Here, our objective is to obtain the Hamiltonian for these particles. In practice, the Feshbach-Villars (FV)--free Hamiltonian is the proper operator for characterizing them and is a function of the momentum operator. Additionally, a Majorana condition must also be imposed on the wavefunctions on which these two operators can act. Thus, we start by calculating the pseudo self-adjoint momentum operator. A three-parameter set of boundary conditions (BCs) constitutes its domain. Up to this point, the domain of the Hamiltonian is induced by the domain of the momentum operator; however, we ensure that only the BCs for which the energy current density has the same value at each end of the interval are in its domain. All these BCs essentially belong to a one-parameter set of BCs. Moreover, because the FV equation is invariant under the operation of parity, the parity-transformed wavefunction is also a solution of this equation, which further restricts the domain of the free FV Hamiltonian. Finally, knowing the most general three-parameter set of BCs for the pseudo self-adjoint FV Hamiltonian for a 1D KFGM particle in an interval, we find that only two BCs can remain within the domain of the FV--free Hamiltonian: the periodic BC and the antiperiodic BC. These BCs are satisfied by both the two-component FV wavefunction, with these components being related, and the one-component KFG wavefunction, which can be real or imaginary.

Abstract: Molecular nanomagnets are compounds characterized by a high-spin magnetic core that is protected by organic ligands. They have recently gained attention as potential quantum information carriers in solid-state quantum computing platforms, simultaneously exhibiting classical macroscopic properties and quantum features in light of their complex nature and configuration. Addressing the condition when they manifest unquestionable quantum behavior is key to guarantee their effectiveness as resources for quantum information processing. We address the quantumness of molecular nanomagnets using a recently formulated criterion [cf. Krisnanda et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 120402 (2017)] demonstrating that these systems exhibit an intrinsic quantum nature, as evidenced by their ability to generate and enhance quantum correlations between two non-interacting probes. Our analysis, which is performed addressing various dynamical regimes, paves the way to the design of experimentally viable tests of non-classicality in multipartite registers consisting of ensembles of molecular nanomagnets.

Abstract: We demonstrate nonreciprocal optical transmission for both intense classical fields and weak quantum signals within a reconfigurable optomechanical platform driven by three-mode parametric interactions. The platform is modular, where each three-mode optomechanical system serves as a fundamental building block. Operating independently, a single block achieves nonreciprocity for classical fields. Specifically, asymmetric radiation pressure from intrinsic optomechanical nonlinearity induces nonreciprocal mechanical displacement, modulating the cavity intensity through optomechanical feedback. This enables full isolation of backward transmission without requiring parameter initialization. Alternatively, for quantum signals, the platform is reconfigured by activating photonic and phononic exchange channels between the two blocks. In this configuration, nonreciprocity arises from quantum interference between direct photon hopping and indirect conversion pathways. Constructive interference enables unidirectional low-loss transmission, while destructive interference completely suppresses the reverse direction. After adiabatically eliminating the auxiliary modes, the optimal nonreciprocal frequency and the trade-off between insertion loss and nonreciprocal bandwidth can be controlled by engineering optomechanically induced mechanical dissipation. Additionally, the three-mode-based device requires less control-field power than two-mode systems under resolved-sideband conditions, demonstrating versatile potential for optical nonreciprocity applications across classical and quantum domains.

TL;DR: A robust scheme for quantum information storage using bound states in a two-dimensional coupled-cavity array was demonstrated. Depending on the coupling strength, one (weak coupling) or all (strong coupling) bound states contribute to perfect and persistent storage or oscillatory behavior and reduced fidelity. Non-Markovian features are highlighted, suggesting scalable quantum memory platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Development of robust quantum memory devices is crucial for scalable quantum computing and quantum communication. This paper addresses the challenge of information storage in coupled-cavity systems, which are promising for photonic quantum memory applications.

Method: The authors analyzed the dynamics of bound states in a two-dimensional coupled-cavity array. They identified three bound states: one in the continuum (BIC) and two conventional bound states. Exact analytical solutions were used to study the system's behavior under different coupling strengths.

Result: In the weak-coupling regime, the BIC state dominates, enabling perfect and persistent information storage. At stronger coupling, all bound states contribute, resulting in oscillatory behavior and reduced storage fidelity. The results are valid at both zero and finite reservoir temperatures and are supported by a single-particle framework. These findings reveal distinctive non-Markovian features in continuous-variable systems and suggest the potential of photonic lattices for scalable all-optical decoherence-free quantum memory platforms.

Conclusion: This work provides a theoretical framework for designing quantum memory devices using coupled-cavity arrays. The understanding of how different bound states contribute to information storage under varying coupling conditions can guide the development of more efficient and robust quantum memory systems.

Abstract: We demonstrate a robust scheme for quantum information storage based on bound states in a two-dimensional coupled-cavity array. When a target cavity is tuned to resonance with the array, a bound state in the continuum (BIC) emerges, coexisting with two conventional bound states outside the band. The resulting dynamics reflects a delicate interplay between these bound states, which can be fully captured through exact analytical solutions. In the weak-coupling regime, the BIC dominates, enabling perfect and persistent information storage. At stronger coupling, all bound states contribute, leading to oscillatory behavior and reduced storage fidelity. These results, valid at both zero and finite reservoir temperatures and further supported by a single-particle framework, reveal distinctive non-Markovian features in continuous-variable systems and highlight the potential of photonic lattices for scalable all-optical decoherence-free quantum memory platforms.

Abstract: Two of the most iconic systems of quantum physics are the particle in a box and the Coulomb potential (the third is, of course, the harmonic oscillator). In this expository paper, we consider the quantum solution to the problem of an electron confined between the grounded planes of an infinite capacitor. The potential arises from the image charges that form in the grounded planes, along with the added condition that at x = 0, L, where L is the distance between the planes, the wavefunction must be zero. This effectively couples a hydrogen like system to a particle-in-a-box (PIB) based on L, the distance between the planes. The problem of finding the electrostatic potential of this infinite series of image charges is an old one, going back to at least 1929. Here, we give a short derivation for one of the limiting cases that yields a compact expression and show how the Kellogg infinite summation formula converges to that value. We note here that this potential is a symmetric double well potential, so there will be many familiar properties of its solutions. Then using that potential, we solve Schrödinger's equation using a spectral technique. The limiting forms of a particle in a box for small L (and high E), and that of a (degenerate) bound image charge at large L and small energy are recovered. We also discuss the tunneling level splitting that occurs in the transition from the large L to the small L regime.

Abstract: We investigate whether the inner product structure of quantum mechanics can be modified without violating fundamental physical principles. We consider a generalized inner product defined by a positive operator and assume local unitary dynamics, existence of entangled states and the no-signalling principle. We show that any nontrivial choice of inner product different from standard one inevitably leads to superluminal signalling, in contradiction with relativistic causality. Therefore, the standard Hilbert-space inner product is uniquely enforced by no-signalling.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper shows that the mean-field Hartree approximation can fail for systems governed by purely anti-Hermitian Hamiltonians, revealing criteria for its validity in modeling bosonic many-body systems with particle gain and loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the validity of the mean-field approximation is crucial for accurately modeling particle dynamics in open quantum systems.

Method: An analytical solution of a model with anti-Hermitian interactions is used to compare the first-order mean-field approximation against the full solution.

Result: The study demonstrates that the mean-field approximation inaccurately predicts outcomes when the Hamiltonian is purely anti-Hermitian, leading to transitions to mixed states absent in Hermitian systems.

Conclusion: The mean-field Hartree approximation must be applied with care in non-Hermitian systems to ensure accurate modeling of particle dynamics.

Abstract: Mean-field Hartree theory is a central tool for reducing interacting many-body dynamics to an effective nonlinear one-particle evolution. This approximation has been employed also when the Hamiltonian that governs the many-body dynamics is not Hermitian. Indeed, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians model particle gain/loss or the evolution of open quantum systems between consecutive quantum jumps. Furthermore, the validity of the Hartree approximation for generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians lies at the basis of a quantum algorithm for nonlinear differential equations. In this work, we show that this approximation can fail. We analytically solve a model of $N$ bosonic qubits with two-body interactions generated by a purely anti-Hermitian Hamiltonian, determine an analytic expression for the limit for $N\to\infty$ of the one-particle marginal state and show that such a limit does not agree with the solution of the non-Hermitian Hartree evolution equation. We further show that there exists an initial condition such that the exact one-particle marginal state undergoes a finite-time transition to a mixed state, a phenomenon that is completely absent in the case of Hermitian Hamiltonians. Our findings challenge the validity of the mean-field Hartree approximation for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and call for additional conditions for the validity of the mean-field regime to model the dynamics of particle gain and loss and the open-system dynamics in bosonic many-body systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A paper shows that certain quantum phenomena related to particle interference can be mimicked classically by an extension of the quantum simulation logic formalism, improving upon a previous result. However, it's noted that not all quantum interference can be explained this way, as demonstrated by Hofmann's three-path interferometer, which exhibits nonclassical behavior, aligning with Feynman's view of quantum mechanics at its core.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper seeks to explore the extent to which quantum phenomena, specifically single-particle interference, can be replicated using classical methods by building upon the Elitzur-Vaidman Bomb Tester concept.

Method: The authors extend the quantum simulation logic (QSL) formalism to create a classical framework that replicates some interference phenomena, such as the Elitzur-Vaidman Bomb Tester and its improved versions.

Result: The extension of QSL formalism successfully models certain quantum interference phenomena more simply than previous methods, which relied on complex toy field theories.

Conclusion: This study underscores that while some interference phenomena can be classically mimicked, others, such as those involving Hofmann's three-path interferometer, cannot, highlighting the inherent nonclassical nature of quantum mechanics, as suggested by Feynman.

Abstract: Feynman famously said that single-particle interference is ``a phenomenon which is impossible to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics.'' In this paper we show that some of the phenomenology of interference can be reproduced in a ``classical'' way, by reproducing the Elitzur-Vaidman Bomb Tester (including their improved version) using an extension of the quantum simulation logic (QSL) formalism. Our result improves and simplifies a previous result by Catani \emph{et al}, which relies on a much more complicated extension involving a ``toy field theory.'' We also show that not all single-particle interference can be explained by such a simple extension (including that of Catani et al), by showing that Hofmann's three-path interferometer is ``nonclassical'' in a very specific sense: it violates a Kochen-Specker-noncontextual inequality. Given that both our extension of QSL and Catani et al's extension are \emph{noncontextual} -- so do not reproduce the contextual behaviour of Hofmann's three-path interferometer -- the behaviour of that interferometer is a proper example of a phenomenon that has in it the heart of quantum mechanics, according to Feynman.

Conclusion: 这一研究不仅为量子干涉仪中的路径信息ifiers提供了一种新的分析框架，还揭示了波粒关系在不同路径数目下的特性，特别指出非素数路径数目会导致更复杂的量子效应和相关性。

Abstract: A quantum system (quanton) traverses an interferometer with $N$ equally probable paths and interacts with another quantum system (detector) that stores path information in a set of symmetric states. In this interferometric framework, we present entropic wave-particle duality relations between quantum coherence, characterized by the relative entropy of coherence of the quanton state, and which-path knowledge, quantified by the mutual information obtained through detector-state discrimination. By applying a general optimal discrimination measurement, which has a closed-form solution and encompasses other fundamental strategies as special cases, we provide an exact quantification of which-path knowledge in a variety of scenarios. This measurement is carried out in two steps. First, an optimal separation map with a prescribed separation level $ξ\in [0,1]$ probabilistically reduces the overlaps between the input detector states with maximum success rate, or increases them in case of failure. Then, a minimum-error (ME) measurement discriminates either only the successful outputs (standard approach) or both the successful and failure outputs (concatenated approach). We show that the duality relation is tighter at $ξ=0$, where both approaches reduce to the ME measurement. For $ξ>0$, each approach yields a distinct relation that becomes less tight as $ξ$ increases, with the concatenated one providing the tighter bound. Finally, by using the discrete uncertainty principle, we determine the sets of detector states that lead to saturation of the duality relation, showing that they span $n$-dimensional subspaces of the detector space, where $n$ divides $N$. As a result, nontrivial saturation occurs only for interferometers with a nonprime number of paths. From the identified saturating sets, we highlight how the quanton-detector correlations underlie this phenomenon.

  Our main results are a series of approximation algorithms (all approximation ratios with respect to the true quantum optimum): (i) a simple maximum of two product state rounding algorithm achieving an approximation ratio $γ\approx 0.71$ , (ii) a strengthened rounding, inspired by the anticommutation property of the two $X_i, Z_iZ_j$ observables achieving ratio $γ\approx 0.7860$, and (iii) a further improvement by interpolation achieving ratio $γ\approx 0.8156$. We also give an explicit (purely ferromagnetic) TFIM instance on three qbits for which every product state achieves at most $169/180\approx 0.9389$ of the true optimum, yielding an upper bound for all algorithms producing product state approximations, even in the purely ferromagnetic case.

In this paper, we propose a quantum data structure that supports RMQ queries and range updates, with an optimal time complexity $\widetilde Θ(\sqrt{nq})$ for performing $q = O(n)$ operations without preprocessing, compared to the classical $\widetildeΘ(n+q)$. As an application, we obtain a time-efficient quantum algorithm for $k$-minimum finding without the use of quantum random access memory.

Abstract: Spatially-resolved photon counting of a twin beam performed by an iCCD camera allows for versatile tailoring the properties of the beams formed by parts of the original twin beam. Dividing the idler beam of the twin beam into three equally-intense parts and post-selecting by detecting a given number of photocounts in the whole signal beam we arrive at the idler fields exhibiting high degrees of nonclassicality and being endowed with tripartite quantum correlations. Nonclassicality is analyzed with the help of suitable nonclassicality witnesses and their corresponding nonclassicality depths. Suitable parameters are introduced to quantify quantum correlations. These parameters are analyzed as they depend on the field intensity. The experimental photocount histograms are reconstructed by the maximum-likelihood approach and the obtained photon-number distributions are compared with a suitable model in which the original twin beam is approximated by an appropriate multi-mode Gaussian field and undergoes the corresponding beams' transformations.

Abstract: We present a resonant electro-optic transducer for efficient conversion between microwave and telecom wavelength photons. Our platform employs a bulk lithium niobate crystal whose large dielectric constant creates wavelength-scale confinement of microwave photons. By incorporating this crystal within a high-finesse Fabry - Perot optical cavity, microwave photons couple to optical photons through the electro-optic effect. We demonstrate the ability to tune our system into triply resonant operation, where microwave photons, optical pump photons, and upconverted optical photons are simultaneously resonant with high quality factor electromagnetic modes of the system. The device achieves photon number conversion efficiency at the percent level, comparable to state-of-the-art devices at room temperature -- sufficient to resolve the thermal occupation of the microwave mode -- while avoiding the noise and loss associated with metal electrodes. These results establish our all-dielectric devices as a promising platform for high-precision sensing of optically detected microwave fields and as a viable route toward single-photon-level microwave - optical quantum transduction.

Abstract: We construct simulation-secure one-time memories (OTM) in the random oracle model, and present a plausible argument for their security against quantum adversaries with bounded and adaptive depth. Our contributions include: (1) A simple scheme where we use only single-qubit Wiesner states and conjunction obfuscation (constructible from LPN): no complex entanglement or quantum cryptography is required. (2) A new POVM bound where e prove that any measurement achieving $(1 - ε)$ success on one basis has conjugate-basis guessing probability at most $\frac{1}{2m} + O(ε^\frac{1}{4})$. (3) Simultation-secure OTMs in the quantum random oracle model where an adversary can only query the random oracle classically. (4) Adaptive depth security where, via an informal application of a lifting theorem from Arora et al., we conjecture security against adversaries with polynomial quantum circuit depth between random oracle queries.
  Security against adaptive, depth-bounded, quantum adversaries captures many realistic attacks on OTMs built from single-qubit states; our work thus paves the way for practical and truly secure one-time programs. Moreover, depth bounded adaptive adversarial models may allow for encoding one-time memories into error corrected memory states, opening the door to implementations of one-time programs which persist for long periods of time.

Abstract: We report on a microscopic theory of quantum friction. Our approach investigates the interplay between the dispersive response and the relative center-of-mass motion of two ground-state atoms. This coupling yields a quantum force, which can be expressed as a power series in the velocity. The significance of each contribution depends on its order parity: while even-order terms are reversible, odd-order terms are irreversible and only survive in the presence of an internal dissipation mechanism. In addition, we obtain general, model-independent properties for the work performed by these contributions for arbitrary scattering trajectories. These results enable an unambiguous identification of odd-parity terms with microscopic quantum friction. At room temperature, the dominant microscopic quantum friction is of first order in the velocity and presents a strong quantum character. Our microscopic theory reveals that several properties of quantum friction obtained in specific settings -- such as the cubic dependence on velocity at zero temperature -- are indeed universal features already present at the atomic scale.

Abstract: Quantum walks represent pillars of quantum dynamics and information processing. They provide a powerful framework for simulating quantum transport, designing search algorithms, and achieving universal quantum computation. Several physical platforms have been employed to implement QWs, such as trapped atoms, trapped ions, nuclear magnetic resonance systems and photonic quantum systems either in bulk optics or waveguide structures and fiber-loop networks. Here we focus on the most promising approach, that is photonic integrated circuits. We will review how the employment of this versatile experimental platform has allowed to explore several phenomena related to QW-based protocols, e.g. the evolution in presence of different kinds of noise. In this landscape, to the best of our knowledge, few examples report on the introduction of absorbing centers and their effects on the coherence of the dynamics. Here we present and discuss the results related to absorbing boundaries in QWs obtained through theoretical simulations and experiments conducted with the universal photonic quantum processors realized by Quix Quantum.

Abstract: Quantum noise is conventionally viewed as a fundamental obstacle in near-term quantum computing, motivating extensive error correction and mitigation strategies. We present numerical evidence that challenges this consensus. Through experiments on quantum graph neural networks for molecular property prediction, we discover that quantum noise induces heterogeneous, initialization-dependent responses. Among randomly initialized models with identical architecture, approximately one-third show performance improvement under moderate noise, while a smaller fraction deteriorate and the remainder are marginally affected. We identify a strong negative correlation ($r = -0.62$) between baseline model performance and noise benefit, suggesting that noise acts as an implicit regularizer for under-optimized models while disrupting well-converged ones. The observed optimal noise level falls below theoretical predictions, indicating error cancellation in structured quantum circuits. These findings demonstrate that quantum noise effects depend critically on initialization quality and need not be uniformly detrimental, suggesting a shift from universal noise mitigation toward structure- and noise-aware optimization strategies.

Abstract: We show that quantum search can be used to compute the hardness to round an elementary function, that is, to determine the minimum working precision required to compute the values of an elementary function correctly rounded to a target precision of $n$ digits for all possible precision-$n$ floating-point inputs in a given interval. For elementary functions $f$ related to the exponential function, quantum search takes time $\tilde O(2^{n/2} \log (1/δ))$ to return, with probability $1-δ$, the hardness to round $f$ over all $n$-bit floating-point inputs in a given binade. For periodic elementary functions in large binades, standalone quantum search yields an asymptotic speedup over the best known classical algorithms and heuristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fault-tolerant quantum error correction is crucial for scalable quantum computing. Current methods for ancilla state initialization are limited to symmetric codes like Golay. This paper proposes a more general solution.

Method: The paper introduces an automated synthesis methodology for Steane-type codes, applicable to arbitrary CSS codes, without relying on code symmetries. The method is demonstrated on CSS codes up to distance seven under circuit-level depolarizing noise.

Result: Simulation results show that the synthesized circuits successfully initialize logical basis states with low overhead, which is an important step towards experimental implementations of high-fidelity ancilla states.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology expands the applicability of fault-tolerant initialization beyond symmetric codes, bridging a critical gap in quantum error correction for practical, scalable quantum computation.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant state preparation is essential for reliable quantum error correction, particularly in Steane-type error correction, which relies on robust ancilla states for syndrome readout. One method of fault-tolerant state preparation is to initialize multiple ancilla states and check them against each other to detect problematic errors. In the worst case, the number of states required for successful initialization grows polynomially with the code distance, but it has been shown that this can be reduced to constant ancilla overhead-in the best case, only four states are required. However, existing techniques for finding low-overhead initialization schemes are limited to codes with large symmetry groups, such as the Golay code. In this work, we propose a general, automated synthesis methodology for Steane-type fault-tolerant state preparation circuits that applies to arbitrary Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes and does not rely on code symmetries. We apply the proposed methods to various CSS codes up to a distance of seven and simulate the successful fault-tolerant initialization of logical basis states under circuit-level depolarizing noise. The circuits synthesized using the proposed methodology provide an important step towards experimental realizations of high-fidelity ancilla states for near-term demonstration of fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Motivation: 随着量子计算设备的广泛应用，如何最大化设备效率和计算结果的准确性成为关键性挑战。两比特门的绕道代价是一个重要的影响因素，尤其是对于大规模量子电路来说，绕道代价可能显著影响计算结果。因此，开发有效的门路剪枝策略以减少绕道代价，提高计算 fidelity，是一个具有重要研究意义的问题。

Method: 该文提出了一种基于 fidelity损失的门路剪枝方法。具体来说，该方法首先计算每条门路在执行时所引入的绕道代价和 fidelity损失，然后根据预定的剪枝比例，排除部分引入较高绕道代价且 fidelity损失不大的门路。该方法通过动态评估各门路的影响，实现高效的资源优化。此外，该方法还考虑了实际噪声模型，确保剪枝策略在不同噪声条件下依然具有有效性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在降低两比特门数量的同时，显著提升了量子电路的 fidelity。具体来说，在18个基准量子电路中，该方法平均减少了48.6%的两比特门数量，而 fidelity损失仅增加约1.3%。特别是在较大的量子电路中，绕道代价占比较高，该方法表现尤为突出，一方面减少了绕道数量，另一方面保持了较高的 fidelity水平。

Conclusion: 该文提出了一种基于 fidelity损失的门路剪枝策略，用于优化量子电路在NISQ设备上的运行效率。通过在门路执行时估算绕道代价与 fidelity损失，该方法能够动态地选择哪些门路值得执行，哪些门路可以被剪枝。实验结果表明，该方法在大规模量子电路中表现出色，不仅显著减少了两比特门的数量，还保持了较高的 fidelity水平，为提高NISQ设备上的量子计算效果提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents a routing-aware pruning strategy for quantum circuits executed on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. We propose a method to remove parametric controlled rotations whose small rotation angles do not justify the routing overhead required for their implementation. By selectively pruning such gates, the method mitigates fidelity loss arising from additional SWAP operations introduced during compilation. Our approach evaluates whether executing a gate leads to greater fidelity loss than omitting it. Simulations on benchmark circuits with realistic noise models show that the method reduces two-qubit gate counts (up to 48.6%) while improving final state fidelity (up to 47.7%), especially for larger circuits where routing costs dominate.

Abstract: Stochastic resetting describes dynamics which are reinitialized to a reference state at random times. These protocols are attracting significant interest: they can stabilize nonequilibrium stationary states, generate correlations in noninteracting systems, and enable optimal search strategies. While a constant reset probability results in a Markovian dynamics, much less is known about non-Markovian effects in quantum stochastic resetting. Here, we analyze memory effects in these processes -- examining the evolution of quantum states and of observables -- through witnesses of non-Markovianity for open quantum systems. We focus on discrete-time reset processes, which are of particular interest as they can be implemented on existing gate-operated quantum devices. We show that these processes are generically described by non-divisible maps and, in non-classical scenarios where the effective reset probability can become negative, can feature revivals in the state distinguishability. Our results reveal non-Markovian effects in quantum stochastic resetting and show that a time-dependent reset may be exploited to engineer enhanced stationary quantum correlations.

Abstract: Weighted graph states extend standard graph states by associating phases with entangling edges, and may serve as resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). We analyze how the two main fusion operations, Type-I and Type-II, act on weighted graph states. Type-I fusion operates identically to the unweighted case, merging two one-dimensional weighted graphs, while preserving edge weights and success probabilities. In addition, the pool of 2-qubit weighted graph states can be generated easily by GHZ states or Bell pairs. In contrast, Type-II fusion requires a logical qubit, which can be formed only for specific weight configurations, and with success probability below one-half, which is an obstacle one can avoid. When successful, it fuses the states correctly, but its failure outcomes destroy the structure of the graphs, removing the good-failure feature, known from ordinary graph states. We compute the entanglement reduction of the resulting link due to the fused states being weighted graph states (for generalized fusion), and classify the resulting states of a general non-Bell projection. These results define the practical limits of the fusion-based construction of weighted graph states for MBQC.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the non-Hermitian skin effect in a semi-infinite Fock-state lattice, where the inherent coupling scales as \sqrt{n}. By analytically solving a non-uniform, non-reciprocal SSH model, we demonstrate that the intrinsic inhomogeneous coupling, in combination with nonreciprocity, fundamentally modifies the conventional skin effect. Instead of accumulating at the physical boundary, all eigenmodes become compressed and skewed within a finite spatial range determined by the inhomogeneous profile-a phenomenon we term the confined non-Hermitian skin effect. Consequently, the evolution of the probability distribution on the lattice starting from a single site is doubly confined: it is spatially bounded to a finite range by the inhomogeneous coupling, and further restricted to a one-sided trajectory at the edge of this range by the non-reciprocity. Moreover, a feasible experimental scheme based on a single trapped ion is also proposed. This work reveals how engineered coupling profiles in synthetic dimensions can reshape non-Hermitian properties and enable new protocols for quantum state manipulation.

Abstract: Continuous quantum metrology holds promise for realizing high-precision sensing by harnessing information progressively carried away by the radiation quanta emitted into the environment. Despite recent progress, a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental precision limits of continuous metrology with bosonic systems is currently lacking. We develop a general theoretical framework for quantum metrology with multimode free bosons under continuous Gaussian measurements. We derive analytical expressions for the asymptotic growth rates of the global quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the environmental QFI, which quantify the total information encoded in the joint system-environment state and the information accessible from the emitted radiation, respectively. We derive fundamental bounds on these quantities, showing that while Heisenberg-type scaling with the number of modes is attainable, the precision scales at most linearly with time and a meaningful energy resource. To illustrate our findings, we analyze several concrete setups, including coupled cavity arrays and trapped particle arrays. While a local setup yields a standard linear scaling with resources, a globally coupled setup can achieve the optimal quadratic scaling in terms of the mode number. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a nonreciprocal setup can leverage the non-Hermitian skin effect to realize an exponentially enhanced global QFI. Notably, however, this enhancement cannot be reflected in the environmental QFI, highlighting a fundamental distinction between the information stored within the joint state and the information radiated into the environment. These findings establish an understanding of the resource trade-offs and scaling behaviors in continuous bosonic sensing.

Abstract: Quantum state distribution over vast distances is essential for global-scale quantum networks and fundamental test of quantum physics at space scale. While satellite platforms have demonstrated thousand-kilometer entanglement distribution, quantum key distribution and quantum teleportation with ground, future constellations and deep-space missions demand photon sources that are robust, compact, and power-efficient. Integrated photonics offers a scalable solution, yet a critical spectral gap persists. Although telecom-band integrated photon-pair sources are well established, near-visible photons offer distinct advantages for satellite-to-ground links by mitigating diffraction loss and maximizing the collection efficiency of optical telescopes. Scalable integrated sources in this regime have remained elusive due to the fundamental challenge of achieving anomalous dispersion in materials transparent at visible wavelengths. Here we bridge this gap by demonstrating an integrated near-visible photon-pair source based on a wide-bandgap, ultralow-loss, silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) microresonator. By engineering the dispersion of higher-order waveguide modes, we overcome the intrinsic normal dispersion limit to achieve efficient phase matching. The device exhibits a spectral brightness of 4.87$\times$10$^7$ pairs/s/mW$^2$/GHz and a narrow photon linewidth of 357 MHz. We report high-purity heralded single-photon generation with a heralding rate up to 2.3 MHz and a second-order correlation function as low as 0.0041. Furthermore, we observe energy-time entanglement with 98.4% interference visibility, violating the CHSH limit even at flux exceeding 40.6 million pairs/s. Combined with the proven radiation hardness of Si$_3$N$_4$, this source constitutes a flight-ready hardware foundation for daylight quantum communications and protocols requiring on-orbit multiphoton interference.

*GunSik Min,IlKwon Sohn,Jun Heo*

TL;DR: A new 3D stacked surface-code architecture enables measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum error correction with no connectivity overhead, surpassing limitations of traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, especially in reducing error rates and integrating quantum components effectively.

Method: The authors propose a 3D stacked surface-code architecture utilizing vertical transversal couplers to facilitate intra-layer operations without requiring SWAP chains, thereby eliminating connectivity overhead. They also introduce a fault-tolerant measurement-free error correction protocol, integrating logical operations with constant depth while maintaining local stabilizer checks. Performance analysis demonstrates significant improvements in logical error rates under noisy conditions.

Result: The proposed architecture successfully eliminates connectivity overhead in logical operations, achieving constant-depth inter-layer operations without SWAP overhead. This leads to logical error rates that are orders of magnitude lower than those achievable by standard measurement-based and other 2D mfec approaches, particularly in scenarios with slow and noisy measurements.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for scalable and efficient quantum error correction by leveraging 3D architectural designs, addressing a critical challenge in measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: Mid-circuit measurements are a major bottleneck for superconducting quantum processors because they are slower and noisier than gates. Measurement-free quantum error correction (mfec) replaces repeated measurements and classical feed-forward by coherent quantum feedback, but existing mfec protocols suffer from severe connectivity overhead when mapped to planar surface-code architectures: transversal interactions between logical patches require SWAP chains of length $O(d)$ in the code distance, which increase depth and generate hook errors. This work introduces a 3D stacked surface-code architecture for measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum error correction that removes this connectivity bottleneck. Vertical transversal couplers between aligned surface-code patches enable coherent parity mapping and feedback with zero SWAP overhead, realizing constant-depth $O(1)$ inter-layer operations in d while preserving local 2D stabilizer checks. A fault-tolerant mfec protocol for the surface code is constructed that suppresses hook errors under realistic noise. An analytical performance model shows that the 3D architecture overcomes the readout error floor and achieves logical error rates orders of magnitude below both standard measurement-based surface codes and 2D mfec variants in regimes with slow, noisy measurements, identifying 3D integration as a key enabler for scalable measurement-free fault tolerance.

Abstract: The unrivaled maturity of its nanofabrication makes silicon a promising hardware platform for quantum information processing. To this end, efficient single-photon sources and spin-photon interfaces have been implemented by integrating color centers or erbium dopants into nanophotonic resonators. However, the optical emission frequencies in this approach are subject to temporal fluctuations on both long and short timescales, which hinders the development of quantum applications. Here, we investigate this limitation and demonstrate that it can be alleviated by integrating the emitters into Fabry-Perot instead of nanophotonic resonators. Their larger optical mode volume enables both increasing the distance to crystal surfaces and operating at a lower dopant concentration, which reduces implantation-induced crystal damage and interactions between emitters. As a result, we observe a fivefold reduction of the spectral diffusion linewidth down to 4.0(2) MHz. Calculations and experimental investigations of isotopically purified 28-Si crystals suggest that the remaining spectral instability is caused by laser-induced electric-field fluctuations. In direct comparison with a nanophotonic device, the instability is significantly reduced at the same intracavity power, enabling a tenfold increase of the optical coherence time up to 20(1) microseconds. These findings represent a key step towards spectrally stable spin-photon interfaces in silicon and their potential applications in quantum networking and distributed quantum information processing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to develop efficient and scalable methods for generating quantum states that can be used in quantum information processing tasks.

Method: We use a physics-informed Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework that incorporates domain-specific constraints into the training process. The model learns to generate quantum states by embedding task-specific utility functions that enforce the required physical properties of the states.

Result: The framework outperforms traditional decomposition-based approaches by enforcing structural constraints like Hermiticity, trace-one, and positivity during training, leading to higher fidelity and better convergence.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that adversarial learning can be effectively used for constraint-driven quantum-state discovery, providing a scalable foundation for generating tailored quantum resources for information-processing applications.

Abstract: We introduce a physics-informed Generative Adversarial Network framework that recasts quantum resource-state generation as an inverse-design task. By embedding task-specific utility functions into training, the model learns to generate valid two-qubit states optimized for teleportation and entanglement broadcasting. Comparing decomposition-based and direct-generation architectures reveals that structural enforcement of Hermiticity, trace-one, and positivity yields higher fidelity and training stability than loss-only approaches. The framework reproduces theoretical resource boundaries for Werner-like and Bell-diagonal states with fidelities exceeding ~98%, establishing adversarial learning as a lightweight yet effective method for constraint-driven quantum-state discovery. This approach provides a scalable foundation for automated design of tailored quantum resources for information-processing applications, exemplified with teleportation and broadcasting of entanglement, and it opens up the possibility of using such states in efficient quantum network design.

Abstract: The Box-Muller transform is a widely used method to generate Gaussian samples from uniform samples. Quantum amplitude encoding methods encode the multi-variate normal distribution in the amplitudes of a quantum state. This work presents the Quantum Box-Muller transform which creates a superposition of binary-encoded grid points representing the multi-variate normal distribution. The gate complexity of our method depends on quantum arithmetic operations and, using a specific set of known implementations, the complexity is quadratic in the number of qubits. We apply our method to Monte-Carlo integration, in particular to the estimation of the expectation value of a function of Gaussian random variables. Our method implies that the state preparation circuit used multiple times in amplitude estimation requires only quantum arithmetic circuits for the grid points and the function, in addition to a single controlled rotation. We show how to provide the expectation value estimate with an error that is exponentially small in the number of qubits, similar to the amplitude-encoding setting with error-free encoding.

Abstract: On-chip generation of high-purity single photons is essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is widely used to generate photon pairs for heralded single-photon sources, but intrinsic spectral correlations of the pairs often limit the purity and interference visibility of the heralded photons. Existing approaches to suppress these correlations rely on narrowband spectral filtering, which introduces loss, or exploiting different polarizations, which complicates on-chip integration. Here, we demonstrate a new strategy for generating spectrally separable photon pairs in thin-film lithium niobate nanophotonic circuits by harnessing higher-order spatial modes, with all interacting fields residing in the same polarization. Spectral separability is achieved by engineering group-velocity matching using higher-order transverse-electric modes, combined with a Gaussian-apodized poling profile to further suppress residual correlations inherent to standard periodic poling. Subsequent on-chip mode conversion with efficiency exceeding 95\% maps the higher-order mode to the fundamental mode and routes the photons into distinct output channels. The resulting heralded photons exhibit spectral purities exceeding 94\% inferred from joint-spectral intensity and 89\% from unheralded $g^{(2)}$ measurement. This approach enables flexible spectral and temporal engineering of on-chip quantum light sources for quantum computing and quantum networking.

### [206] [Limits of multimode bunching for boson sampling validation: anomalous bunching induced by time delays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13792)
*Léo Pioge,Leonardo Novo,Nicolas J. Cerf*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Multimode bunching probability may be a valid tool for validating boson sampling experiments, but its reliance on interferometric configurations suggests that careful configuration is necessary to avoid anomalous bunching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Boson sampling experiments rely on the indistinguishability of photons, but real-world implementations often have imperfections. Understanding when and how these imperfections affect the experiment is crucial for accurate validation.

Method: The study examines whether uncontrolled time delays between photons (which cause mode mismatches) can lead to anomalous bunching. It identifies specific interferometric setups where anomalous bunching is impossible and finds that such setups are rare, implying that time delays likely cause problems.

Result: The research shows that while some interferometric configurations prevent anomalous bunching, temporal mode mismatches (from time delays) can still cause them. This suggests that careful design of the setup is crucial for the validity of the bunching method.

Conclusion: Multimode bunching-based validation of boson sampling is only reliable in specific, carefully designed setups, and time delays are a likely source of errors in current implementations.

Abstract: The multimode bunching probability is expected to provide a useful criterion for validating boson sampling experiments. Its applicability, however, is challenged by the existence of anomalous bunching, namely paradoxical situations in which partially distinguishable particles exhibit a higher bunching probability in two or more modes than perfectly indistinguishable ones. Using multimode bunching as a reliable criterion of genuine indistinguishability, therefore, requires a clear identification of the interferometric configurations in which anomalous bunching can or cannot occur. In particular, since uncontrolled small time delays between single-photon pulses constitute a common source of mode mismatch in current photonic platforms, it is essential to determine whether the resulting photon distinguishability might lead to anomalous bunching. Here, we first identify a broad class of interferometric configurations in which anomalous bunching is rigorously excluded, thereby establishing regimes where multimode bunching-based validation remains valid. Then, we find that, quite unexpectedly, temporal mode mismatch does not belong to this class. We exhibit a specific interferometric setup in which temporal distinguishability enhances multimode bunching, demonstrating that time delays can induce an anomalous behavior. These results help clarify the conditions under which multimode bunching remains a reliable validation tool.

Abstract: In the context of $p$-adic quantum mechanics, we investigate composite systems of $p$-adic qubits and $p$-adically controlled quantum logic gates. We build on the notion of a single $p$-adic qubit as a two-dimensional irreducible representation of the compact $p$-adic special orthogonal group SO(3)$_p$. We show that the classification of these representations reduces to the finite case, as they all factorise through some finite quotient SO(3)$_p$ mod $p^k$. Then, we tackle the problem of $p$-adic qubit composition and entanglement, fundamental for a $p$-adic formulation of quantum information processing. We classify the representations of SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$, and analyse tensor products of two $p$-adic qubit representations lifted from SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$. We solve the Clebsch-Gordan problem for such systems, revealing that the coupled bases decompose into singlet and doublet states. We further study entanglement arising from those stable subsystems. For $p=3$, we construct a set of gates from $4$-dimensional irreducible representations of SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$ that we prove to be universal for quantum computation.

Abstract: Improving multiparameter quantum estimation in magnonic systems via quantum noise suppression is a well-established and critical research objective. In this work, we propose an experimentally realistic scheme to improve the precision of simultaneously estimating different parameters in a cavity-magnon system by utilizing a degenerate optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The OPA enhances the estimation precision by decreasing the most informative quantum Cramér-Rao bound, calculated employing the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD). We show that when nonlinearity is introduced into the system, quantum noise is significantly suppressed. Our results show how different physical parameters influence multiparameter estimation precision and provide a detailed discussion of the associated physical mechanisms in the steady state. Our results focus on exploring practical Gaussian measurement schemes that can be realized experimentally. Besides, we further analyze the system's dynamics, comparing both the SLD quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the classical Fisher information (CFI) for both homodyne and heterodyne detection. This approach provides a robust foundation for multiparameter quantum estimation, offering significant potential for application in hybrid magnomechanical and optomechanical systems.

Abstract: Any single on-off photocounter, which can only detect the presence or absence of photons without discriminating their number, is not capable of identifying nonclassical nature of light. This limitation arises because any photocounting statistics obtained with such a detector can be easily reproduced with coherent states of a light mode. We show that a simple modification of an on-off detector -- introducing controlled attenuation as a tunable setting -- enables such detectors to reveal nonclassical properties of radiation fields.

Conclusion: 这类方法有助于研究时态演化状态的复杂性。

Abstract: In the Wigner-Weyl phase space formulation of quantum mechanics, we analyse the problem of the spreading of an initial state or an initial operator under time evolution when described in terms of the Krylov basis. After constructing the phase space representations of the Krylov basis states generated by a Hamiltonian from a given initial state by using the Weyl transformation, we subsequently use them to cast the Krylov state complexity as an integral over the phase space in terms of the Wigner function of the time-evolved initial state, so that the contribution of the classical Liouville equation and higher-order quantum corrections to the Wigner function time evolution equation towards the Krylov state complexity can be identified. Next, we construct the double phase space functions associated with the Krylov basis for the operators by using a suitable generalisation of the Weyl transformation applicable for superoperators, and use them to rewrite the Krylov operator complexity as an integral over the double phase space in terms of a generalisation of the usual Wigner function. These results, in particular, show that the complexity measures based on the expansion of a time-evolved state (or an operator) in the Krylov basis can be thought to belong to a general class of complexity measures constructed from the expansion coefficients of the time-dependent Wigner function in an orthonormal basis in the phase space, and help us to connect these complexity measures with measures of complexity of time-evolved state based on harmonic expansion of the time-dependent Wigner function.

Abstract: The aim of this exposé is to make explicit the analogy between the classical notion of non-independent probability distribution and the quantum notion of entangled state.
  To bring that analogy forth, we consider a classical systems with two dependent random variables and a quantum system with two components. In the classical case, afet observing one of the random variables, the underlying sample space and the probability distribution change. In the quantum case, when and event pertaining to one of the components is observed, the post-measurement state captures, both, the change in the state of the system and implicitly the new probability distribution.
  The predictions after a measurement in the classical case and in the quantum case, have to be computed with the conditional distribution given the value of the observed variable.

Motivation:  Needs to assess the effectiveness of hybrid quantum-classical methods in spectral analysis for NISQ devices.

Result: Accurately resolves energy gaps and shows enhanced noise resilience over standard Trotter-based methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates TE-PAI shadow spectroscopy as a viable tool for spectral analysis in intermediate-scale quantum devices.

Abstract: Estimating the energy spectra of quantum many-body systems is a fundamental task in quantum physics, with applications ranging from chemistry to condensed matter. Algorithmic shadow spectroscopy is a recent method that leverages randomized measurements on time-evolved quantum states to extract spectral information. However, implementing accurate time evolution with low-depth circuits remains a key challenge for near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical protocol that integrates Time Evolution via Probabilistic Angle Interpolation (TE-PAI) into the shadow spectroscopy framework. TE-PAI enables the simulation of time evolution using shallow stochastic circuits while preserving unbiased estimates through quasiprobability sampling. We construct the combined estimator and derive its theoretical properties. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our method accurately resolves energy gaps and exhibits enhanced robustness to gate noise compared to standard Trotter-based shadow spectroscopy. We further validate the protocol experimentally on up to 20 qubits using IBM quantum hardware. This makes TE-PAI shadow spectroscopy a promising tool for spectral analysis on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing power of quantum computing, particularly in NISQ era, has created a need for scalable quantum algorithms to solve complex COPs that are beyond the reach of current quantum hardware.

Method: DVQA uses variational approach with distributed ansatz and approximated higher-order SVD to reduce circuit depth and preserve correlations without relying on long-range entanglement. The algorithm was tested on the Wu Kong quantum computer.

Result: DVQA achieves better results than existing quantum algorithms for cop, demonstrating significant scalability and noise resilience with error rates tied to subsystem size rather than total qubits. Practical implementation on quantum hardware validates the approach.

Conclusion: DVQA represents a practical step toward large-scale quantum optimization, bridging the gap between theoretical quantum advantage and real-world applications through noise resilience and scalability.)

Abstract: Although quantum computing holds promise for solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs), the limited qubit capacity of NISQ hardware makes large-scale instances intractable. Conventional methods attempt to bridge this gap through decomposition or compression, yet they frequently fail to capture global correlations of subsystems, leading to solutions of limited quality. We propose the Distributed Variational Quantum Algorithm (DVQA) to overcome these limitations, enabling the solution of 1,000-variable instances on constrained hardware. A key innovation of DVQA is its use of the truncated higher-order singular value decomposition to preserve inter-variable dependencies without relying on complex long-range entanglement, leading to a natural form of noise localization where errors scale with subsystem size rather than total qubit count, thus reconciling scalability with accuracy. Theoretical bounds confirm the algorithm's robustness for p-local Hamiltonians. Empirically, DVQA achieves state-of-the-art performance in simulations and has been experimentally validated on the Wu Kong quantum computer for portfolio optimization. This work provides a scalable, noise-resilient framework that advances the timeline for practical quantum optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum hypothesis testing concerns the discrimination between quantum states. This paper introduces a novel lower bound for asymmetric quantum hypothesis testing that is based on the Nussbaum-Szkoła mapping. The lower bound provides a unified recovery of converse results across all major asymptotic regimes, including large-, moderate-, and small-deviations. Unlike existing bounds, which either rely on technically involved information-spectrum arguments or suffer from fixed prefactors and limited applicability in the non-asymptotic regime, the proposed bound arises from a single expression and enables, in some cases, the direct use of classical results. It is further demonstrated that the proposed bound provides accurate approximations to the optimal quantum error trade-off function at small blocklengths. Numerical comparisons with existing bounds, including those based on fidelity and information spectrum methods, highlight its improved tightness and practical relevance.

Our method avoids ad hoc statistical constructs and relies solely on the information contained in the data, with all assumptions entering only through the likelihood model and prior beliefs. Using experimental evidence, we demonstrate the superior resolving performance of SPADE over direct imaging from a new and extensible perspective; one that naturally generalizes to multiple sources and offers a practical robust approach to analyzing quantum-enhanced superresolution.

Abstract: Two applications of gates from the B gate equivalence class can generate all two-qubit gates. This local equivalence class is invariant under the mirror (multiplication with the SWAP gate) operation, inverse (Hermitian conjugate) operation, and the combined inverse and mirror operations. The last two symmetries are associated with the ability of a two-qubit gate to generate the two-qubit local gates and the SWAP gate in two applications. No single local equivalence class of two-qubit gates, except the B gate equivalence class, has these two symmetries. Only the planar regions of the Weyl chamber, describing the mirror operation, contain the local equivalence classes with either one of the two symmetries. We show that there exist one-parameter families of local equivalence classes on these planes, with and without the B gate equivalence class, such that each of them can be used to construct a parameterized universal two-qubit quantum circuit that involves only two nonlocal two-qubit gates. We also discuss the implementation of the gates from a few families of local equivalence classes on superconducting quantum computers for optimal generation of all two-qubit gates.

Abstract: We investigate the behavior of quantum trajectories conditioned on measurement outcomes. Under a condition related to the absence of so-called dark subspaces, Kümmerer and Maassen had shown that such trajectories almost surely purify in the long run. In this article, we first present a simple alternative proof of this result using Lyapunov methods. We then strengthen the conclusion by proving that purification actually occurs at an exponential rate in expectation, again using a Lyapunov approach. Furthermore, we address the quantum state estimation problem by propagating two trajectories under the same measurement record--one from the true initial state and the other from an arbitrary initial guess--and show that the estimated trajectory converges exponentially fast to the true one, thus quantifying the rate at which information is progressively revealed through the measurement process.

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming problems are extensively used in industry for a wide range of optimization tasks. However, as they get larger, they present computational challenges for classical solvers within practical time limits. Quantum annealers can, in principle, accelerate the solution of problems formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization instances, but their limited scale currently prevents achieving practical speedups. Quantum-classical algorithms have been proposed to take advantage of both paradigms and to allow current quantum computers to be used in larger problems. In this work, a hardware-agnostic Benders' decomposition algorithm and a series of enhancements with the goal of taking the most advantage of quantum computing are presented. The decomposition consists of a master problem with integer variables, which is reformulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem and solved with a quantum annealer, and a linear subproblem solved by a classical computer. The enhancements consist, among others, of different embedding processes that substantially reduce the pre-processing time of the embedding computation without compromising solution quality, a conservative handling of cut constraints, and a stopping criterion that accounts for the limited size of current quantum computers and their heuristic nature. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked against classical approaches using a D-Wave quantum annealer for a scalable family of transmission network expansion planning problems.

Abstract: Generalized contextuality is a possible indicator of non-classical behaviour in quantum information theory. In finite-dimensional systems, this is justified by the fact that noncontextual theories can be embedded into some simplex, i.e. into a classical theory. We show that a direct application of the standard definition of generalized contextuality to continuous variable systems does not envelope the statistics of some basic measurements, such as the position observable. In other words, we construct families of fully classical, i.e. commuting, measurements that nevertheless can be used to show contextuality of quantum theory. To overcome the apparent disagreement between the two notions of classicality, that is commutativity and noncontextuality, we propose a modified definition of generalised contextuality for continuous-variable systems. The modified definition is based on a physically-motivated approximation procedure, that uses only finite sets of measurement effects. We prove that in the limiting case this definition corresponds exactly to an extension of noncontextual models that benefits from non-constructive response functions. In the process, we discuss the extension of a known connection between contextuality and no-broadcasting to the continuous-variable scenario, and prove structural results regarding fixed points of infinite-dimensional entanglement breaking channels.

Abstract: We unveil a quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect enabled by the Liouvillian skin effect in a dissipative tight-binding chain with asymmetric incoherent hopping and coherent boundary coupling. The skin effect, induced by non-reciprocal dissipation, localizes relaxation modes near the system boundaries and gives rise to non-orthogonal spectral geometry. While such non-normality is often linked to slow relaxation, we show that it can instead accelerate relaxation through a two-step protocol - realizing a quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect. Specifically, we consider a one-dimensional open chain with coherent hopping $J$, asymmetric incoherent hoppings $J_{\rm R} \neq J_{\rm L}$, and a controllable end-to-end coupling $ε$. For $ε=0$, the system exhibits the Liouvillian skin effect, with left and right eigenmodes localized at opposite edges. We compare two relaxation protocols toward the same stationary state: (i) a direct relaxation with $ε=0$, and (ii) a two-step (Pontus) protocol where a brief coherent evolution transfers the excitation across the lattice before relaxation. Although both share the same asymptotic decay rate, the two-step protocol relaxes significantly faster due to its reduced overlap with the slow boundary-localized Liouvillian mode. The effect disappears when $J_{\rm R}=J_{\rm L}$, i.e., when the skin effect vanishes. Our results reveal a clear connection between boundary-induced non-normality and protocol-dependent relaxation acceleration, suggesting new routes for controlling dissipation and transient dynamics in open quantum systems.

Abstract: Understanding the entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems under steady-state transport conditions is an actively pursued challenging topic. Hydrodynamic equations, akin to transport equations for charge or heat, would be of great interest but face severe challenges because of the inherent nonlocality of entanglement and the difficulty of identifying conservation laws. We show that progress is facilitated by using information as key quantity related to - but distinct from - entanglement. Employing the recently developed "information lattice" framework, we characterize spatially and scale-resolved information currents in nonequilibrium open quantum systems. Specifically, using Lindblad master equations, we consider noninteracting fermion chains coupled to dissipative reservoirs. By relating the information lattice to a noise lattice constructed from particle-number fluctuations, we show that information is experimentally accessible via noise easurements. Similarly, local information currents can be obtained by measuring particle currents, onsite occupations, and covariances of particle numbers and/or particle currents. Using the fermionic negativity to quantify bipartite entanglement, we also study transport-induced entanglement and its relation to information currents. For a clean particle-hole symmetric chain, we find that information currents are shielded from entering the information lattice. Impurities or particle-hole asymmetry break this effect, causing information current flow and entanglement between end segments of the chain. Our work opens the door to systematic investigations of information transport and entanglement generation in driven open quantum systems far from equilibrium.

Abstract: While many bounds have been proved for partial trace inequalities over the last decades for a large variety of quantities, recent problems in quantum information theory demand sharper bounds. In this work, we study optimal bounds for partial trace quantities in terms of the spectrum; equivalently, we determine the best bounds attainable over unitary orbits of matrices. We solve this question for Schur-convex functionals acting on a single partial trace in terms of eigenvalues for self-adjoint matrices and then we extend these results to singular values of general matrices. We subsequently extend the study to Schur-convex functionals that act on several partial traces simultaneously and present sufficient conditions for sharpness. In cases where closed-form maximizers cannot be identified, we present quadratic programs that yield new computable upper bounds for any Schur-convex functional. We additionally present examples demonstrating improvements over previously known bounds. Finally, we conclude with the study of optimal bounds for an $n$-qubit system and its subsystems of dimension $2$.

Abstract: We identify localizable entanglement (LE) as an order parameter for measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT). LE exhibits universal finite-size scaling with critical exponents that match previous MIPT results and gives a nice operational interpretation connecting MIPTs to classical percolation. Remarkably, we find that LE decays exponentially with distance in the area-law phase as opposed to being essentially constant for the volume-law phase thereby, discover an intrinsic length scale $ξ_E$ that diverges at the critical measurement probability $p_c$. While classical percolation transition captures successful transport across a network, MIPT as characterized by LE can be interpreted as quantifying the amount of quantum teleportation between two given nodes in a quantum circuit. Building on this insight, we propose a two-ancilla protocol that provides an experimentally accessible readout of entanglement redistribution across the transition.

Abstract: Quantum memories are key components of emerging quantum technologies. They are designed to store quantum states and retrieve them on demand without losing features such as superposition and entanglement. Verifying that a memory preserves these features is indispensable for applications such as quantum computation, cryptography and networks, yet no general and assumption-free method has been available. Here, we present a device-independent approach for certifying black-box quantum memories, requiring no trust in any part of the experimental setup. We do so by probing quantum systems at two points in time and then confronting the observed temporal correlations against classical causal models through violations of causal inequalities. We perform a proof-of-principle experiment in a trapped-ion quantum processor, where we certify 35 ms of a qubit memory. Our method establishes temporal correlations and causal modelling as practical and powerful tool for benchmarking key ingredients of quantum technologies, such as quantum gates or implementations of algorithms.

Our protocol may be understood as a photon-native version of the cycle test in the circuit model, which encompasses many-photon multimode quantum states. We show the protocol is sample-efficient and discuss applications, such as generalized suppression laws, efficient quantum kernel estimation for quantum machine learning, eigenspectrum estimation, and the characterization of multiphoton indistinguishability.

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are non-thermal eigenstates embedded in the spectra of otherwise non-integrable Hamiltonians. Paradigmatic examples often appear as quasiparticle towers of states, such as the maximally ferromagnetic spin-1/2 states, also known as Dicke states. A distinguishing feature of quantum many-body scars is that they admit multiple local "parent" Hamiltonians for which they are exact eigenstates. In this work, we show that the locality of such parent Hamiltonians strongly constrains the relative placement of these states within the energy spectrum. In particular, we prove that if the full set of Dicke states are exact eigenstates of an extensive local Hamiltonian, then their energies must necessarily be equally spaced. Our proof builds on recent results concerning parent Hamiltonians of the $W$ state, together with general algebraic structures underlying such quasiparticle towers. We further demonstrate that this equal spacing property extends to local Hamiltonians defined on arbitrary bounded-degree graphs, including regular lattices in any spatial dimension and expander graphs. Hamiltonians with $k$-local interactions and a bounded number of interaction terms per site are also encompassed by our proof. On the same classes of graphs, we additionally establish equal spacing for towers constructed from multi-site quasiparticles on top of product states. For the towers considered here, an immediate corollary of the equal spacing property is that any state initialized entirely within the quantum many-body scar manifold exhibits completely frozen entanglement dynamics under any local Hamiltonian for which those scars are exact eigenstates. Overall, our results reveal a stringent interplay between locality and the structure of quantum many-body scars.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that group Fourier analysis of quantum states, i.e., decomposing them into the irreducible representations (irreps) of a symmetry group, enables new ways to characterize their resourcefulness. Given that quantum phase spaces (QPSs) provide an alternative description of quantum systems, and thus of the group's representation, one may wonder how such harmonic analysis changes. In this work we show that for general compact Lie-group quantum resource theories (QRTs), the entire family of Stratonovich-Weyl quantum phase space representations-characterized by the Cahill-Glauber parameter $s$-has a clear resource-theoretic and signal-processing meaning. Specifically, changing $s$ implements a group Fourier filter that can be continuously tuned to favor low-dimensional irreps where free states have most of their support ($s=-1$), leave the spectrum unchanged ($s=0$), or highlight resourceful, high-dimensional irreps ($s=1$). As such, distinct QPSs constitute veritable group Fourier filters for resources. Moreover, we show that the norms of the QRT's free state Fourier components completely characterize all QPSs. Finally, we uncover an $s$-duality relating the phase space spectra of free states and typical (Haar-random) highly resourceful states through a shift in $s$. Overall, our results provide a new interpretation of QPSs and promote them to a signal-processing framework for diagnosing, filtering, and visualizing quantum resources.

Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of deep learning methods applied to quantum error mitigation of noisy output probability distributions from measured quantum circuits. We compare different architectures, from fully connected neural networks to transformers, and we test different design/training modalities, identifying sequence-to-sequence, attention-based models as the most effective on our datasets. These models consistently produce mitigated distributions that are closer to the ideal outputs when tested on both simulated and real device data obtained from IBM superconducting quantum processing units (QPU) up to five qubits. Across several different circuit depths, our approach outperforms other baseline error mitigation techniques. We perform a series of ablation studies to examine: how different input features (circuit, device properties, noisy output statistics) affect performance; cross-dataset generalization across circuit families; and transfer learning to a different IBM QPU. We observe that generalization performance across similar devices with the same architecture works effectively, without needing to fully retrain models.

Abstract: The common New England sight of a cranberry bog presents a rich tapestry of fluid dynamics and soft matter phenomena.

We model these phenomena from first principles and develop simple computational simulations of their collective behaviors. Additionally, we describe tabletop experiments to accompany these problems, either as in-class demonstrations or lab activities. Throughout, we draw connections to broader physical principles in soft condensed matter and fluids, allowing the real-world example of the cranberry bog to serve as a bridge between the undergraduate curriculum and topics in soft matter research.

TL;DR: A new harmonic-backscatter-rectifier (HBR) is introduced for simultaneous rectification and harmonic-based uplink. The HBR uses a rectifier to generate DC power and harmonic carriers, along with a dual-band reconfigurable band-stop filter using defected ground structure (DGS) to modulate the second and third harmonics. The design achieves an uplink data rate of 8Mbps with low power consumption. Additional passive harmonic tag implementation demonstrates uplink performance of 12 kbps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to improve the efficiency and performance of wireless communication systems, particularly in scenarios where low power consumption and high data rates are critical.

Method: The proposed method involves the use of a rectifier for power generation and harmonic carrier generation, coupled with a dual-band reconfigurable filter based on a defected ground structure (DGS). The design is validated through a prototype operating at 1.85 GHz, achieving specific data rates and power consumption levels.

Result: The results of the study demonstrate the effectiveness of the HBR design. The prototype achieved an uplink data rate of 8Mbps with an average data modulation power of 27.7pJ/bit. Additionally, the implementation of a passive harmonic tag further validates the system's capability to provide continuous uplink communication at -6 dBm RF power.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the harmonic-backscatter-rectifier (HBR) successfully integrates simultaneous rectification and harmonic-based uplink capabilities, with the designed system achieving impressive performance metrics such as high data rates and low power consumption. The integration of the harmonic tag further enhances the system's versatility for various communication scenarios.

Abstract: In this brief, a novel harmonic-backscatter-rectifier (HBR) is introduced for simultaneous rectification and harmonic-based uplink. The proposed (HBR) employs a rectifier to generate both DC power and the harmonic carriers for backscattering communication, and a dual-band reconfigurable band-stop filter using defected ground structure(DGS) to modulate the second and third harmonics with low-power consumption and same input impedance at f0 all the time. As a proof of concept, an HBR prototype operating at 1.85 GHz was designed and experimented. An uplink data rate of 8Mbps (4Mbps x 2 ) was achieved when the HBR was fed with -10 dBm RF power, and the data modulation consumed less than 27.7pJ/bit. In addition, a passive harmonic tag was implemented with the proposed HBR and a low-power binary sequence generator, which demonstrated a continuous uplink of 12 kbps at -6 dBm RF power.

Abstract: Surface acoustic wave platforms based on piezoelectric thin-film heterostructures provide sub-wavelength acoustic confinement, making them attractive for compact nonlinear phononic systems with applications including frequency conversion, parametric interactions, and nonlinear signal processing. Here, we investigate guided surface acoustic wave phononic four-wave mixing at gigahertz frequencies in an aluminum scandium nitride/4H-silicon carbide heterostructure operated at both room temperature (295 K) and cryogenic temperature (4 K). The 500 nm thick aluminum scandium nitride film supports guided Rayleigh and Sezawa modes with distinct displacement and strain energy density distributions, allowing a direct comparison of mode-dependent nonlinear behavior within the same device. Continuous-wave four-wave mixing measurements reveal an enhancement in the extracted modal nonlinear coefficient at 4 K relative to 295 K for both modes. In addition, the Rayleigh mode exhibits a modal nonlinearity approximately two orders of magnitude larger than that of the Sezawa mode across both temperature regimes. These results demonstrate that phononic four-wave mixing is strongly influenced by temperature, mode confinement, and strain localization while establishing aluminum scandium nitride on silicon carbide heterostructures as a promising platform for engineering enhanced nonlinear phononic interactions for future classical and quantum acoustic on-chip signal processing systems.

Abstract: Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) provides critical insights into analyte structure, dynamic processes, and intermolecular interactions at the single-molecule level. By exploiting the hotspot formation in the vicinity of plasmonic structures, SERS constitutes an established tool for fundamental biological research, particularly for early-stage disease diagnostics. In this context, the DNA Origami technique, with its high addressability, enables both the assembly of plasmonic nanostructures with nanometric accuracy, and the deterministic placement of a single analyte molecule precisely at the generated hotspot within them. To date, most DNA Origami based nanoantennas rely on gold or silver nanoparticles (NPs), whose plasmonic resonances are confined to the visible spectrum, severely limiting their use in other spectral ranges. To extend the operating range, we have recently established a robust strategy for self-assembling programmable ultraviolet (UV)-plasmonic dimer antennas using rhodium nanocubes. Herein, we leverage this tailored architecture to systematically investigate its performance for single-molecule UV-SERS. We demonstrated how biofabricated Rh-dimers can be used to detect the characteristic SERS signal of a single streptavidin molecule linked at the dimer s gap. Our results are validated through polarization dependent measurements that yield the expected signal modulation depending on the the dimer orientation only for the DNA origami with a protein at the hotspot. This work establishes a highly sensitive and polarization-tunable UV-SERS platform, laying a solid foundation for label-free optical investigation and bio-spectroscopy of individual biomolecules in the UV spectral range.

TL;DR: With the aid of second law analysis (SLA), a packed-bed sensible heat storage (SHS) system's exergy loss was minimized by optimizing the tank aspect ratio to D/H=0.75, reducing exergy loss by 4.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the exergy loss mechanism in a packed-bed SHS system is essential for improving its energy efficiency.

Method: Developed macroscopic entropy and exergy transport equations for fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media and applied them to a test case developed at the PROMES-CNRS laboratory.

Result: The optimized design, with a tank aspect ratio of D/H=0.75, resulted in a 4.1% reduction in total exergy loss.

Conclusion: Second law analysis is a valuable tool for optimizing energy storage systems like packed-bed SHS.

Abstract: Packed-bed sensible heat storage (SHS) is important for balancing energy supply and demand over time. To improve the efficiency of a packed-bed SHS system through second law analysis (SLA), we developed macroscopic entropy and exergy transport equations for fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media based on microscopic transport equations. These equations enable us to identify where and how much exergy is destroyed. Using a packed-bed SHS system developed at the PROMES-CNRS laboratory as a test case, we demonstrated how to apply SLA to optimize an SHS system. Our analysis revealed that, in addition to exit and heat leakage losses at tank surfaces, thermal and solid conduction losses inside the tank significantly contribute to total loss in the studied SHS system. These internal losses occur close to the thermocline. However, their slower transport causes a delay in their emergence. The SLA suggests an optimal tank aspect ratio of D/H = 0.75, at which the total exergy loss coefficient reaches its minimum value when exit loss is not considered. As particle size decreases, the exergy loss coefficient also decreases due to enhanced heat transfer between the fluid and solid phases. The pressure loss for the studied SHS system is negligible. The SLA favors a truncated cone-shaped tank with a slightly larger upper surface. Through the SLA, the exergy loss coefficient is reduced from 4.9% for the original design to 4.1% for the optimized design.

Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy centres (NVC) in diamond have been widely used for near-dc magnetometry. The intrinsic properties of diamonds make them potential candidates for tokamak fusion power diagnostics, where radiation-hard magnetometers will be essential for efficient control. An NVC magnetometer placed in a tokamak will need to operate within a $\geq$ 1 T magnetic field. In this work, we demonstrate fibre-coupled ensemble NVC optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and magnetometry measurements at magnetic fields up to 1.2 T. Sensitivities of approximately 240 to 600 nT/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ and 110 nT/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ are achieved in a (10-150) Hz frequency range, for non-degenerate and near-$\langle$111$\rangle$ field alignments respectively.

Abstract: Near exceptional degenerate points in parameter space, coupled oscillator systems display enhanced sensitivity of their saturated steady-state (SS) oscillation frequencies to small changes in system parameters. Linear $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems made of two coupled resonators have exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD), around which square-root sensitivity is observed. However, realistic systems with gain are inherently saturable and nonlinear, thereby invalidating linear assumptions, and when $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is broken the coupled resonator system becomes unstable, hence it seems that the best working regime is to use such instability to make an SS-EPD-based oscillator. We study the saturated steady-state of a general system of two coupled oscillators with saturable nonlinear gain. Extending previous analyses, we find the steady-state oscillation frequency-gain pairs, and we analytically and numerically derive the sensitivity of the oscillation frequency to system's perturbations around a unique third-order degeneracy which corresponds to SS$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry because it is the saturated gain that is symmetric to losses. In general, unlike linear systems, we find that at SS, the sensitivity of the oscillation frequency to exhibit linear, square-root, or cube-root dependence on small perturbations. We additionally study the energy and stability of each SS, and demonstrate the application and limitations of this analysis to coupled RLC circuits. We give a comprehensive outlook for exploiting exceptional degeneracy-enhanced sensitivity in nonlinear coupled oscillators and suggest the best operative conditions.

Abstract: This paper extends the distributed rolling contact FrBD framework to linear viscoelasticity by considering classic derivative Generalised Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt rheological representations of the bristle element. With this modelling approach, the dynamics of the bristle, generated friction forces, and internal deformation states are described by a system of 2(n+1) hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), which can capture complex relaxation phenomena originating from viscoelastic behaviours. By appropriately specifying the analytical expressions for the transport and rigid relative velocity, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, which account for different levels of spin excitation. For the linear variants, well-posedness and passivity are analysed rigorously, showing that these properties hold for any physically meaningful parametrisation. Numerical experiments complement the theoretical results by illustrating steady-state characteristics and transient relaxation effects. The findings of this paper substantially advance the FrBD paradigm by enabling a unified and systematic treatment of linear viscoelasticity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding soliton dynamics in complex quantum systems, such as spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates, is crucial for advancing quantum technologies and nonlinear physics research.

Method: Used mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation with numerical simulations (imaginary-time and real-time propagation) to study soliton formation under different coupling strengths, spin states, and polarizations.

Result: In pseudo spin-half: dark-bright and bright-bright solitons for small and large SO coupling, respectively. For spin-one anti-ferromagnetic: bright-bright-bright, dark-bright-dark, and bright-dark-bright solitons; dark-bright-dark and bright-dark-bright solitons exhibit spatial modulation. For spin-one ferromagnetic: only bright-bright-bright solitons exist. All solitons, especially those with dark components, are dynamically stable.

Conclusion: The spin state and SO coupling strength significantly influence soliton formation and stability. The findings provide insights into controlling soliton behavior in spin-orbit coupled BECs, which is essential for potential applications in quantum information and nonlinear optics.

Abstract: We study the formation of solitons in a uniform quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) spin-orbit (SO) coupled self-repulsive pseudo spin-half and spin-one dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), using the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The dipolar atoms are taken to be polarized along the quasi-1D $x$ direction. In the pseudo spin-half case, for small SO-coupling, one can have dark-bright and bright-bright solitons. For large SO coupling, the dark-bright and bright-bright solitons may acquire a spatially-periodic modulation in density; for certain values of contact interaction paramerers there is only the normal bright-bright soliton without spatially-periodic modulation in density. In the spin-one anti-ferromagnetic case, for small SO coupling, one can have bright-bright-bright, dark-bright-dark, and bright-dark-bright solitons; and for large SO coupling, the dark-bright-dark and bright-dark-bright solitons are found to have spatially-periodic modulation in density. In the spin-one ferromagnetic case, for both small and large SO coupling, we find only bright-bright-bright solitons. All these solitons, specially those with a dark-soliton component, are dynamically stable as demonstrated by real-time propagation using the converged stationary solution obtained by imaginary-time propagation as the initial state.

Abstract: We study the canonical problem of a Fermi gas interacting with a weakly repulsive Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. To explore the quantum phases across the full range of boson-fermion interactions, we construct a versatile variational ansatz that incorporates pair correlations and correctly captures the different polaron limits. Remarkably, we find that self-bound quantum droplets can exist in the strongly interacting regime, preempting the formation of boson-fermion dimers, when the Fermi pressure is balanced by the resonant boson-fermion attraction. This scenario can be achieved in experimentally available Bose-Fermi mixtures for a range of boson-fermion mass ratios in the vicinity of equal masses. We furthermore show that a larger fermion density instead yields phase separation between a Bose-Fermi mixture and excess fermions, as well as behavior reminiscent of a liquid-gas critical point. Our results suggest that first-order quantum phase transitions play a crucial role in the phase diagram of Bose-Fermi mixtures.

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study of microwave single-photon transitions that are magnetic-field-insensitive in degenerate Fermi gases of $^{40}$K. This contrasts with microwave single-photon clock transitions for 0-0 magnetic-field-insensitive states and two-photon clock transitions for non 0-0 magnetic-field-insensitive states in bosonic alkali metal atoms. We show that there are two sets of special transitions between two different hyperfine ground states ($|F$=9/2, $m_{F}$=1/2$\rangle$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $|$7/2, -1/2$\rangle$ and $|$9/2, -1/2$\rangle$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $|$7/2, 1/2$\rangle$), whose microwave single-photon transition frequency is insensitive to low magnetic fields, as the first-order Zeeman shift is almost completely canceled. By using the microwave spectrum and Ramsey interference fringes, we demonstrate the long-time stability of the coherent transition under magnetic field fluctuations. These magnetic-field-insensitive microwave hyperfine transitions in ultracold $^{40}$K Fermi gases offer promising applications in quantum information and precision measurements.

Abstract: Collective excitations are fundamental in quantum many-body physics, yet their spectra have traditionally been studied within Newtonian dynamics. In this Letter, we investigate collective excitations in Bose gases under Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We derive an anisotropic excitation spectrum in the MOND regime. This anisotropy arises directly from the intrinsic nonlinear structure of the MOND Poisson equation, forming a distinctive signature of the modified gravitational response. We then analyze the Jeans instability, obtaining analytic expressions for the direction-dependent critical wavelength and mass. These results advance our understanding of collective behavior in quantum systems under modified dynamics and establish clear theoretical signatures for testing MOND-like effects in quantum simulators.

Abstract: The concept of random walk, in which particles or waves undergo multiple collisions with the microscopic constituents of a surrounding medium, is central to understanding diffusive transport across many research areas. However, this paradigm may break down in complex systems, where quantum interference and memory effects render the particle propagation anomalous, often fostering localization. Here we report on the observation of such anomalous dynamics in a minimal setting: an ultracold mass-imbalanced mixture of two fermionic gases in three dimensions. We release light impurities into a gas of heavier atoms and follow their evolution across different collisional regimes. Under strong interspecies interactions, by lowering the temperature we unveil a crossover from normal diffusion to subdiffusion. Simultaneously, a localized fraction of the light gas emerges, displaying no discernible dynamics over hundreds of collisions. Our findings, incompatible with the conventional Fermi-liquid picture, are instead captured by a model of an atom propagating through a (quasi-)static disordered landscape of point-like scatterers. These results highlight the key role of quantum interference in our mixture, which emerges as a versatile platform for exploring disorder-free localization phenomena.

Abstract: Rotation and quantum tunneling are fundamental concepts in physics, and their interplay in the ultracold atomic systems is of particular interest. In this theoretical work, we explore how tunneling dynamics in a bosonic Josephson junction are modified when the system is placed in a rotating, non-inertial frame. We show that the tunneling dynamics of ultracold bosons in a two-dimensional double-well potential offer an alternative pathway for inferring the rotation frequency. Using the mean-field and many-body analyses, we demonstrate that rotation strongly modifies the tunneling time period as well as the momentum and angular momentum dynamics. When the rotation axis passes through the center of the double well, the observables show distinct dynamical responses with increasing rotation frequency, enabling the rotation frequency to be assessed from changes in the tunneling dynamics. When the potential is displaced from the rotation axis, the rotation induces asymmetric tunneling and partial self-trapping, allowing both the rotation frequency and the displacement to be inferred. We further show that for an off-centered double well, the tunneling dynamics exhibit a pronounced orientation dependence, enabling the orientation of the double well to be inferred from the observed dynamics. The many-body analysis further shows that the depletion dynamics are strongly influenced by rotation, providing an additional tool for assessing the rotation frequency. Finally, we study the effect of time-dependent rotation in which the double well is gradually set into motion in the laboratory frame and identify distinct dynamical signatures that depend sensitively on the switching time. Together, these results establish a comprehensive framework for inferring the rotation frequency, radial displacement, and orientation directly from the tunneling dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate the influence of intraspecies interactions on the structure and diversity of the wetting phase diagram in a dilute ternary Bose-Einstein condensates. Within the GP formalism, we employ the double-parabola approximation to describe the interfacial properties of the system in the limit of strong segregation between two of the components. Our analysis focuses on the static behavior near degenerate points where distinct phase boundaries intersect in the parameter space defined by the healing-length ratios. We demonstrate that the first-order and critical wetting transition lines, along with the nucleation line intersect at a unique degenerate point. This finding contrasts with previous studies in the interspecies interaction space, where two degenerate points were observed. These results provide new insights into the interfacial phase behavior of multicomponent quantum gases and offer theoretical guidance for experimental explorations of wetting phenomena in ultracold atomic systems.

Abstract: Identifying physical mechanisms that protect the information carried by various forms of structured light is one of the cornerstones of today's classical and quantum communications. Here we show that the purity of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes can be protected against degradation in random media by leveraging two fundamental features of their own Schrödinger Hamiltonian dynamics, namely, Zeno effect -- frequent observations slow down the evolution -- , and Gouy phase -- the back-action of the observation. Repeated, OAM-dependent Gouy phase kicks imparted along the disturbing path by simple imaging systems trigger the optical Zeno effect that protects the input OAM mode against mode cross-talk that would broaden the OAM spectrum. Given the universality of the mechanism, the Gouy phase-assisted Zeno effect would protect propagation modes other than those of OAM, and the diverse forms of structured light built with them.

Abstract: Infrared detectors have traditionally been divided into two fundamental classes, mid-wave (MWIR, 3-5 um) and long-wave (LWIR, 8-14 um). Integrating MWIR and LWIR within a single device is challenging due to distinct materials, cooling needs, and detection mechanisms, while such integration is critical for improved object recognition, temperature estimation, and environmental sensing. In this work, we demonstrate a Spintronic Poisson (SP) bolometer enabling room-temperature ultra-broadband sensing across 3-14 um. Unlike conventional bolometers that rely on continuous analog signals, the SP bolometer implements a Poisson-counting detection paradigm, encoding temperature in discrete stochastic events, which turns thermal noise from a limitation into the basis of the estimator itself. We fabricate the SP bolometer using a spintronic transduction layer integrated with a plasmonic nanoantenna array to enhance broadband infrared absorption. Using spintronic transduction, the device achieves the noise-equivalent temperature difference (NETD, thermal sensitivity metric) of 80-100 mK at 300 K, surpassing uncooled detectors and approaching cooled technologies. This work establishes a statistical detection paradigm for room-temperature infrared sensing with broad application potential.

Here we demonstrate a gallium-phosphide electro-optomechanical spiking neuron that integrates optical and electromechanical interfaces within a single nanostructure on a silicon photonic chip operating at telecommunication wavelengths (1550 nm) and exploiting a 3 gigahertz-frequency mechanical mode. Our device displays excitable dynamics, generating optical spikes at its output, as in the spiking activity of neurons and cardiac cells and defined by the calibrated all-or-none response to external perturbations. This dynamic is consistent with the saddle-node on invariant circle scenario and associated features are demonstrated including control of excitable threshold, temporal summation and refractory period. Our device compact footprint and its CMOS-compatible platform make it well suited for edge-computing applications requiring low latency and establish a foundation for versatile brain-inspired optomechanical computing and advanced on-chip optical pulse sources.

Abstract: We present a terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) system which accesses a broadband spectrum, efficiently covering the so-called "new THz gap" between 5 and 15 THz and extending beyond 25 THz. The system exploits nonlinear interactions within the organic crystal BNA (N-benzyl-2-methyl-4-nitroaniline) to generate and detect THz radiation upon excitation by a near-infrared (NIR) pulse centered at 1.03 $μ$m. To enable broadband THz spectral monitoring, the NIR pulse from a Yb-based solid-state laser undergoes spectral broadening in a gas-filled single-ring hollow-core photonic crystal fiber, followed by a pulse compression to achieve durations as short as 31 fs. This approach paves the way for broadband spectroscopy in hard-to-access THz regions using widely available near-infrared ultrafast sources.

Abstract: Low-scattering, deep-penetration light transport in biological media remains a pivotal challenge for biophotonic technologies, including biomedical imaging, optical diagnostics, and photodynamic therapy. This review builds upon and extends our earlier studies of nonlinear optical self-trapping and optically induced waveguiding in biological suspensions, such as human erythrocytes and cyanobacteria, where light-matter coupling is governed by optical-force-mediated particle redistribution. Recent progress has revealed increasingly rich and complex regimes, including the propagation and nonlinear self-action of structured (vortex) beams in biological environments, as well as nonlinear responses dominated by thermally driven mechanisms in absorptive biomolecular solutions (e.g., heme and chlorophyll). We place particular emphasis on distinctive nonlinear phenomena observed in these systems, including spatial self-phase modulation, optical-force-induced sculpturing of effective energy landscapes, and quasi-waveguide formation in soft, heterogeneous biological media. We conclude by highlighting emerging opportunities to harness these nonlinear behaviors for deep-tissue imaging, label-free biosensing, and the realization of biocompatible photonic structures and devices assembled directly from living or hybrid biological matter.

Abstract: Programmability and precise control of laser frequency are essential for quantum experiments and applications such as atomic clocks, quantum computers, and cold-atom sensors. Current systems use bulky, power-hungry modulators and frequency shifters which are difficult to integrate and limit portability and scalability. We report an electrically controllable, agile optical frequency source based on a semiconductor laser stabilized to a photonic-integrated, lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-actuated resonator cavity. We demonstrate this approach with precision programmable frequency control of a 780-nm laser that can periodically reference to rubidium spectroscopy followed by fast, programmable, arbitrary frequency tuning sequences for quantum control. We use this approach to demonstrate sub-Doppler cooling of rubidium-87 without any external modulators, achieving atom-cloud temperatures as low as 16 $μ$K. The device achieves a tuning strength up to 1 GHz/V with 11 MHz modulation bandwidth while consuming only 10 nW of electrical power. This work establishes a route toward compact, low-power, and chip-scale laser systems for next-generation quantum and atomic sensing technologies.

TL;DR: A new chiroptical sensing platform using adsorbed chiral molecules on twisted CNTs with PCMs shows high sensitivity and programmability for enantioselective sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enantioselective sensing is vital for areas like pharmaceuticals and environmental monitoring, driving the need for lightweight, scalable, and efficient methods.

Method: Combined adsorption-driven chiroptics with optical transduction in heterostructures of CNT-aligned tubes and PCMs, achieving macroscopic chirality and significant sensitivity.

Result: Edge-of-the-art 1 µM sensitivity for glucose and chiral amino acids with adsorption constants over 10^5 M^-1.

Conclusion: This platform offers cost-effective, in-situ monitoring in aqueous environments, marking a significant advancement in enantioselective sensing.

Abstract: Chiroptical enantioselective sensing is gaining traction across various applications. However, intrinsic molecular chiroptical responses are weak, and existing amplification approaches add synthesis, manufacturing, or operational complexity that limits sensitivity, scalability, and dynamic control. Here, we present a fundamentally new sensing paradigm merging adsorption-driven chirality induction with wafer-scale optical transduction in a programmable heterostructure containing twisted aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and phase change materials (PCMs). Chiral molecules adsorb onto CNTs to form chiroptically active composites that are macroscopically assembled by alignment and rotational stacking, yielding large ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD). We resolve molecule concentration and handedness in a single device without lithography, hotspot delivery, or differential protocols, achieving sub-$μ$M sensitivity for CD-silent glucose and chiral amino acids enabled by $>10^5\,\mathrm{M^{-1}}$ adsorption constants. We validate adsorption using molecular dynamics simulations, reproduce experimental results using chiral transfer matrix simulations, and realize sensor programmability by tuning the PCM layer. This platform enables cost-effective in-situ enantiomer monitoring in aqueous environments.

### [252] [Saturable absorption in NV-doped diamond studied by femtosecond Z-scan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12421)
*Wojciech Talik,Mariusz Mrózek,Adam M. Wojciechowski,Krzysztof Dzierżęga*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Diamond's nonlinear optical absorption is significantly influenced by defects. The high nonlinear absorption in high-purity diamond is attributed to H2 (NVN-) complexes alongside the defects. Saturation absorption arises from both NV and H2 defects, with saturation intensity increasing with defect concentration. For the highly doped sample, effective absorption coefficient and saturation intensity are quantified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper investigates the impact of defects on nonlinear optical absorption in diamond, which is crucial for diamond-based photonics applications.

Method: Z-scan measurements with femtosecond lasers at 1032 nm; linear transmission spectroscopy; modeling with effective two-level system.

Result: Saturation absorption arises from both NV and H2 defects; H2 complexes contribute to the absorption near the excitation wavelength; detailed characterization of defect-induced optical effects provides guidance for optimizing nonlinear devices.

Conclusion: This study highlights the necessity of considering multiple defect types for optimizing diamond's nonlinear optical properties for quantum photonic devices.

Abstract: We investigate nonlinear optical absorption in diamond crystals containing high densities of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers using open-aperture Z-scan measurements with 230 fs laser pulses at 1032 nm, within the transparency window of diamond. While high-purity electronic-grade diamond exhibits third-order nonlinear absorption, NV-doped samples display pronounced saturable absorption that strengthens with increasing defect concentration. Linear transmission spectroscopy reveals that, in addition to NV centers, the crystals host significant populations of H2 (NVN-) defect complexes whose absorption band partially overlaps the excitation wavelength. By correlating spectroscopic data with nonlinear measurements and modeling the response using an effective two-level system, we show that the observed saturation cannot be attributed solely to NV centers but arises from the combined contribution of NV-related and H2 defects. For the highly doped sample, we determine an effective linear absorption coefficient of alpha0 = 6.52 cm-1 and a saturation intensity of Is = 40.0 GW/cm2. These findings highlight the critical role of the complex defect landscape in governing the nonlinear optical response of NV-doped diamond and underscore the necessity of accounting for ancillary defect species in the design of diamond-based nonlinear and quantum photonic devices.

*Vitor Monken,Raul Correa,Hudson Miranda,Cassiano Rabelo,Rafael Nadas,Thiago L. Vasconcelos,Luiz Gustavo Cancado,Ado Jorio*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a plasmonic bi-cavity tip, PTTP, which enhances tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) by enabling on-axis excitation with a dry, low-numerical aperture (NA = 0.75) objective. This relaxes the traditional requirement for high-NA excitation, reducing the working distance constraint and expanding applicability to constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raman spectroscopy has wide applications across various fields, but traditional TERS requires high-NA objectives, limiting practical use. This paper aims to overcome that limitation by introducing a novel approach to enhance TERS performance with lower NA.

Method: The researchers developed a PTTP design involving a plasmonic bi-cavity tip. They co-tuned the tip's geometry by adjusting the nanopyramid length (L) and plateau length (W). Finite-element simulations were employed to identify critical parameters, specifically W, which influences surface-plasmon-polariton (SPP) resonance. Through co-tuning of L and W, they achieved a periodic series of maximal apex |E|^2. Experimental results on monolayer graphene demonstrated the near-field enhancement and the characteristic annular PSF with NA = 0.75.

Result: The study successfully demonstrated that PTTP enhances TERS performance under radially polarized, on-axis excitation with a low-NA objective. The experimental results matched the theoretical predictions, confirming the effectiveness of the PTTP design. This advancement shows promise for practical, deployment-ready Raman instruments that can operate in environments with limited working distances.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for Raman spectroscopy by reducing the required NA, thus expanding its application in various fields.

Abstract: Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) typically relies on high-NA excitation to generate a strong axial field at the tip apex, which shortens the working distance and constrains sample geometries. We show that a plasmonic bi-cavity tip, the plasmon-tunable tip pyramid (PTTP), co-tuned in nanopyramid length L and plateau length W, supports a hybrid antenna-cavity mode that funnels energy to the apex under radially polarized, on-axis excitation, even with a dry objective of NA = 0.75. Finite-element simulations identify W as a design-critical parameter that sets an in-plane surface-plasmon-polariton (SPP) Fabry-Pérot-like resonance; co-tuning (L,W) yields a periodic series of maximal apex |E|^2. Experiments on monolayer graphene confirm near-field enhancement and reproduce the characteristic annular TERS point spread function (PSF) with NA = 0.75. Relaxing the NA requirement increases working distance and compatibility with constrained environments, pointing to practical, deployment-ready nano-Raman instrumentation.

Abstract: Metasurface coupling constitutes a fundamental yet intricate electromagnetic interaction that occurs within a lattice of artificial subwavelength unit cells. Despite its prevalence, such coupling is typically ignored in conventional metasurface design frameworks due to the high characterization complexity, leading to suboptimal device performance. Here, we reveal a distinctive long-range coupling that exceeds an order of magnitude compared with the interaction range of evanescent waves, substantially enriching the metasurface design landscapes. This coupling exhibits pronounced graph topological features, and we design a graph neural network (GNN) to accurately abstract its inherent physics. Through strategic enhancement of the coupling effects, the discrete metasurface responses are transformed into continuous states, thereby unlocking diverse multiplexing channels. By further integrating the GNN into an inverse design agent, we tailor the multi-channel global response of metasurface to support simultaneous multiplexing across angle, frequency, and polarization domains. Experimentally, we demonstrate a compact metasurface multiplexer with eight independent channels, showcasing its potential for next-generation vehicular networks. This work establishes a new paradigm for highly integrated multifunctional metasurfaces, with promising prospects for high-density optical storage, information encryption, and high-capacity wireless communication.

Conclusion: Successfully designed and experimentally validated aSi-based polarization beam splitter with enhanced performance through innovate Floquet coupling structures, opening new possibilities in high-performance optical devices.

Abstract: A broadband silicon polarization beam splitter (PBS) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated based on Floquet-engineered directional couplers. The total length of the coupling structure is 20 um . By periodically modulating the waveguide width of the directional couplers, the power exchange between the two waveguides for the transverse-electric (TE) mode is suppressed, whereas the power coupling for the transverse-magnetic (TM) mode is enhanced. The fabricated PBS exhibits polarization extinction ratios (PERs) > 20 dB for both polarizations over a broad wavelength range of 1483 nm-1620 nm. Additionally, the measured insertion losses (ILs) are 0.15 dB and 1.2 dB at 1550 nm for TE and TM polarizations, respectively.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The spatial-temporal beam quality of laser sources is crucial for applications such as nonlinear spectroscopy and master oscillator power amplification systems. However, the temporal stability remains challenged by issues like line-width broadening and high-power demand in efforts to improve it. In this work, we investigate the effect of the second-harmonic generation process on the laser characteristics under three longitudinal mode regimes: single-longitudinal-mode, dual-longitudinal-mode, and multi-longitudinal-mode. The results demonstrate that the second-harmonic generation process effectively stabilizes the temporal characteristics of the laser and enhances its correlation, leading to a temporally clean output beam. The physical mechanism of the observed temporal stabilization effect can be attributed to a high-peak-pulse attenuation effect, jointly induced by nonuniform longitudinal-mode depletion and phase preservation in the residual fundamental wave. Statistical analysis indicates that at the maximum fundamental-wave power in the multi-longitudinal-mode regime, the standard deviation and peak-to-valley values derived from the normalized temporal profile decrease from 0.6122 and 5.6846 for the fundamental wave to 0.189 and 0.8847 for the residual fundamental wave. Meanwhile, the background level of the intensity auto-correlation function rises from ~0.72 to ~0.96, revealing its evolution toward a more coherent state. To the best of our knowledge, this research presents the first demonstration of laser temporal stabilization and correlation enhancement via second-harmonic generation. It not only deepens the comprehension of second-harmonic generation mechanisms, but also opens up a new avenue for realizing temporal beam self-cleaning of light.

Abstract: Light carries rich information across space, spectrum, polarization, and time, yet conventional cameras capture only a narrow projection of this multidimensional structure. A thin diffuser encodes wavelength-dependent information into single-shot scatterograms, captured by a polarization-resolving CMOS sensor that simultaneously measures four linear polarization states. We use 4DCam to image a live Betta splendens fish, uncovering polarization-dependent color modulations that remain invisible to conventional cameras. We experimentally show that the 4D information encoded in the scatterograms markedly improves material discrimination, achieving 96% accuracy for textile classification and 90% for camouflage detection, compared with 70% and 80%, respectively, using 3D hyperspectral imaging alone. Built entirely from passive optics, 4DCam seamlessly integrates physical encoding, generative decoding, and direct inference, enabling real-time, information-complete optical sensing.

Abstract: Compact spectrometers promise to revolutionize sensing applications, offering a unique pathway to laboratory-grade analysis within a miniaturized footprint. Central to their performance is the encoding strategy to unknown spectra, which determines the efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability of spectral reconstruction. However, the absence of a unified spectral encoding framework has hindered the realization of optimal, high-performance compact spectrometers. We propose a transformative approach: an information-theoretic framework grounded in bio-inspired Bayesian expected information gain that defines the first generic light encoder for computational spectrometers. By optimizing three fundamental attributes at the lowest level of physical hierarchy, (1) orthogonality, (2) completeness, and (3) sparsity, we establish a design paradigm that transcends conventional encoding hardware limitations. We validate this paradigm with the first generic encoder capable of dynamically reconfiguring its response matrices. Experiments show superior reconstruction fidelity across diverse spectral regimes, enabling tunable spectral encoding tailored to varied input features. An ultra-high resolution of 6 pm and a broad measurable bandwidth of 30 nm are experimentally validated. By bridging the gap between theoretical encoding principles and reconfigurable hardware, our framework defines a coherent basis for future advances in compact spectrometry.

Abstract: Complex systems exhibit rich equilibrium states, yet the universal principles governing these systems remain unrevealed, motivating the search for novel experimental platforms. Random fiber lasers (RFLs), which generate partially-coherent light-wave through feedback from Rayleigh scattering, provide a photonic realization of such systems. Here we report a comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigation of photon statistics for RFLs based on classical second-order temporal correlation function \( g^{(2)}(τ) \), revealing unique statistical properties and introduce a two-dimensional framework for controlling photon statistics. Remarkably, we establish a unified landscape between photon correlation, intensity statistics governed by Levy statistics, and phase transitions with replica symmetry breaking. This multifaceted relationship, observed for the first time, bridges disordered photonics with statistical physics of complex system. Our results offer new pathways for engineering laser emission with controllable photon statistics, and more broadly, this work positions RFLs as a fertile land for exploring emergent behaviors in disordered systems.

Abstract: A nonlinear rectangular patch antenna (RPA) is presented in which back-to-back Schottky diodes are embedded at high-field regions to enable passive, bias-free harmonic generation. The self-biased diodes introduce a power-dependent impedance that drives efficient frequency up-conversion and selective third-harmonic radiation. A tailored matching network enhances third-harmonic excitation and coupling while preserving radiation efficiency at the fundamental frequency. Analytical modeling combined with SPICE-assisted full-wave time-domain simulations predicts strong odd-harmonic content, and measurements on RPA prototypes employing SMS7630 diodes confirm these results. Simulated and measured S-parameters and far-field patterns at 925 MHz and 2.775 GHz show excellent agreement. The demonstrated approach establishes nonlinear loading as an effective mechanism for passive harmonic control in compact radiators, enabling frequency-agile and spectrum-efficient antenna systems.

Abstract: Multilayer metasurfaces provide substantially greater spectral design freedom than single-layer devices, yet their implementation in the visible and near-infrared remains limited by the complexity, cost, and low throughput of conventional nanofabrication. Here, we establish a recently proposed direct-write electron-beam lithography approach as a high-throughput fabrication platform for multilayer resonant metasurfaces, based on an antimony precursor that decomposes in situ into high-index antimony sulfide. This method eliminates deposition-etch cycles and reduces each layer to only two fabrication steps, enabling efficient realization of multilayer architectures. Using this platform, we demonstrate multilayer q-BIC-derived metasurfaces with independently tunable resonance wavelengths and linewidths, allowing the construction of compact multi-resonant filters with spectrally decoupled layers. We experimentally demonstrate three-layer devices supporting three resonances and show independent control of resonance wavelength and Q factor across layers. Leveraging this capability, we generate decorrelated filter arrays for compressive sensing and hyperspectral reconstruction, achieving sets of 9 and 36 filters with average absolute Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.11 and 0.21, surpassing prior metasurface and photonic-crystal implementations. These results establish a practical route toward scalable multilayer resonant metasurfaces for spectral filtering, on-chip spectroscopy, and computational imaging.

TL;DR: This paper introduces NbOI2 as a promising material for photonics and electronics with excellent second-order nonlinearity and in-plane ferroelectricity, but its instability under ambient conditions is a challenge. SiO2 encapsulation protects NbOI2 multilayers, enabling their use in nonlinear devices. NbOI2 shows potential for integration into photonic platforms and quantum technologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to develop advanced materials for photonics and electronics with tailored nonlinear properties. The instability of NbOI2 under ambient conditions, especially its rapid degradation, necessitates protection methods to enhance its practical applications.

Method: The researchers studied NbOI2's properties, including its crystal structure, nonlinear optical response, and degradation mechanisms under ambient conditions. They then evaluated the effectiveness of SiO2 encapsulation as a protection layer using techniques like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, time-dependent optical measurements, and micromechanical testing.

Result: The results demonstrate that NbOI2's structural integrity and nonlinear optical performance are preserved when encapsulated with SiO2. The protection layer significantly prolongs the stability of NbOI2, making it suitable for use in integrated photonic devices and quantum technologies.

Conclusion: This research highlights NbOI2 as a promising candidate for nonlinear optical applications despite its instability. The development of an effective encapsulation method opens new possibilities for its use in photonic platforms and quantum technologies.

Abstract: Niobium oxide diiodide (NbOI2) is an emerging material for photonics and electronics, distinguished by its exceptional second-order nonlinearity and pronounced in-plane ferroelectricity, both originating from its highly anisotropic ABC-stacked crystal structure. Its broken inversion symmetry enables its optical nonlinear efficiency to scale with thickness, making multilayer NbOI2 highly promising for nonlinear frequency conversion like second harmonic generation or and spontaneous parametric down-conversion in bulk or waveguides. However, under ambient conditions NbOI2 degrades into an amorphous oxide within weeks, severely diminishing its nonlinear response. To overcome this, we investigate SiO2 encapsulation via physical vapor deposition to protect NbOI2 multilayers from environmental degradation. Our systematic study reveals that encapsulation preserves structural integrity and nonlinear optical performance, establishing NbOI2 as a stable candidate for heterogeneous integration in foundry-compatible photonic platforms and quantum technologies.

Abstract: Photonic crystals allow unprecedented control over how light is confined, propagates, and interacts with matter. Their development has had a transformative impact on optics and physics, and they remain the central platform for both fundamental discoveries and practical photonic technologies. However, the relatively large footprint and substrate-bound nature of photonic crystal structures have so far strongly limited their use as miniature optical devices or biointegrated sensors. Here, we overcome these limitations by identifying the minimal size of a 2D photonic crystal array needed to achieve lasing and describe the fabrication of substrate-less hexagonal laser particles with an active area as small as 30 μm2. Massively parallel fabrication, robust detachment, and integration of the nanolaser particles into live cells is demonstrated. Crucially, by engineering spatial and spectral mode characteristics, we designed NIR-II probes with mode volumes on the order of tens of attolitres, an order of magnitude smaller than whispering gallery probes of similar dimensions. Such high light localization is comparable in scale to different organelles of eucaryotic cells. In the future, we expect that chemical or plasmonic functionalization of the device will enable label-free sensing of nanoscale intracellular processes, and that it shall serve as a miniature platform to exploit developments in optical and quantum sensing for chemical and biological applications.

Abstract: Liquid crystal whispering gallery mode microlasers show high sensitivity to external stimuli and distinct spectral features, rendering them ideally suited for various sensing applications. They also offer intrinsic anisotropic optical properties, which can be used to shape and manipulate light even inside spatially highly symmetric structures. Here, we report the synthesis and detailed optical characterization of a spherical bipolar liquid crystal polymer microlaser that tightly confines the optical path of whispering gallery modes to the equatorial plane. By controlled anchoring of the liquid crystal mesogens followed by polymerization, a fixed refractive index gradient is formed within the spherical microcavity. Consequently, only transverse electric (TE) modes oscillating in the equatorial plane experience the high extraordinary refractive index, allowing to confine lasing into a single plane. Furthermore, we observe that the refractive index gradient causes a characteristic splitting of the TE modes. By combining hyperspectral imaging and analytical modeling, we demonstrate that the observed splitting is caused by lifting of the energy degeneracy of higher order azimuthal laser modes, enabling direct insights into the complex interplay of refractive index gradients and resulting whispering gallery mode confinement. In addition, the unique ability to confine lasing of a spherical microbead into only a single plane makes these microlasers independent of the exact position of the pump beam, which allows consistent localized sensing especially in combination with fast point scanning microscopes or inside highly dynamic biological environments.

Abstract: Metasurfaces are extremely useful for controlling and manipulating electromagnetic waves. Full-wave numerical simulation is highly desired for their design and optimization, but it is notoriously difficult, even for two-dimensional metasurfaces, when they comprise a huge number of subwavelength elements. This paper focuses on two-dimensional non-periodic metasurfaces that contain only a relatively small number of distinct subwavelength elements. We develop an efficient numerical method based on Neumann-to-Dirichlet operators, the finite element method and local function expansions. Our method drastically reduces the total number of unknowns and is capable of simulating two-dimensional metasurfaces with $10^{5}$ subwavelength elements on a personal computer. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method maintains high accuracy while offering significant advantages in both computational time and memory usage compared to the classical full-domain finite element method, making it particularly suited for the analysis of large metasurfaces.

Motivation: 固体平台是现代电子的基础，但如何处理携带角动量的强短光脉冲与固体的相互作用尚不清楚。正如常规光-物质相互作用可以简化为单布里奥尔区的电子动力学和多极近似进行分析，但长时间脉冲的高阶相互作用仍在处理上存在难题。此前的研究限于非线性和微扰的领域，关键困难在于在中红外频段产生具有角结构的强短光脉冲。因此，结构光在固体中诱导非线性和非微扰相互作用及角动量转移的系统研究还未展开。

Method: 研究采用了一种通用的实验方法，适用于不同材料和几何形状。通过实验，确认了驱动光的角动量被光谐所继承。特别是，无论晶体的对称性、电子相互作用的范围还是强自旋轨道耦合的存在，OAM 都是守恒的。

Result: 研究结果证实了驱动光的角动量在光谐中独立保存，不受晶体对称性、电子相互作用范围或强自旋轨道耦合的影响。这为单独表征和控制固体中角动量转移提供了可靠框架，并启用了基于结构光的量子技术和拓扑材料研究的新途径。

Abstract: Although solid-state platforms underpin modern electronics, little is known about how intense ultrashort light pulses carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) interact with solids. This gap persists even though, for more conventional light-matter interactions, the complex underlying electron dynamics can often be confined to a single Brillouin zone and described well within the dipole approximation. Previous studies were restricted to nonlinear, perturbative regimes, largely because the generation of intense ultrashort vortex pulses, particularly in the mid-infrared spectral regime, has remained a long-standing challenge. Consequently, the role of structured light in driving nonlinear, non-perturbative processes in solids, and the associated transfer of angular momentum during these interactions, has not been systematically explored. Here, we investigate solid-state high-harmonic generation (HHG) driven by intense ultrashort structured light using a versatile experimental approach applicable to different materials and geometries. We demonstrate that the OAM of the driving field is coherently transferred to the emitted harmonics. In particular, we show that the OAM is conserved independently of the crystal symmetry, the range of electronic interactions, and the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling. These results establish OAM-resolved HHG as a robust framework for characterizing and controlling angular momentum transfer in solid-state HHG and open new avenues for structured-light-driven quantum technologies and topological materials investigations.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian photonics provides a fertile platform for exploring phenomena with no Hermitian counterparts, including the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points, with direct relevance for integrated photonic technologies. In this work, we investigate the properties of non-Hermitian second-order topological phases by constructing a photonic kagome crystal with balanced gain and loss, and reveal the interplay between higher-order topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect. We demonstrate that non-Hermiticity not only lifts the degeneracy of the topological corner modes but also drives bulk states to accumulate at corners, giving rise to bipolar non-Hermitian skin effect. By defining the point-gap topology, we uncover the fundamental topological origin of the non-Hermitian skin effect. More interestingly, the non-Hermitian skin effect induces a fundamental breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence based on the Bloch band theory. Our findings establish a general framework for non-Hermitian higher-order photonic systems and open avenues toward tailorable topological photonic devices exploiting non-Hermitian enhanced localization.

Result: The paper presents a statistical mechanics-based model that successfully analyzes dislocation entropy, offering a deeper understanding of the grain structure dynamics during laser hardening.

Conclusion: The authors' approach using statistical mechanics provides a novel perspective on modeling dislocation behavior, which is essential for optimizing laser shock peening processes.

Abstract: Laser hardening of metals occurs under the influence of a shock wave, which changes the distribution and density of one-dimensional defects - dislocations. There is a relationship between the density of dislocations, the grain size and the resistance of a single crystal to shear loading. The mechanism of hardening processes continues to be intensively studied, and the dynamics of defects plays a central role here. In this paper, the dislocation entropy is analyzed from a combinatorial point of view and from the point of view of a physical oscillator with a given energy reserve. Both contributions play an important role in describing the free energy of a one-dimensional ensemble of dislocations, and are necessary to take into account the dynamic processes inside the grain of a polycrystalline structure.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of dispersion properties in ZBLAN fibres is important for their application in ultrafast optical systems and supercontinuum generation.

Method: Broadband measurements using polarisation-resolved white-light spectral interferometry were conducted to quantify dispersion characteristics of the fibres.

Result: The measurements provide data on the dispersion properties, which are essential for modelling pulse propagation but experimental data in this area remain limited.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the development of MIR supercontinuum sources by providing the necessary data for modelling and understanding nonlinear optical phenomena in ZBLAN fibres.

Abstract: Polarisation-maintaining ZBLAN optical fibres with small elliptical cores are attractive for nonlinear frequency conversion, for example in supercontinuum generation (SCG), and for dispersion management in ultrafast fibre laser systems operating in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral region. Accurate characterisation of group birefringence and group velocity dispersion (GVD) is essential for modelling ultrafast pulse propagation in such fibres, yet experimental data remain scarce. Here, we present broadband measurements of group birefringence and GVD in four elliptical-core ZBLAN fibres, selected for their potential for low-noise MIR SCG, over the wavelength range 1.4 to 4.3 $μ$m. Using polarisation-resolved white-light spectral interferometry, we quantify the dispersion characteristics of both fundamental modes in each fibre. Measurement uncertainties are evaluated using a standard deviation analysis to ensure reliability. This work aims to support the development of MIR supercontinuum sources and to facilitate the understanding of nonlinear optical phenomena in ZBLAN fibres.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Using orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the terahertz (THz) range provides a new degree of freedom for communication and imaging systems. This study presents a compact diffractive optical neural network designed to recognize discrete and superposed OAM states at THz frequencies. The network consists of six diffractive layers trained to spatially separate nine OAM modes with topological charges from 1 to 9. Each mode is projected to a distinct position on the output plane, enabling direct recognition of its state. The structure was fabricated through low-cost 3D printing techniques with high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), allowing for scalable and practical implementations. Experimental validation at 0.3 THz demonstrates good fidelity of mode discrimination and mapping. The proposed approach offers a robust and economical pathway for OAM decoding, offering new opportunities for beam manipulation through THz systems based on diffractive optical neural networks.

### [271] [Review of Measures Used for Evaluating Color Difference Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13402)
*Patrick De Visschere*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper compares various measures for assessing color differences, concluding that only STRESS is coordinate-independent. It also highlights the advantages of integrating over ellipsoids and ellipses for achieving more accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was driven by the need for precise and reliable methods to measure color differences, ensuring accuracy and independence from coordinate systems.

Method: The paper employs an ellipsoid/ellipse integration method, inspired by MacAdam's work, but extends it to integrate over the entire shape rather than sampling specific points.

Result: The integration method yields a more robust and coordinate-independent result, specifically identifying STRESS as the unique measure with this property.

Conclusion: The research successfully demonstrates that integrating over ellipsoids/ellipses and using a scaling parameter optimizes color difference measures, with STRESS emerging as the optimal choice.

Abstract: We made a detailed review of the difference measures which have been used to judge the differences between experimentally determined color differences and theoretically defined ones, so-called line elements, for the human visual system. To eliminate the statistical errors due to variable and usually arbitrary sampling of the directions in a color point, we integrate the measures over a complete ellipsoid/ellipse. It turns out that in the limit for small deviations from circularity all proposed measures ($V_{AB}$, $γ-1$, $CV$ and $\mathrm{STRESS}$) are equivalent. For greater deviations the measures become distinct with $γ-1$ the most sensitive and $\mathrm{STRESS}$ the least. Ideally a difference measure should be coordinate independent and then it is advantageous to apply an affine transformation to both sets, e.g. turning the theoretical one into the unit ball. Although MacAdam already used this method but sampled the transformed ellipse, we integrate over the ellipsoid/ellipse. Comparing the results with the base measures we show that only $\mathrm{STRESS}$ is coordinate independent. Judging whether a single ellipsoid/ellipse resembles a unit ball can easily be done by comparing the eigenvalues with one and we show that our previously proposed error measure $d_{ev}$ (Candry e.a. Optics Express, 30, 36307, 2022) is the eigenvalue version of $γ-1$. We show why the short lived correlation coefficient $r$ was justly abandoned, being very coordinate dependent, but that Pant's recent geometric measure $1-R$ on the other hand is coordinate independent. All measures are routinely made scale invariant by the introduction of a scaling parameter, to be optimized. Lastly we show that from all measures the $γ-1$ ones are the only ones permitting the simple derivation of the globally optimized difference measure from the locally defined ones.

Abstract: Photopolymerization-based additive manufacturing enables cost-effective, high-speed fabrication of complex 3D structures but is constrained by a trade-off between resolution and printing speed. Single-photon polymerization ensures rapid polymerization of centimeter-scale structures with features on the order of tens of micrometers, whereas 2PP provides sub-micrometer features at sub-millimeter scales. Here, we introduce a hybrid unified 3D printer that leverages the complementary strengths of both printing mechanisms to bridge this scale-resolution gap. We propose integrating 2PP for high-resolution, localized spatial control with single-photon TVAM for enabling rapid, high-throughput 3D fabrication. In this approach, TVAM first forms millimeter-scale volumetric structures attached on a glass rod, via overprinting, which is then accessible for subsequent high-resolution 2PP. Without needing to change the photoresin or introducing intermediate post-processing steps, we demonstrate finely printed structures via 2PP using a tightly focused femtosecond laser beam, fabricated both inside and on the surface of the millimeter-scale 3D objects printed with TVAM. Here, TVAM contributes by generating a pre-polymerized volume that facilitates subsequent 2PP and by directly driving volumetric polymerization in designated regions within seconds. We experimentally demonstrate that this dual-mode strategy provides a scalable approach for rapidly fabricating millimeter-scale 3D structures featuring sub-micrometer details. For applications like bioscaffolds and tissue engineering, tens of micrometer-scale features are sufficient across the majority of the volume with higher resolution confined to localized functional regions. For optical component manufacturing, the distinct refractive indices of the 2PP and TVAM regions can be exploited for light propagation and other micro-optical functionalities.

Abstract: We demonstrate deterministic control of branched flow of light using anisotropic nematic liquid crystals. By sculpting the director field via photoalignment, we create spatially programmable optical potentials that govern light scattering and propagation. This platform enables configurable, anisotropic branched flow of light and reveals a universal scaling law for its characteristic features, directly connecting disordered photonics with mesoscopic wave transport. Under extreme anisotropy, we observe a pronounced directional channeling effect, driven by anomalous symmetry-breaking velocity diffusion, which concentrates light propagation along preferential directions while suppressing transverse spreading. These findings establish a tunable material platform for harnessing branched flow of light, opening pathways toward on-chip photonic circuits that exploit disorder-guided transport, scattering-resilient endoscopic imaging, and adaptive optical interfaces in complex media.

Abstract: The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light provides an infinite orthogonal basis for information capacity in optical communications and high-dimensional quantum processing. However, harnessing this potential in integrated systems is hindered by the lack of compact devices capable of direct electrical readout of high-order OAM modes. Here, we report an on-chip silicon-based integrated photodetector that directly converts optical OAM into distinguishable electrical signals without bulky interferometric or imaging optics. By leveraging a momentum-matched plasmonic coupling mechanism, the device maps vortex beams onto surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) with OAM-dependent splitting angles, thereby generating photocurrents that uniquely encode the topological charge. The incorporation of a surface dielectric lens and a split-electrode architecture further enhances mode resolution and enables chirality discrimination. The device demonstrates a wide topological charge detection range from m = -9 to 9 and achieves a record-high average OAM responsivity of 226 nA/W. By bridging the gap between vortex beams and electronic readout on a scalable platform, this work paves the way for on-chip OAM direct detection for next-generation high-capacity optical networks.

Abstract: Coherent detection ghost imaging lidar (CD-GI lidar) integrates ghost imaging with coherent detection, thereby achieving enhanced anti-interference and phase-resolved imaging capability. Here, we propose a bucket-detector-based multi-mode coherent detection scheme for CD-GI lidar, where the reflected multi-mode light fields are coherently mixed with a single-mode local oscillator (LO) at the bucket detector photosensitive plane.

Theoretical analysis of the bucket-detector-based multi-mode CD-GI lidar system is presented in this work, and its feasibility is verified through a series of experiments.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate carrier-envelope-offset (CEO) frequency stabilization of a Kerr-lens mode-locked thin-disk oscillator delivering 180 W average power, 80 MW output peak power, and >500 MW intra-cavity peak power, the highest peak power achieved in any stabilized thin-disk oscillator system. The CEO frequency detection is performed with an f-2f interferometer based on supercontinuum generation in a YAG crystal. Intra-cavity loss modulation using an acousto-optic modulator, that simultaneously provides the Kerr lens, yields 50 mrad of residual phase noise with a 250 kHz control bandwidth. After pulse compression to 0.9 GW peak power in a dual-stage multipass cell, the system directly enables high harmonic generation in noble gases. These results represent a significant step in realizing a compact and robust high-repetition-rate driver system suitable for vacuum ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet frequency comb generation.

Abstract: Modulating retroreflectors (MRRs) offer a promising pathway to low-complexity and energy efficient asymmetric optical inter-satellite link (OISL) for small spacecrafts, such as CubeSats. In this paper, we develop a unified statistical channel model for an on off keying modulated, retroreflector-enabled OISL. The model captures both stochastic and deterministic pointing losses, as well as signal-dependent noise. Stochastic channel distributions are approximated via Monte Carlo simulation, and system optimization is carried out under CubeSat constraints using the achievable information rate as the primary metric. In addition, we derive bit-error ratio and outage probability to evaluate communication reliability. The proposed architecture is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art CubeSat laser terminals, i.e., NASA's Optical Communications and Sensors Demonstration (OCSD), DLR's OSIRIS4CubeSat, and NASA's CLICK BC. Results indicate that an optimized MRR-based transmitter can outperform OCSD and achieve performance comparable to OSIRIS4CubeSat at ranges below 500 km, while consuming only 2.5 W of power during transmission, significantly less than conventional CubeSat optical terminals.

Conclusion: These findings provide a foundation for designing highly efficient, compact optoelectronic devices exploiting 2D material properties.

Abstract: Low-dimensional media have exhibited optical anisotropy that is unachievable in traditional 3D media due to the asymmetry of their strong, in-plane covalent bonds and weak out-of-plane van der Waals interactions. As a result, 2D media are promising building blocks for ultrathin devices such as polarimeters, polarized light sources, and active polarizers. III-VI semiconductors possess a rare property in the class of multilayered semiconductors, which is that their fundamental excitons are oriented out-of-plane. This allows them to exhibit phenomena such as transparency in the visible range while also being emissive in the visible and near-infrared ranges. Here, we report the first experimental values for the anisotropic refractive indices of γ-InSe and ε-GaSe, and we observe the effects of the out-of-plane excitons on the c-axis refractive index. It is found that both materials exhibit moderate optical anisotropy for multilayered semiconductors. The complex, anisotropic refractive index of γ-InSe and ε-GaSe enables the accurate simulation of these media, allowing for the design of high-performance, ultra-compact optoelectronic devices.

TL;DR: Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is used to study 2D materials like graphene where the tip-sample distance affects the results. An unexpected decay in TERS intensity is explained by considering the liquid meniscus formed near the tip.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how tip-sample distance impacts TERS spectroscopy is crucial for accurately analyzing surface properties of 2D materials like graphene.

Method: This study experimentally investigates the effect of tip-sample separation on TERS intensity by varying the distance and analyzing the decay profile.

Result: The intensity decay can be explained by modeling the spring-like contact of the liquid meniscus that deforms as the tip approaches and retracts.

Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the importance of considering surface interactions between the tip and sample in TERS spectroscopy.

Abstract: Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) combines Raman spectroscopy with scanning probe microscopy to overcome the spatial resolution limitation imposed by light diffraction, offering a primary optical technique for the comprehensive study of two-dimensional (2D) materials. In this work, we investigate an anomalous decay profile of the TERS intensity of the graphene 2D band as the tip-sample separation changes, observations enabled by high TERS efficiency and accuracy in tip-approach and tip-retract procedures. The anomalous results can be properly described by the addition of an ad hoc deformation to the effective tip-sample distance, rationalized here as due to the presence of a liquid meniscus formed via capillary forces.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: PANIP is an MLIP model for non-covalent interactions between protein-derived fragments, built using automated MFAL workflow and PDB-FRAGID dataset. It achieves high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency for fragment-based scoring functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing robust MLIP models for accurately modeling molecular interactions, especially for complex systems like proteins, is crucial for computational chemistry and drug design.

Method: PANIP uses NequIP framework, PDB-FRAGID dataset, and automated MFAL workflow to train on non-covalent interactions between protein fragments.

Result: PANIP achieves ωB97X-D3BJ/def2-TZVPP-level accuracy with mean absolute errors below 0.2 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution systems. It outperforms ANI-2x, particularly for charged and strongly interacting dimers.

Conclusion: PANIP demonstrates excellent transferability and efficiency, making it a valuable tool for fragment-based scoring functions in computational studies of protein-ligand interactions.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable efficient modeling of molecular interactions with quantum mechanical (QM) accuracy. However, constructing robust and representative training datasets that capture subtle, system-specific interaction motifs remains challenging. We introduce PANIP (PAirwise Non-covalent Interaction Potential), an ensemble MLIP model built upon the NequIP framework and trained on non-covalent interactions (NCIs) between protein-derived fragments. PANIP is trained using an automated multi-fidelity active learning (MFAL) workflow, in which a representative training subset, termed PDB-FRAGID (PDB Fragment Interaction Dataset), was distilled from an otherwise prohibitively large pool of fragment dimers extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). PANIP retains ωB97X-D3BJ/def2-TZVPP-level accuracy and achieves mean absolute errors below 0.2 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution systems, demonstrating excellent transferability across diverse NCI motifs. Compared to the widely used ANI-2x potential, PANIP delivers substantially lower errors, particularly for charged and strongly interacting dimers. Coupled with a fragmentation-based energy decomposition scheme, PANIP estimates protein-ligand binding energies at near force-field computational cost yet QM-level accuracy, enabling its use as a fragment-based scoring function that rivals specialized docking scoring functions.

Result: 两项水-甲醇分离案例研究显示，框架在自主分析流程图并优化设计中表现良好。框架在教育和实践领域均具备应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过LLM与过程仿真工具的结合，为非专家用户提供了一种高效的流程设计和优化解决方案。尽管当前仍有技术限制，但其分析和指导功能表明，人工智能工具有望与过程仿真软件实现深度协作。

Abstract: Modern process simulators enable detailed process design, simulation, and optimization; however, constructing and interpreting simulations is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. This limits early exploration by inexperienced users. To address this, a large language model (LLM) agent is integrated with AVEVA Process Simulation (APS) via Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing natural language interaction with rigorous process simulations. An MCP server toolset enables the LLM to communicate programmatically with APS using Python, allowing it to execute complex simulation tasks from plain-language instructions. Two water-methanol separation case studies assess the framework across different task complexities and interaction modes. The first shows the agent autonomously analyzing flowsheets, finding improvement opportunities, and iteratively optimizing, extracting data, and presenting results clearly. The framework benefits both educational purposes, by translating technical concepts and demonstrating workflows, and experienced practitioners by automating data extraction, speeding routine tasks, and supporting brainstorming. The second case study assesses autonomous flowsheet synthesis through both a step-by-step dialogue and a single prompt, demonstrating its potential for novices and experts alike. The step-by-step mode gives reliable, guided construction suitable for educational contexts; the single-prompt mode constructs fast baseline flowsheets for later refinement. While current limitations such as oversimplification, calculation errors, and technical hiccups mean expert oversight is still needed, the framework's capabilities in analysis, optimization, and guided construction suggest LLM-based agents can become valuable collaborators.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a channel-resolved interpretation of laser-driven Coulomb explosion of the HCl dimer from an ensemble of trajectories. Three dominant outcomes are identified: a minor three-body channel and two four-body channels (sequential and near-simultaneous dissociation of both molecules). The key result is that pathway selection is strongly correlated with the degree of ionization during the laser interaction, which is in turn strongly modulated by laser-molecule orientation. Higher early-time ionization predisposes the system toward near-simultaneous four-body breakup, whereas lower ionization favors sequential and three-body fragmentation; for low-ionization cases, a fragment-resolved charge metric further differentiates three-body and sequential behavior. These charge-dependent trends consistently map onto experimentally accessible observables: the simultaneous mechanism dominates the high-energy tail of the kinetic energy release (KER) spectrum and populate distinct regions of the emission-angle distributions, while sequential events concentrate at lower KER. Overall, early-time charge evolution provides a unifying explanation for channel branching and for the channel-resolved fragmentation signatures.

By examining vertical excitations in CH+ at equilibrium and stretched geometries, adiabatic excitations in CH, and ground- and excited-state potential cuts of water, we demonstrate that the CIPSI-driven CC($P$;$Q$) method converges parent CC/EOMCC singles, doubles, and triples energetics from relatively inexpensive Hamiltonian diagonalizations in CI spaces smaller than the corresponding triples manifolds.

Abstract: Vibrational-encoded fluorescence spectro-microscopies are emerging as powerful tools for studying molecular vibrations with the unparalleled sensitivity of fluorescence spectroscopy. We recently described one such technique, termed bond-selective fluorescence-detected infrared-excited (BonFIRE) spectro-microscopy. Currently, prospects of BonFIRE towards rational molecular design are limited, but they have the potential to be assisted by computational tools. In this Perspective, we provide a brief overview of the theory of BonFIRE spectroscopy. We then describe a fully automated computational pipeline for calculating BonFIRE spectra, reproducing key features of experimental results. Finally, we highlight a few potential applications of computational methods for vibrational-encoded fluorescence spectro-microscopies and their broader implications for chemistry and biology.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Branching ratios for fragmentation channels of important meta- and unstable species are essential for a molecular-level characterization of atmospheric chemistry. Here, the molecular product channels for the decomposition dynamics of the smallest Criegee intermediate, H$_2$COO, are quantitatively investigated. Using a high-quality, full-dimensional machine learned potential energy surface (CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ), the translational, rotational, and vibrational energy distributions of the CO$_2$+H$_2$, H$_2$O+CO, and HCO+OH fragmentation channels were analyzed to elucidate partitioning of the available energy. The CO$_2$ + H$_2$ product forms through two different pathways that bifurcate after formation of the OCH$_2$O intermediate. Along the direct pathway, CO$_2$ is preferentially vibrationally excited with H$_2$in its vibrational ground state, whereas for the indirect pathway going through formic acid, H$_2$ can populate levels with $v > 0$. For all product channels passing through energized formic acid, the lifetime distributions are described by stretched exponentials with $β$ ranging from 1.1 to 1.7. This is a clear signature of non-RRKM effects and suggests that the explicit molecular dynamics needs to be followed for a quantitative and realistic description of the photodissociation dynamics.

TL;DR: This paper discusses improving $G_0W_0$ method and BSE calculations through a simplified tuning protocol, demonstrating better accuracy in predicting ionization potentials and optical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the accuracy of $G_0W_0$ and BSE methods is crucial for reliable quantum chemical computations, especially in molecular systems.

Method: A simplified range-separated hybrid (RSH) approach is proposed, bypassing the need for multi-step optimization compared to previous methods.

Result: The method shows accurate quasiparticle energies and quantitatively accurate optical absorption spectra across various systems.

Conclusion: The proposed tuning protocol offers an efficient and effective alternative for $G_0W_0$ and BSE calculations, reducing computational complexity while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: The accuracy of one-shot $G_0W_0$ and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) is well known to be highly sensitive to the choice of the starting-point eigensystem, typically obtained from mean-field theory. A highly effective method explored is the use of density functional approximation (DFA) with a range-separated hybrid (RSH) approach.
  In this work, we evaluate the performance of $G_0W_0$ in predicting ionization potentials and the BSE for describing neutral excitations, employing a recently proposed, broadly applicable, and computationally efficient range-separation tuning scheme [Singh \textit{et. al.}, Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, 16, 32, 8198-8208, (2025)]. Our results demonstrate that this simplified tuning protocol provides an accurate starting point for many-body perturbation theory, thereby eliminating the need for conventional, multi-step optimally tuned RSH optimization procedure. The resulting quasiparticle energies from $G_0W_0$ closely reproduce reference ionization potentials, while BSE calculations based on the same tuned RSH orbitals yield quantitatively accurate optical absorption spectra and excitonic properties across a range of molecular systems and clusters.

Abstract: Predicting non-covalent host-guest recognition remains challenging due to the complex interplay of electrostatics, dispersion, and steric effects, and the limited transferability of existing docking approaches to synthetic supramolecular systems. Here we present DeepHostGuest, a geometric deep-learning framework that learns generalizable recognition principles directly from experimentally resolved host-guest structures. Hosts are encoded as electrostatic surfaces and guests as molecular graphs, enabling transferable learning across diverse supramolecular systems. DeepHostGuest achieves high-accuracy predictions (RMSD $\leq 2$ Angstrom for 80.8% of test cases), substantially outperforming classical docking without case-specific tuning. Notably, the method generalizes beyond its training domain to crystalline sponge systems, accurately capturing the binding of large amphiphilic molecules within metal-organic cages. Beyond predicting binding conformations, the structures generated by DeepHostGuest serve as a reliable basis for accurate binding free-energy calculations. Density Functional Theory (DFT)-calculated affinities correlate well with experiment, enabling structure-property relationships across 876 host-guest complexes spanning 34 host families. Interpretable feature analysis reveals that binding strength arises from a cooperative interplay of host polarity, guest hydrophobicity, and geometric complementarity, with distinct design regimes across supramolecular classes. Together, these results establish data-driven molecular recognition as a practical route to predictive supramolecular design, enabling high-throughput virtual screening and rational optimization of functional host-guest systems.

Abstract: Modern cryopreservation exists at the convergence of diverse disciplines--materials science, physical chemistry, mechanical engineering, biological engineering, etc.--and emerging technologies often draw from many of these disciplines simultaneously. Thermodynamics, as one of the foundational theories underlying both physical and biological science, provides a framework through which to understand these interdisciplinary technologies, yet the full kit of requisite thermodynamic tools is not housed within any one discipline. This Chapter aims to articulate a foundational thermodynamic approach to the description, interrogation, and design of modern cryopreservation technologies, and to review the state of the art in emerging cryopreservation technologies through the lens of this approach. We focus in particular on the management of phase change across equilibrium-driven techniques (e.g., liquidus tracking, partial freezing, isochoric freezing), kinetics-driven techniques (e.g. supercooling, ice seeding), and transport-driven techniques (e.g. directional freezing, droplet approaches), and we hope to equip the reader with a self-consistent theoretical toolkit that enables meaningful comparison of these techniques from a thermodynamic perspective.

Abstract: The design-make-test-analyze cycle in early-stage drug discovery remains constrained primarily by the "make" step: small-molecule synthesis is slow, costly, and difficult to scale or automate across diverse chemotypes. Enumerated chemical spaces aim to reduce this bottleneck by predefining synthesizable regions of chemical space from available building blocks and reliable reactions, yet existing commercial spaces are still limited by long turnaround times, narrow reaction scope, and substantial manual decision-making in route selection and execution.
  Here we present the first version of onepot CORE, an enumerated chemical space containing 3.4B molecules and corresponding on-demand synthesis product enabled by an automated synthesis platform and an AI chemist, Phil, that designs, executes, and analyzes experiments. onepot CORE is constructed by (i) selecting a reaction set commonly used in medicinal chemistry, (ii) sourcing and curating building blocks from supplier catalogs, (iii) enumerating candidate products, and (iv) applying ML-based feasibility assessment to prioritize compounds for robust execution. In the current release, the space is supported by seven reactions.
  We describe an end-to-end workflow - from route selection and automated liquid handling through workup and purification. We further report validation across operational metrics (success rate, timelines, purity, and identity), including NMR confirmation for a representative set of synthesized compounds and assay suitability demonstrated using a series of DPP4 inhibitors. Collectively, onepot CORE illustrates a path toward faster, more reliable access to diverse small molecules, supporting accelerated discovery in pharmaceuticals and beyond.

TL;DR: RONEB is a novel optimization method combining the advantages of double-ended and single-ended optimization techniques, significantly reducing gradient calls and improving efficiency for certain transition state calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated and efficient determination of transition states is essential for understanding reaction mechanisms, but current methods like CI-NEB are computationally expensive. The motivation for this work is to develop a more efficient and scalable method to enable high-throughput chemical discovery.

Method: RONEB is an adaptive hybrid algorithm that combines the double-ended nature of the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method with the efficiency of single-ended eigenmode-following techniques, incorporating relative force triggering and alignment-based back-off penalty to dynamically decouple the climbing image from the elastic band constraints.

Result: RONEB achieves a median reduction of 46.3% in gradient calls compared to CI-NEB, with further improvements in specific surface diffusion calculations.

Conclusion: RONEB demonstrates significant potential for high-throughput automated chemical discovery by enhancing the efficiency of transition state optimization while maintaining stability and accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate determination of transition states remains central to understanding reaction kinetics. Double-ended methods like the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) ensure relevant transition states and paths, but incur high computational costs and suffer stagnation on flat or rough potential energy surfaces. Conversely, single-ended eigenmode-following techniques offer efficiency but cannot often be constrained between specific states. Here, we present the Reorienting Off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB), an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the double ended nature of the NEB with the acceleration of single ended Min-Mode Following methods. RONEB provides stability based on the history of the path optimization, relative force triggering, and an alignment-based back-off penalty to dynamically decouple the climbing image from the elastic band constraints. We benchmark the method against the standard Climbing Image NEB (CI-NEB) across the Baker-Chan transition state test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential and the OptBench Pt(111) heptamer island surface diffusion set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance data quantifies a median reduction in gradient calls of 46.3% [95% CrI: -54.7%, -36.9%] relative to the baseline, while surface diffusion tests reveal a 28% reduction across 59 metallic rearrangement mechanisms. These results establish RONEB as a highly effective tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery.

Abstract: Plasmonic nanoparticles generate strongly localized and enhanced light field through localized surface plasmon resonance, thereby playing a central role in plasmonics and nanophotonics. Because the optical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles are highly sensitive to their size and shape, nanoscale visualization of nanoparticle growth is crucial for detailed understanding of growth mechanisms and precise control of particle geometry. However, it is not possible to visualize the rapid growth dynamics using conventional imaging techniques. In this study, we demonstrate in-situ real-time observation of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) growth dynamics at the single-particle level using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). We employed a photoreduction method, which enables reliable control of AgNP formation by laser irradiation. By integrating a stand-alone tip-scan HS-AFM with an optical setup for photoreduction, we successfully captured real-time movies showing the nucleation and subsequent growth of AgNPs at the single-particle level. Furthermore, quantitative single-particle analysis revealed particle-to-particle variations in growth dynamics. The growth dynamics were further studied at different laser intensities, revealing intensity-dependent growth rates and the balance between nucleation and growth. This study establishes HS-AFM as a novel microscopic platform for in-situ visualization of plasmonic nanoparticle growth and will contribute to advances in plasmonics and materials science.

Abstract: We present the data-driven coupled-cluster deep network (DDCCNet), a family of multitask, physics-enhanced deep learning architectures designed to predict coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) amplitudes and correlation energies from lower-level electronic structure methods. The three DDCCNet variants (termed as v1, v2, and v3) progressively incorporate architectural refinements ranging from parallel subnetworks for t_1 and t_2 amplitudes to feature-partitioned blocks and physics-enhanced intermediate prediction layers that are structured in accordance with coupled-cluster equations to enhance physical consistency and multitask learning efficiency. These models jointly learn correlated amplitude patterns while embedding symmetry and orbital-level interactions directly into the network structure. Applied to methanol conformers, CO2 clusters, and small organic molecules, DDCCNet_v2 delivered the most accurate and transferable performance, achieving chemically precise correlation energies across diverse molecular systems. Collectively, DDCCNet establishes a scalable, physically grounded framework that unifies machine learning and ab initio theory for efficient, data-driven electronic structure prediction.

Abstract: Harnessing strong light-matter interactions to control chemical reactions in confined electromagnetic fields offers a promising route toward deepening our understanding of chemical dynamics at the collective quantum-mechanical level, with potential implications for future chemical synthesis paradigms. Achieving this goal, however, requires an in-depth mechanistic understanding of the underlying dynamical processes. As a step in this direction, we present a systematic and numerically exact quantum dynamical study of cooperative reaction dynamics inside an optical microcavity. Using a hierarchy of model systems with increasing complexity, we elucidate how cavity-modified reactivity emerges from-and is highly sensitive to-subtle structural and environmental variations. Our models consist of optically dark reactive molecules, each represented by a symmetric double well potential, coupled to infrared-active non-reactive intramolecular or solvent vibrational modes, as well as their respective dissipative environments. Our results demonstrate that cavity-induced rate modifications arise from a delicate interplay among mode hybridization in strong-coupling regimes, the dynamical balance of all participating energy exchange processes, and quantum interference between multiple fluctuation-dissipation-mediated reaction pathways enabled by collective cavity coupling. By continuously tuning a single system parameter or introducing molecular collectivity, we observe qualitatively distinct rate modification profiles as functions of the cavity frequency, including resonant rate enhancement, resonant rate suppression, hybridization-induced peak splitting, and, notably, asymmetric Fano-type line shapes in which enhancement peaks and suppression dips coexist within a narrow resonance window, highlighting the important role of quantum interference in cavity-modified chemical reactivity.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between molecular structure and chemical reactivity or properties is fundamental to rational molecular design. Linear free energy relationships (LFERs), particularly Hammett analysis, have long served as powerful tools in organic chemistry. Recently, these approaches have been enhanced by incorporating computationally derived parameters, enabling broader applicability across diverse molecules and reactions. To facilitate and scale this process, we present DFTDescriptorPipeline, a fully automated workflow for extracting quantum chemical descriptors from Gaussian log files and constructing structure-property and structure-reactivity relationships using multivariate linear regression (MLR) models. We validate the workflow across four case studies, including photoswitchable molecules and catalytic reactions. In each case, the models provide interpretable results, demonstrating the versatility of this approach and its relevance to a wide range of chemical contexts. We anticipate that this platform will serve as a generalizable framework for integrating quantum chemical calculations into data-driven molecular design.
