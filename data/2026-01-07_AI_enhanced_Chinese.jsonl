While ground states at integer fillings are typically identified as quantum Hall ferromagnets within a Hartree-Fock framework, we propose the existence of symmetric topological Mott insulators (STMIs) that transcend this Slater determinant picture. Focusing on half-filling of each flavor per unit cell, we demonstrate the existence of STMIs which exhibit a quantized charge or spin Hall response. We first establish this phase in a bilayer Haldane-Hubbard model with localized orbitals on the $A$ sublattice and dispersive band on the $B$ sublattice. Starting from a trivial Mott insulator on the $A$ sublattice, tuning the sublattice potential drives a Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) transition of the associated $p-\\mathrm{i}p$ exciton pairing, realizing a topological Mott insulator with $C=1$ per flavor. We further generalize this construction to a single-layer spinful model, where the resulting STMI hosts charge edge modes coexisting with bulk local moments. A Mott semimetal is identified at the quantum critical point between the STMI and the trivial Mott insulator. Finally, we discuss applications to AA-stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$, proposing a ferromagnetic Chern insulator phase as a low-temperature descendant of the symmetric Mott semimetal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u51e0\u4e4e\u5e73\u5766\u62d3\u6251\u5e26\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u5b66\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u62d3\u6251Mott\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\uff08STMIs\uff09\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u4e8eHartree-Fock\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684Slater\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u534a\u5145\u6ee1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u5e26\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42Haldane-Hubbard\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8ep-ipy\u9699\u914d\u5bf9\u7684BCS\u8d85\u5bfc\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u57df\u7684.quantum Hall\u6548\u5e94\u6216\u81ea\u65cbHall\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5355\u5c42\u6709\u81ea\u65cb\u5b64\u5b50\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0Mott\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u7535\u8377\u8272\u8fb9\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5e03\u6d1b\u8d6b\u5c42\u78c1\u77e9\u3002\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0Mott\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4e0e\u5e73\u51e1Mott\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3aMott\u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5bf9AA\u5c42\u53e0\u7684MoTe\u2082/WSe\u2082\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u78c1\u6027Chern\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u800c\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u65b0\u578b\u6750\u6599\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u77e5\u9053\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u4f53\u6001\uff08\u5bf9\u79f0Mott\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53cc\u5c42Haldane-Hubbard\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5355\u4e00\u5c42\u5e26\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u53d8\u4f53\u6001\uff08STMIs\uff09\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u3001\u5176\u6027\u8d28\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u5173\u7cfb", "result": " 1\uff09\u5728\u534a\u586b\u5145\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u79f0\u62d3\u6251Mott\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ec4\u5206\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4e2a\u901a\u9053\u7684\u7535\u8377\u6216\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50[Hall]\u54cd\u5e94\u30022\uff09\u901a\u8fc7BEC-BCS\u8f6c\u6362\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u5e73\u51e1Mott\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u5230STMIs\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u30023\uff09\u5728\u5355\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u79f0Mott\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u7535\u8377\u8272\u8fb9\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5e03\u6d1b\u8d6b\u5c42\u78c1\u77e9\u30024\uff09\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3aMott\u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\u30025\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u9645\u6750\u6599\uff08AA\u5c42\u53e0\u7684MoTe\u2082/WSe\u2082\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u78c1\u6027Chern\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u800c\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": " \u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3moir\u00e9\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u53d8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u578b\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u79f0\u62d3\u6251Mott\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u548cMott\u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u666e\u904d\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6750\u6599\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u5982AA\u5c42\u53e0\u7684MoTe\u2082/WSe\u2082\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u78c1\u6027Chern\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

Building on a ``parity-graded'' representation [1], we prove that any continuous fermionic wavefunction on a compact domain can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy by a linear combination of K antisymmetric basis functions--such as pairwise products or Slater determinants--multiplied by symmetric functions. A key result is that the number of required bases is provably small: K=1 suffices in one-dimensional continua (and on lattices in any dimension), K=2 suffices in two dimensions, and in higher dimensions K grows at most linearly with particle number. The antisymmetric bases can be learned by small neural networks, while the symmetric factors are implemented by permutation-invariant networks whose width scales only linearly with particle number. Thus, Fermi Sets achieve universal approximation of fermionic wavefunctions with minimal overhead while retaining clear physical interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Ho-based pyrochlores host a dipolar spin-ice ground state, characterized by Ising moments constrained by the ice rules and elementary excitations analogous to magnetic monopoles. Here we examine how controlled chemical disorder influences this state by introducing site mixing on the non-magnetic $B$-site in two compounds. Ho$_2$GaSbO$_7$ contains only Ga$^{3+}$/Sb$^{5+}$ charge disorder, whereas Ho$_2$ScSbO$_7$ exhibits both charge and substantial size disorder arising from the large ionic-radius mismatch between Sc$^{3+}$ and Sb$^{5+}$. Although both materials retain the pyrochlore structure, neutron scattering measurements reveal a reduced correlation length for the $R/B$-site cation ordering and enhanced local structural distortions in Ho$_2$ScSbO$_7$. Despite these structural differences, bulk thermodynamic measurements and magnetic diffuse scattering demonstrate that both systems exhibit the defining signatures of a dipolar spin-ice state. Low-energy inelastic neutron spectroscopy further uncovers broad magnetic excitations that develop within the dipolar spin-ice regime, a feature absent in pristine Ho pyrochlores and indicative of disorder-induced splitting of the non-Kramers ground-state doublet.

The obtained dark soliton solutions are classified into two distinct types, referred to as type-I and type-II dark solitons, which exhibit fundamentally different structural and dynamical characteristics. A single type-I dark soliton is symmetric about its center and admits three distinct valley profiles, namely single-valley, double-valley, and flat-bottom structures, whereas a single type-II dark soliton only supports a single-valley profile. These two types of dark solitons differ in their phase behaviors as the spatial variable varies from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, as well as in their velocity--amplitude relations. For multiple pure type-I dark solitons, collisions are shape-preserving; however, a nontrivial collective effect is revealed in which modifying the parameters of one soliton can induce changes in the profiles and amplitudes of the other solitons, even though all collisions remain elastic in nature. In contrast, multiple pure type-II dark solitons behave independently, undergoing only phase shifts without any modification of their shapes or amplitudes. When type-I and type-II dark solitons coexist, their interactions lead to genuine shape-altering collisions, where the valley structures and amplitudes of type-I dark solitons are modified, while type-II solitons remain unaffected except for phase shifts. Asymptotic analysis further shows that the influence of type-II dark solitons on type-I dark solitons is confined to the pre-collision stage and disappears after the interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Long-term $t_0$ timing drifts, characterized independently both by convolution analysis of compression data and direct THz streaking measurements, lie between 65 - 95 fs (FWHM), among the lowest reported for RF-based systems. At low charge (17 aC), we report an intrinsic pulse duration of 56 fs (FWHM) from comparison of simulations to measured compression data, among the shortest for keV UED at $>$16 aC. Moreover, 2.8 fC bunches, combined with 40 kHz repetition rate and direct detection, produce a detectable normalized throughput that is one (three-to-four) orders of magnitude higher than existing keV (MeV) sources.

Starting from a defect-rich, far-from-equilibrium state, we model the subsequent evolution with the projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which conserves both energy and particle number. By tuning the initial energy, we control the effective post-quench temperature and examine its role in the equilibration dynamics. We find that the gas exhibits universal behaviour at all temperatures, evidenced by spatio-temporal scaling of correlation functions and power-law growth of the correlation length $\\sim t^{1/z}$, with $z$ the dynamical critical exponent. We find $z$ to be temperature dependent, with $z \\approx 1.5$ for post-quench temperatures just below the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, and $z \\approx 1.9$ for quenches to near-zero temperature. Analysis of the Porod tail of the momentum distribution suggests a temperature-dependent competition between vortices and sound waves in the coarsening process. The two-time correlation function also exhibits universal scaling, decaying as $\\sim t^{-\u03bb/z}$, with autocorrelation exponent $\u03bb$.

Mass spectrometry, combined with fragment correlation analysis and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, is used to identify the molecular origin of the neutral and ionic products. Singly ionized AB produces neutral H and H2, while doubly ionized AB produces neutral H and H2 along with H+, H2+, and H3+, all within 1 ps. Electronic-structure calculations show that H, H+, H2, H2+, and H3+ originate predominantly from hydrogen atoms bound to the boron center and that their formation proceeds through hydrogen migration and, in some channels, neutral H2 roaming. The calculations further indicate that the dication meets the structural and energetic requirements for neutral H2 release, a prerequisite for forming astrochemically relevant H3+. However, the large adiabatic relaxation energy causes most roaming H2 to dissociate before proton abstraction, suppressing H3+ formation. These results provide new insight into dissociative ionization pathways in hydrogen-rich molecules, extend mechanistic principles developed for halogenated alkanes to ammonia borane, and suggest implications for hydrogen-release chemistry in ammonia-borane-based storage materials.", "AI": {"tldr":

We first derive the perturbative expansion around General Relativity (GR), working to first order in the small parameter $\u03b1$. For a collapsing flat FLRW dust interior we compute the explicit first-order corrections to the scale factor, the stellar radius, and the horizon formation time. We then use these results to obtain the shift in the PBH formation threshold $\u03b4_c$. The perturbative effect is small for PBHs forming in the deep radiation era, but becomes important when the background curvature is high. To access this early regime we reformulate the theory in the Einstein frame, where the model becomes GR plus the scalaron field $\u03c6$ with the Starobinsky potential. We provide the complete ODE system governing both the cosmological background and the evolution of an overdense closed FLRW patch.

Microelectromechanical resonators offer a promising platform for reservoir computing as they inherently possess the requisite nonlinear and temporal properties while also facilitating the integration of sensing and computing within a single platform. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a physical reservoir computing platform based on two capacitively coupled drum resonators, operating in the MHz frequency regime. Taking advantage of the concept of phonon-cavity electromechanics, a pump tone is applied at the sideband of the phonon cavity while probing one of the coupled modes, analogous to optomechanical systems, thereby creating nonlinear dynamics in energy transfer between the two resonators. Physical reservoir computing is implemented by exploiting the nonlinear response induced through pump amplitude modulation in combination with a time-delay feedback loop, and the performance is evaluated using both parity and Normalized Auto-Regressive Moving Average benchmarks. This work demonstrates a compact microelectromechanical platform for the integration of sensing and reservoir computing.

Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) offers high precision, yet the 2pi ambiguity of the wrapped phase means that conventional absolute phase recovery typically relies on multiple coded patterns, sacrificing temporal resolution. Deep learning-based composite FPP (CFPP) shows promise for single-shot phase recovery from a composite fringe, but limited interpretability makes it difficult to assess reconstruction reliability or trace error sources in the absence of ground truth. To address this, we propose HSURE-CFPP (Heteroscedastic Snapshot-ensemble Uncertainty-aware Ratio Estimation for CFPP). HSURE-CFPP predicts the numerator-denominator ratio used for wrapped-phase computation with a heteroscedastic snapshot-ensemble network, enabling ultra-fast 3D imaging from a single composite fringe and producing pixel-wise uncertainty maps for confidence assessment and unreliable-region identification. Specifically, a heteroscedastic likelihood jointly estimates pixel-wise noise variance to capture data uncertainty, while a snapshot ensemble quantifies model uncertainty via dispersion across snapshots, yielding total predictive uncertainty as an interpretable reliability measure. Experiments on static and dynamic scenes demonstrate that HSURE-CFPP achieves high-accuracy reconstruction at high speed and that the predicted uncertainty correlates well with reconstruction errors, providing a deployable quality-assessment mechanism for deep-learning-based FPP.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes HSURE-CFPP, a method for ultra-fast 3D imaging using single-shots from composite fringes, incorporating uncertainty estimation for reliability.", "motivation": " advancing high-speed 3D measurement in manufacturing through robust and accurate optical metrology algorithms.", "method": "HSURE-CFPP combines CFPP with a heteroscedastic snapshot-ensemble network to predict numerator-denominator ratios, estimating pixel-wise uncertainty for reliability metrics.", "result": "HSURE-CFPP achieves high-accuracy reconstruction rapidly, with uncertainties correlating with reconstruction errors, providing a deployable quality check.", "conclusion": "HSURE-CFPP offers a fast, reliable single-shot 3D imaging solution for dynamic environments, enhancing metrology applications in advanced manufacturing."}}

Beyond the topology of individual degeneracies, their mutual interactions yield richer phenomena. A representative example is the anomalous non-annihilating collision of pairwise-created degeneracies, previously believed to occur only in non-Abelian multiband systems. Here, we theoretically reveal and experimentally demonstrate that such an anomalous collision can emerge even in a simple two-band system without non-Abelian nature. In a two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice whose Brillouin zone forms a nonorientable Klein bottle, two EPs with opposite topological charges, pairwise created from a hybrid point, merge into a new vortex point upon re-encounter, instead of annihilating. Remarkably, the hybrid point is a defective degeneracy featuring no eigenenergy braiding, whereas the vortex point is a non-defective degeneracy yet exhibits nontrivial eigenenergy braiding. This process manifests a non-Hermitian phase transition from a gapped phase to a gapless phase, a scenario that we directly observe in a hybrid-dimensional acoustic lattice via momentum-resolved band braid and Berry phase measurements.

Theory predicts that slow, deterministic modulation of the drive amplitude or frequency can lead to a peculiar synchronization regime characterized by intermittent locking of the oscillation phase beyond the Arnold-tongue boundaries associated with fixed harmonic forcing. We test these predictions in a controllable aeroacoustic self oscillator, i.e, a whistle, that exhibits a robust limit cycle and is subject to external acoustic forcing with programmable frequency and amplitude modulation. Under both slowly varying frequency or amplitude of the forcing, three regimes are observed: (i) strict synchronization (ii) intermittent synchronization, characterized by alternating phase locking and brief phase slip episodes and (iii) no synchronization, with regular phase slips. Particularly in strict synchronization regime, the phase of the oscillator will follow arbitrary slowly-varying drive phase and under amplitude modulation its amplitude fluctuations are strongly suppressed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba9\u81ea\u6fc0\u632f\u8361\u5668\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\u540c\u6b65", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u6fc0\u632f\u8361\u5668\u5728\u975e\u6052\u5b9a\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u884c\u4e3a", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6c14\u9e23\u5668\u65bd\u52a0\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5e45\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u70b9\u540c\u6b65\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u4e25\u683c\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u95f4\u6b47\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u975e\u540c\u6b65", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u81ea\u6fc0\u632f\u8361\u5668\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u884c\u4e3a"}}

Here, we investigate the electronic structure of the TMDs ZrTe$_2$ and Ni-intercalated ZrTe$_2$ (Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$, $x\\approx 0.05$) employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We readily identify in Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$ two flat bands, most likely associated with localized Ni-derived 3$d$-states, at about $\\approx-0.7$ eV and $\\approx-1.2$ eV in binding energy. The presence of these flat bands is observed for all temperatures ($T$) in our study. More significantly, at low-$T$, we identify an electronic structure reconstruction in Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$, which halves the electronic periodicity along the $k_{z}$ direction. This is reminiscent of a commensurate band folding with wave-vector $q=(0,0,\u03c0)$. Together with previous results from macroscopic measurements, namely heat capacity and resistivity, our findings suggest that Ni intercalation drives a structural instability at $T^{*}=287$ K, which causes the observed electronic band reconstruction.

In particular, we find that the total energy flux radiated to infinity is maximized at a gravitational-wave frequency that is close to, but not exactly equal to, the real part of the corresponding quasinormal-mode frequency. Moreover, as the binary is moved farther away from the SMBH, this offset from the mode frequency becomes increasingly pronounced. In addition, for suitable orientations, the binary can effectively ``feed'' the light ring of the SMBH, selectively exciting particular oscillation modes.

However, none of these simple systems are chemical dynamical systems (CDSs) - a special subset of polynomial DSs that model the dynamics of mass-action chemical reaction networks (CRNs). In particular, only a small number of three-dimensional quadratic CDSs with chaos are reported, all of which have at least 9 monomials and at least 3 quadratics, with CRNs containing at least 7 reactions and at least 3 quadratic ones. To bridge this gap, in this paper we prove some basic properties of chaotic CDSs, including that those in three dimensions have at least 6 monomials, at least one of which is negative and quadratic.

To measure the electric field, produced by an electron beam, we excite thermal rubidium atoms to a highly excited Rydberg state via a two-photon ladder transition and detect Stark shifts of Rydberg states by monitoring frequencies of the corresponding electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) transmission peaks. We addressed several technical challenges in this approach. First, we use crossed laser beams to obtain spatial information about the electron beam position and geometry. Second, by pulsing the electron beam and using phase-sensitive optical detection, we separate the true electron beam electric signature from the parasitic electric fields due to photoelectric charges on the windows. Finally, we use a principle component analysis to further improve signal quality. We test this method to detect the current and to reconstruct a 2D profile of a 20 keV electron beam with currents ranging from 25 - 100 uA.

We find that it hosts a fragile antiferromagnetic (AFM) order and a cluster glass (CG) ground state, both of which are highly sensitive to external fields. Upon cooling under low in-plane magnetic fields, the AFM phase evolves into a polarized paramagnetic phase, either directly or indirectly through the intermediate CG phase.

Our central result is the derivation of the condition for complete and simultaneous cancellation of all right- and left-traveling emission modes. We find this requires preparing the detectors in a unique entangled state whose real-valued coefficients are fixed by an elegant geometric constraint, given by a ratio of sines of the logarithms of the detector accelerations.

Here, we introduce defect landscape engineering, the deliberate creation of vacancy clusters prior to helium exposure, as a general strategy to suppress helium-induced degradation. Using \u03b1-SiC as a model, we combine advanced microscopy, strain mapping, helium depth profiling, positron annihilation spectroscopy, and atomistic simulations to demonstrate that tailored pre-damage transforms helium defect evolution. Instead of forming extended platelets and nanocracks, helium is trapped in stable, uniformly dispersed nanobubbles. Simulations reveal that small vacancy clusters act as dual-function sinks for irradiation-induced interstitials and preferential helium traps, fundamentally altering cascade recombination dynamics. This mechanism is composition-independent and scalable, offering a new design principle for radiation-tolerant ceramics across carbides, nitrides, and oxides.

However, their luminescent performance deteriorates sharply at high temperatures.

The high carrier retention rate of phosphors is attributed to the ability of Ti4+Mg2+ positive charge center to strongly trap non-bonding electrons over a long range (about 20 angstroms) as the electronic satellite for its stable operation. Under external optical/thermal stimulation, the released electrons and holes recombine at the different luminescent levels of Tb3+, resulting in the emission of different PersL branching ratios.

Here, to address this challenge toward a broadly applicable design framework for topological waveguides, we experimentally demonstrate that topological adiabatic geometry implemented in a micro electromechanical system suppresses valley mixing. We found that the adiabaticity enhances immunity to defects and increases the transmission efficiency of the armchair boundary. As the adiabaticity increases, topological protection is recovered over an increasingly broad portion of the bulk band gap, extending from low to high frequencies. Furthermore, we show that the recovery of protection in the adiabatic armchair boundary enables waves to propagate through 90^\u00b0 and 150^\u00b0-bent waveguides by coupling with other interface geometries. Suppressing valley mixing via adiabaticity paves the way for a universal design framework for topological waveguides and for restoring robust topological characteristics across a wide range of wave phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50 wentilating Hall\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u4e5f\u79f0\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50ishes-Hall\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u4e2d<'Boundary'>'\u548c<'System Topology'>\u5bf9\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u8fc7\u5883\u6218\u672f\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5fae\u7535\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165adiabatic\u51e0\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4e86_valley-mixing_\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": " \u901a\u8fc7adiabatic\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86ideally\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5168\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e00\u81f4\u7684_bandgap_\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u666e\u9002\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u62d3\u6251\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

For technical reasons we focus on the case of 2+1 bulk dimensions. The AdS boundary conditions (in any dimension) require us to impose Dirichlet boundary conditions on the standard Euclidean axion $\u03c7_E$. Fixing its asymptotic values on two boundary spheres to $\\pm \u03c7_{E,\\infty}$, we find such wormholes to be subdominant to a UV-sensitive endpoint contribution for $\u03c7_{E, \\infty}$ near the real axis, and that (with our conventions) they become dominant only for $\u03c7_{E, \\infty}$ near the negative imgainary axis. Furthermore, such wormholes are irrelevant to our computation for ${\\rm Im} \u03c7_{E, \\infty} >0$ (in the sense that the associated ascent contour fails to intersect the contour of integration).

We analyze a memory-assisted quantum clock interferometer in which a frequency-bin photonic clock is stored in two vertically separated quantum memories for a controllable duration, such that the joint state evolves in a quantum superposition of two proper times. After retrieval, the photonic modes interfere in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer, for which we derive analytic expressions for the resulting multiphoton detection statistics. Extending this HOM-based scheme from entangled photon pairs to frequency-entangled 2N-photon inputs, we show that the proper-time dependent phase is amplified by a factor N, leading to an N-times faster collapse and revival of the interference signal compared with the two-photon case. Incorporating finite memory efficiency and lifetime, we identify regimes where this modulation remains observable. For parameters compatible with demonstrated Rb and Cs memories and achievable optical frequency separations, the first collapse occurs for height differences in the order of 10-100 m with subsecond to few-second storage times, while suitable rare-earth ion and alkali memory combinations can reduce the required height to the few-metre scale.

In this work, we examine the cosmological consequences of Barrow and Tsallis HDE implemented with the Granda-Oliveros (GO) infrared (IR) cutoff. After deriving the modified Friedmann equations within the thermodynamic-gravity conjecture, we study the background evolution in both non-interacting and interacting dark sector scenarios, emphasizing the role of the entropic parameter in shaping late-time dynamics. We then confront the model with state-of-the-art observations, including PantheonPlus and Union3 Type Ia supernovae, Cosmic Chronometers and DESI DR2 BAO measurements. Using Bayesian MCMC methods, we constrain the model parameters and compare the performance of BHDE with that of $\u039b$CDM. Our results show that BHDE is compatible with current data and can exhibit a mild statistical preference over the concordance model for certain dataset combinations.

Contrary to the principle of symmetry inheritance in free-space optics, where the symmetry of any structured field is strictly constrained by that of its source, we show that strong SOI enables quasi-symmetry-protected formation of meron lattices even when the underlying optical sources violate the nominal rotational symmetry. By analyzing the Hermiticity of the electric-dipole radiation amplitude in a circular polarization basis, we derive an effective mirror operator acting only on a subset of C3 polarized dipole emitters, forming a quasi-symmetry group that commutes with SOI. This quasi-symmetry guarantees exact C3 merons and gives rise to a robust polarization zone within which continuously varying input polarizations generate identical topological textures.

At intermediate interaction strengths, soliton creation and annihilation break adiabaticity and disrupt quantized transport. In the strong-coupling regime, the coexistence of ground- and excited-state solitons leads to negligible coupling at energy crossings, giving rise to discrete time-translation symmetry breaking (DTTSB) in the soliton dynamics. Comparison of mean-field results with exact diagonalization along closed circular pumping paths confirms both the validity of the mean-field description and the robustness of DTTSB across different pumping trajectories.

Our findings also reveal surprising consequences of the interplay among symmetry, Gaussianity, and thermodynamic constraints, suggesting that real-world scenarios with multiple constraints have a rich structure not accessible from examining individual constraints separately.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u50cf\u79bb\u6563\u53d8\u91cf\u90a3\u6837\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u6096\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u65ad\u8a00\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u6570\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0d\u5168\u6b63\u786e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u7c7b\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Gaussian\u8fd0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5219\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728Gaussian\u8fd0\u7b97\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u50cf\u79bb\u6563\u53d8\u91cf\u90a3\u6837\u7b80\u5355\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u8bba\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u5c24\u5176 Rogerals\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u6b64\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

In the present model, transport processes such as surface and volume diffusion are excluded, as are elastic interactions, step-step repulsion or attraction, and stoichiometric effects. We show that intrinsic step jamming arises from asymmetric fluctuations in atomic attachment and detachment driven by biased transition probabilities under the SOS restriction, leading to collective step congestion. Asymmetric fluctuations also determine whether adatom or hole clusters grow or recede. This mechanism bears close similarity to jamming phenomena in the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), including multi-lane variants. In contrast, symmetric thermal fluctuations generate adatom or hole clusters on terraces, thereby suppressing intrinsic step jamming.

Searches for gravitational-wave signals in the detector data are prone to spurious disturbances of terrestrial origin. The technique presented here benefits from the fact that such effects are generally non-coincident in time at geographically separated detectors. Therefore, abnormally loud triggers that are not time-coincident can be vetoed. We implement the veto technique in a matched-filter search for transient signals from binary black holes and observe search backgrounds to be generally close to the Gaussian limit. An improvement in the sensitivity of the search is demonstrated using simulated signals.

Focusing first on real parameters, we apply these conditions, together with a new symmetry of the superpotential we named ``q-symmetry'', to strongly constrains $\\mathcal{F}$. Imposing only these mathematical conditions is enough, for example, to reproduces the \\textit{structure} of the one-loop correction and the \\textit{exact result} in the planar limit, which are known from the literature. Extending the analysis to complex parameters, we develop a similar method to obtain the more restricted form of $\\mathcal{F}$, though the complex case obscures expansions in ``q-invariant'' variables. We also show how an additional pair $(q,h)$ of integrable deformations arises via q-invariance, and verify that the transformed R-matrix satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation. Moreover, we make two ansatz for the coefficients left in free in the finiteness $\\mathcal{F}$ for the real parameters, and while it has some defects, it reveals interesting results when compared with literature: the first predicts the pair of integrable deformations derived in \\cite{Mansson2010}, while the second ansatz gives the first correction only at fourth loop order $\u03ba^8$ \\cite{Mansson2010}, which is known to be true in the planar limit. Furthermore, we study the impact of this symmetry on the algebra of the deformed XXZ spin chain and the moduli-vacuum of LS, and find a gauge/gravity interpretation when $h=0$ for the q-symmetry, obtaining the simplest relation between $k$ (from TsT) and $\u03b2$ ($q = \\exp(\u03c0i \u03b2)$) to be linear, in agreement with known results for the Lunin-Maldacena-Frolov deformation \\cite{Frolov_2005,Lunin_2005}.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We show through numerical simulations that the new method resolves finer spectral features, while maintaining an order-of-magnitude speedup over conventional approaches to noise spectroscopy. Second, we simplify the experimental implementation of the method, by introducing Rademacher measurements for reconstructing sparse noise spectra.

Here, by optically suppressing ultrafast charge-transfer (CT) to interlayer excitons in WSe2/WS2 heterostructures, we uncover dynamics of moir\u00e9 IALX revealing long lifetimes (\u03c4 > 1000 ps) arising from localized Wannier and in-plane CT nature. We then observe moir\u00e9 intralayer intervalley biexcitons with binding energy ~ 16 meV, with long lifetimes due to moir\u00e9 confinement. Furthermore, we find time-domain signatures of strong coupling between moir\u00e9-IALX and ~ 10 micro-eV phasons, evidenced as twist-angle-dependent GHz oscillations in IALX dynamics. Our findings establish moir\u00e9 superlattices as interacting hybrid quantum systems and for engineering non-equilibrium phenomena, as well as for GHz-scale optoelectronics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u53cc\u5c42\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u6750\u6599WS2/WSe2\u4e2d\u7684\u83ab\u91cc\u53f6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5149\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u5149\u573a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8d85\u5feb\u7535\u8377\u4f20\u8f93\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u7684\u83ab\u91cc\u53f6\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\uff08\u03c4 > 1000 ps\uff09\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u6676\u683c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u598210\u5fae\u7535\u5b50\u4f0f\u7684phason\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u83ab\u91cc\u53f6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5982\u4f55\u8de8\u8d8a\u7535\u8377\u548c\u6676\u683c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c GHz\u7ea7\u5149\u5b66\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u83ab\u91cc\u53f6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u5176\u540e\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5668\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5149\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u573a\u8c03\u63a7\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387 pump-probe \u5de5\u5177\u5728 WS2/WSe2 \u6469\u5c14\u53f6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u5149\u548c\u58f0\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5149\u573a\u6291\u5236\u8d85\u5feb\u7535\u8377\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5c42\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\uff08CT\uff09\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u5355\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5bff\u547d\u3002\u6d4b\u5b9a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u57df\u5185\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528 signatures\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0e\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u6676\u683c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982 phason\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 GHz\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u632f\u8361\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u7684\u83ab\u91cc\u53f6\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\uff08\u03c4 > 1000 ps\uff09\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e0e ~10 \u5fae\u7535\u5b50\u4f0f\u7684\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u6676\u683c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08phason\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 GHz \u8303\u56f4\u7684\u632f\u8361\u4fe1\u53f7\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u83ab\u91cc\u53f6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7535\u8377\u548c\u6676\u683c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u73b0\u8c61\u548c GHz \u7ea7\u5149\u5b66\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u83ab\u91cc\u53f6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e3a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u548c\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u6676\u683c\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u52a8\u6001\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a(newer) \u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c GHz \u7ea7\u5149\u5b66\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

The study covers the one-dimensional diamond chain and its two- and three-dimensional generalizations. The ground-state phase diagram contains four distinct phases: ferromagnetic (F), critical (C), monomer-dimer (MD), and tetramer-dimer (TD), which converge at a quadruple point. We demonstrate the presence of macroscopic ground-state degeneracy and corresponding residual entropy, which is maximal at the quadruple point and also extends throughout the MD phase and its boundaries with TD and F phases. For the diamond chain, we derive exact degeneracies, while for higher-dimensional lattices, we map the problem onto a bond percolation model or used transfer-matrix approach, enabling the numerical computation of the ground state degeneracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5177\u6709 competing \u8f6c\u5411\u78c1\u573a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7406\u60f3\u91d1\u521a\u77f3\u6676\u683cHeisenberg\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u76f8\uff1a\u5b8c\u5168\u78c1\u5316\uff08F\uff09\u3001\u4e34\u754c\uff08C\uff09\u3001\u5355\u4f53-\u53cc\u4f53\uff08MD\uff09\u548c\u56db\u4f53-\u53cc\u4f53\uff08TD\uff09\u3001\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u5728\u56db\u5143\u76f8\u70b9\u5904\u6c47\u805a\u3002\u5728\u91d1\u521a\u77f3\u94fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u57fa\u6001\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u952e\u6e17\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u6001\u9000\u5316\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u57fa\u6001\u9000\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u5728\u56db\u5143\u76f8\u70b9\u5904\u6700\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9MD\u76f8\u53ca\u5176\u4e0eF\u548cTD\u76f8\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5904\u4e5f\u9002\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u6676\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0bHeisenberg\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5305\u542b competing \u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982\u5bf9\u91d1\u521a\u77f3\u94fe\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u5411\u952e\u6e17\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u57fa\u6001\u9000\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91d1\u521a\u77f3\u94fe\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u76f8\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u57fa\u6001\u9000\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u76f8\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6676\u683c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684Heisenberg\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b8c\u6574\u5730\u56fe\u793a\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5b8c\u5168\u78c1\u5316\u548c\u4e34\u754c\u76f8\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u4e88\u4e86\u57fa\u6001\u9000\u5316\u7684\u5168\u9762\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002"}}

The central idea is the inclusion of auxiliary angular frequencies that modulate the temporal evolution of composite states. These additional dynamical degrees of freedom act as coherence channels through which nonseparability is mediated.

Since such rounds contribute, negatively, to the error correction leakage, this results in a correct, though sub-optimal bound. Here, we derive a new proof of security for CAD applied to the decoy state BB84 protocol, computing a bound on Eve's uncertainty in all possible single and vacuum photon events.

Through simulation, we find that the magnonic band structure imitates that of graphene, but additionally has some kagome-like character and includes a few flat bands. Surprisingly, its nature can be understood using a 9-band tight-binding Hamiltonian. This clear analogy to 2D materials enables band-gap engineering in 2D, topological magnons along 1D phase boundaries, and spectrally isolated modes at 0D point defects. Interestingly, the 1D phase boundaries allow access to the valley degree of freedom through a magnonic analog of the quantum valley-Hall insulator. These approaches can be extended to other magnonic systems, but are potentially more general due to the simplicity of the model, which resembles existing results from electron, phonon, photon, and cold atom systems.

In dipolar-octupolar (DO) pyrochlores, such as $\\text{Ce}_2\\text{Zr}_2\\text{O}_7$, the candidate $\u03c0$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI) state is predicted to host both gapless emergent photons and a continuum of spinons. However, resolving these modes at zero field is complicated by their spectral overlap and the presence of nonmagnetic scattering near zero energy. Here, we report neutron scattering experiments on $\\text{Ce}_2\\text{Zr}_2\\text{O}_7$ under a magnetic field along the $[1,1,1]$ direction. In contrast to previous unpolarized studies at zero-field that relied on high-temperature subtraction, we use a same-temperature high-field subtraction protocol to isolate the photon mode.

While single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films are recognized for their gas adsorption capabilities, their integration with photonic structures often overlooks complex light-matter interactions. In this work, we report a counterintuitive polarization-dependent response in an evanescent-wave NO2 sensor, fabricated by depositing aerosol-synthesized SWCNT thin films onto SPFs. The device demonstrates high performance, including a limit of detection of 400 ppb and stable operation in humid environments. However, its sensing behavior deviates strikingly from established models: upon NO2 exposure, transmitted light intensity increases for TM polarization but decreases for TE polarization, a phenomenon not attributable solely to changes in the intrinsic absorption of the SWCNTs. We pinpoint that the dominant mechanism is a gas-induced alteration of the SWCNT film's complex refractive index, which subsequently perturbs the evanescent field mode profile of the waveguide. Numerical simulations confirm that accounting for this mode-profile redistribution is essential to accurately describe the sensor's response.

The HPP acquires its directionality from the TDS via momentum matching. It also exhibits plasmonic characteristics, with excitation frequencies following the surface-plasmon dispersion relation. We obtain a Rabi oscillation and a long-time decay that describe the HPP and use them to reveal weak- and strong-coupling regimes through the emergence of normal-mode splitting.

Finally, by analyzing the emission spectrum, we observe an anticrossing of the peak doublets~(a feature also seen in cavity QED setups) which originates from quantum vacuum effects and the resulting non-Markovian HPP evolution in our WQED.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u4e9a\u5fae\u7c73\u7ea7\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u4ee5\u7279\u5b9a\u81ea\u65cb\u72b6\u6001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u6162\u3001\u6f2b\u5c04\u7684\u8868\u9762\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6742\u6563\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u8be5\u6742\u6563\u5b50\u5728\u67d0\u65f6\u523b\u51fa\u73b0\u5982\u745e\u6ce2\u72b6\u7684\u5149-\u7269\u8d28\u4ea4\u9519\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5d4c\u5165\u4e86\u7531\u8868\u9762\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u6563\u6591\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e9a\u5fae\u7c73\u7ea7\u81ea\u65cb\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u4e0e\u957f\u6ce2\u6bb5\u8868\u9762\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u5174\u548c\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u949f\u578b\u514b\u5c14\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6fc0\u53d1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5149-\u7269\u8d28\u6742\u6563\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u503c\u5fae\u5206\u6cd5(MixED)\u7814\u7a76\u4e86freq\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff1b\u8fd0\u7528\u5206\u88c2\u6cd5\u548c\u6cd5\u5c14\u54c8\u7279\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\u505a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u6307\u6570\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u6742\u6563\u5b50\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u6563\u5c04\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790HPP\u548cEPR\u8c31\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e34\u754c\u6307\u6570\u6cd5\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u745e\u6ce2\u5f0f\u7684\u5149-\u7269\u8d28\u4ea4\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u957f\u65f6\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u4ec5\u5728\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592bHPP\u6f14\u5316\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u4e0e\u5fae\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u3001\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u533a\u4e2d\u7684HPP\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8868\u9762\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u7684\u6742\u6563\u5b50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6d88\u6563\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u632f\u8361\u548c\u77ac\u6001\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6297\u4ea4\u53c9\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86HPP\u7684\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

In one-dimensional single particle systems, the periodic driving generates a variety of topological phases and edge modes. In this work, we investigate the topological phase transition of the one-dimensional Floquet Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model using entanglement entropy, and construct the phase diagram based on entanglement entropy. The entanglement entropy exhibits pronounced peaks and follows the logarithmic scaling law at the phase transition points, from which we extract the central charge $c=1$. We further investigate the entanglement spectrum to accurately distinguish the different topological phases. In addition, the coupling between zero and $\u03c0$ modes leads to characteristic splittings in the entanglement spectrum, signaling their hybridization under periodic driving. These results remain robust in non-Hermitian regimes and in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping, demonstrating the reliability and universality of entanglement entropy as a diagnostic for topological phase transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u7ef4Floquet Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u9636\u6bb5\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7535\u8377c=1\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u6027\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u90bb\u8fd1\u5947\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u4e2d\u6355\u83b7\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86Floquet Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5272\u4e0b\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5468\u671f\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\u65f6\uff0c\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u7740\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5bf9\u6570\u6807\u5ea6\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea0\u7f20\u8c31\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u96f6\u548c\u03c0\u6a21\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u7684\u5206\u7acb\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5468\u671f\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\uff0c1D Floquet Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u666e\u904d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u8fd1\u90bb\u8df3\u8dc3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002"}}

In this paper, we examine measurement using the Q-based, objective-field model for quantum mechanics. Schrodinger considered a microscopic system prepared in a superposition of states which is then coupled to a macroscopic meter. We analyze the entangled meter and system, and measurements on it, by solving forward-backward stochastic differential equations for real amplitudes $x(t)$ and $p(t)$ that correspond to the phase-space variables of the Q function of the system at a time $t$. We model the system and meter as single-mode fields, and measurement of $\\hat{x}$ by amplification of the amplitude $x(t)$. Our conclusion is that the outcome for the measurement is determined at (or by) the time $t_{m}$, when the coupling to the meter is complete, the meter states being macroscopically distinguishable. There is consistency with macroscopic realism. By evaluating the distribution of the amplitudes $x$ and $p$ postselected on a given outcome of the meter, we show how the $Q$-based model represents a more complete description of quantum mechanics: The variances associated with amplitudes $x$ and $p$ are too narrow to comply with the uncertainty principle, ruling out that the distribution represents a quantum state. We conclude that the collapse of the wavefunction occurs as a two-stage process: First there is an amplification that creates branches of amplitudes $x(t)$ of the meter, associated with distinct eigenvalues. The outcome of measurement is determined by $x(t)$ once amplified, explaining Born's rule. Second, the distribution that determines the final collapse is the state inferred for the system conditioned on the outcome of the meter: information is lost about the meter, in particular, about the complementary variable $p$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eQ\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u573a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411-\u540e\u5411\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5bf9\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u7531 meter \u7cfb\u7edf\u5728 coupling \u5b8c\u6210\u540e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b8f\u89c2\u5b9e\u5728\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u5176\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\uff1a\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u6b21\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u662f\u653e\u5927\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u652f\uff08\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u503c\uff09\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86 x(t) \u7684\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u4e4b\u540e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86 Born's rule\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u662f\u6d4b\u91cf\u540e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff08\u4e22\u5931\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e meter \u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u4e8e p \u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528 Q \u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5ba2\u89c2\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u524d\u5411-\u540e\u5411\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411-\u540e\u5411\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c meter \u7684\u5355\u6a21\u5f0f\u573a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u539f\u7406\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u7531 meter \u7cfb\u7edf\u5728 coupling \u5b8c\u6210\u540e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b8f\u89c2\u5b9e\u5728\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u5176\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\uff1a\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u6b21\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u662f\u653e\u5927\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u652f\uff08\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u503c\uff09\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86 x(t) \u7684\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u4e4b\u540e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86 Born's rule\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u662f\u6d4b\u91cf\u540e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff08\u4e22\u5931\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e meter \u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u4e8e p \u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408 Q \u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5ba2\u89c2\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u6d4b\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u662f\u653e\u5927\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c meter \u7684coupling \u5df2\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a Born's rule \u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d4b\u91cf\u540e\u7684\u5269\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u72b6\u6001\u5f97\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u3002"}}

In this first paper, we examine the geometry from the perspective of a foliation by spherical hypersurfaces. Using the rigging technique, we first define a local frame adapted to these slices and reconstruct the geometry and dynamics fully. We clarify the connection of the frame adapted to constant-radius slices, to the Kodama vector and Misner-Sharp energy. Through frame transformations, we then show that the gravitational dynamics in a general foliation-adapted frame can be interpreted as hydrodynamics, i.e., geometro-hydrodynamics: the Einstein equations exhibit the gravitational analogs of the Euler and Young-Laplace equations, and the spacetime can be viewed as the worldvolume of a concentric stack of \"gravitational bubbles\" -- spherical collective modes with the Misner-Sharp energy density and a geometric pressure. We apply this framework to apparent horizons and study the dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that a similar geometro-hydrodynamic picture holds in Lovelock gravity. These results provide a fresh perspective on this class of spacetimes and lay the foundation for understanding their thermodynamic properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ca\u5176\u4f59 props\u7684\u53d8\u4f53,\u5173\u6ce8\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u7cfb\u5217\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d,\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u90e8\u5206,\u4e3b\u8981\u63a2\u8ba8\u51e0\u4f55\u4ece\u5f84\u5411 foliation \u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 rigging \u6280\u672f\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u6846\u67b6,\u9002\u914d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5207\u7247,\u5e76\u91cd\u5efa\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u672c\u6587\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u4e0e\u5e38\u6570\u534a\u5f84\u5207\u7247\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e Kodama \u5411\u91cf\u548c Misner-Sharp \u80fd\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6846\u67b6\u8f6c\u53d8,\u8868\u660e\u5728\u4e00\u822c foliation-adapted \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b,\u5f15\u529b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u2014\u2014\u5373\u51e0\u4f55\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66:\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u65b9\u7a0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u6b27\u62c9\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c YL \u65b9\u7a0b,\u65f6\u7a7a\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u4f5c\u5d4c\u5957\u7403\u5f62\u2018\u5f15\u529b\u6c14\u6ce1\u2019\u7684 worlvolume\u2014\u2014\u5e26\u6709 Misner-Sharp \u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u538b\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5e94\u7528\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c6\u754c\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u6b64\u5916,\u5728\u6d1b\u592b\u5217\u514b\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u51e0\u4f55\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u7c7b\u65f6\u7a7a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2,\u5e76\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ca\u5176\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u4e3a\u7531\u7403\u5f62\u5207\u7247\u7ec4\u6210\u7684 foliation,\u53ef\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6982\u5ff5,\u5c06\u5f15\u529b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7c7b\u6bd4,\u4e3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec:1. \u4f7f\u7528 rigging \u6280\u672f\u5b9a\u4e49\u5c40\u90e8\u6846\u67b6;2. \u91cd\u5efa\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66;3. \u901a\u8fc7\u6846\u67b6\u8f6c\u6362\u5c06\u5f15\u529b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66;4. \u5e94\u7528\u5230\u89c6\u754c\u548c\u6d1b\u592b\u5217\u514b\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa:1. \u5f15\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66,\u5305\u542b\u6b27\u62c9\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c YL \u65b9\u7a0b;2. \u65f6\u7a7a\u53ef\u4ee5\u89c6\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5957\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6c14\u6ce1;3.

Conventional QKD contains public classical post-processing steps that require authentication to prevent impersonation and maintain security. However, a major limitation of QKD is it cannot perform authentication by itself, and thus requires a separate authentication mechanism. In addition, these public classical steps also have information leakage which subjects QKD to additional attack strategies and reduces the final key rate. In this work, we propose a new QKD variant that removes the need for a separate authentication mechanism, eliminates information leakage, and achieves a substantially higher key rate. By having two more protocol keys than conventional QKD and no public classical steps, our design achieves (almost) perfect information-theoretic security with the protocol keys reusable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1(QKD)\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u65e0\u9700\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u7ecf\u5178\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u5173\u6ce8\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u534f\u8bae\uff08QKD\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u7ecf\u5178\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684QKD\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u66fe\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u5bc6\u94a5\uff0c\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u7ecf\u5178\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86(\u8fd1)\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u534f\u8bae\u5bc6\u94a5\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684QKD\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u6f0f\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u7ecf\u5178\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5e76\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u8bae\u5bc6\u94a5\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684QKD\u534f\u8bae\u3002"}}

In special relativity, this is no longer the case. Relativity of simultaneity causes different inertial observers to measure markedly different excitation spectra, with stability being the only property known to be Lorentz invariant in all causal theories. Here, we show that, under a certain Onsager-like symmetry principle (which applies to kinetic theory and transient hydrodynamics), it is possible to place rigorous bounds on phase velocities, eigenmode convergence radii, spectral gaps, and equilibration rates in any inertial frame, using only information about the rest frame spectrum at zero wavenumber.

Starting from a one-dimensional interaction $V(x) = -g^2 e^{-\u03b1m x}/x$, we reformulate the problem in terms of a four-dimensional radial oscillator, where the finite screening length generates a systematic hierarchy of polynomial interactions in the radial coordinate. This mapping enables a controlled Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbative treatment of the ground-state wavefunction and an explicit spectral analysis of the reduced density matrix. Working in the weak-screening regime, we compute the leading non-Gaussian correction arising from the quartic interaction $\u03c1^4$, which appears at order $\u03b1^2$ in the expansion of the Yukawa-like potential. We obtain closed analytic expressions for the resulting small eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix and evaluate their contribution to the von Neumann entanglement entropy. We show that the entropy receives analytic corrections at order $\u03b1^2$, originating both from explicit anharmonic state-mixing effects and from the implicit $\u03b1$ dependence of the Gaussian width parameter. Our results clarify the distinct roles of harmonic renormalization and genuinely non-Gaussian interactions in generating entanglement, establish a systematic power-counting and normalization scheme for higher-order $\u03c1^{2n}$ perturbations, and provide a transparent oscillator-based framework for computing entanglement entropy in weakly interacting low-dimensional and field-theoretic

We analyze the dynamics of charged particles on circular orbits and derive the corresponding radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies. The influence of the nonlinear electrodynamics parameter, magnetic coupling, dyonic charge, and quintessence state parameter on the innermost stable circular orbit and epicyclic frequencies is examined in detail. Using the forced resonance model, we compare the theoretical predictions of high-frequency QPOs with observational data from several X-ray binary systems. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis is employed to constrain the black hole parameters and assess the role of weak magnetization and nonlinear electrodynamics effects. This analysis indicates that QPO observations tightly constrain the black hole mass and orbital radius while placing stringent upper bounds on the ModMax coupling, magnetic interaction, and dyonic charge. In addition, we study the radiative properties of the accretion disk and analyze the effects of the model parameters on the disk flux and temperature profiles. These findings suggest that the observed QPOs are consistent with general relativity in the strong-field regime, allowing only small deviations associated with Einstein-Maxwell theory in the presence of a quintessence field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f31\u78c1\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5916\u8d28 shell \u632f\u52a8\u548c\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\uff08QPOs\uff09\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Einstein-ModMax\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e94\u6b21\u65b9\u7269\u8d28\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7535\u8377\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5f84\u5411\u548c\u7ad6\u5411\u7b80\u8c10\u632f\u52a8\u9891\u7387\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u78c1\u8026\u5408\u3001\u7535\u4e2d\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4e94\u6b21\u65b9\u7269\u8d28\u72b6\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5185\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u5706\u5f62\u8f68\u9053\u548c\u7b80\u8c10\u632f\u52a8\u9891\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5236\u5171\u632f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9ad8\u9891QPO\u4e0e\u51e0\u4e2aX\u5c04\u5929\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8fd0\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5f31\u78c1\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cQPO\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e25\u683c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u5bf9ModMax\u8026\u5408\u3001\u78c1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u7535\u4e2d\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7684\u8f90\u7167\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u76d8\u9762\u6d41\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684QPO\u5728\u5f3a\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7b26\u5408\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u6b21\u65b9\u7269\u8d28\u5b58\u5728\u4e0b\u5141\u8bb8\u4ec5\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5185Radius\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u504f\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53ca\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u662f\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u5bf9\u63a2\u7d22\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Einstein-ModMax\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4e94\u6b21\u65b9\u7269\u8d28\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f31\u78c1\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u8d28\u5c42\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408QPO\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "QPO\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e25\u683c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u5bf9ModMax\u8026\u5408\u3001\u78c1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u7535\u4e2d\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5728\u5f3a\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e0eQPO\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u5728\u4e94\u6b21\u65b9\u7269\u8d28\u5b58\u5728\u4e0b\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4ec5\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5185Radius\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u504f\u79bb\u3002"}}

Similarly, in a Bell test using any given Bell inequality, the maximum violation achievable using quantum strategies respecting or disregarding a certain symmetry can be different. In this work, we focus on the symmetry involved in the exchange of parties and explore when we have to trade this symmetry for a lower-dimensional quantum strategy in achieving the maximal violation of given Bell inequalities. For the family of symmetric Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequalities, we provide evidence showing that there is no such trade-off. However, for several other Bell inequalities with a small number of dichotomic measurement settings, we show that symmetric quantum strategies in the minimal Hilbert space dimension can only lead to a suboptimal Bell violation. In other words, there exist symmetric Bell inequalities that can only be maximally violated by asymmetric quantum strategies of minimal dimension. In contrast, one can also find examples of asymmetric Bell inequalities that are maximally violated by symmetric correlations.

We investigate whether improvements in stored energy and instantaneous charging power arise from genuine quantum correlations or from coherent collective dynamics that are not intrinsically quantum. We compare the time evolution of energetic quantities with a hierarchy of information-theoretic measures probing bipartite, tripartite, and further-partite correlations. Across different battery charger configurations, we find a consistent temporal ordering in which the instantaneous power peaks before the buildup of strong quantum correlations, indicating that peak charging is dominated by coherent transport, while entanglement and scrambling develop at later times. Furthermore, charging protocols based on k local interactions are examined under both unconstrained and norm-constrained (fair) settings, enabling a clear distinction between classical scaling effects and genuine collective enhancements. Increasing the interaction order or the participation number does not automatically translate into higher charging power. Instead, the performance is primarily dictated by how many particles actually become mutually correlated and contribute to entanglement.

This runs counter to earlier evidence that optimal synthesis required combinatorial search, and we show that this discrepancy can be explained by avoiding the random selection of certain parameter-deficient circuit skeletons.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The potential applications of this technology have been widely explored, and extensive research over the past decades has been dedicated to developing scalable quantum computers. However, the question of the energetic performance of quantum computation has only gained attention more recently, and its importance is now recognized. In fact, quantum computers can only be a viable alternative if their energy cost scales favorably, and some research has shown that there is even a potential quantum energy advantage. Rydberg atoms have emerged recently as one of the most promising platforms to implement a large-scale quantum computer, with significant advances made in recent years. This work aims at contributing first steps to understand the energy efficiency of this platform, namely by investigating the energy consumption of the different elements of a Rydberg atom quantum computer. First, an experimental implementation of the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm is analyzed, and an estimation of the energetic cost of executing this algorithm is calculated. Then, a potential scaling of the energy cost of performing the Quantum Fourier Transform with Rydberg atoms is derived. This analysis facilitates a comparison of the energy consumption of different elements within a Rydberg atom quantum computer, from the preparation of the atoms to the execution of the algorithm, and the measurement of the final state, enabling the evaluation of the energy expenditure of the Rydberg platform and the identification of potential improvements.

Here, we present a unified theoretical framework for the frequency principle (F-principle) that characterizes the training dynamics of both classical and quantum neural networks. Within this framework, we prove that quantum neural networks exhibit a spectral bias toward learning low-frequency components of target functions, mirroring the behavior observed in classical deep networks. We further analyze the impact of noise and show that, when single-qubit noise is applied after encoding-layer rotations and modeled as a Pauli channel aligned with the rotation axis, the Fourier component labeled by $\\boldsymbol\u03c9$ is suppressed by a factor $(1-2\u03b3)^{\\|\\boldsymbol\u03c9\\|_1}$. This leads to exponential attenuation of high-frequency terms while preserving the learnability of low-frequency structure. In the same setting, we establish that the resulting noisy circuits admit efficient classical simulation up to average-case error. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: Quantum neural networks primarily learn low-frequency features during early optimization and maintain robustness against dephasing and depolarizing noise acting on the encoding layer. Our results provide a frequency-domain lens that unifies classical and quantum learning dynamics, clarifies the role of noise in shaping trainability, and guides the design of noise-resilient quantum neural networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u9891\u7387\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u9891\u7387\u539f\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u4f4e\u9891\u6210\u5206\u6709\u504f\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u4f7f\u5f97\u9ad8\u9891\u6210\u5206\u8870\u51cf\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u4f4e\u9891\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}
